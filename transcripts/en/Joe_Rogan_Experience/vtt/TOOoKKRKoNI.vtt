00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.870
<v Speaker 1>So after you got through this,</v>

3
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>What made you do four and five?</v>

5
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>The carrot of like,</v>

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>just wait a little,</v>

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.033
<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>

8
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.791
<v Speaker 1>Here's what they do.</v>

9
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>They set up that you're the auditor now,</v>

10
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

11
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you're auditing these things in your body.</v>

12
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>You're now the boss.</v>

13
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>So they go,</v>

14
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.591
<v Speaker 1>they tell you,</v>

15
00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>get your head on like your,</v>

16
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 1>it's your job.</v>

17
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to believe anything.</v>

18
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>You just need to audit them.</v>

19
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.920
<v Speaker 1>So you need to do your job as an auditor.</v>

20
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.731
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're called.</v>

21
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Auditor's people who are the ones who take you into session and Scientology,</v>

22
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like you're in a leadership role.</v>

24
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:39.520
<v Speaker 1>So you're doing these things a favor,</v>

25
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:40.601
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

27
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:40.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:41.411
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's true.</v>

29
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:41.831
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

30
00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:42.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I do sometimes hear voices and you know,</v>

32
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:44.321
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

33
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:44.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>you have a moment with yourself and you're like,</v>

35
00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I might be really kind of crazy.</v>

36
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.941
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:49.511
<v Speaker 1>so you're like,</v>

38
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe this was an answer.</v>

39
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

40
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>it's sick because it speaks to a side of you that wants answers about life,</v>

41
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.711
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

42
00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:57.311
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like,</v>

43
00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:57.641
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

44
00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:58.870
<v Speaker 1>this is some crazy shit,</v>

45
00:00:58.871 --> 00:00:59.111
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

46
00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>that there wasn't even the people that what?</v>

47
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

48
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you know it it.</v>

49
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.261
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

50
00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>you believe what you want to believe at the time.</v>

51
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Does it feel to you at the moment,</v>

52
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>like maybe if you just keep going,</v>

53
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:12.934
<v Speaker 1>it'll get better.</v>

54
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'm confused now,</v>

55
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>but if I contemplate this and I write it over,</v>

56
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>eventually I'm going to receive enough information,</v>

57
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:21.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:22.120
<v Speaker 1>This is all going to be like,</v>

59
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>oh right.</v>

60
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I was a fool.</v>

61
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:25.414
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand.</v>

62
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

63
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

64
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>one time I had talked to a friend about it,</v>

65
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.921
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

66
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:30.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:30.891
<v Speaker 1>I heard some of us,</v>

68
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>some Xenu Shit.</v>

69
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.033
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

70
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>she pulled me into celebrity center so fast into a secured room and she handed</v>

71
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:41.511
<v Speaker 1>me my ass.</v>

72
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:41.771
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

73
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>don't you ever say that word outside of secured room?</v>

74
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing a knowledge report on you.</v>

75
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.501
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

76
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:48.334
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing room.</v>

77
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>You never say that word out loud in a room that's not secured.</v>

78
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.941
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And never seen again.</v>

80
00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>So she wrote a report on the report.</v>

81
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>She wrote a knowledge report on me.</v>

82
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I got sent to what's called ethics,</v>

83
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>which is like the Justice Department of celebrities of,</v>

84
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>of Scientology.</v>

85
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

86
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>they brought me into another secured room because they have to get somebody who</v>

87
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>knows this information.</v>

88
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

89
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.140
<v Speaker 1>never ever say that w say this.</v>

90
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>It never confirm it.</v>

91
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Never deny it.</v>

92
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Never give that information out ever.</v>

93
00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>That just never discuss it.</v>

94
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Just say I'd never heard of it.</v>

95
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 1>You sound crazy.</v>

96
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

97
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 2>And then I also,</v>

98
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 2>this is all just theories of course,</v>

99
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to research any of this,</v>

100
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

101
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

102
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I think parents try to outdo each other with their stories about what the fuck</v>

103
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:31.831
<v Speaker 2>they felt.</v>

104
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>

105
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 2>they're really,</v>

106
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.953
<v Speaker 2>they're really like,</v>

107
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 2>they're not saying people,</v>

108
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 2>most parents know.</v>

109
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And I've learned to kind of already be like,</v>

110
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:39.804
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

111
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 2>they'll just sit down next to you,</v>

112
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 2>like your Forrest Gump and they'll just sit down and just start talking to you.</v>

113
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.901
<v Speaker 2>So he just said,</v>

114
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 2>your kid,</v>

115
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.501
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

116
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 2>well this is what you got to watch out for.</v>

117
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:47.941
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

118
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I remember my kid and Blah,</v>

119
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:49.021
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

120
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 2>blah blah,</v>

121
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.921
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

122
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like airplane.</v>

123
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean with with a fucking person,</v>

124
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 2>he talks to them and you want to kill yourself.</v>

125
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Just wait until he started going to school.</v>

126
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.853
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

127
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to,</v>

128
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>you've got to hang out with these parents all the time.</v>

129
00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Your kid's become</v>

130
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 3>friends with their kids and then you,</v>

131
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 3>you become friends with these people that you would never be fucking friends</v>

132
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>

133
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 3>This is what I do is I just look straight ahead and I don't look at him,</v>

134
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't respond to what they're saying.</v>

135
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 3>And then they just sort of the talk quieter and they gradually leave.</v>

136
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to go to dinner with them and your wife's can be friends</v>

137
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:16.451
<v Speaker 3>with some lady.</v>

138
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:16.721
<v Speaker 3>You're going to,</v>

139
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 3>well let's go on a double date.</v>

140
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:18.281
<v Speaker 3>Okay fine.</v>

141
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go this one guy now he talks and he doesn't look at you.</v>

142
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 3>He tells me these fucking stupid stories about his kid and the basketball team</v>

143
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 3>and he looks at you for a second.</v>

144
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

145
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 3>so Adam's in his basketball and then he starts looking down.</v>

146
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 3>He's in that did the coach won't put them in the game and I'm saying like if</v>

147
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.310
<v Speaker 3>he's a good player,</v>

148
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.751
<v Speaker 3>she could play,</v>

149
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:39.751
<v Speaker 3>how can we not can put them in the game and he's fucking bling rambling with no</v>

150
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 3>regard whatsoever for your attention span.</v>

151
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 3>The entertainment value of what he's saying.</v>

152
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 3>He's just the underlying insecurity of not being able to look at you or he's</v>

153
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 3>selling self-involved,</v>

154
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 3>he's self involved and is doing some weird thing with his hands where he's like</v>

155
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 3>click talking with his hands and I'm going,</v>

156
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

157
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 3>It's literally like someone squish,</v>

158
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.700
<v Speaker 3>fantasize about doing to them,</v>

159
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 3>not just running,</v>

160
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.401
<v Speaker 3>just running away.</v>

161
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:01.001
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hurt him.</v>

162
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 3>The guy's hurt by life.</v>

163
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 3>He's so damaged by live.</v>

164
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do anything to them.</v>

165
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 3>I just wanna get the fuck away.</v>

166
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 3>I always picture those people and I have a giant roll of duct tape.</v>

167
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 4>I just put it on the,</v>

168
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like a cartoon level speak.</v>

169
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

170
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.691
<v Speaker 4>it's cartoon level.</v>

171
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 4>I just put it on their mouth and I go,</v>

172
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.530
<v Speaker 4>and the last one,</v>

173
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.710
<v Speaker 4>it comes up and over their head and then it hangs down.</v>

174
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 4>The whole rest of the tape is hanging down over there awkwardly.</v>

175
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 4>And then I just go back to eating or whatever,</v>

176
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:33.210
<v Speaker 4>and they just sit there and slowly have to take it off.</v>

177
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 3>There's some brutal fucking people.</v>

178
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

179
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

180
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:41.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of weird people that you,</v>

181
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

182
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 3>you get closer to them and closer to them and you find out about their life.</v>

183
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

184
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.211
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

185
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:46.841
<v Speaker 3>when all those people,</v>

186
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:47.471
<v Speaker 3>I want to do that too.</v>

187
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they're talking about me,</v>

188
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

189
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.791
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

190
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:49.610
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

191
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

192
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

193
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they talk about me too.</v>

194
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 3>That's just how it goes.</v>

195
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Seemed like he was in a bad mood all the time.</v>

196
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.383
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

197
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

198
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 3>This is friend of Ron White's,</v>

199
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 3>who's a friend of mine who,</v>

200
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:00.671
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 3>the first time he met me he's like,</v>

202
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:01.961
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

203
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:02.441
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

204
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:02.921
<v Speaker 3>And Ron's like,</v>

205
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:03.341
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

206
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.031
<v Speaker 3>he's a good guy.</v>

207
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

208
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 3>he's a dad too,</v>

209
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 3>and we're all buddies together now,</v>

210
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:07.841
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>

211
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:08.211
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

212
00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

213
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.693
<v Speaker 3>I'm guarded.</v>

214
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 3>I've been beaten down by some of these fucking basketball stories.</v>

215
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 3>It's these assholes and tell you and my,</v>

216
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 3>he could,</v>

217
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.160
<v Speaker 3>he's a good player.</v>

218
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.760
<v Speaker 3>He's a good player.</v>

219
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Did just want to put them in the game.</v>

220
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

221
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.821
<v Speaker 3>Do you just,</v>

222
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 3>you think of things that you would torture somebody talking about and you like,</v>

223
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 3>I would never do this to you.</v>

224
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing this to me?</v>

225
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 3>You're not even thinking about verbal water.</v>

226
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.123
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

227
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.530
<v Speaker 4>like in your own little Guantanamo.</v>

228
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a great way describing like when is the dessert tray coming?</v>

229
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.530
<v Speaker 3>I would say I don't need dessert,</v>

230
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.491
<v Speaker 3>so what should we do,</v>

231
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Gary Vee,</v>

232
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.960
<v Speaker 3>let's wrap this up.</v>

233
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.740
<v Speaker 3>What should we do?</v>

234
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.573
<v Speaker 3>What should people do?</v>

235
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.890
<v Speaker 3>People should fucking stop complaining.</v>

236
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

237
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

238
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.691
<v Speaker 3>Call the fuck.</v>

239
00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:48.890
<v Speaker 3>They are good call.</v>

240
00:05:48.891 --> 00:05:50.840
<v Speaker 3>People should not listen to America.</v>

241
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Propaganda of fixing the shit they suck at.</v>

242
00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:55.670
<v Speaker 3>They should be tripling down on what they're good at.</v>

243
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>They should be competent in certain</v>

244
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 5>areas,</v>

245
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.910
<v Speaker 5>but you're not going to become Beyonce or your bone structure is a certain way,</v>

246
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 5>like you're not going to solve everything.</v>

247
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 5>Your Iq can get a little bit better,</v>

248
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 5>but don't worry about the incremental.</v>

249
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Figure out what you fucking puts you on fire and you're halfway decent at it.</v>

250
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 5>If you're lucky enough right now to be listening and you're good at what you</v>

251
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:23.891
<v Speaker 5>like become tunnel fucking vision because there's way too many voices telling</v>

252
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 5>you what and how.</v>

253
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 5>And here's the other thing,</v>

254
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.411
<v Speaker 5>and this is the big one,</v>

255
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

256
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 5>because you have a humongous audience.</v>

257
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 5>The biggest thing that I've seen dividends from have the conversation with the</v>

258
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 5>person that's holding you back.</v>

259
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 5>The reason most people who are listening right now,</v>

260
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 5>we're not doing that thing is they're worried about the opinion of somebody,</v>

261
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 5>usually their mother,</v>

262
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 5>usually their father.</v>

263
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 5>And the reality is is that your spouse may be the person holding you back and</v>

264
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:51.660
<v Speaker 5>you have to have that conversation.</v>

265
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 5>Turn them off.</v>

266
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 5>We have to get to a place where you're doing you because the number one thing</v>

267
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 5>that scares the fuck out of me is regret.</v>

268
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 5>And you're going to sit there at 72 and he going to say,</v>

269
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 5>I wish,</v>

270
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.931
<v Speaker 5>I wish,</v>

271
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 5>I wish.</v>

272
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 5>And whether that's money or spend more time with your family.</v>

273
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 5>There's a million ways to do this.</v>

274
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 5>Not everybody wants to buy the jets.</v>

275
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 5>Not everybody wants to smoke weed on the beach in Bahamas.</v>

276
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody's got a different fucking thing.</v>

277
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 5>Figure out what your fucking thing is and stop making fucking bullshit excuses</v>

278
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 5>who the president is.</v>

279
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.710
<v Speaker 5>Your mom did this like,</v>

280
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 5>like I missed it.</v>

281
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 5>I had that idea for Uber.</v>

282
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 5>Then why didn't you fucking do it Dick?</v>

283
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.471
<v Speaker 5>That's what I think.</v>

284
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 5>Joe Margarel,</v>

285
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 3>this is not about parties.</v>

286
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 3>We're taking these people on.</v>

287
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.160
<v Speaker 3>We're bringing God back in even smaller.</v>

288
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't very religious like Trump has gotten religion learning about this</v>

289
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 3>because let me tell you something.</v>

290
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 3>Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves God and he's been briefed on all this</v>

291
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to roll their ass up so the pedophiles better get ready.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Tell them.</v>

299
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>number one,</v>

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 3>people think there's a God damn conspiracy.</v>

302
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.741
<v Speaker 3>Here's what happens.</v>

303
00:07:57.741 --> 00:07:58.780
<v Speaker 3>They think it's a flat earth too.</v>

304
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.120
<v Speaker 3>I take real stuff.</v>

305
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 3>Notice Joe's done is researched,</v>

306
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 3>not kissing his ass.</v>

307
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 3>So he knows all these little points.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm like remembering stuff when he brings it up.</v>

311
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Cause I tried to suppress half this crap.</v>

312
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:09.021
<v Speaker 3>I can't handle it anymore,</v>

313
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:09.201
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

314
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm 43 and I'm sitting here looking at all this and then,</v>

315
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 3>and these people come up to me on the street and they go,</v>

316
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 3>hey Joe,</v>

319
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.340
<v Speaker 3>And then I,</v>

320
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:17.811
<v Speaker 3>I tried like,</v>

321

<v Speaker 3>I say Bill Hicks.</v>

333
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

336
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 3>I'll be on the street or I'll be at a restaurant and they come over and they go,</v>

337
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.370
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

338
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.881
<v Speaker 3>hey bill,</v>

339

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:38.890
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

344
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.580
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

345
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.413
<v Speaker 3>and I turn around and go,</v>

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.571
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

347
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:45.571
<v Speaker 3>I know it's you all because I did a few pieces and one little video with a guy</v>

348
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:48.180
<v Speaker 3>that lived in Austin that you knew that's how I met you,</v>

349
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.030
<v Speaker 3>but you don't like Bill Hicks.</v>

350
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what's ridiculous about it.</v>

351
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.401
<v Speaker 3>Like what'd you get?</v>

352
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Like massive plastic surgery changed the way your voice sounds like your voice</v>

353
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:57.200
<v Speaker 3>is so different than his,</v>

354
00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 3>all the testing is that no one ever wants to look real conspiracies cause</v>

355
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 3>they're complex and hard to understand.</v>

356
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 3>They want to just go with the earth is flat.</v>

357
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.401
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

358
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:05.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

359
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 3>there's aliens living underneath the capitol.</v>

360
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Dinosaurs aren't real or,</v>

361
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:09.301
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

362
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:09.451
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

363
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:09.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

364
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

365
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 3>the point is I'm look at a bash.</v>

366
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:12.531
<v Speaker 3>Eddie.</v>

367
00:09:12.531 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Eddie has,</v>

368
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

369
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 3>it's good to have a free open mind,</v>

370
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't promulgate stuff.</v>

371
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 3>He's only researching what's been said.</v>

372
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 3>So I want to just get this out of the way.</v>

373
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 3>I am Bill Hicks.</v>

374
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.421
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually,</v>

375
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 3>you are how old Bill Hicks be?</v>

376
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.523
<v Speaker 3>Like 60.</v>

377
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

378
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 3>I think he died at 32 and 1994.</v>

379
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:29.851
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

380
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:30.684
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

381

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I was getting my studio it really cold.</v>

388
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.960
