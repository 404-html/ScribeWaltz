1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.270
All right.
We're alive.
That's it.
You don't have to do it Chris.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.580
Don't worry about it.
Alright Chris,
what's going on guys?
He paying attention.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.490
What are you doing?
Hello Chris.
How good you're doing.
Checking your email.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.890
We're alive is a million people fucking Christ.
Let me see my Facebook.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.230
Oh,
I got a like on that picture

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.440
you guys are the head of the owners of my favorite all time website for mixed

7
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.370
martial arts.
It's changed names three or four times since I've been a member.

8
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.270
A submission fighting.com back in the day.
Right?
What was the original,
the uh,

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.780
the original,
well I grabbed a bunch of URLs before the sport.

10
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.990
Really had a name that would have been 95 ish or so.

11
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:41.490
One of the ones who grabs with submission,

12
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.250
fighting.com I asked the guys at the gym at a submission,

13
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.160
fighting.com mixed martial arts.com and a few other ones.
What they liked,

14
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.550
they said submission,
fighting.com so we ran with that for a few years.

15
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.150
But I would get outraged emails from people saying this is not what I was

16
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:54.841
expecting.

17
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:58.260
And what they wanted was one of those sort of porno apartment wrestling kind of

18
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:59.094
sites.

19
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.600
And then my mother said she would tell her friends what I was up to and she'd

20
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.400
say,
they'd say,
what's the URL?
And she'd say,

21
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:07.920
submission fighting.com and she'd get long looks from him.

22
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:09.420
So after my mother started complaining,

23
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:13.650
I changed it to mixed martial arts.com then the UFC switched to UFC TV.

24
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:18.540
So we became MMA TV and then we,
and then the UFC dropped the TV.

25
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:21.600
So we went back to mixed martial arts.com that's where we are forever.

26
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.510
Although somebody offered us a,
they offered,

27
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:27.750
they didn't complete 600 grand for mixed martial arts.com and we would have

28
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:30.150
dropped it in a heartbeat for that.
And going back to MMA TB,

29
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.790
why didn't you take it?
And we did take it.
They didn't.

30
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.080
They didn't to with the one changed.
Yeah,
it's all yours.

31
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.590
600 grand.
$600,000 that's insane.

32
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.660
Didn't business.com go for like 7 million bucks or something crazy like that?

33
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.730
Yeah.
What the fuck,
man,
that's a lot of God.
Damn scratch.

34
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.760
The one that kills me though is I turned down mma.com for $200 at the time,

35
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:58.680
cause it wasn't a sport,
really wasn't mixed martial arts.com.

36
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.490
It's like people called it that,
but MMA wasn't really a thing yet.

37
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:04.890
It was the main mall association and they had,

38
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.100
they had let it lapse and for 200 bucks I could have grabbed it.
And I'm like,

39
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:11.130
yeah,
$200.
It's a lot of money.
What year was this?

40
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.590
[inaudible] 99,
maybe 98.
99 97.

41
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:19.740
Somewhere in there.
Do you remember what year it became called?

42
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:22.890
Mixed martial arts?
All the whole sport.
I would,

43
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.950
I mean I would date that to when everybody got to get,

44
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:30.300
when nick limbo got everybody together in New Jersey and came up with a unified

45
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:35.250
rules,
which would have been 2008 crash.
And that's when,
uh,
that's when the,

46
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.440
the name sort of started to stick,

47
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.290
but they were calling it that did big John McCarthy name it.

48
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.590
I have heard a variety of,
uh,

49
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.110
I've heard a variety of explanations for where the name came from.

50
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:47.400
And I honestly don't know.

51
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.460
I don't think there's anyone that's a that's that's definitive.

52
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.810
I'm pretty sure our heard big John say that he named it.

53
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.040
It was either him or it was Jeff Blatnick.
I can't say it.
Yeah,
more than once.

54
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:04.000
Jeff has said that he coined the term and the aspect John Cause he's up at the

55
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.360
San Diego with us so we get back on the CFI claims that what is going on in San

56
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.670
Diego.
A character and myself are up there for our convention.

57
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.460
It's the association of Athletic Commissions.
It's a blast.

58
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.300
It's all the athletic commissions in the country coming together for a year and

59
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.840
drink and just pretty much talk to each other about the issues are going on in

60
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.740
their acs and they try to,
well obviously not for a year.
How long has it go for?

61
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.690
No,
sorry.
They come together every year.
Once a year.

62
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.000
It's a like a week event for them and they just go over rules and shit like
that.

63
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.700
It sounds a little,

64
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.130
there's a huge amount of socializing and it sounds a little bits that's

65
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.800
trivializing it.
The thing is the,
the,
uh,

66
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.820
association of boxing commissions was formed by a Federal Lola Muhammad Ali act.

67
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:46.990
But that law has no teeth.

68
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.940
There's no penalties if you don't pay any attention to suspensions and does

69
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:55.990
nothing happens.
So the whole association is basically built on goodwill.

70
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.740
So there's an awful lot of just people getting to know each other and having a

71
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:00.251
beer.

72
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:04.180
And Chris often acts as a bartender and gets to know people that way and sounds

73
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:05.770
like it's a little trivial just to get to know people,

74
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.620
but it's actually the glue that holds the whole ABC together.

75
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.640
<v 1>So that's how it holds together.
Like say if somebody gets banned in,</v>

76
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:15.510
say Mississippi,
they keep them band in Massachusetts and things along those,

77
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.070
<v 0>that's it.
Exactly.
The,
uh,
the Muhammad Ali act says that,
uh,
requires federal law,</v>

78
00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:23.200
requires that boxing commission share suspension information.
So you kick it,

79
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:24.150
knocked out in Boston,

80
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:27.480
and then next weekend go up to New Hampshire and get knocked out again and then

81
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:30.750
go to Maine and get knocked out again,
which used to be a real problem.

82
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.960
It's still is a real problem in places like Mexico.

83
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.330
Mexico doesn't out suspension,
so guys just literally will,
if they're,

84
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.470
because they're poor,
they'll get knocked out every weekend and their opponent,

85
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.550
you know,
everybody's bogged away.

86
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.820
MMA is built on fair fights from the beginning of,
of is built on tomato cans.

87
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:52.620
And so there's a huge market for fighters that just lose,

88
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.130
um,
and they get knocked out all the time in Mexico.
Right.

89
00:04:56.131 --> 00:05:00.150
And like that guy that fought Mickey Rourke and Russia as this insane losing

90
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:03.090
record and he's homeless somewhere around here,

91
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:07.470
actually [inaudible] guy who lives in the streets and his job is basically to

92
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:08.880
show up and get knocked unconscious.

93
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.330
<v 1>And I didn't even do a good job of it.
That was bizarre.
It's bizarre.</v>

94
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.030
Did those things still happen?
Like did you see the one in Mexico,

95
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.080
the politician that muscles,

96
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.000
<v 0>the guy with a huge chest?
Yeah,
that was,
that was absolutely.</v>

97
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.340
Have you seen the crews?
No,
I don't think I've seen it.

98
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.200
<v 1>You need to say it.
Well,
we'll play it to Fox and match.
Oh,
it's reject.</v>

99
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.460
It's kind of call it a boxing match.

100
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.830
It's a guy who has synthol injected it to his arms and chest and shoulders.

101
00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:35.870
You know that synthol stuff.
If you don't know,

102
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.280
people are listening to this synthol something that I guess bodybuilders created

103
00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:44.240
it because like if they had a body part that wasn't sticking out enough that

104
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:48.800
like wasn't symmetrical.
Like say some guys,
their calves don't grow very well.

105
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.440
So they would have these big,
upper is big leg,

106
00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:55.730
but their calves would be skinny so they would inject this oil into their calves

107
00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:59.810
and it makes your muscle swell up,
but they're like fake boobs.

108
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.730
They Jiggle when you move.
So this guy has it all over his body.

109
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.240
He has it on his shoulders,
he has it on his chest,

110
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:12.170
he has it on his arms and because of that,
first of all,
his arms are heavy.

111
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.000
It's like he's punching with like 10 out 10 pound gloves and the other guy has

112
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.210
eight ounce gloves and this guy is known for having fake fights.

113
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:25.211
Apparently he has like 11 fake fights on his record and he's a senator in Mexico

114
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.980
and he's comes from a wealthy family.
The guy on the left,

115
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:30.260
massive plastic surgery all over his face.

116
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:34.700
His whole face looks like a like a fucking Kabuki mask.
But look,

117
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.750
he's,
his whole body is like fake.
And if you turn it up Jamie,

118
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:41.540
so we can hear when the crowd sees him fight,

119
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.830
they start laughing like really loud.

120
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.260
Like give us some volume here.

121
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.640
<v 2>I was like this on the crowd.</v>

122
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.400
I mean jet the fuck out of here.
That's like a sketch from mad TV.

123
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.430
Said,
look at this,

124
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.300
look at the way he's throwing punches is literally like he's got led all over

125
00:07:24.301 --> 00:07:29.301
his arms cause these Goddamn synthol muscles like he's carrying pounds of this

126
00:07:29.311 --> 00:07:33.570
water stuff is oil stuff in his body.
I would fight that guy,

127
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.700
that guy on the left.
We'll either,
one of them I guess

128
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.920
is so crazy.
This guy's a law graduate.

129
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.440
Wouldn't have to do to be a law graduate in Mexico.
Pay The fee.

130
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.053
I mean

131
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.600
<v 1>have you guys might want to suspend that guy if he's still a lawyer.</v>

132
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.070
But you know,

133
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.150
it's so crazy because Mexico is known for its great tradition of fantastic

134
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:04.930
boxers.
Like some of the greatest boxers of all time I've come out of Mexico.

135
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.740
It's a huge part of their culture.
So to have this guy do that,

136
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.340
it's rich guy do that is,
it's so crazy.
But that's always existed.

137
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.680
I believe that was a,
was done in the Philippines.

138
00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:17.650
I think Mexican fans would pull that guy from limb to limb.

139
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:20.440
If you tried it in Mexico,
I'm pretty sure that was,
uh,
that,
that,

140
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.950
that video was shot in Mexico,
in the Philippines.
That was it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

141
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.040
It's just Mexican fans are very,
very,
they're like Philly fans.

142
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:28.420
They know exactly what they're looking at.

143
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.090
It's just interesting you said that because the guys who were talking,

144
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:34.300
they sound like they have a Filipino accent.
You guys are speaking English.

145
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.010
I don't know the Filipino accident well at all,

146
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:37.660
but I definitely would defer to you.

147
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.410
I play a lot of pool and some of the Filipinos and the great pool players,

148
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.510
some of the best pool players ever from the Philippines.

149
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.360
So I'm used to Filipino accent.
Um,
the,

150
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.700
the website you guys started,
so you've been around for 20 years now.

151
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.360
Uh,

152
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:58.470
we started the site in [inaudible] 98 so I thought you said 95 95 I started

153
00:08:58.741 --> 00:08:59.790
buying the Urls,

154
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:04.560
I think [inaudible] 96 we had the art of NHB fighting on AOL,

155
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.850
so if you started in [inaudible] 98 I was a member I think in 98 I think I was a

156
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:13.350
member like the first year then if not 98 99 somewhere.
I've got our first,

157
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:15.870
I think first 400 and you're definitely on the list.

158
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.740
I'm one of the first 400 baby woo.
How many members you guys have now

159
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.940
active?
Hundreds of thousands.
Probably.
Holy Shit.
Half a million accounts,

160
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.640
but you know those people fall off here and there,
but a lot.
Wow.

161
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.290
We have 1.3 million people that come to our site every month.
That's insane.

162
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:37.870
And growing and growing.
Well,
it's the best forum and it's,

163
00:09:37.871 --> 00:09:39.360
it's hard to regulate,

164
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:42.990
but you guys have done an amazing job of keeping the Douche bags off or at least

165
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:45.930
keeping them at bay because that's what ruins those places.

166
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:50.280
It kicks off all the pro fighters like so many guys used to post there and don't

167
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.270
anymore like Tito and a lot of other like Evan Tanner of course there's a famous

168
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:57.330
thread that gets pumped up every now and then where Evan Chandler was saying

169
00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:59.700
hello before he died.
And uh,

170
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.870
it was cool back then that like these guys who were fighting in the UFC would

171
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:05.370
come on on a regular basis,

172
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.760
but they get run off by these just anonymous shitheads who just say the root is

173
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:14.940
mean is shit to them after they lost or before the fight.
You know,

174
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:19.080
like I've talked to a bunch of fighters,
like no one even to name names,

175
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:21.600
but giving guys like John Fitch or like I don't go there,

176
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:24.660
I got to stay off their,
cause it fucking fucks with my head.

177
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.010
Like these guys are assholes.
I'll pretty much all assholes.
The problem is,

178
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.550
it's not true.
They're not all assholes.
But when we started it was a small,

179
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.510
tight knit community of people that were in the sport.
And then you know,

180
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:39.930
the UFC blows up so people find us and now it's a million people.

181
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.070
And out of those million people,
maybe 10,000 are nice,

182
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:48.170
but the rest are just anonymous douche bags.
I don't really think it's the,

183
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.500
I think it's the opposite.
I think 10,000 or cons,

184
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.540
the other rest of them are fairly nice.
And the concert,
very vocal.

185
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.141
Like they get it,

186
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:58.320
they're all in there all the time and they just speak up all the time.
Well,

187
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:00.300
it's just like they can.
Yup.

188
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.860
I mean that's the beautiful thing about the Internet.

189
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.180
It's the horrible thing about the Internet.

190
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.360
The beautiful thing about the internet is anyone can talk and that's the same

191
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:09.630
reason why it sucks.
Yeah,
that was perfectly,
that was perfectly put.

192
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:13.640
It baffled me so much.
I actually went to a psychiatrist,
ask him,
uh,
uh,

193
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.610
there's a psychiatrist as a friend of family.
I'm like,
why do people do that?

194
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:18.901
And he said,

195
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:22.560
human beings have all sorts of emotional impulses and we're constrained by

196
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:25.760
society from acting out in a lot of them.
Maybe you're an unhappy person.

197
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.230
You want to swear it,
every single person you see,
but you can't,

198
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.290
or you get punched in the eye or there's other bad feedback.
But on the Internet,

199
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:34.770
all that stuff just comes out and you're anonymous.

200
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:36.750
So there's no repercussions whatsoever.

201
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.550
Like occasionally you guys hear about that guy and read it.
He was a,
uh,
uh,

202
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.000
a famous,
uh,

203
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.610
I'm infamous guy on some of these forums because he would post like really

204
00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:51.780
inappropriate shit,
really rude things,
nasty things.
And apparently,

205
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:54.070
I don't know if it was anonymous or who went after the guy,

206
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:56.920
but they found his actual identification.

207
00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:01.390
They knew who he actually was and they contacted as employers and they sent him

208
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:06.340
the posts that this guy was making and he got fired.
And uh,
you know,

209
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:08.830
they interviewed him and he said,
you know,
it was his release.

210
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.200
He said he was just playing a role and you know,

211
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.920
he would do cho pictures of underage girls and all kinds of like really creepy

212
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:18.460
shit.
Yeah.
I mean that was his thing.
And uh,

213
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.700
it was real in real life.

214
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.400
I mean he got real live repercussions because he got fired because of it.

215
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.730
So it was,
it was a big deal.
Eventually,
it doesn't surprise me at all.

216
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:29.350
We have guys email us every week.

217
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:31.390
Can you please delete all my posts on your farm?

218
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.920
Because they're looking for a job I've had.

219
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.290
I don't want that stuff out in public.

220
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.210
I've had that happened on my own message board,
but I'm like,
dude,
you don't,

221
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.620
your name is like,
you know,
suck it off.

222
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.540
[inaudible] 69 he really thinks someone's going to find that.
It just seems like,

223
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.830
it seems like a weird place to look now when you started,
what's,

224
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:53.560
what's really interesting about this sport for folks who don't know?

225
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.940
I'm mixed martial arts.
When I came along in 1997 it's one of,

226
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.750
I first started working for the UFC.
It was essentially a band sport.

227
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.910
The only way you get it was directv.

228
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.390
That was the only way you could get it was banned from cable.
Uh,

229
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.450
and when you would talk to people about it,

230
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:14.200
they would talk to you like you are a horrible person for being involved in such

231
00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:18.730
a thing.
And the sports stayed alive because of the Internet.

232
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.630
It was the first sport ever that stayed alive because of the Internet.

233
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.070
The websites will,
the sure dog or MMA weekly,
I don't know when that came along,

234
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:30.970
but there was a bunch of them that came along that that was how we found out

235
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:35.350
about the sport.
That's how we found out about the pride shows and k one.

236
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:40.000
And you know,
all the different fights that were going on in Japan and in Brazil.

237
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.460
The only way to find out about them was the internet.

238
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:45.100
So we were all like really active,
like,

239
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:47.850
and you would go to these forums and you would try to find out,
you know,

240
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.850
what is happening,
what's going on now?
And a lot of times,
you know,
you would,
uh,

241
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.240
be able to buy a tea.
I used to get tapes from a dude in Canada,

242
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.490
friend of mine in Canada,
uh,
had a friend and this dude,
uh,

243
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.310
contacted me do named Brian and I will buy tapes room.

244
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:07.120
He would get them from Japan and he would send them down to me in California.

245
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:12.121
I still have a gang of them and it was like all Genki pseudos old fights and kid

246
00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:15.970
Yamamoto like in the early days.
And it was really the,

247
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:18.170
it was a such an underground sport.
Why?

248
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:22.570
It's one of the reasons why the name of your website was so perfect because it

249
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:25.510
was the underground of the underground sport.

250
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.770
<v 0>Yeah,
I agree 100%.
I actually,
many,
many years ago,</v>

251
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:31.300
maybe 15 years ago,

252
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:35.020
I tried to get wired magazine to do an article on it because they did,

253
00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:35.920
maybe it was 10 years ago,

254
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:40.780
they did an article on the role of the Internet in revolutions in countries and

255
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:43.600
that was,
that was Tony.
I was like,
Hey,
I got a sport that was saved by,

256
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.870
by the Internet.
And they sent him some cool pictures and they were like,
oh,

257
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:50.330
those are cool pictures.
We're not interested,
but I agree 100% and I,

258
00:14:50.331 --> 00:14:52.190
I tried to get some,
some notice

259
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.650
<v 1>of that and the sort of the tech community or at least as much about the</v>

260
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.990
technique as much of the tech communities I know which was,

261
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:59.360
which was is it wasn't as wired magazine.

262
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.540
Well there wasn't very many other sports.
I can claim that.

263
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.930
None that I could think of.
And what other sport,
first of all,

264
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.700
there's never been a sport in our life that has grown the way MMA has is
nothing,

265
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.580
nothing even close.
They tried it with soccer,
didn't take,

266
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.650
I mean there's been a bunch of attempts.

267
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.660
Remember when they had that basketball game they used to play on trampolines
all.

268
00:15:19.661 --> 00:15:22.860
They still play that game.
I seen it on ESPN like seven to before.

269
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.120
It's like still on and like one o'clock in the morning.

270
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.980
And that's what they used to have.
Like Pka Karate,
PKA karate you to on it.

271
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.820
Like they can't give the eighties that's right.
That's what they called it.

272
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:40.570
But there was no sport in my lifetime that grew like MMA did from complete total

273
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:46.730
obscurity to the cover of ESPN over the front page,
front page of CNN,

274
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.090
a cover of sports illustrated.
Like that shit never happened.

275
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.750
There's never been a sport that that blew up like that.

276
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.350
And when it was at its worst,
when it was at its most desperate time,

277
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.040
it was sites like yours really.
They kept it alive.
Yeah.

278
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.470
Ultimate Athlete magazine listed again,

279
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:07.760
this is going back 10 or 12 years because they tried to compete with the UFC

280
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:11.600
with a show also using the term ultimate and they got sued and disappeared.

281
00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:16.420
But before they disappeared they gave out,
they did the 20 most important,
um,

282
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.470
things in the history of the Internet and I,

283
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.360
number eight was the underground and they were like,

284
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:24.770
if not for the underground and several other sites of the sport might've died.

285
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.890
And then they went on to discuss exactly what you are because it had been banned

286
00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:30.470
from television and,
and everything.
Well at one point in time,

287
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:34.700
the other ground had more posts and the underground,
it's still does does it?

288
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.730
Well,
we,
it got to be so much our surrogate full,

289
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.510
so we killed the other ground one day and everybody got mad at us,
but it's,

290
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:44.490
they're more or less even now,
more traffic on it.

291
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:48.200
We have to like every 30 days just delete them because it's just,
it's stupid.

292
00:16:48.201 --> 00:16:49.760
It's these guys at work,
nine to five

293
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.850
they just found snakes in the Internet with some friends and they just stay

294
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:58.760
there all day.
When I worked some psychos and I worked nine to five,

295
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:02.570
that's all I did all day.
I was an it guy.
I would just,
Oh gee,
all day.

296
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:03.500
Well that's,

297
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.280
that is the thing about people that have desk jobs where they're not being

298
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:09.530
watched.
The amount of productivity,

299
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:13.730
that's a loss today because the Internet is off the fucking charts.

300
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.160
It is absolutely absurd.
If you look at,

301
00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:19.490
our stats were only popular during work days.

302
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:23.180
We can smell really bothers you and they're going to a barbecue or taking a jog

303
00:17:23.181 --> 00:17:28.160
or whatever.
Nighttime there came their girlfriend.
It's people at work all day.

304
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.940
It's amazing how much time is being wasted.

305
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.990
People are getting paid by the hour to serve to other ground and look at girls

306
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.170
acids,
young,

307
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.620
9,700 page asked threads that you guys have.
There's a,

308
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.991
it's a,

309
00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:49.230
it's a testament to how things are screwed up in American management though that

310
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.050
did it.
It's

311
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.180
<v 0>allowed.
I mean,</v>

312
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.780
nobody should be able to go on the Internet during the work day because they're

313
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:56.450
not going to be doing work.
They're going to be

314
00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.020
<v 3>listening to this podcast right now.</v>

315
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.100
There's a huge amount of people at work with headphones on that aren't doing any

316
00:18:03.101 --> 00:18:05.650
fucking work at all.
They just kicking their feet back.

317
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.050
They might have like a folder open,

318
00:18:08.051 --> 00:18:11.590
like they're pretending to pay attention to some fucking spreadsheet,

319
00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.710
but really they're just listening to us.
That's normal.

320
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.950
<v 0>I know that there's a,
there's a little thing you can download for your computer.</v>

321
00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:20.200
So at the touch of a button,

322
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.910
a spreadsheet pops open and makes it appear as if you're working hard.

323
00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:27.460
So you boss comes and looks over your shoulder and being spreadsheet.

324
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.660
<v 3>I didn't go back.</v>

325
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.700
I wanted to work with Kerrick since Oh sex before that was just an it guy.

326
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.780
Graduated College.
I regular it job,

327
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.520
but I was into the sport and so I would work it eight to five and I had the

328
00:18:39.521 --> 00:18:41.980
underground up all the time or I was doing work for him,

329
00:18:41.981 --> 00:18:46.981
like on the side and I had a button on the floor that was attached to Usb and

330
00:18:46.991 --> 00:18:49.960
when like tapped it like an excel spreadsheet would pop up and like another

331
00:18:49.961 --> 00:18:52.810
document they're looking at,
I was working,
so if like a boss came in behind me,

332
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.990
tap the button.
It looks like I'm working,
but I'd really just be Oh gee.

333
00:18:55.991 --> 00:18:59.560
And I working on something else all day.
You boss is listening right now.

334
00:18:59.561 --> 00:19:01.720
He wants his fucking money,
right?
Yeah,
probably.
I think I owe,

335
00:19:01.721 --> 00:19:05.960
I'm like 40 grand a year for three years.
Just something that really is a,

336
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.900
it's a giant issue.

337
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.930
Now another giant issue that you guys must've come across is bandwidth.
I mean,

338
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.590
how much bandwidth does that site use and how much does that cost every month?

339
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.100
<v 0>I remember when I,</v>

340
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:24.110
the first time I ever noticed bandwidth was an issue with $75 a month and this

341
00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:28.310
probably would have been 99 or someone,
he's like,
oh my God,
$75 a month.

342
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.520
This is insane.
And then,
uh,
an ex you f,
uh,

343
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.280
ex NFL player owned a snake store in Colorado and he kind of heard,

344
00:19:37.281 --> 00:19:41.750
I was having this huge $75 a month bandwidth issue.
And so he said,
you know what?

345
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.080
Put a banner on your site for my snake store in Colorado.

346
00:19:45.081 --> 00:19:48.500
I'll give you 75 bucks a month.
I was like,
oh my God,
this is money.

347
00:19:48.501 --> 00:19:50.930
This is commerce and what are we paying now?

348
00:19:50.931 --> 00:19:53.960
Cars 3000 a month or something for it,
3000 a month,

349
00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:58.160
3000 a month in bandwidth and bandwidth and all that fun shit.

350
00:19:58.161 --> 00:20:00.350
That's insane.
And that's not including the cat,
you know,

351
00:20:00.351 --> 00:20:03.590
the capital costs of the,
and we start drive,
go down.

352
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.180
<v 3>Something crazy happens like fight related,</v>

353
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.430
like just people saying what the traffic Greg is about to break the internet or

354
00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:10.960
something and it happens all the time.

355
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.840
Kimbo is broken the Internet more than once.
Um,

356
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:17.200
Kimbo take moments that tend to break things.

357
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.830
Now when you go to the underground,
if you go to em,
mixed martial arts,

358
00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:24.640
I've almost said MMA.
Dot.
TV,
it redirects.
If you go there,

359
00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:28.670
you pay $500 a year to keep that just because half the people still type it in.

360
00:20:28.671 --> 00:20:32.200
And when they go to a browser,
my browser used to be programmed to it.

361
00:20:32.201 --> 00:20:35.590
I would hit em and it would,
that would fill it out,
click that and then it would,

362
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.860
it would forward to mixed martial arts.com but you got a bunch of banners like

363
00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:43.360
you have a Mazda ads and do you guys have to actively seek those out in the
hall?

364
00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:46.750
We have a company that pretty much wraps all of the ad inventory.

365
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.100
So made some deals

366
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.230
<v 4>ourselves like with the endemics,</v>

367
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:53.500
like the rev gear and draft kings and request a test fox,

368
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.420
but someone else just sells the rest.

369
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.190
And so now is this your job entirely for both of you?
Yeah.
Yeah,

370
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.170
a hundred percent a hundred percent wild,
isn't it?

371
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.110
Like at one point in time is must have been like a frivolous thing that you were

372
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:05.944
doing

373
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.790
<v 0>for the first,
for the first decade or so.</v>

374
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.070
Occasionally we would get ahead by a few hundred dollars and then there'd be

375
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:16.450
some local fighter.
I know we've got a chance to fight in the Nebraska.

376
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:19.420
I had a guy who had got to fight Nebraska,
so I bought him an airplane ticket.

377
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:24.130
That's what we would use with our super profits.
And then,
uh,
I don't know when,

378
00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:28.060
when it,
when it turned pro 2008,
May,

379
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.030
2008 we brought in Chris and Chris kind of got some good deals and all of a

380
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:34.120
sudden I was like,
oh my God,
we can make more than $75 a month.

381
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.660
<v 4>Yeah,
well not,
so when I came on board,
they were like,
we have this website,</v>

382
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.320
it gets a million views a month.
We make $100 a month.
And I'm like,

383
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.330
I think you can make more than that.
So he's like,
hey,

384
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.050
try it in the soil and you've got a job.

385
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:51.310
So I reached out to like tap out the big guys in the space and I made big deals

386
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:54.550
that these guys were like,
you guys should go ask tap over 800 bucks a month.

387
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:57.200
And I'm like let's go ask him for 8,000 and see what happens.

388
00:21:57.201 --> 00:22:01.240
And sure enough tap out bit at the time and kind of took off from there.

389
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.690
<v 0>That's actually a true story and the numbers are not exaggerated in the lakes.</v>

390
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:08.110
We were literally like kind of angling for 800 a month and of course literally

391
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:11.440
said 8,000 a month and they literally bought it and we signed a contract.

392
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.560
It's probably the greatest day of my entire life.

393
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.510
<v 4>Tap out is like a a great example of the over saturation of the market.</v>

394
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.240
Like tap out at one point in time was cool to wear.

395
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.770
I know a lot of people have a hard time believing that.
No,

396
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.720
19 1998 sophomore year of high school,

397
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.720
I ordered the tap out you're from and your face.com and I thought shit it said

398
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.560
like submit to tap out to cry uncle to it was like,
I was like,
this is awesome.

399
00:22:37.561 --> 00:22:40.500
I wore it once a week to school cause I thought that was the best thing in the

400
00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:44.430
world.
I thought it was so cool you wouldn't catch me dead in the tap out shirt,

401
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.230
you know,
before like nine years ago.

402
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:51.270
So now you can't catch you dead and tap out.
You're no,
not a chance.
What's it,

403
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.313
what happened?

404
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.330
I think they got related to like the Douche Douche bag aspect of MMA fans and

405
00:22:57.331 --> 00:22:57.411
there,

406
00:22:57.411 --> 00:23:02.411
there is that whole big culture of like Douchey MMA fans and like tap out then

407
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.360
affliction.
They all got kind of stuck in that.
Well how about how that happens?

408
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.510
<v 0>Well I it uh,</v>

409
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.090
grappling tournament again 15 years ago or something,

410
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.010
I had an interaction with a guy that,

411
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.050
that stuck with me ever since I had made some call in some mash and I came,

412
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:21.640
I think it was his match.
Not One of his students.

413
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:25.450
He's got a big school up in Canada now and he was arguing with me that I made

414
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:28.420
the point wrong and I was like,
dude,
it's just grappling.
Come on man.

415
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.160
And he looked at me and he goes,
look,

416
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.850
this is what we do instead of having health insurance.

417
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.580
And I just got cold apologized and I listened to what he said,
but there's a,

418
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.470
that's what he,
he said grappling is what I do instead of having health.

419
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.990
<v 4>Sure.
So he pays for grappling instead.
Health and human rights.</v>

420
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.460
<v 0>So serious about his lessons at hens.
Hose that he had moved from Canada,</v>

421
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.340
moved in,
moved from Canada to New York.
I was taking lessons at handles.

422
00:23:53.341 --> 00:23:54.510
He was probably a bit of black belt.

423
00:23:54.511 --> 00:23:57.930
Now he's probably a blue belt or a purple belt.
Then I was reffing a match.

424
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:02.550
I probably made a wrong call.
He lost.
I was telling him it's not that important.

425
00:24:02.551 --> 00:24:04.770
And he said,
this is what I do instead of having health insurance.

426
00:24:04.771 --> 00:24:07.110
I can't do both.
That's how serious it is for me.

427
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.770
And there's a hardcore fan base of the sport that's like that.

428
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.210
Like if you were like,
okay,

429
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.500
health insurance or never discussing or having anything to do with MMA there,

430
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.880
there,
sorry,
health insurance,
hope I don't break my leg.

431
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.850
But that's the hardcore fan base around them.

432
00:24:20.851 --> 00:24:25.560
There's millions of knuckle heads that also by the apparel and stuff and

433
00:24:25.561 --> 00:24:29.580
eventually the knuckleheads out number,
the,
the hardcores and,
and uh,

434
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.010
and it doesn't work.
The one huge,
et cetera.

435
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.770
One of the huge exceptions that those roots of fight,

436
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.460
it's just an unbelievable company.
They,
the very first time I saw one of the,

437
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.360
the of their,
uh,

438
00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:42.450
their things and wearing one right now you're wearing one right now where their

439
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.480
shit all the time.
Not,
but that's too,
yeah,
I've got one in my,

440
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.630
I've got one in my suit and we're wondering where I've got one of my suitcase

441
00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:52.410
right now.
They managed to do with integrity.
I think I see their,
their,

442
00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:55.440
their apparel around a lot.
And to me at least,

443
00:24:55.441 --> 00:24:56.850
they still have complete integrity.

444
00:24:56.851 --> 00:25:00.420
If the president and the tire center was wearing and I'd still be like,
yeah,

445
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.460
we're to fight as is awesome.

446
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.151
<v 3>It's a fight.</v>

447
00:25:03.151 --> 00:25:07.960
Takes old like fight promo posters and turns them into cool t shirts and all

448
00:25:07.961 --> 00:25:08.790
like this one.

449
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.790
This is the actual sign for the Gracie Academy in like the 1950s and this is

450
00:25:14.251 --> 00:25:15.270
amazing.
That's it.

451
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.740
To me it's like a little piece of history so I don't think they're ever going to

452
00:25:19.741 --> 00:25:21.300
go out of style,
but there's certain,

453
00:25:21.301 --> 00:25:25.800
there's a certain douchey element that's attached to the tee shirt world of

454
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.920
mixed martial arts because it became a way that guys,

455
00:25:28.921 --> 00:25:33.810
it's sort of identify with the sport.
Like a,
this is one that I always site.

456
00:25:33.811 --> 00:25:35.520
There's a real shirt that I saw in New Jersey.

457
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.680
This guy was wearing a shirt that said,
some guys grapple,
some guys strike,

458
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.760
um,
both.
And I was like,
Oh,
you're disgusting.

459
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.970
I actually know that company.
Yeah.
Yeah.

460
00:25:47.971 --> 00:25:52.320
Some guys who strikers jump guys are grapplers on bull.
Mike,

461
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.250
my favorite Nma t shirt of all time is kicked out of the run off of it.

462
00:25:56.251 --> 00:25:59.070
But a couple of companies have.
My girlfriend loves to grapple,

463
00:25:59.071 --> 00:26:03.740
but you should see her box.
My favorite a teacher I've ever had,

464
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.370
I think I still have it and that's a good shirt for Boston to cause the word box

465
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:12.000
and synonymous with vagina in Boston and one of those.

466
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:13.890
It's one of those weird things that somehow or not,

467
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:19.020
I did not know that that was just a Boston thing assumed it was worldwide
spread.

468
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.220
We've,
we've spread it,
we've spread it across the world,

469
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.380
but I think it came from our neck of the woods.

470
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.510
I think box was like how the box doesn't even look like a box.

471
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.390
Maybe a Kleenex because I like the box at this hole in the middle.

472
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.790
How her tits cans,
tits were cans for a long time.
Right?

473
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.140
What does that make any sense?
Right?
Him,

474
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.590
I don't think any of the nicknames for tits makes sense.
Probably boobs,

475
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.610
but it looks like boobs.

476
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.630
Did you ever think at one point in time and not keeping that site going there?

477
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:54.660
Was there any time where it was becoming too expensive or too much of a pain in

478
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:56.820
the ass and you're just like,
ah,
fuck this place?

479
00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.590
<v 0>No,
the,
the,
the,</v>

480
00:26:58.591 --> 00:27:02.860
the worst of the sport is in some ways when I was the most dedicated to it,

481
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.980
when the sport got,
got off a paper view and yeah,

482
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.940
there was like three paper views in a year and that was more or less it hooking.

483
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.730
Shoot,
Jeff,
Jeff would put on a couple of Hook and shoots here.

484
00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:13.564
There's almost nothing.

485
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.440
I figured the sport was going to die on a national basis and then we would,

486
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.400
we would just sort of build it up over 40 50 years and I'd be dead at the end of

487
00:27:21.401 --> 00:27:23.960
it.
But I believe in a sport I always have and I thought it would,

488
00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.960
it would build up from the bottom up.

489
00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.090
And so I thought the Internet at the time at least,

490
00:27:28.091 --> 00:27:31.920
was incredibly important to do that.
So on the sport was at it's lowest.
I was,

491
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:36.190
I was actually the most excited about keeping the,
keeping the site going.

492
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.780
I've definitely never,
uh,

493
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:42.040
never a single moment wanted to turn them off one at a turn it off cause all the

494
00:27:42.041 --> 00:27:42.874
jerks.

495
00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.990
<v 3>Well I always had loyalty to cipher.
A couple of reasons.</v>

496
00:27:46.991 --> 00:27:49.750
One because it was one of the first ones I've ever joined and it was like one of

497
00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:53.950
the places where like I said you would get guys like Josh Barnett would post on

498
00:27:53.951 --> 00:27:56.710
there and all these yeah a lot of guys,
big guys,

499
00:27:56.711 --> 00:27:59.350
Randy and the back of the day get Henderson,

500
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.570
Dana white would be on all the time back in the day and he's still on it every

501
00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:05.650
day.
He just hasn't,
it doesn't post anymore.
How do you know,

502
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.470
cause he calls me though once a week to complain.
Oh Jesus.

503
00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:13.150
Does he complain about like posts are up here and there.
Yeah.
You know,

504
00:28:13.151 --> 00:28:15.690
it shouldn't have actually spread that he's getting a match.
You know,

505
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.680
just as people were like making things up above them.

506
00:28:17.681 --> 00:28:22.180
He doesn't like that and people right now are going to be making things up right

507
00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:24.640
now because they know that you guys are here.
Right?

508
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.610
I mean when he says stuff that he says it,
he doesn't care.

509
00:28:27.611 --> 00:28:30.340
But if somebody twist his words and make something up,

510
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.960
he gets upset about it because that's why people do it for fun.
I,
yeah,

511
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:33.940
the whole trolling

512
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.040
through how many they're going to continue to do it now.
Dana,

513
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.920
Jesus Christ Christian three under the fucking bus.
I just got like,
Hey,

514
00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:44.260
I'm going to get a call and like 10 minutes like you're fired.

515
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.080
I always had loyalty for two reasons.
One because of that,
but two,

516
00:28:47.081 --> 00:28:48.360
because care can I,

517
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.400
we know people from from Massachusetts like we knew like we're probably pretty

518
00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:54.761
close to same age.

519
00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:59.440
I'm 47 how old is four 54 we in that time period,

520
00:28:59.441 --> 00:29:03.580
we knew a lot of the same martial arts people like I'd heard about you,

521
00:29:03.581 --> 00:29:05.830
I heard about your school in western Massachusetts.

522
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.640
Western Massachusetts was always a home of Larry Kelly who's like a really well

523
00:29:09.641 --> 00:29:10.750
known karate guy.

524
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.800
Here's my business partner for 20 years and he was really popular or famous

525
00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:19.801
rather for knocking out Billy blanks back when Billy Billy blanks was a fucking

526
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.860
superhero.

527
00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.900
I mean he was the point karate guy and that's another one where they dusted the

528
00:29:25.901 --> 00:29:29.620
guy off and made them fight again.
If you watched that fight with Billy blanks,

529
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:34.870
Larry Kelly chaos him with a hopping hook kick to the face and Larry was famous

530
00:29:34.871 --> 00:29:37.750
for his hook kick,
which is a really hard shot.

531
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.880
It's a hard kick to generate force with because your have to start out here and

532
00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:46.240
then they have to switch that way.
It's a weird motion.

533
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.170
Whereas like around kick seems more natural like kinetically.

534
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.090
But Larry had a down he and he hook kicked Billy blanks in the face and send him

535
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:58.600
fall lying.
He skid across the the mat.

536
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:03.430
He was completely unconscious and they waited for him to wake up and then they

537
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:05.950
were literally trying to get them to fight again.

538
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.940
That's how this is it right here.
Oh here it is.
Watch this.
This is uh,

539
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.940
like when people talk shit about the hook kick,
I say,

540
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:14.920
well I'm going to show you something here.
First of all,
Bill,

541
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:18.610
super foot walls and boom that,
I mean,
come on son,

542
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.410
look at that.
I mean that was beautiful.
One more time.
Look at this.

543
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:28.060
The hop boom and he disguised it behind the back fist or a jab or whatever he

544
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:33.030
was doing with his front hand.
Beautiful.
And when uh,

545
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.400
they've dusted him off after that,
if you watched the actual full video,

546
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:38.290
they were trying,
they waited for a long time.

547
00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:40.120
They were trying to get them to go back in there and fight again,

548
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.100
which is how stupid people were back then.
This terrible,

549
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.840
they had no knowledge when we were coming up and we were talking before the show

550
00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:49.930
started about guys who had been knocked out in the gym and all these people that

551
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:51.820
we know,
people get knocked out,

552
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:56.500
they would dust you off and push you right back in there like that day,

553
00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.220
five minutes later,
like right here,
is Billy there w there warming them up.

554
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:04.180
They're like,
wake up Billy,
wake up.
Wake up,
it's like,
I think I got a dream.

555
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.590
It's called Tibo smelling salts and his nose.

556
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.620
And there was a,
there's was a bunch of these guys,

557
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:16.621
there was him and a bunch of other guys like him that were these really big

558
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:21.730
super muscular guys that were involved in the point fighting circuit.

559
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:27.060
And they got real good at leaping in and tagging you and um,

560
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.330
you're starting to see that skill emerge in MMA.

561
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.680
I know there's a guy who fights for Bella tore his name is escaping me right
now.

562
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:40.000
He's a venom.
What's his venom Michael Page,
right?
Yeah,
that's it.

563
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:44.350
And he has that style.
And then of course you've got,
um,
uh,

564
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.020
Raymond Daniels who's fighting and glory,

565
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.390
who's really picking up the kickboxing game,

566
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.740
who also was a great fighter in a point karate circuit.
And he's got that style,

567
00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:57.600
that leap in style and the ability to cover distance,
the,

568
00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.660
the ability to jump in and cover distance in a way that you can't,
you know,

569
00:32:01.661 --> 00:32:05.170
like there's a lot of guys that are,
uh,
they're sticking to that Moy Thai style,

570
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:10.230
sort of flat footed Tiago Silva Plod forward sort of style and that shit is not

571
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:12.274
flying anymore.

572
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.330
You got these guys like Tj Dillashaw that are now using the neo footwork style,

573
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.990
but the Raymond Daniels style,
I think that's the next level.

574
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.550
I think you've got that style of leaping in on top of the neo footwork style

575
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:29.380
because that ability that those guys had of his closing the distance really

576
00:32:29.381 --> 00:32:31.060
quick with that karate style blitz.

577
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.450
I still think that's like a missing aspect in a lot of MMA.

578
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.920
Machita had it a little bit,
you know,
he has,
he has an element of that,

579
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.210
but he was more of a counter striker I think.
Um,
Larry Kelly like in that,

580
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:45.050
in that video,

581
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:48.530
like demonstrated like why that can be like super effective like that.

582
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.390
<v 0>It actually came,
originally came into the sport of,
uh,
uh,</v>

583
00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.500
point fighting from a Bruce Lee in Bruce Lee picked it up from,
uh,
from fencing.

584
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:57.770
Bruce Lee watched all kinds of,

585
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:00.940
he watched boxing and loved Muhammad Ali the same way Dominick Cruz did try and

586
00:33:00.941 --> 00:33:04.840
pick up things from him and he watched fencing and it fencers have the quickest

587
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.560
footwork,
handwork that I personally have ever seen.
They just explode forward.

588
00:33:08.561 --> 00:33:11.470
And he picked it up and he showed it to a karate guy named Joe Lewis,

589
00:33:11.471 --> 00:33:12.900
not the boxer,
Joe Lewis.
But I cried.

590
00:33:12.901 --> 00:33:16.270
A guy named Joe Lewis and Joe Lewis started smashing everybody with it.

591
00:33:16.271 --> 00:33:17.560
And so everybody else picked it up.

592
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:22.480
And then the point fighting in karate where you stop every single time you land

593
00:33:22.481 --> 00:33:23.740
sewing,
which is kind of nutty,

594
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.600
started to dissipate and people start doing what's called continuous point where

595
00:33:28.601 --> 00:33:30.010
you weren't trying to knock each other out.

596
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:33.820
You were trying to land super clean shots without a knockout,
but you kept going.

597
00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:35.740
And that's where like Daniel's came from.

598
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.620
And I'm Michael Van and page and guys like that.
And I,
I do think that it,
uh,

599
00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.550
that it can be applied to the sport and then,
you know,

600
00:33:42.551 --> 00:33:45.130
in a couple of years people learn how to counter that and something,

601
00:33:45.131 --> 00:33:48.100
something new will come along.
But when you can do something new in the sport,

602
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.100
you get a,
you get a little edge for a while,
like Machita did with,
uh,

603
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.220
with his traditional SugarCon karate,
the,
those long,

604
00:33:54.221 --> 00:33:58.570
long lunges forward and sort of jabbing super hard and throwing that right hard.

605
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.870
He had an advantage over everybody until he started bringing karate guys in and

606
00:34:01.871 --> 00:34:03.820
they're like,
okay,
it's not that tough to shut down

607
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.990
<v 3>guys,
figure out what they're doing.
You know,</v>

608
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.670
once you find a guy who's really good that you can spar with,

609
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:14.050
then you can kind of time it.
But until then,
until then it's like,
what is this,

610
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.660
this new style of movement that I have in front of me that I don't,

611
00:34:17.661 --> 00:34:20.530
I don't know anybody moves like this and it's super hard to judge.

612
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.970
She provided judge the timing.

613
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.080
<v 0>I got to watch it organically,
most notably through a,
through grapplings,</v>

614
00:34:26.081 --> 00:34:30.220
I started reffing grappling in the late nineties for my best friend Kip Cola or

615
00:34:30.221 --> 00:34:30.480
with,

616
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.440
with Naga and I would watch as new grappling techniques would get introduced

617
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.221
when I started,

618
00:34:36.221 --> 00:34:39.940
nobody knew what a heel hook was and then a few guys would learn a heal hook and

619
00:34:39.941 --> 00:34:41.590
guys didn't know how to it.
They didn't know how to tap.

620
00:34:41.591 --> 00:34:43.330
They didn't know what break your leg if you didn't tap.

621
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:46.840
And there'd be these horrific injuries of guys spinning the wrong way from heel

622
00:34:46.841 --> 00:34:49.300
hooks and now hardly anybody taps to heal hooks.

623
00:34:49.301 --> 00:34:54.060
It's not that tough to get out of.
Um,
and unless Paul Harris can sound,

624
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:58.930
then you're in trouble now.
Mother Fucker,
Jesus Christ,
she's terrifying.

625
00:34:58.931 --> 00:35:00.640
Or Eddie Cummings or,
or

626
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:01.451
<v 3>Gary Tonin.</v>

627
00:35:01.451 --> 00:35:05.220
There's a new level of guys that are coming and the grappling circuit out of a

628
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:10.090
John Danaher school and it's like this,
this new level of leg locks,

629
00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:14.260
like leg locks are really permeating all of grappling in Jujitsu now and are in

630
00:35:14.261 --> 00:35:15.910
a very new and strange way.

631
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.330
I've had some interesting conversations with Eddie Bravo about it,

632
00:35:19.331 --> 00:35:24.331
where Eddie really ignored leg locks until a few years back and then started

633
00:35:24.341 --> 00:35:25.270
incorporating it.

634
00:35:25.271 --> 00:35:28.300
And a lot of it is because of the success of a lot of these east coast guys.

635
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.530
A lot of it,
like I said,
Gary Tonin,

636
00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.090
Eddie Cummings and a lot of it is under the tutelage of dawn her,

637
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.860
but there's a lot of guys in,
in grappling that are really good at it.

638
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:40.590
And of course in MMA it was Paul Horace.

639
00:35:40.591 --> 00:35:42.340
It really kinda opened up a lot of people's eyes.
Yeah,

640
00:35:42.341 --> 00:35:45.510
it's funny you brought it up.
I'm going to train with it tonight down in La.

641
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.310
And I told someone that and they're like,
yeah,

642
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.930
he's been really working on his leg lock slightly.

643
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:51.780
So that's where you can just look out for my gym.

644
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:55.110
Coincidentally we've been doing leg looks forever like Joe Lozo and those guys,

645
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.820
that's the bread and butter they've been doing.

646
00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.740
Flying heel hooks is for 10 years and it all came from uh,

647
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.070
a guy named Donnie Danville and fall river.
Um,
it was actually passed now,

648
00:36:05.071 --> 00:36:09.300
but he grew up with a Japanese mother and judo and um,

649
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.170
he was like a leg lock king and this is like 2002.
And we're like,

650
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.670
what the fuck is a leg lock?

651
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.260
But he came into our gym and he tossed like rolling toeholds he taught us to fly

652
00:36:18.261 --> 00:36:22.020
in leg lock.
MMM.
All inside,
outside the up,
all that stuff.
And we're like,

653
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.680
this is awesome.
And for years our gym was,
we had,

654
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:27.540
that was a competitive advantage.
We knew leg lock,

655
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:30.180
so he guys and grappling tournaments and fights with Lego blocks and they had no

656
00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:33.660
idea what was going on.
Do you guys remember Scott Adams?
Yeah,
of course.

657
00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.910
And he was guy,
one of the guys who trained with chuck like way back in the day,

658
00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.880
he was known as like a leg lock master back when no one knew what the hell leg

659
00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:42.714
locks were.

660
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.540
He was one of those guys that you would hear about and you would go to him,

661
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.550
you know,
there was a few of those guys,

662
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:52.350
like Frank Mir had some real good leg locks way,
way back in the day and that's,

663
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:54.150
that fucked him when he fought Ian Freeman.

664
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:58.530
Remember that he was going for the heel hook.
What do you really,

665
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.000
wow.
That was when it wasn't working for the UFC that was watching that at home.

666
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.991
And uh,
I,

667
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:08.160
I remember that was the issue with leg locks was that when someone would attack

668
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:08.994
a leg lock,

669
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.540
you would have both of your arms committed to the leg lock so you wouldn't be

670
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:16.290
able to defend against punches.
And as you know,
with a guy like Ian Freeman,

671
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.150
it only takes one to scramble your fucking senses.
And then a cop I'm in,

672
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:25.350
frank got hit by like four or five in a row.
Boom,
bom,
bom,
bom.

673
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.570
He just was gone.
You know.

674
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.440
And it's interesting to see that the progression of these techniques,

675
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:33.300
how it changes and how it morphs.

676
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:38.430
And one of the things like from like if you look at a guy like Larry Kelly or

677
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:41.610
you look at it like a lot of these traditional karate techniques,
those,

678
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.100
those techniques were kind of looked at like,

679
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.780
like there was those don't work anymore.

680
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.130
But now you're seeing so many of these traditional martial arts techniques like

681
00:37:50.131 --> 00:37:54.460
front kicks to the body are now standard like Collin Mcgregor,

682
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:59.190
Conor McGregor rather ruined Chad Mendez with front kicks to the body.

683
00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:02.550
Just jabbing them with those front kicks to the body and the spinning back kick

684
00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:05.580
to the body.
You've seen a lot of guys throw those kicks to the body.

685
00:38:05.581 --> 00:38:09.200
Now you're seeing a lot of wheel kicks that Wonderboy Thompson files.

686
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.730
Fuck Jake Ellenberger.
Holy Shit Shit.

687
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:16.440
I mean you're seeing these traditional techniques that are just super effective

688
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.620
when you get them in the hands of a guy like Edson Barboza when you get them in

689
00:38:19.621 --> 00:38:21.570
the hands of a guy who knows all the other things.

690
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:27.300
<v 0>Yeah,
I couldn't agree more the at various points I have thought,
okay,</v>

691
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.130
the sport is is done.

692
00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:32.430
We've SORTA got this body of knowledge and we've just got to refine what we've

693
00:38:32.431 --> 00:38:36.130
got and we're not going to be seeing a lot of,
a lot of new stuff coming

694
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.440
<v 3>in.
And every time I had that thought,
six months later,</v>

695
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:41.920
something had come along and,
and uh,
I would be proven wrong,

696
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.420
including super simple things like the arm and guillotine when it first started

697
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:47.740
happening in grappling tournaments,

698
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:50.950
I was reffing first time it really hit me hard.
I was reffing in Hawaii,

699
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:53.770
guy stuck in a,
in an arm and guilty and I thought it was a front headlock.

700
00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:57.610
And in Naga you give points if somebody gets close to a tap and I'm standing

701
00:38:57.611 --> 00:39:00.640
here like this is nothing to go on.
It's a front headlock from Heidi to dump.

702
00:39:00.641 --> 00:39:04.540
Dad is not going to,
and like I went to sleep cause remember Pete Pete,

703
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:09.541
Sal and Phil Baroni Pizza [inaudible] sleep and Phil said after the fight he

704
00:39:09.671 --> 00:39:12.460
goes,
I didn't know that you could get the sleeping one of those.
Right.

705
00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:17.130
Cause we did know it wasn't that he was ignorant,
we didn't know.
But Matt Serra,

706
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:21.340
who was Pete sells coach knew they were a little bit ahead and use the Jujitsu's

707
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:23.560
Henzel Gracie black belt a little bit ahead.

708
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.260
You know a little bit ahead of everybody.
When I started learning Jujitsu,

709
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.670
I was told you're safe if the arms and your friend had like,
oh just hang out.

710
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:32.710
You know,
let go and you're good.
You're always safe.

711
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.600
They figured out how to get up high on the neck.

712
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.380
That's what happened when guys started getting that Guillotine,

713
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.850
they would lean back like a regular gauge didn't work,

714
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.060
but now when they get up high on the neck,
man,
it just shuts the lights out.

715
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.130
If you've got a good grip,
you know,

716
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:49.120
there's also different grips like this is a big one that a lot of guys are
using.

717
00:39:49.121 --> 00:39:51.820
This Pretzel Grip where your wrap around this way,

718
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.960
it seems awkward until you have someone's neck in there and then for some reason

719
00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:58.930
it feels amazing.
Yeah,
I know Jake shields likes it.

720
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.830
I learned it from Denny proper goes,
who was a big fan of a,

721
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.220
he's a big fan of like adding,
incorporating all kinds of weird grips to it.

722
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.760
Be Different people have different grips that they use with techniques and it's

723
00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:14.540
amazing how just those little subtle adjustments have a huge impact on the,
the,

724
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.000
the efficiency of the technique.

725
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.240
How much leverage you can get into the technique.
Yeah.

726
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.320
I think Tom Waller told me that was his grip one day and I was like,
I'll try it.

727
00:40:22.321 --> 00:40:26.620
It seems weird,
but I liked that grip now and it's a great grip.
So many,

728
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.720
so many.
One in Mexico with a guillotine and then,
you know,

729
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.360
did like motion to the camera.
They went like this and they were like,
no,
no,
no,

730
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:38.710
no.
Like this.
Like he did it to the camera,
showed after he got the tap.

731
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:43.600
I get the name escapes me,
who it was.
But uh,
that's,
it's fascinating to me.

732
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:47.980
All the different techniques and the different variables and we're seeing that

733
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:50.110
even with the traditional martial arts techniques,

734
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:53.860
there's still a lot of things that guys are doing wrong with like traditional

735
00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:57.250
kicks,
like sidekicks and spinning back kicks are turning side kicks.

736
00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:00.340
There's still a lot of guys that have the need down instead of the knee up.

737
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.380
They don't lift the knee high enough because it takes,

738
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:05.560
it takes a long time to learn how to do that,
but when you do do it,

739
00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:09.400
then you get that thrusting kick,
which just has so much more power.

740
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:13.090
Like Barboza like you see Barboza is turning side kicks this weekend.

741
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:16.780
He lifts that knee up high and it comes straight at you.

742
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.750
That mother fucker kicks so fast.

743
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.230
Can you imagine getting kicked and the deck like oh his name dead from that

744
00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:26.020
spinning back kick,
he'll write to the deck.

745
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.330
I don't know what kind of copy has,

746
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.890
if it's one of those diamond MMA ones or one of those tie steel cups.

747
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:33.980
The didn't will

748
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.731
<v 1>just supposed to be like,</v>

749
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:37.460
you can run him over with a car and they don't have one now.
Yeah,

750
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:40.610
that's what I use.
They're incredible.
They're great.
Do you have one character?

751
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.010
There are 100% I can actually do one of those.

752
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:46.230
Kicked me in the Jimmy skits and you can get kicked in the Jimmy and it actually

753
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.240
like those commercial,

754
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:50.390
they put an apple in the cup on the ground and they run it over with her.

755
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:52.280
I get a cup and it gets destroyed.

756
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:55.610
Then they put it on the Diamond Cup and they run it over and the apple is fine.

757
00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.440
Yeah,
they're legit.
4,000 pounds of a car or whatever.
Yeah.

758
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.650
It's,
it's interesting cause all these,
you know,

759
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.680
these little problems that people used to have and they still have,

760
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:09.680
there's a lot of guys that still have lush,
shitty old cops.

761
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.420
Like I don't know what Felder was using,

762
00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:14.250
but it looked to me like a regular jockstrap and a comp that you would buy a

763
00:42:14.251 --> 00:42:17.620
fucking a sporting good $10 shock doctor or something cup.

764
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.850
I was cornering a rocks.

765
00:42:19.851 --> 00:42:24.260
And so a few years ago at a strike force and uh,
we were,
we were just,

766
00:42:24.261 --> 00:42:28.200
I think we're just taking a long walk to shoot trucks.
Roxanne modifiers.
Yeah.

767
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.050
It was the same one where a fade or knocked out a Rogers and I think,

768
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:35.840
um,
uh,
uh,
come on,

769
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.360
spit it out.
Ah,
Ha has some,
uh,
mental health issues right now.
So yeah,

770
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.230
he's a long list.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ

771
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:51.560
I ran into may have Miller and he had his cup and it was just a cup that you

772
00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:55.550
would buy for 1495 at,
at Dick Sporting goods or something.

773
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.600
Um,
the metal cups are,
I think they're the best because if you kick them,

774
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:02.180
you get a broken toe and if you figure four somebody's body,

775
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:05.750
you can dig the Metal Cup under their spine,
grapple at the cup.

776
00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:10.070
Now I feel like I'm not confident like I'm going to like move and then like,

777
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.220
ah,
just a cup.
Well,

778
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:15.560
the metal cups are banned from a lot of grappling tournaments because they offer

779
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:18.800
a,
a weapon.
Yeah,
it's a weapon.
It's,
it's um,

780
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:23.280
it's like a leverage point,
like a fulcrum point.
Especially for arm bars.

781
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.190
It's like you're,
you have a rock there.

782
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.700
It's a completely different point of leverage then you would have,

783
00:43:28.701 --> 00:43:30.590
if it was just your deck,
I won't,

784
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.470
I wonder if that's how big Tim's forearm broke when Mir did.

785
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.210
I wonder if he had a metal cup on it.

786
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.500
He couldn't have forearm over the edge of the Metal Cup like that.

787
00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:42.160
I never thought about that.
Very possible.
You guys fight with ty Cobb steel cuts.

788
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:43.650
I tell everybody to.

789
00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.540
Joel ozone has this mount back Ma and he calls it broke back mountain.

790
00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.090
So he gets like,
so he gets the hook set right?

791
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.880
And then he's got the hooks that he flattens you flatten the ground.

792
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.010
Then he scoots his ass back.

793
00:43:55.011 --> 00:43:58.490
So like his cups and you're like you asshole pretty much.
And it's terrible.

794
00:43:58.491 --> 00:43:58.971
It's terrible.

795
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:01.850
I've tapped out to it cause he just drives forward with a hot cup and it feels

796
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:05.150
like you're getting fucked in the ass.
So you've got to just be much tap.
Well,

797
00:44:05.151 --> 00:44:10.050
you kind of are
probably no penetration,
but it's pretty close to it.

798
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.590
That's so rude and terrible,
but you can't move.
You can't.

799
00:44:13.591 --> 00:44:16.730
We be like stuck because you can't like push your hips up to the sky.

800
00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:17.450
It's terrible.

801
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:21.640
There's some moves that are still legal in grappling like oil checks.
How's,

802
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.420
that's no,
that's illegal in NCAA wrestling.
That's,
that's wrong.

803
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:31.750
You are literally shoving your fingers in a man's asshole to controlling him and

804
00:44:32.191 --> 00:44:35.370
they move because of that because it fucking hurt.
That's horrible.

805
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.950
It's weird that you could do that,
but you can't just grab his dick.

806
00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.390
You want to really manipulate a guy grabbed his dick.
You can move them around.

807
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.270
I mean if you think about it,
if a Fishhook is illegal,
why should be,

808
00:44:45.271 --> 00:44:46.290
we'll put your finger and the guys,

809
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:49.410
but I mean that's totally a hundred more times.

810
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.740
Do we think there's a bunch of stuff that needs to be changed in the rules,

811
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:57.210
like downward elbows.
That is just dumb,
dumb as fuck.
Every time I'm at the show,

812
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:01.230
I watched the raft tried to explain that elbow guy.
Yeah.

813
00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.500
And every ref is different and under the corners,

814
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.870
like what are you talking about?
Like there's like a fucking Mohawk.
Oh No,
no.

815
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:07.651
I mean yeah,

816
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:12.651
but that was the area 12 the 12 to six elbow was banned because in big John

817
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:13.883
McCarthy told me this,

818
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:17.850
that when they first brought the sport to the athletic commissions,
they said,

819
00:45:17.851 --> 00:45:21.010
okay,
you can do anything but you can't do this.
Downward elbows try.

820
00:45:21.011 --> 00:45:24.970
Cause I saw a guy on ESPN break bricks and a karate tournament.
So they,

821
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.860
they thought that this was the most powerful strike known to man.

822
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.750
Meanwhile you've got Barboza wheel kicking Terry Edom into another dimension and

823
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:38.100
that's legal and also like the back of the head.
Like I get the fact that you,

824
00:45:38.101 --> 00:45:40.800
she,
you don't want people to get hit in the back of the head.

825
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.880
But here's the reality.

826
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.640
Almost every head kick is landing in the back of the head.

827
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.590
That's why guys go out.

828
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.930
Cause that the foot wraps around sitting in the back of the head.
Yeah.

829
00:45:48.931 --> 00:45:53.370
It's a big part of it.
A big part of the impact is the instep or the Shin.

830
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:57.630
Literally hitting that spot where everyone tells you not to hit when you do

831
00:45:57.631 --> 00:46:00.990
ground and pound.
But little short punches.
I mean it's kind of funny,

832
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:03.870
like someone's telling you,
you can't hit a hammer,
fists in the back of the head.

833
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:06.540
You know when your arm is half tied up and you're trying to do that and they're

834
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:09.030
like,
watch your back of the head.
But meanwhile when you're standing,

835
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:14.031
you just crank it with all that thigh meat and bone and 50 pounds of leg behind

836
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:22.080
it and boom,
that's legal.
It's very strange.
The A,

837
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:26.700
the thing about the back of the head that a lot of fans don't know is that both

838
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:31.620
players have a responsibility and that what usually happens,

839
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:35.580
especially with those kicks is that kickstarts to come in and people shy away

840
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:39.600
from it because it kicks coming in and they expose the back of their head and

841
00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:43.200
then they get knocked out.
Um,
but both players,

842
00:46:43.201 --> 00:46:45.960
both fighters have a responsibility about that back of the head stuff.

843
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:48.480
And if a shot comes in that if you hadn't moved,

844
00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:52.230
hit you on the side of the head and then you move and your back of your head

845
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:56.100
starts to get exposed.
It's kind of on you.
Well,
the same on the ground as well,

846
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:56.780
right?

847
00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.210
When a guys pounding on you on the ground and you're moving your head away from

848
00:47:00.211 --> 00:47:03.300
the punches to your face and he hits the back of your head and the referee says,

849
00:47:03.301 --> 00:47:04.410
watch the back of the head.

850
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:08.370
Well you were already launching that punch before the guy turned.

851
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.440
It's kind of not really your fault.

852
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:14.520
Get agreed 100% of science behind the back of the head thing.
I mean,

853
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.040
isn't it bad to hit any part of the fuck I want?

854
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.730
Any part of the head is not good to hit from boxing.
It was cold,

855
00:47:21.731 --> 00:47:24.260
a rabbit punch and box.
And going back to before that,

856
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:28.980
it's always been illegal in boxing.
I had a,
I had a weird one two years ago,

857
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.160
the Association of Boxing,

858
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.960
<v 0>uh,
commissions convention.
I spoke with a surgeon who was one of the,
um,
uh,</v>

859
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:39.100
ringside physicians,
a group heads,
and I was like,

860
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:42.370
I asked about this exact thing,
this exact thing we're discussing.
I said,

861
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:44.950
you know,
how dangerous is the back of the head?
And he said,
you know,

862
00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:51.150
the one that I'm worried about is right here.
He said that before either,

863
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:54.220
well,
that where the,
apparently I didn't know anything about it.

864
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:57.550
When we're little kids,
the bones haven't quite grown together.

865
00:47:57.551 --> 00:48:00.400
And as you get a little older,
up until two years old or something,

866
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:04.990
all the bones come together and they form an a little spot right here.

867
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:07.660
But the,
um,
but uh,
he,

868
00:48:07.661 --> 00:48:10.330
he thinks that there's actually a weakness in being hit right here.

869
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:11.260
And in the 80s,

870
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.210
I remember being at Master toddies when we tie studio in Manchester,
England,

871
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:19.480
and we watched the videotape and tidy said that guy died on the tape.

872
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.790
And I was like,
Holy God,
how did he die?

873
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:24.340
And it was a downward elbow right to here.
It's like a,

874
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.440
sounds like a silly sort of a blood sport thing,

875
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:31.240
but that jumping downward elbow right to this spot here is illegal and Moyie

876
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.930
Thai so may will be actually that's illegal.
Yeah.
The,
the,
the,
the,

877
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.420
the single downward or the double downward where they jump up and come right

878
00:48:40.421 --> 00:48:41.860
down and hit right here is illegal.

879
00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:46.420
<v 3>So that's so strange that the forehead would be an illegal target.
And Moy,
Tai,</v>

880
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.410
that seems so busy

881
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:51.570
<v 0>with an elbow,
but a downward downward elbow.
What about like a slashing Alba?</v>

882
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.130
Totally fine.
Cut cutaway.
But it seems like,

883
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:59.380
<v 3>but even a hard one,
like I was strong elbow.
It's still,</v>

884
00:48:59.381 --> 00:49:02.330
I mean it's not that specific.
If you're hitting someone in the forehead,

885
00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:06.280
<v 0>it may be as simple as a few times guys go,</v>

886
00:49:06.281 --> 00:49:09.060
well a lot of times it will be Thai guys had been downward,
you know,

887
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.200
wing elbowed across the head and they didn't die.

888
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:15.070
They just got a big cut and then somebody actually passed away from the straight

889
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:16.630
downward and they were like,
oh,
we're not doing that.

890
00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.340
<v 3>But the problem is in Moy,
Tai,</v>

891
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.390
you're not dealing with the most stringent athletic commissions are doing Mris

892
00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:25.720
and cat scans and making sure that people have the EKG is in order.

893
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:29.230
There's none of that going on there.
So who knows why the fuck that guy died.

894
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:34.070
<v 0>And a lot of people speed,
they take speed before they do more.
Cause more.</v>

895
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.890
Yeah.
That's pretty common.
Kids kids died of it and they in Thailand,

896
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:42.540
Dak younger,
younger,
uh,
several law younger fighters died from,

897
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:47.040
they would take speed cause you,
I mean I don't some kickboxers back in the 80s,

898
00:49:47.041 --> 00:49:49.380
it took speed for the same reason.
He kind of trained harder.

899
00:49:49.381 --> 00:49:52.710
You get more aggressive,
you're more angry,
you feel pain less.

900
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:54.900
Do you remember rip fuel?
Yeah,

901
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.580
<v 3>I did.
I took that shit once.
I went to Jujitsu class.
Oh my God,</v>

902
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:03.640
I almost fucking died.
My heart was pounding was Saul tall,
tall,
tall.

903
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:07.150
And I was like,
I got to sit down like I've never been,
it wasn't tired.

904
00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.920
It wasn't a tired thing.
It was like my heart was racing.

905
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:12.740
It was like I shouldn't be this tired.
My heart shouldn't be beating

906
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.560
<v 0>and then try that in a fight.</v>

907
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:17.180
When you are adrenalized and you're bleeding and he's bleeding,

908
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:20.320
the referee screaming,
there's 2000 people screaming and imagine what your,

909
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:22.660
your heart would have done.
Yeah,
guys have guys who have died from it.

910
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.560
<v 3>People did die from rip fuel.
It's one of the reasons why,</v>

911
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.970
I mean I remember taking it and I remember a,

912
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:32.740
I rolled with a couple guys and then I just had to sit down cause I was,
I was,

913
00:50:32.741 --> 00:50:35.870
I was really concerned.
I was like this is not like me being a pussy.

914
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:37.010
There's something going on here.

915
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.190
And then I heard about all these people dropping like flies and then they pulled

916
00:50:40.191 --> 00:50:41.900
it off the shelf and then they made it illegal.

917
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.580
But I would take it before I would lift and I feel like fucking Superman,
I'd be,

918
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.770
Oh God,
you just have so,
but lifting,
you know,

919
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:50.900
you're doing sets of six or whatever the hell you're doing.

920
00:50:50.901 --> 00:50:54.380
It's not taken you that long.
When you're doing a nine minute role,

921
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.370
that's when the heart really starts getting taxed and it just can't recover.

922
00:50:58.371 --> 00:50:59.420
It can't calm down.

923
00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:02.780
It's just you're confusing the signals with that goddamn speed.

924
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.480
<v 1>Friend of mine and a little,
I don't want to call it a seizure,
but he,</v>

925
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.140
little CP Lee had a little hit,
a little Caesar,

926
00:51:08.141 --> 00:51:10.370
a little seizure while we were driving.

927
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:13.610
We're driving a Honolulu and all of a sudden he just kind of pulls over and

928
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:17.180
freezes and shakes and it was,
it was from rip,
rip,
rip fuel,

929
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.970
that word.
You know,
if we'd been on the highway,

930
00:51:19.971 --> 00:51:22.400
I don't know what would have happened.
He would've died.
I would've died.

931
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:23.450
It was a rip fuel oil.

932
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:27.710
You would have reached over a fucking heroic manner and sat in his lap and drive

933
00:51:27.711 --> 00:51:32.060
due to safety.
Yeah.
It's um,
it's interesting how there's all these different,

934
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:35.990
like crazy athletic supplements that kind of go by the wayside.

935
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.630
They start out being like a,

936
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:42.000
like Jack Three d was one that I think have they pulled that final,

937
00:51:42.001 --> 00:51:45.470
they pulled that,
cause I know that somebody like guys in the military,

938
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.550
apparently we're taking it.

939
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.190
I have a buddy of mine who was in the military and he told me about it.

940
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:51.620
He texted me,
he goes,
you ever tried to Jack Three d?
Holy Shit,

941
00:51:51.621 --> 00:51:55.340
I'm getting big on this.
And then like four months later somebody died on it.

942
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:57.560
I was like,
I sent him the article.
I'm like,
man,

943
00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:01.790
my understanding is that that unscrupulous companies will come up with some new

944
00:52:01.791 --> 00:52:06.020
formula that's got two horny goat weed and oyster meet and who knows what all in

945
00:52:06.021 --> 00:52:09.680
it.
And they will actually add real anabolic steroids to it.

946
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.780
Oh yeah know they'll market it,
you'll get huge.

947
00:52:11.781 --> 00:52:15.290
And then they'll take the steroids out.
But the stuff's still has a reputation.

948
00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:18.110
So it's,
it's back.
You can still buy it.
Well,

949
00:52:18.111 --> 00:52:22.690
find out Jack Three d basically changed the,
uh,
maybe they changed the,

950
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.410
the 100 mil or something like that,
who just Google Jack Three d deaths mean.

951
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.660
So I might have to apologize if I'm wrong.
Death armies.

952
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:35.270
He was wanting to death after using Jack Three d points to gap and regulation.

953
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:40.220
But it could also just be a guy that just died.
She,
that's the problem.

954
00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:44.810
It was like,
who the fuck knows what's killing these people?
You know you don't,

955
00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:44.830
I don't

956
00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:49.300
<v 3>know.
People die just jogging.
They do die.
They die with nothing in their system.</v>

957
00:52:49.301 --> 00:52:52.000
They die with just fucking salads room,
you know?

958
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:56.770
And if the guy had died and he would have died anyway and he just took Jack

959
00:52:56.771 --> 00:52:57.610
Three d and died,

960
00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.550
you could blame the Jack Three d but I don't know a lot of Goddamn people

961
00:53:00.551 --> 00:53:04.750
tearing.
Remember red line.
It was like a drink.
I remember taking that.

962
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.880
Someone's like,
hey take this,
let make you feel great for your workout.

963
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:10.130
I thought my chest was going to blow out of my fucking heart.
I like,

964
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:12.040
I thought that I'd never done cocaine,

965
00:53:12.041 --> 00:53:13.600
but I feel like that's what cocaine feels like.

966
00:53:13.601 --> 00:53:17.530
Like it was like [inaudible] and I had to rack off like four hours and I went

967
00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:20.740
home and he was still jacked up.
I never took it again.
It was terrifying.

968
00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:25.620
Well that stuff was also like many doses in a bottle.

969
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:26.040
Yeah.

970
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.370
<v 1>Like he'll drink like a quarter of the bottle,
but it's not a big bottle.</v>

971
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:32.730
It's not like a can of coke and you look at it,
you're like,
oh this is a serving,

972
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:33.660
but you don't read that.

973
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.860
Who the fuck reads labels like those look like this shit in the back.

974
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:39.240
Like the little tiny I can,

975
00:53:39.241 --> 00:53:43.380
first of all I'm 47 my I suck unless I put reading glasses on.

976
00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:47.070
I can't read that.
So these little things I could have to go,
okay,

977
00:53:47.071 --> 00:53:51.750
how many t four four servings says three ounces of liquid.

978
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:55.680
How's this four servings dividing this with team,
that pint of Ben and Jerry's,

979
00:53:55.681 --> 00:53:57.080
they tell you that's four servings to,

980
00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.580
but it doesn't need the whole God damned pint of Ben and Jerry's.

981
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:02.940
That's where tick.
But that's like how they get away with like,

982
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.230
you know when you look at a bag of chips and tells you how many calories or is

983
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.090
per serving only 183 checks.

984
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:11.760
But it's,

985
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.760
it's interesting how the supplement industry when it comes to bodybuilding and

986
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:22.101
when it becomes to any athletic training has really benefited from all these,

987
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:23.310
you know,

988
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:26.880
these different like regulations to get past where new things become illegal.

989
00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:30.150
So they come up with some new thing to kind of like fill in the blanks.

990
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:35.460
It's I one of those guys that did always,
uh,

991
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.330
I've never taken very many supplements because I've never made hardly any money

992
00:54:39.331 --> 00:54:39.931
from doing it.

993
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:43.200
And I figured if I was making some money I would definitely take every

994
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:45.180
supplement on the market because it was worth it.

995
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:49.140
But it was never very good and they weren't probably made more than $200 or

996
00:54:49.141 --> 00:54:53.100
something.
So I,
I,
for me it just,
it wasn't worth it.
Making money from fighting.

997
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.750
Yeah,
make money from fighting.
It just was,

998
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.760
might as well just go in there and see how you do.
So percent natural.

999
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:02.430
Talk about the what,
what's going on right now with MMA,

1000
00:55:02.431 --> 00:55:06.900
with the testing because I think it's pretty fascinating that this is a sport

1001
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:09.960
where to be completely and totally honest,

1002
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:14.820
most likely a giant percentage of the population of the people involved in the

1003
00:55:14.821 --> 00:55:17.880
sport.
We're taking some sort of performance enhancing drugs.

1004
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.820
It seems like to get through a training camp,

1005
00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:22.800
and if you're not familiar with MMA,

1006
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.850
one of the crazy things about the sport is that it involves so many different

1007
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:30.420
disciplines.
You have to learn how to wrestle,
you have to learn submissions,

1008
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:34.500
meaning you know,
joint locks and chokes.
You have to learn how to kickbox.

1009
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.590
You have to learn all these things and you have to put them all together and you

1010
00:55:37.591 --> 00:55:39.690
also have to do a strength and conditioning program.

1011
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.990
So unlike boxing where you're learning how to box and then you're probably doing

1012
00:55:43.991 --> 00:55:46.950
a little roadwork on top of that,
but that's mostly it.

1013
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.610
It means some guys engage in some calisthenic programs.

1014
00:55:50.611 --> 00:55:54.930
Manny Pacquiao is like his famous ab routine.
He could see him do a call.

1015
00:55:54.931 --> 00:55:57.570
The lab actually does.
Palati switch is kind of interesting,

1016
00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.850
but they don't have to grapple.

1017
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:04.290
So for them what's important is just honing those hand skills recovering and

1018
00:56:04.291 --> 00:56:07.050
coming back and honing those skills.
It's really,
it's,

1019
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:11.160
it's counter productive for them to go through the same kind of workouts that

1020
00:56:11.161 --> 00:56:13.890
the MMA guys do.
But for MMA guys,

1021
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:19.070
this fucking grind of getting up in the morning every day and doing this for six

1022
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:20.640
to eight weeks for a camp,

1023
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.040
it's almost impossible to do at the highest levels without

1024
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.150
<v 3>some kind of help.</v>

1025
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:29.980
And now the UFC has incorporated this rigorous,

1026
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:35.370
incredibly intense testing where they're doing randoms five times a year on

1027
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:40.270
people.
So guys like Conor Mcgregor,
Liotta or anybody,

1028
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:42.640
they're just going to get tested.
They're going to show up at your house.

1029
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:45.970
And if you have to,
if you're in camp,
this is what's really fucked up to me.

1030
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.970
Say if you've got to work out at 10 o'clock in the morning and you,
you know,

1031
00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:51.790
you need your sleep,
you went to bed at 10 you know,
you're,

1032
00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:54.610
you're looking to get 10 11 hour sleep and they wake you up,

1033
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.350
they'll wake you up at five six o'clock in the morning,

1034
00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:00.610
pee in this Cup right now,
and you have to,
and the,
and they wake you up,

1035
00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:02.860
they fuck with your sleep and you know,
yeah,

1036
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:04.000
they're only going to do it that one day.

1037
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.510
But you might go to the gym that one day and be tired because of that.

1038
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:10.780
And that might be the time you get injured.
It's totally possible.

1039
00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:12.250
It's totally unprofessional.

1040
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.010
It doesn't make any sense to me that they're allowed to just wake you up.

1041
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:15.850
They should.

1042
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:20.710
They should have to do it in an an off time and a time where you absolutely are

1043
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:24.400
not going to be getting your rest.
Like you should have parameters.
Like she said,

1044
00:57:24.401 --> 00:57:26.980
listen,
I go to bed at 11:00 PM every night.

1045
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:31.981
I wake up at 9:30 AM and when those times leave me the fuck alone cause I got to

1046
00:57:32.711 --> 00:57:35.890
recover.
God,
goddammit.
You know,
but they don't,
they don't do it that way.

1047
00:57:35.891 --> 00:57:37.940
They just come anytime they want and they you have to

1048
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.550
<v 0>pull out your deck and in a cup and that's it.</v>

1049
00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:43.370
There's watch you two guy has to watch a Jake.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1050
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:44.510
Cause you could have a rubber dick.

1051
00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:49.460
Kevin Randleman got busted with a wizard Nader.

1052
00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.960
Well Kevin Randomly got busted with non human urine from w well from the wisdom

1053
00:57:53.961 --> 00:57:57.200
of the horse you're on or something.
But guys will do everything that cheat.

1054
00:57:57.201 --> 00:58:00.800
If you're not looking at their deck like you can rub like like a paste on your

1055
00:58:00.801 --> 00:58:02.540
thumb and like let your stream run through.

1056
00:58:02.541 --> 00:58:06.560
It wasn't either as or the in this area deck,

1057
00:58:06.561 --> 00:58:09.470
he's got to look at it and you're like the piece coming out of that deck and the

1058
00:58:09.471 --> 00:58:14.471
paste was somehow another diffuse diffuse would go through your finger and the

1059
00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:19.130
paste whatever the ingredients where it would diffuse the sample or a tainted or

1060
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:23.030
I think it's a good thing to find out what everyone's taking.

1061
00:58:23.031 --> 00:58:25.580
I think it's also a good thing to try to figure out what,

1062
00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:28.650
<v 3>what is possible for the human body.
Like what,</v>

1063
00:58:28.651 --> 00:58:32.000
what kind of condition can you actually get in without help?

1064
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:37.390
I mean and if we are really dealing with a sport where 70% let's say 70 Vito

1065
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.400
says is like 90 maybe he's right.

1066
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:45.580
<v 0>I would say have used at some point it's 90 I'm using right now.</v>

1067
00:58:45.621 --> 00:58:48.800
I have no idea.
But at some point in their career we're using,
yeah,

1068
00:58:48.801 --> 00:58:53.090
it's 90 do you think that's the case at other sports?
I have no idea.

1069
00:58:53.091 --> 00:58:54.680
I know a fair amount of what mixed martial arts,

1070
00:58:54.681 --> 00:58:58.520
but like I wouldn't know which end of a tennis racket.
The hold I,
I don't know.

1071
00:58:58.521 --> 00:59:00.940
Although Chris,
Chris and I spent a yes,

1072
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:06.010
the good part of yesterday with two of the two senior guys from Usada and for

1073
00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.650
hours.
They talked about everything that they've gone through since ever since.

1074
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.970
And U S anti-doping associate,
that's the,
that's the group that uh,

1075
00:59:13.971 --> 00:59:18.440
the UFC has contracted with to do all the testing.
And when we look at it,

1076
00:59:18.441 --> 00:59:21.290
it does seem completely onerous,
but from their point view,

1077
00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:22.700
they've been in a decades

1078
00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:27.620
<v 1>long battle to against people,
particularly in well in a lot of sports,</v>

1079
00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:32.621
including maybe most notably cycling where they told us a story yesterday about

1080
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:35.870
one of their testers and they found this out later years,

1081
00:59:35.871 --> 00:59:39.110
years later in deposition,
one of their testers shows up at the hotel.

1082
00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:41.750
Somebody is waiting in the lobby and cell phones up.

1083
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:43.610
That guy is on his way up right now.

1084
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:48.890
The athletes sprints to the doctor's room and the doctor grabbed an IV bag and

1085
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:52.580
squeezed it and forced it into him and then put another one in and squeezed it,

1086
00:59:52.581 --> 00:59:55.820
enforced it,
and there was enough extra liquid in his body from that.

1087
00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:59.240
So as levels were a little kind of weird,
but they didn't go over any threshold.

1088
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.200
And that's the kind of shenanigans that,
that they've been fighting against.

1089
01:00:03.201 --> 01:00:04.700
And I think that's the origin of that stuff.

1090
01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:09.170
Like we're going to show up at 3:00 AM and we don't really care about you in MMA

1091
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:13.340
to it.
It does seem completely unnecessary,
but from their point of view,

1092
01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:17.150
with this decades of of Toronto fight dirty cyclists and things,
they,

1093
01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:20.600
they feel like that's the corner that they're,
they're forced into.

1094
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:24.590
We'll cycling is the dirty sport.
It's the dirtiest,
I think.
Right?

1095
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:27.920
It's one of the dirtiest.
That's why I saw something in the dance.

1096
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:30.170
Some guy who was winning the Tour de France and I just started laughing.

1097
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.720
I'm like,
what's he doing?
Is He doing,
what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1098
01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:35.970
Do it while you're lying.
Who Cares?
They're riding the fucking bike.
I,

1099
01:00:35.971 --> 01:00:36.920
they ain't trying to hurt anybody.

1100
01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:40.190
Let them all do steroids and just see who wins.
And when you can't,

1101
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.060
you can't do that because then the idea is that kids coming up are forced to

1102
01:00:44.061 --> 01:00:47.330
take performance enhancing drugs cause otherwise there's no way to win that

1103
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:48.830
sport.
It's a fake sport.

1104
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:53.630
It's a fake sport in that the results that you're seeing are not normal results.

1105
01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:57.050
They're superhuman results and they only come about because you take a guy and

1106
01:00:57.051 --> 01:00:58.220
you alters chemistry.

1107
01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:01.190
You alters chemistry to point where he's not a human anymore.

1108
01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:05.000
Like if you look at a bodybuilding,
yeah,
look at a body builder,
perfect example,

1109
01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:08.420
and you look at some fucking giant Dorian Yates type character,

1110
01:01:08.421 --> 01:01:13.421
just veins all over his eyeballs and his fucking faces ripped and he weighs 300

1111
01:01:14.961 --> 01:01:18.350
pounds and is five foot two.
It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
They're like,

1112
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:20.060
what is that?
It's not a human,

1113
01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.540
it's just not a humanities or levels that they have in their body or not human

1114
01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:27.050
levels.
There's,
this is a new thing.
You've created a new thing with chemistry.

1115
01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:27.920
Yeah guys.
Of Guys,

1116
01:01:27.921 --> 01:01:32.510
you know those body builders will put on 70 pounds of muscle and as anybody

1117
01:01:32.511 --> 01:01:34.980
knows who trains putting on seven pounds of muscle is,

1118
01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.440
it takes years to put on,

1119
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:42.620
you can put on 10 pounds of muscle in six months if you are fucking really

1120
01:01:42.621 --> 01:01:47.180
diligent and you got to push through really hard sore days,

1121
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:50.990
you got to do a lot of dead lifting.
You got to do a lot of squats,

1122
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.870
you got to eat a lot of fucking meat and you gotta you gotta.

1123
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.090
You gotta really work at it,
but you can do it.
You could put on,

1124
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:57.710
most people don't work out that hard,

1125
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:59.870
but if you get a guy on the juice you can put on,

1126
01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:03.620
I was on this stuff called Mag 10 you should be able to buy it at GNC.

1127
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:07.340
You remember this?
Oh,
you're selling these pills.
These are cell GNC.

1128
01:02:07.341 --> 01:02:10.670
They're like clear pills.
You take like 10 of them.
It's like some crazy number.

1129
01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:15.770
I put on 10 pounds of muscle in like seven weeks.
She says,
I'm not even kidding.

1130
01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.950
It was legal is a strong as shit I've ever taken.
And when I got off of it,

1131
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.580
<v 3>my Dick died like a sniper.</v>

1132
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.470
My Dick was useless.
My Dick was useless for like a month.

1133
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:31.890
It just wouldn't work.
And I was like,
wow,
that's,
that's a steroid.

1134
01:02:31.891 --> 01:02:32.910
That's a real steroid.

1135
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:35.520
And it was one of those things that you could just buy for a little bit.

1136
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:38.220
It was like the little window,
you could buy it and then it went away.

1137
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:39.031
But I'm telling you,

1138
01:02:39.031 --> 01:02:41.520
I never got bigger in my life off of anything other than this stuff.

1139
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:43.380
And I felt so strong.

1140
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.280
I would go to the gym and like one day I'd be able to get 10 reps and then I

1141
01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:51.090
would my next workout,
four days later it was 12 reps didn't make any sense.

1142
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.760
I'm getting an extra two reps in in three or four days.

1143
01:02:53.761 --> 01:02:56.520
Like that doesn't make any sense.
But you would just recover.

1144
01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:00.810
And then I would think about what is it like to take like Anna draw 50 or some

1145
01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:04.920
of the really crazy ones that they say turn you into like a wild silver back

1146
01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:07.560
gorilla and then stack them,
right?
Yeah.
Those guys,

1147
01:03:07.561 --> 01:03:09.200
they would take him like I remember a,

1148
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:12.070
I knew the student was a football player who told me that they would take an

1149
01:03:12.071 --> 01:03:15.450
Adderall 15 and we take all this different stuff and uh oh no,
no,
no.

1150
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:18.270
This is a different guy.
He's a bodybuilder.
He told me he was a,

1151
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:22.380
became a Jujitsu guy,
became a black belt under John Jacques Machado.
Great Guy.

1152
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:26.940
And he told me that when he was bodybuilding and he took the Ana draw 50 stuff.

1153
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:32.150
He said literally he would see red and then wake up grabbing someone about to

1154
01:03:33.481 --> 01:03:34.140
kill them.

1155
01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:38.160
Like he would like some guy said something to intro him in traffic and before he

1156
01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:41.560
knew what he was out of the car reaching into the guy's car,
ready to kill him.

1157
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.880
He was like,
what the fuck am I doing?
I don't want to go to jail.

1158
01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:46.190
I don't want to kill anybody.

1159
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:51.830
But it was this overwhelming rage for almost nothing.

1160
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:55.140
It just turns you into like an animal.
Like it sets you back.

1161
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:56.670
Like you're strong as a Gerler and he,

1162
01:03:56.850 --> 01:04:01.230
you lose that like cumin parties fucking little thing.
Not really a person.

1163
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.930
You're some,
you're like you mostly person,

1164
01:04:03.931 --> 01:04:08.160
but you've got some other element in you and the Ana draw 50 stuff is
apparently,

1165
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:09.270
I don't know if it still is,

1166
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:11.580
but that was like the stuff that people would talk about.

1167
01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.850
Like if you fuck with that,
like that is that,
that's the ranger,

1168
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:20.030
that's the ranger and that's the stuff that puts 30 40 pounds of just stacked

1169
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.740
shredded beef on you.
Just

1170
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.280
all those dudes that would do squats and drop the bar and walkaway.

1171
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:31.980
Barely human.
Barely human.
Okay.

1172
01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:36.350
<v 0>Guy At my gym in the,
this is going back probably early eighties doing karate.</v>

1173
01:04:36.351 --> 01:04:40.010
Nice guy from a couple towns over a move to la.

1174
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.450
Started bodybuilding,
got a girlfriend,
got pissed off at her,

1175
01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:48.380
got a bat,
broke her window and she shot him dead and he was not,

1176
01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.800
he was not a violent guy.
He never been convicted with,

1177
01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:53.300
never been arrested for any crimes,
didn't do anything bad.

1178
01:04:53.301 --> 01:04:56.030
I really do pin that on him.

1179
01:04:56.031 --> 01:04:59.960
Just sticking every steroid he could possibly find in his ass until his brain

1180
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:02.960
blew up and then his girlfriend literally shot him dead.
Well,

1181
01:05:02.961 --> 01:05:04.760
there's a dude that I knew that died.

1182
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:08.180
His name was Curtis and he was vittores original strength and conditioning

1183
01:05:08.181 --> 01:05:09.014
trainer

1184
01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:12.720
<v 3>back in 97 when Vito was 19 years old.</v>

1185
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.740
Remember when Vito first in the UFC?
Vito weighed about 200 plus pounds,

1186
01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:21.520
like two two oh three maybe maximum.
He was a real lean,

1187
01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:24.340
but muscular is hell and fast as lightning.

1188
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:28.660
When Vito first stormed on the scene would never seen hand speed like that with

1189
01:05:28.661 --> 01:05:31.300
good wrestling and Jujitsu too.
I mean he just,

1190
01:05:31.301 --> 01:05:34.870
Trey telling men had no idea what was coming.
He came out guns blazing.

1191
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.930
That guy that was training and we would like Eddie Bravo and I,

1192
01:05:37.931 --> 01:05:41.650
we used to call him garden hoses because the guy had veins that were like garden

1193
01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:45.070
hoses.
They didn't make any sense.
He had these arms that were like,

1194
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:47.680
I'm not bullshitting.
Five of my arms,

1195
01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:52.120
like maybe five moms rolled up at a cord.
I mean there were enormous,

1196
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:55.630
but he had veins throughout his arms that were like hoses.

1197
01:05:55.630 --> 01:06:00.190
He's she huge fucking veins and he was purple.
He would lift legs.
Ooh,

1198
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:03.020
Julette tricep extensions.
And it would be purple.

1199
01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:05.680
Just fucking,

1200
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:09.520
the whole thing's about the blow in one day it did and one day it's just blue

1201
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.690
pop,
boom.
The whole thing just,

1202
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:16.450
just left him bleeding internally and just the whole thing exploded.

1203
01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.880
Harder brain,
it's a pot,
the whole fucking

1204
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:22.510
catastrophic failure of everything.

1205
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:25.930
And he was in his thirties he was a young guy,
you know,

1206
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:31.060
and that was when Vituro got up to like two 40 when he fought Randy couture.

1207
01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.270
Remember that?
I mean he got just shy like a lion.

1208
01:06:34.271 --> 01:06:35.680
He didn't even look at a person anymore.

1209
01:06:35.681 --> 01:06:39.760
His head looked like it was attached at the top with a neck.

1210
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:43.990
Like his top of his head was where his next start and it just came down and he

1211
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:48.991
just had no gas is gas tank was for about maybe 30 or 40 seconds of flooring.

1212
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.060
And then it would like quickly drop off.

1213
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.030
Was that the fight that ended in like a minute with a cut on the,

1214
01:06:55.031 --> 01:06:56.380
I know that was in,

1215
01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:00.130
that was for the light heavyweight title and that was in the two thousands.

1216
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:03.370
This was way before that,
I want to say 97 or 98.

1217
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:08.400
And I was there for that fight and a Vituro was like 240 pounds.

1218
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:09.690
That was when,
uh,

1219
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.150
everybody thought he was gonna kill Randy and Randy just beat him down,

1220
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:16.150
took him down and smashed them,
mashed him,
changed his life.

1221
01:07:16.151 --> 01:07:20.020
Like if Itar before then was this unstoppable force who had destroyed tank

1222
01:07:20.021 --> 01:07:23.410
Abbott destroyed tellig men and Scott for Roseau.
And everybody was like,

1223
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:26.710
Vito is the fucking,
like people were talking about VR versus Hixon.

1224
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.650
There's all this like this crazy talk back then,
you know.

1225
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:34.060
And then Vito had like that downward spiral that he went on for a little bit.

1226
01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:37.510
Whereas his sister got kidnapped and all that stuff happened after that,

1227
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:41.050
I found her right.
She died and she was killed.
Unfortunate,
horrible,

1228
01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:44.020
horrible story.
Um,
but uh,

1229
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:48.910
but the point being that like performance enhancing drugs there then it's not

1230
01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:52.270
all fun games.
Scary Shit,
scary shit.

1231
01:07:52.271 --> 01:07:55.780
And when you force your body to do something totally unnatural like that,

1232
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:59.650
like the,
the rapid change of putting on 30,

1233
01:07:59.651 --> 01:08:04.570
40 pounds in literally six to eight weeks like that is not good for,

1234
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:08.230
is not good for you though.
So we got to stop that.
Right.

1235
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:13.000
But the dialogue is like what,
what should be legal?

1236
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:15.410
It should it be legal to take creatine cause that helps.

1237
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:17.810
Should it be legal to take amino acids because they help.

1238
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:20.120
She'd be allowed to take volt multivitamins.

1239
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:24.020
Should you have to get all your vitamins from food?
You know,
where does it end?

1240
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:28.230
<v 0>One of the ones that,
uh,
in that regard that I've been puzzling about for,</v>

1241
01:08:28.231 --> 01:08:31.700
for several years now is a Nick Diaz heads.
He's,

1242
01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:36.320
he's used to cut a lot over the eyes and there's a surgeon in Vegas that will

1243
01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:40.130
cut your eyes open and a grind down your eye orbits.

1244
01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:44.660
So they become less sharp.
I Dunno.
Is that cheating?
I mean,

1245
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:49.690
he's doing surgery to change his body so he can be a more efficient fighter that

1246
01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.150
it's kind of defensive.
He's just trying not to get cut.
But

1247
01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:55.700
I dunno,
it,

1248
01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:58.220
it had been thinking about it for years and I don't know what the answer is.

1249
01:08:58.310 --> 01:08:58.941
<v 3>See that one,</v>

1250
01:08:58.941 --> 01:09:02.330
I don't have any problem with it all because he was born with just a weird

1251
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:05.330
eyebrow.
And also,
uh,
on top of that,

1252
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:07.430
he had so much scar tissue from all these fights.

1253
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:11.000
So it wasn't just a matter of the bone was cutting his,

1254
01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:12.170
it was also a matter of like,

1255
01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:15.200
he had to get that scar tissue removed cause it would just burst,
you know,

1256
01:09:15.201 --> 01:09:18.350
scar tissue.
If you don't know when you have scar tissue around your eye,

1257
01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:22.610
when something heals up,
it's measurably weaker than it was before that.

1258
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.040
But now they have new methods of dealing with that.

1259
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:29.240
Like Vandelay like before Vandelia got his surgery,
his eyes,

1260
01:09:29.241 --> 01:09:32.720
he would just get hit once and it would swell up and it would like come down and

1261
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:35.060
almost closes I and then would cut open and start bleeding.

1262
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:38.150
And if you looked at them back then before he had his surgery,

1263
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.280
his eyes were just a mass of scar tissue like all around his eyebrows.

1264
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:46.430
So it makes everything thicker because you've got all these cuts,

1265
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:49.670
the heel and there's a not and another one that healed and there's a knot and

1266
01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:50.870
all of his time is happening.

1267
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:55.250
Your eyelids are relaxing also from getting hit a lot cause the muscles get

1268
01:09:55.251 --> 01:09:58.670
pulverized and it starts drooping down over your eye.

1269
01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:03.320
So some guys get surgery to sort of raise their eyelids back up and put them in

1270
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:05.780
place so they could see better cause you,
you,
you,

1271
01:10:05.781 --> 01:10:09.530
when you are fighting for a long period of time as the Pooka look like you

1272
01:10:09.531 --> 01:10:10.580
always see it in cartoons.

1273
01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:13.670
They get that thing will get you what bullish they'll go,

1274
01:10:13.671 --> 01:10:17.870
nothings brained in that thing where they would get with the eyebrows would drop

1275
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:21.090
down.
That that impedes your vision slowly.

1276
01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:25.010
A lot of guys also don't realize that Scott inside of your body takes a lot

1277
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:26.480
longer to heal than the outside.

1278
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:30.140
So guys would get cut in the gym and like three days it looks like it's healed,

1279
01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:34.160
but it's really still damaged inside go.
They're like,
oh,
it's not an open wound.

1280
01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:37.430
I can go back to sparring and they get hit again and it cuts open again.

1281
01:10:37.431 --> 01:10:41.420
It takes a long time for that stuff to heal internally and it becomes chronic.

1282
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:42.230
Yeah.

1283
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.290
<v 0>One thing I wanted to throw in,
because there's a,
a huge audience here,</v>

1284
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:49.040
and I know it was a fact,
a lot of them are fighters is when you do get cut,

1285
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:53.990
don't let like the EMT or somebody just throw three quick stitches in there,

1286
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:57.560
get that cut done by a,
uh,
get it,
get it done by a plastic surgeon.

1287
01:10:57.561 --> 01:11:01.340
It makes a huge difference.
Although that scar tissue comes from people letting,

1288
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.000
I've actually seen EMT is just,
I know how to do that and they'll,

1289
01:11:05.001 --> 01:11:08.420
they'll put three stitches in and not very nicely.
So guys,

1290
01:11:08.421 --> 01:11:11.340
when you get a really bad cut in a fight,
go,
go find a plastic surgeon.
It's,

1291
01:11:11.341 --> 01:11:12.174
it's worth it.
Yeah.

1292
01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.370
<v 4>Well Kevin Ross,
he fought in lion fight.</v>

1293
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.830
He was actually putting pictures on his Instagram.

1294
01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:19.770
But what a shitty job the doctor had done.
They stapled him,

1295
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.930
the staple went in the cut like instead of skin skin,
the staple.

1296
01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:27.180
This guy was fucking blind.
Some old doctor,

1297
01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:32.181
something stapled literally inside the cut instead of on the skin itself around

1298
01:11:32.881 --> 01:11:36.480
the cut to pull the cut together.
This fucking idiot stapled the cut.

1299
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:38.880
And now a lot of times they just try to use glue.

1300
01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:42.980
I cut myself in the winner from a fucking icicle cause I live in New England.

1301
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:44.850
It fell in my circle.
Cut You.
Yeah,

1302
01:11:44.851 --> 01:11:48.000
my fucking dad wanted me to shovel his roof off cause like they get water,

1303
01:11:48.001 --> 01:11:49.230
dams that damage.

1304
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.550
So we're just pushing the lather up and he bangs nice sickle and I just look up

1305
01:11:53.551 --> 01:11:55.110
and fucking smashing me in the head.

1306
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:58.080
I turned around and scream and then I look at it and he was like,

1307
01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.330
you're fucking bleeding.
I'm like,
what do you mean?
That grabbed my head,

1308
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.440
fucking blood pouring down my face everywhere.
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

1309
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.290
So I go to the bathroom,
like put my hand on it,

1310
01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:09.950
go to the bathroom and there's a good cut.
I see a lot of cuts in the gym,

1311
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.260
something like that.
Thick fucking needs stitches.
I'm like,
Dad,
I got to go.

1312
01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:14.490
I need tickets.
He's like,
no,

1313
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:17.120
put the bandaid on it and finished my roof and then you can go into the yard.

1314
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.540
So the panty though.
Wow.
I climb up that roof shoveled the roof,

1315
01:12:21.541 --> 01:12:24.720
goes to the ER and they want to put glue in it and I'm like,

1316
01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:28.260
I see a lot of the stitches like can you put such as in my head it's like,

1317
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.860
I think we can get away with just glue.
I'm like,
get away.

1318
01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:34.500
I box like I don't want it to,
I want it to be really well closed.
He's like,
no,

1319
01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:37.590
I'm just going to put glue in it like can you please ditch it is like,

1320
01:12:37.591 --> 01:12:38.610
who's the doctor here?

1321
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:42.810
And he just put glue in my head and it's still a big scar there and it's just

1322
01:12:42.811 --> 01:12:45.720
not as,
I don't think it's as healer.
It would've been if he gets his name.

1323
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:50.700
What's his name is?
Fuck,
I don't know.
Wow.
He's an arrogant Brockton hospital.

1324
01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:52.200
So Brockton,

1325
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:57.201
blockbuster and the part of the Marvin Hagler part of the story that Chris isn't

1326
01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:57.841
telling you,

1327
01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:01.620
is it like any good person from Lowe's and haven't made the minute he got a head

1328
01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:04.380
cut and he was bleeding all over the place.
He did a selfie.
Oh yeah.

1329
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:07.530
When you're walking in a little gun,
guys in the jail of Famer,

1330
01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.630
he gets cut.
I'll be like,
don't wipe it off.
Don't touch it yet.

1331
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.750
We've gotta take a picture first and then we like address the wound and stuff.

1332
01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:19.980
Why?
I don't know.
It's kind of like our wall of fame almost put a Polaroid up.

1333
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:23.780
You got to move into your Massachusetts south shore to get out.

1334
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:27.270
There are too many animals there.
It's just a fun environment.

1335
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.940
Joe Even said it and then any of you this week for his fight,
he goes,

1336
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.050
we're a bunch of pricks in my gym and it says we're all from the northeast.

1337
01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:34.080
They're all pricks.
Well,

1338
01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:37.110
I went to your gym and long time ago and he did a seminar.
Old Jim.
Yeah,

1339
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:41.100
I remember me back in the day.
We actually,
uh,
we still have the toenail clippers.

1340
01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:43.500
We used it and we call them the Joe Rogan toenail clippers.

1341
01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:47.310
I don't think anyone uses them because they're like dull as shit now,
but like,

1342
01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.100
oh,
they're still sitting in a desk somewhere.
That's hilarious.

1343
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:54.840
Why we were talking about this before.
Like anybody who doesn't clip their nails,

1344
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:58.080
their,
their fingernails and toenails before they grappled,
that fucking sucks.

1345
01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.880
They scratch the shit out.
It's terrible.

1346
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:03.340
You're talking about nick to tooth scratching your neck out for listening.

1347
01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:07.990
[inaudible] cut your fucking nails.
Do I carry a toenail clipper everywhere?
If I,

1348
01:14:07.991 --> 01:14:11.260
you know,
if I have a bag,
I'm going to work out.
Plus also to make a fist,

1349
01:14:11.261 --> 01:14:14.530
even though like a punch
the bag and into your,
your,

1350
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:18.160
your fingernails digging into your fucking the meat of your hand.

1351
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:19.390
Every people don't,

1352
01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:22.360
people don't cut their fingernails and don't take showers before they roll or

1353
01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:26.140
just bad evil people.
Some people when you a,
when they fight,

1354
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:28.540
they do it on purpose.
You could tell they fucking stink.

1355
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:30.880
Some people stink when I interview him.

1356
01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.810
<v 5>Ooh,</v>

1357
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:36.340
<v 4>you know they're doing it on purpose.
Lynn Lynn told me,
does it on purpose?</v>

1358
01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:38.950
No showers for like five days and no,

1359
01:14:38.951 --> 01:14:41.650
don't brush your teeth and just take your arm pit.

1360
01:14:41.651 --> 01:14:44.810
They call Tawanna filthy because he's filthy like it's not,

1361
01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:46.270
it's not like a cute nickname.

1362
01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:51.250
He's fucking filthy all the time and just like eat food off the ground and not

1363
01:14:51.251 --> 01:14:54.800
shower.
You just be gross.
And that guy sweat like a motherfucker.

1364
01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:58.450
So like he's always nasty.
Think about his knockout that was craze.
Awesome.

1365
01:14:58.451 --> 01:15:01.160
I was in the corner for that fight and I'm like watching it from the corner.

1366
01:15:01.190 --> 01:15:02.980
I'm like,
shit,
he's getting beat up pretty bad.

1367
01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:07.981
That motherfucker big flat two or five are way bigger and just sitting there

1368
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:11.650
like,
ah,
this is not going right away.
And uh,
the round ends,

1369
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:16.090
we go in there and John would,
this sneaky guy,
he's talking to him,
he's like,

1370
01:15:16.091 --> 01:15:18.370
you know,
you doing all right.
You're doing all right.
Just stay in it.

1371
01:15:18.371 --> 01:15:23.320
And then the ticket around starts and he gets him with a hook like from hell,

1372
01:15:23.321 --> 01:15:23.981
like the best hook.

1373
01:15:23.981 --> 01:15:27.070
You get every headache guy walk through a few and miss before that he was

1374
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:31.120
rounding to like 10.
No,
that round,
like right before he knocked him out.

1375
01:15:31.121 --> 01:15:35.140
It wasn't like Verlanti shouldn't have seen it common like he was throwing a lot

1376
01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:37.540
of hooks,
but Valencia was convinced he was going to steam roll.

1377
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:40.870
He was running forward hard.
He ran right into it and ran into it.

1378
01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:42.790
I mean it was the perfect right hook.

1379
01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:46.830
It was picture perfect on the button and that he kids strong and he hits fucking

1380
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:50.710
hard a wrestler.
But no Tom too.
Oh Tom,

1381
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:54.310
physically one of the strongest guys have ever been on the mat with most

1382
01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:57.040
wrestlers are always strong.
You grow up wrestling,

1383
01:15:57.041 --> 01:16:00.550
he grew up throwing bodies around and manipulating bodies to develop a strength.

1384
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:04.510
It's very unusual like Ben Aspirin,
you look at their Guidon look strong.

1385
01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.900
He looks like a regular guy but you talk to people roll with them.

1386
01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:10.030
They're like Jesus fucking Christ as he strong.
Yeah.

1387
01:16:10.031 --> 01:16:13.090
I read an interview with Pettis and Pettis City just tortures him on the mat

1388
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.490
straight away with them.

1389
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.280
Different kinds of strength and they've been throwing buys around cause they

1390
01:16:18.281 --> 01:16:21.610
were four years old when wrestling's grueling.

1391
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:25.000
I've gotten a wrestling practices it like just like like a d three college

1392
01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:30.001
program and the grueling practices for hour and a half shoot across the mat for

1393
01:16:30.041 --> 01:16:32.000
20 minutes and drill.
It's,

1394
01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:36.460
they just build functional muscle for years and that sport,

1395
01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:41.670
I found a a a guy at a Iowa who did his phd on the changes in wrestling rules

1396
01:16:42.011 --> 01:16:45.450
over a maybe a 50 year period or something.
Red.

1397
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.630
Red is just thesis and it was interesting and you can see they call them

1398
01:16:49.631 --> 01:16:52.060
concession holds and that submissions but it's the exact same thing.

1399
01:16:52.061 --> 01:16:54.640
You could see year by year,
decade by decade,
they,

1400
01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.330
they took out every dangerous hold from wrestling.

1401
01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:04.020
But curiously are interestingly by taking out every dangerous hold,

1402
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.980
it actually made wrestling better because it's the one part of combat sports you

1403
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.980
can do as hard

1404
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.130
<v 0>as you want and nothing gets broken.
You can't do Moitai.</v>

1405
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:16.300
You can't box 100% all the time.
You sure camp uh,

1406
01:17:16.301 --> 01:17:20.720
puts a and enroll on the dig into Jiu Jitsu when people 100% but by virtue of

1407
01:17:20.721 --> 01:17:22.940
having taken all the concession holds that a wrestling,

1408
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:27.590
you can wrestle a guy just as hard as you want and nobody has to go to the

1409
01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:30.590
hospital.
And I think that's,
that's what that,

1410
01:17:30.591 --> 01:17:32.900
that's what makes wrestling so phenomenal as you,

1411
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:36.620
some of these guys start when they're eight years old and they'd go as hard as

1412
01:17:36.621 --> 01:17:40.040
they humanly can for 20 years and they're,
they're monsters.

1413
01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.560
<v 3>Also the mental toughness.</v>

1414
01:17:41.561 --> 01:17:45.250
And they developed as a mental toughness that wrestlers possess because also

1415
01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:48.910
they're usually dehydrated.
They're cutting weight,
they're irritated,

1416
01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.370
almost always overtrained almost always.

1417
01:17:51.371 --> 01:17:54.850
So he developed this ability to push through discomfort that a lot of people

1418
01:17:54.851 --> 01:17:58.990
just don't have.
You know,
Jujitsu,
you can go full blast,
but you have to tab.

1419
01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.290
And if guys don't tap,
that's when problems occur.

1420
01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.280
But you can certainly go full blast up until the moment when you have to
concede.

1421
01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.510
But you know,

1422
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:10.360
a lot of people don't like to concede and that's where the problem comes in.

1423
01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.950
This is one of the dumbest things people don't mind if someone scores a in them.

1424
01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:17.710
In basketball it seems normal.
But if somebody taps you,

1425
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:22.120
it's like the end of your life because you're in a fight you would have lost.

1426
01:18:22.121 --> 01:18:24.580
But guess what,
as the only fucking way you learn,

1427
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.850
like you have to put yourself in positions where you,

1428
01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.080
you're going to tap and you got to deal with that tap.
And if you don't do it,

1429
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:33.430
you're never going to get good at it.

1430
01:18:33.431 --> 01:18:37.690
And we've all known so many guys that come from kickboxing that for whatever

1431
01:18:37.691 --> 01:18:41.440
reason they got really good at one sport and they never could get good at

1432
01:18:41.441 --> 01:18:43.810
Jujitsu because they didn't want to roll with people who could tap them.

1433
01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:49.150
<v 0>Hmm.
Yeah.
The,
the,
the,
I was like that,
you know,
I,</v>

1434
01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.620
I opened up an MMA gym and way before I knew one single thing about the sport in

1435
01:18:53.621 --> 01:18:58.600
[inaudible] 93 just a couple months after a UFC one and for years and years and

1436
01:18:58.601 --> 01:19:01.780
years,
I just didn't want to tap if some new guy came in,
if he was a blue belt,

1437
01:19:01.781 --> 01:19:03.400
that's when blue belts are kind of a big deal.

1438
01:19:03.610 --> 01:19:06.370
I would lose my mind at the fear that the guy might tap me.

1439
01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:10.150
And then I read an interview with Frank Shamrock and he goes,
oh,

1440
01:19:10.151 --> 01:19:13.900
I tap all the time.
And I was like,
oh,
oh frank shamrock tattoo.

1441
01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.080
Oh it's okay for me to tap.
And uh,
that,
that helped me a lot.

1442
01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:20.780
<v 3>You ever seen in Marcella Garcia and Damien Maia Role?
No.</v>

1443
01:19:20.781 --> 01:19:23.570
It's really interesting.
Really interesting cause it happened left and right.

1444
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:26.990
Sure.
Tap each other left and right and they,
they're not even going full clip.

1445
01:19:26.991 --> 01:19:29.750
There's sort of flowing.
They'll,
they're both so good.

1446
01:19:29.751 --> 01:19:31.510
They're both such world champions and they're not,

1447
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:34.430
they don't have any ego at the,
you know on the line there.

1448
01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:35.960
They just trying to train hard and

1449
01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:39.760
<v 0>get their work in.
Have you guys seen the clip of high end and Henzel rolling.</v>

1450
01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:43.840
Yeah,
it's my favorite role clip of all time on youtube in their brothers.

1451
01:19:43.841 --> 01:19:48.010
So there's kind of be that sibling rivalry and in the end Henzel catches him.

1452
01:19:48.011 --> 01:19:52.720
But I was actually talking the big John last night about the same thing and he's

1453
01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:55.510
like,
cause he has a gym up in Valencia,
which is pretty close to here.

1454
01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:58.000
And he's like,
when the guy comes into my gym for the first time,

1455
01:19:58.001 --> 01:19:59.950
they're a little like star struck,
but they're close.

1456
01:19:59.951 --> 01:20:03.240
They want to change it to and he rolls with them and he shakes hands and they

1457
01:20:03.241 --> 01:20:06.580
going to start and he taps him three times.
Is that cool?
You tap big John,

1458
01:20:06.581 --> 01:20:08.070
now let's some fun.
So they kind

1459
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.630
<v 4>of get over that like,
oh,
he lets them,
he rapped him.
Yeah,</v>

1460
01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:13.350
he just taps him on the show like taps out and quits before they even start.

1461
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.810
So they have that in their head.
All right.
I just tapped big John.
Cool.

1462
01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.640
Let's roll sound.
Let's finally break the pressure.
I guess that's stupid.

1463
01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:25.110
I might be stupid but just last night John.

1464
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:30.090
Oh Big John.
How dare you.
I think after that so guys can't go after him.

1465
01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.430
It's,
you know,
you get some guys a football player.
Yeah,

1466
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.370
he's good and he's strong as hell.
Yeah.
He's a giant man.
He has a big man,

1467
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.970
not medium.
John's very good.
He's not like this guy that like you say,

1468
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:44.520
oh we changed you Jitsu.
He trains like he's really good.

1469
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.060
Will you guys in Vegas for UFC one 89 I wasn't at.

1470
01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:51.560
My brother was actually in there.
I saw the photos you guys put on the Ugi.

1471
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:56.220
Put some good,
good photos.
We did.
Where are you guys getting your photos from?

1472
01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:59.520
Like when you have those photos on the front page where it says like MMA news,

1473
01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.320
like I'll click on it right now is a bunch of photos.

1474
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:04.590
Where are you getting those dolce exclusive on ivy ban.

1475
01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:08.120
Where are you getting that photo?
I'll be a screen shot from a screenshot.

1476
01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:11.700
From a video or Mike Dolce is a Facebook.
Oh,
we did.

1477
01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.580
We had a guy on the ground and get the journalists out there for that.

1478
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:19.420
We got some good interviews and stuff,
but yeah,
the jungle shrugger yeah,

1479
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:23.220
he goes every now and then.
He's an Irish guy.
He's like,
Hey,

1480
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.640
I want to do some videos for you guys and go to the shows and we're like,

1481
01:21:26.641 --> 01:21:29.610
we really can't afford that six fucking expensive to send the guy out and pull

1482
01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:34.080
them up.
He's like,
no,
I just want to go.
I'll just do it on my own dime.
Like cool.

1483
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.650
Go out there and have fun.
We get credentialed so he,
that's all he wants from us.

1484
01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:42.420
Really.
UFC one 89 was probably one of the craziest events ever been to ever.

1485
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.080
I believe it,
UFC one 89.

1486
01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:49.650
I wasn't there live.
I saw it on a,
on a big flat screen,

1487
01:21:49.651 --> 01:21:53.940
but it was one of those few times that I'm like,
ah.
It was the,
it was the,
uh,

1488
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:59.280
the Rory Robbie fight where I looked at the screen at one point and Rory looked

1489
01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.420
like he didn't have a nose.

1490
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:04.290
Like I'm looking on the high def screen and there was no no's there.

1491
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:08.010
And it was one of the very few times I've,
I've just been like,

1492
01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:11.430
I'm not sure I want to watch this.
And it was just too

1493
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:15.640
<v 3>intense.
That was one of the most intense title fights ever.</v>

1494
01:22:15.641 --> 01:22:19.150
Roy McDonald got you mean they got,

1495
01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:22.570
he got so close to winning that title.
He had Robbie Lawler almost knocked out.

1496
01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:23.830
He had kicked him,
Dinged Dumb,

1497
01:22:23.831 --> 01:22:27.520
Robbie was wobbling and then Robbie came back to stop them in the next round and

1498
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:32.590
his nose exploded and he literally went down in pain and you could see him

1499
01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:38.200
writhing on the floor and it looked like he was just trying to find some
comfort.

1500
01:22:38.201 --> 01:22:42.220
Like the pain was so intense when that broken knows that he was just trying to

1501
01:22:42.221 --> 01:22:44.230
find some kind of comfort.

1502
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:49.300
Blood was everywhere and it was just two guys that push themselves to the brink.

1503
01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:52.180
And unfortunately,
when you see a fight,
what does that,

1504
01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.260
can you go to the bathroom?
So what you're saying,
just ask.
All right,

1505
01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.090
go ahead and go to the bathroom.
Jesus Christ.
Dad,

1506
01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:03.280
guys drinking over here.
Chris Palm Courses.
The only one drinking here,

1507
01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:08.050
throwing down the booze,
checking his fucking Twitter every five minutes.
But uh,

1508
01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.430
the,
it was,

1509
01:23:09.431 --> 01:23:12.630
it was a sport or it was a fight rather with these like you see him here,

1510
01:23:12.631 --> 01:23:14.350
like writhing in agony like here,

1511
01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:19.940
like that is so hard to deal with.
I mean,
he's just looking at him,
he's like,
oh,

1512
01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:24.590
he just goes down.
I mean,
he's just in agony.

1513
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:28.010
I mean,
it's one of the most tense moments

1514
01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:33.690
I've ever seen a fight of.
Just like the most obvious expression of the,

1515
01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.410
of pain.
I mean,
look at him here.
It's crazy.

1516
01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:42.920
He might not ever be the same.
Yeah.
Neat.
By the way,
Robbie too.

1517
01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:46.520
That was a crazy fucking fight.
Rory said the next day.

1518
01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:49.880
That was the greatest day of his life.
Yeah,
I'm sure he gets what kind of,
uh,

1519
01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:54.290
that's the,
that's the man he is.
I mean,
he fought his heart out.

1520
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:58.130
There was nothing left for vault of them.
They were so closely matched,

1521
01:23:58.370 --> 01:24:01.400
such a good fight.
And Robbie,

1522
01:24:01.401 --> 01:24:06.401
how about when he's screaming in victory and his lip is split open like a cleft

1523
01:24:07.311 --> 01:24:11.960
palate is Lyft has split open this giant Gash in his lip.

1524
01:24:11.961 --> 01:24:12.770
Like look at them.

1525
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:17.770
There's a sideways photo where you see like a profile picture of him roaring

1526
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:22.100
with his lip split open and it's,
it's this hard to believe that this guy's,

1527
01:24:23.150 --> 01:24:26.320
you know,
that he fought like that.
He fought with his lip split wide.

1528
01:24:26.321 --> 01:24:28.250
If there's a better picture of a Jamie find it,

1529
01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:33.520
it's like a sideways angle of the side where you see the actual cut itself.

1530
01:24:33.831 --> 01:24:37.430
But it was one of the most gruesome lip injuries I've ever seen.
And you know,

1531
01:24:37.431 --> 01:24:42.350
it was the guy won that.
Those guys there is Dana.

1532
01:24:42.351 --> 01:24:45.980
Dana apparently walked up from that side right there and said,
oh my God,

1533
01:24:45.981 --> 01:24:48.850
don't talk.
Say Man.
Yeah.

1534
01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.020
I mean his lip was literally just a giant slice,

1535
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:57.830
like you get hit with a hatchet in the face.
It was crazy.
It was a crazy,
crazy,

1536
01:24:57.831 --> 01:25:02.060
crazy fight and one of the most intense closely matched title fights in the

1537
01:25:02.061 --> 01:25:06.020
welterweight division history.
Yeah,
ever.
It was about down to the wire.

1538
01:25:06.170 --> 01:25:09.320
I mean it's really the kind of fight that everybody was wanted from GSP,

1539
01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.840
but she has fees.
Fights were always really tactical,

1540
01:25:11.841 --> 01:25:15.860
is really smart about when to take guys down and people would get mad at like

1541
01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:18.290
the way GSP would fight,
you know,
they would say,
oh,

1542
01:25:18.291 --> 01:25:19.900
he's just out pointing these guys like,

1543
01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.590
but that's the only way you get out with your fucking head and not getting

1544
01:25:24.591 --> 01:25:27.320
fucked up for the rest of your life.
This is what fighting is.
I mean,

1545
01:25:27.321 --> 01:25:31.580
what is fighting is fighting two guys hitting each other until one guy goes down

1546
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:34.870
or was fighting,
figuring out how to knock it hit,
I mean the,

1547
01:25:34.871 --> 01:25:37.850
there were smart guys figure out how to not get hit as much.

1548
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.800
You're always going to get hit.
There's no way around it,

1549
01:25:40.190 --> 01:25:45.140
but get hit the least amount possible and I don't understand people that get mad

1550
01:25:45.141 --> 01:25:49.070
at that.
I really don't like what do you have?
I always want to say,

1551
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:52.100
does anybody ever hit you?
Do you understand what these guys are trying to do?

1552
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:54.890
They're trying to not get hit.
It's a big part of this whole thing.

1553
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:59.160
Don't get hit giant park.
My sense is if I was,

1554
01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:02.550
I'd never played football in my life and I barely know the rules when I watch

1555
01:26:02.551 --> 01:26:04.240
football personally cannot

1556
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:08.330
<v 0>appreciate their athleticism I it because I don't know what's going on.</v>

1557
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:12.380
I know that NFL players are probably the best athletes in the whole world,

1558
01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.810
but I can't see it cause I don't know the sport.

1559
01:26:14.811 --> 01:26:19.250
And my sense is there's a lot of MMA fans that just don't understand the

1560
01:26:19.251 --> 01:26:21.050
artistry that that goes on there.

1561
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:25.370
The timing it takes to take somebody down and all the nuances of,
of defense.

1562
01:26:25.371 --> 01:26:27.470
And I think if they did know it,
they would love watching.

1563
01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:30.500
I love GSP fighting as a fight clinic.

1564
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.680
Look at that guy for 30 seconds and I picked up sewing.
I didn't know before.

1565
01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:35.030
I love watching the guy fight.

1566
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.030
But if I didn't know much about the sport and be like,
ah,
I just,

1567
01:26:38.031 --> 01:26:40.340
why don't you guys hit each other and give each other a bloody nose?

1568
01:26:40.341 --> 01:26:41.330
It's more exciting.

1569
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:43.960
<v 3>Well that's a lot of people felt about the Manny Pacquiao,</v>

1570
01:26:43.961 --> 01:26:46.420
Floyd Mayweather fight.
A lot of people were mad at that fight.
Yeah.

1571
01:26:46.421 --> 01:26:50.290
It's call it boring.
You don't think he's trying,

1572
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:57.190
I mean it's a fixed voguing mood decision to know each other.

1573
01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.750
Oh my God.

1574
01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:02.470
Just that stupid conversation that you have with people that don't understand

1575
01:27:02.471 --> 01:27:05.560
the sport and why does it need just do,
Oh gee,
you shut the fuck up.

1576
01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.000
Why doesn't he just,

1577
01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:10.810
well you should be coaching the fan and the grounded punch man in the face like

1578
01:27:10.811 --> 01:27:14.170
that's good advice.
I'm trying to punch him in the face.

1579
01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.200
I'm excited by the next level athletes and the next level ability that you're

1580
01:27:20.681 --> 01:27:24.940
seeing this sport that I think Tj Dillashaw shows like the those kind of guys.

1581
01:27:24.941 --> 01:27:29.410
I think you're going to see a guy like eventually who can move and strike like

1582
01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:32.350
Tj Butt kicks like Edson Barboza.
You know what I'm saying?

1583
01:27:32.351 --> 01:27:35.590
Like you're going to see that with a guy who could wrestle like Johnny
Hendricks.

1584
01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.650
You're going to see that with a guy who could submit guys like Damien Maia.

1585
01:27:38.890 --> 01:27:41.680
Like right now we're still in this growth stage.

1586
01:27:41.681 --> 01:27:44.340
We haven't hit the critical mass yet.
We haven't hit that.

1587
01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.610
That one where we see the perfect Michael Jordan of MMA,

1588
01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:49.600
they don't exist yet.

1589
01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:54.790
I think you're starting to see glimpses of these possibilities and what TJ

1590
01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:58.390
showed this weekend I think is a great glimpse of that possibility.

1591
01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:02.020
And that's what excites me about fighting.
Like people think,
oh,

1592
01:28:02.021 --> 01:28:03.190
you're a fucking meathead.

1593
01:28:03.191 --> 01:28:06.340
You like watching people beat the shit out of each other.
And it's like,
I get it,

1594
01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:09.160
I look like a meathead.
You know,
I sound like a meathead.
It's a,

1595
01:28:09.161 --> 01:28:11.880
it's a crazy sport being a cage fighting commentator.
It's,
it's,

1596
01:28:11.890 --> 01:28:13.990
it's a crazy sport to,
to be a part of.

1597
01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:17.110
People would assume that you like some sort of an uncivilized fuck head,

1598
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:21.340
but my take on it is that we only live for shorter amount of time anyway.

1599
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.520
You live and you die and there are extreme exciting things that you can do with

1600
01:28:26.561 --> 01:28:30.460
your life if you so choose to.
I think fighting is one of those things.

1601
01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:35.440
And I think at the very highest level what it is is problem solving.

1602
01:28:35.650 --> 01:28:38.650
It's intense consequence,
problem solving.

1603
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:41.350
And when you're looking at a guy like Tj Dillashaw,

1604
01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:46.230
he has created this problem solving solution with Duane Ludwig and their,

1605
01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.990
their problem solving solution involves incredible athleticism,

1606
01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.280
amazing determination,

1607
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:55.360
and a fanatical coach who has a deep,

1608
01:28:55.361 --> 01:28:59.140
deep understanding of movement and striking in a way that I don't think any

1609
01:28:59.141 --> 01:29:03.390
other coaches have.
The Way Duane,
this guys is so different.
I've,

1610
01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:06.300
I've worked out with him,
man.
He's,
he's on another level,

1611
01:29:06.301 --> 01:29:09.630
like he's all fucking aspergers out when he's,
when you're talking to him,

1612
01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:14.440
he gets crazy.
OCD,
a,
d,
d,
whatever the fuck it is.
He,
but he's a blah,
blah,
blah,

1613
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:18.510
blah.
Starts rattling out.
I've watched him and Tj hit mits together to,

1614
01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:23.550
to watch him rattle out information like the intensity level and the amount of

1615
01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:28.500
data that they're crunching and processing and how much thought is behind every

1616
01:29:28.501 --> 01:29:31.970
single movement.
You know,
a lot of guys when they throw punches,
like you say,

1617
01:29:31.971 --> 01:29:33.100
you throw a one,
two,

1618
01:29:33.210 --> 01:29:36.330
you'll sorta move a little bit full with the jab and then you rotate the

1619
01:29:36.331 --> 01:29:39.570
shoulders and the hips to throw the right hand.
Dwayne has the moving,

1620
01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:43.530
he's got you move with the left,
you move with the right,
your cons and you,

1621
01:29:43.531 --> 01:29:44.910
and after you throw that right hand,

1622
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:48.600
you're moving again and you throwing a left hook,
you're moving again.

1623
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:50.970
When you're throwing the right hand,
you're not just rotating your shoulders,

1624
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.340
you're stepping in or you're stepping back.

1625
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.760
There's all these movements and when you see it in the Barao fi,

1626
01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:01.770
especially that final flurry,
I mean that's some shit from a fucking movie man.

1627
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.270
I mean,
he's going left and right and left and right.
He's not in front of them.

1628
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:11.280
V toward trade.
Tellig men,
you know,
Ba,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.
No,
he's boom,

1629
01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:15.450
booms,
sidestep,
boom,
boom,
sidestep,
boom,
boom,
sides,

1630
01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:20.451
death and biologic shit and Borow is fucking seen a fireworks to spray at

1631
01:30:20.671 --> 01:30:22.800
Disneyland and he's throwing these,

1632
01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:25.920
his arms aren't working for him and he's throwing these hooks just trying to

1633
01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:28.500
stay alive and just pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.

1634
01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:31.770
He just getting lit up like a Christmas tree.
It was beautiful to watch.

1635
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:34.500
It's a next level shit,
you know?

1636
01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:38.320
<v 0>Yeah,
I agree 100% one of my heroes in the sport is Andre Petter narrows.</v>

1637
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:41.800
I think he's my hero first of all because he,
uh,
as far as I understand it,

1638
01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:47.170
he was the first guy to bring poor kids into Jujitsu and into mixed martial

1639
01:30:47.171 --> 01:30:49.420
arts.
It was a rich kid sport and a,
he would,

1640
01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.400
I mean you look at all the top guys from the gym,

1641
01:30:51.401 --> 01:30:52.810
they didn't have any money when they showed up there.

1642
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:55.810
They'd live on the mats there and he played sort of a,

1643
01:30:55.811 --> 01:30:59.980
an avuncular or father role and,
and he brought him up and then he sent himself,

1644
01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.690
cause I've learned striking.
He went to what the holiday learned,

1645
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:03.890
Dutch kickboxing and then he,

1646
01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:08.630
he welded a worldclass Jujitsu with Dutch kickboxing touch.
Kickboxing is,

1647
01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:13.631
is like American Western boxing and plus Moy Thai kicks and some karate kicks

1648
01:31:14.411 --> 01:31:17.310
and then a bunch of combinations.
In short,
that's what it is.
And he learned it.

1649
01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:21.250
He put those two together and he created guys like,
like Borow and,

1650
01:31:21.251 --> 01:31:25.750
and like Josie Aldo.
But now there's another step and it's that,
that,

1651
01:31:25.751 --> 01:31:26.980
that Bang Ludwig game.

1652
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:32.510
<v 3>Yeah.
The next level.
Shit,
it's,
it really is an interesting thing to watch.</v>

1653
01:31:32.511 --> 01:31:35.860
It's an interesting thing to watch the progress.
It's an,
it's,

1654
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.700
it's so fascinating because again,

1655
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:41.180
if you look back at football from like the 1960s,

1656
01:31:41.181 --> 01:31:46.030
if you will look back and you watch some of the great players that played,
uh,

1657
01:31:46.130 --> 01:31:46.640
you know,

1658
01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.050
throughout history you will see better athletes today then you see then,

1659
01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.270
but the game is recognizable.

1660
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.750
If you go back and watch UFC one from 1993,

1661
01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:00.340
I mean go walk or watch a Marvin Hagler fight from 88,
you know,

1662
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:05.290
or 1985 march Hagler fight Mustapha Ham show or you know,

1663
01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.020
it was a great fight.
Great fight.
Why Watch him fight?
Do you know anybody?
Watch,

1664
01:32:10.050 --> 01:32:11.190
watch him fight anybody from,

1665
01:32:11.191 --> 01:32:15.400
from that era and then watch a really good boxing match today.

1666
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:18.810
And you'll see the same thing.
You're seeing the same sport.

1667
01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:23.050
You might see a guy in Floyd Mayweather has who has it down to a science.

1668
01:32:23.051 --> 01:32:26.050
And I think,
I think personally,
as far as boxing,

1669
01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.540
I think Floyd Mayweather is the best boxer ever.

1670
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:30.400
Cause I think he gets hit the least.

1671
01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:32.980
He moves the best and he shuts guys down the most.

1672
01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.780
You don't have to like him as a person.

1673
01:32:34.781 --> 01:32:36.430
You might think he's a Douche bag or whatever.

1674
01:32:36.431 --> 01:32:41.110
But I think as far as like being a skillful boxer,
it's my personal opinion.

1675
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:45.250
I mean I got an argument with a Max Kellerman was telling me sugar ray Robinson

1676
01:32:45.251 --> 01:32:48.710
is the best and like maybe,
do you think that George,

1677
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:51.400
do you think Jake Lamata would beat Floyd Mayweather?

1678
01:32:51.401 --> 01:32:53.230
I think you're fucking crazy if you believe that.

1679
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:56.230
I don't think Jake lamata would lay a glove on him.
I just don't,
I don't know.

1680
01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:59.050
I don't believe that would happen.
I just don't see it happening.

1681
01:32:59.350 --> 01:33:00.790
And if they were the same weight class,

1682
01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.110
I think Floyd Mayweather would fucking pot shot Jake Lamata and tie him up and

1683
01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:08.710
cut angles on him and move away from on the ropes.
I just think he's better.

1684
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.820
I think,
yeah,

1685
01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:14.440
Ray Robinson might've fought more times and fought more people and when all the

1686
01:33:14.441 --> 01:33:18.070
way up to light heavyweight and all that jazz.
But I think Floyd's the best.

1687
01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:23.110
But when you look at Ray Robinson's fights,
it's recognizable.

1688
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.780
It's the same sport.
It's the,
it's the same sport.

1689
01:33:25.781 --> 01:33:27.940
This is a little bit of a difference.
A little more plotting.

1690
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:31.300
They fought a little different.
They stood in the pocket a little bit more,

1691
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:36.100
but Jesus Christ,
you look at the difference between MMA from 93 we go,
shit,

1692
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:40.330
go to 95 look at MMA from 20 years ago and look at it now.

1693
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:45.160
It's not the same thing at all for you watched Tj Dillashaw is fight the other

1694
01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:49.930
nine.
Tell me there was anybody that he was even remotely similar to that just 10

1695
01:33:49.931 --> 01:33:51.910
years ago.
I forgot about 20

1696
01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:55.900
<v 0>true.
Was I a hazing?
I was talking with my own,</v>

1697
01:33:55.901 --> 01:33:57.880
the records keeper for MMA and my counterpart,

1698
01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:00.610
the records keeper for boxing is Anti Vermont.
As a couple of two,

1699
01:34:00.611 --> 01:34:01.444
three years ago,

1700
01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:05.290
I was talking with Andy and John McCarthy and McCarthy was talking about the

1701
01:34:05.291 --> 01:34:09.910
fact that he owns a gym and he rolls with all the athletes and stuff and any

1702
01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:13.500
Mira Montes got kind of a weird look on his face and he goes,
wait a minute,
you,

1703
01:34:13.501 --> 01:34:16.090
you,
you,
you,
you roll with these people.

1704
01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:19.360
Because in boxing you have to keep a distance,

1705
01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:22.180
a separation between the officials and the athletes.

1706
01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.370
And what Mccarthy said is this sport is evolving all the time and I can't do my

1707
01:34:27.371 --> 01:34:30.190
job unless I'm in,
they're actually rolling with the people.

1708
01:34:30.191 --> 01:34:33.760
And then he showed them a Google Plata and they,
uh,
Annie the boxing,
I was like,

1709
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:38.500
oh,
that's unbelievable.
And at the dentist's several years ago to Google plot,

1710
01:34:38.501 --> 01:34:42.610
it was a fairly new move and he just threw that out as an example of how it,

1711
01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:45.460
boxing basically stays the same.
So if you're,

1712
01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:48.070
there are records keeper or you're a referee,

1713
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:53.050
you are refereeing and officiating sport that's been the same for 50 years.

1714
01:34:53.051 --> 01:34:55.900
Basically.
You don't have to know all the new things in it.

1715
01:34:56.170 --> 01:35:00.380
And MMA is just all the time and if you're a an official involved in the sport,

1716
01:35:00.381 --> 01:35:03.230
you've got to be on the mats every week or something's going to be coming up

1717
01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:04.910
that you've never seen before.

1718
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:08.640
<v 3>Yeah.
In jujitsu there's always some new move that someone figures out.</v>

1719
01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:11.160
There's always something,
some new way to do a choke,

1720
01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:14.100
some new way to lock an arm bar in or attack a leg.

1721
01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:17.160
That combination that Jamie just put up on the,
on the big screen,

1722
01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:22.370
this is a t J's final flurry against Hen Barao it you show me a painting than

1723
01:35:24.031 --> 01:35:27.290
anybody ever made that looks better than this.
Look at this.

1724
01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:30.390
The way he just did that,
the way he's moving on them and look,

1725
01:35:30.450 --> 01:35:33.480
every time his punching,
he stands in front of them.

1726
01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:38.310
He lands shots and then he moves.
Boom,
moves to the left,
moving to the right.

1727
01:35:38.311 --> 01:35:40.930
Look.
Every time he's throwing these punches,
he's movement.

1728
01:35:42.090 --> 01:35:44.940
I mean this is like a sponge.

1729
01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.290
Next level athlete and the kid like Tj Dillashaw super dedicated,

1730
01:35:49.650 --> 01:35:54.650
get a perfect mind for the sport that became best friends with a fucking maniac.

1731
01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.200
Like Duane Ludwig who was a world champion kickboxer who showed him how to do it

1732
01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.700
exactly how they did it in the locker.
I'm like,

1733
01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:06.060
I was actually back there watching them warm up and that's exactly how they move

1734
01:36:06.061 --> 01:36:10.890
with a warm up and he executes it exactly that.
He wants them to look at that,

1735
01:36:10.891 --> 01:36:13.590
that animated Gif like look at this movement.
I mean it's,

1736
01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:17.880
it's fucking incredible.
I mean,

1737
01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:21.990
look at that.
That is insane.
And right in front of them being,

1738
01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:26.940
and then slides just out of the way of the counter strikes says incredible shit

1739
01:36:26.941 --> 01:36:31.410
man.
I mean,
I,
I don't think there's been a guy in the sport that moves that good.

1740
01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:35.010
And what's really incredible is Dwayne never moved like that.

1741
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:38.350
Dwayne's teaching them some shit that he figured out that he didn't even do

1742
01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:42.810
himself.
I mean,
Duane was a great kick boxer,
but Dwayne was way more linear.

1743
01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.130
Linear in his movements like with Tj is doing is some really crazy shit that

1744
01:36:47.131 --> 01:36:49.230
Dwayne sort of figured out that Tj can do.

1745
01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.600
<v 0>And the maybe the craziest thing about it is Tj does have a base in something</v>

1746
01:36:54.701 --> 01:36:57.040
else.
He started off,
obviously as a wrestler,

1747
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:59.110
there's a whole new generation coming up.

1748
01:36:59.111 --> 01:37:02.170
They were on the swim team or they played hockey or more something.

1749
01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:04.120
They don't have any base in any sort of a thing.

1750
01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:07.030
All their learning from the Getgo is mixed martial arts.

1751
01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:09.070
Guys like Joe proctor out of a,

1752
01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:12.070
at a Christian was a hockey player in high school and walked into the gym and

1753
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:14.890
never done any,
any kind of combat sport all his life.

1754
01:37:14.891 --> 01:37:18.440
And I think with the whole next generation of Joe proctors is,

1755
01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:22.300
is going to Spiro up stuff.
I can barely imagine.

1756
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:23.400
<v 3>Well there's a thought,</v>

1757
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:27.120
there's a school of thought that the best way is actually not that way,

1758
01:37:27.121 --> 01:37:31.110
but rather the best ways to get really fucking good at one thing to get like

1759
01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:35.130
really good at kickboxing and then dedicate yourself to learning MMA.

1760
01:37:35.131 --> 01:37:39.570
So you will always have this advantage in the striking because we all know that

1761
01:37:39.571 --> 01:37:43.590
to get really incredibly good at something almost requires like a singular

1762
01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:44.470
dedication.
Sure.
Like,

1763
01:37:44.690 --> 01:37:49.380
like although Tj is one of the world's best mixed martial arts fighters for
sure,

1764
01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:52.170
he's probably not one of the world's best strikers.

1765
01:37:52.171 --> 01:37:56.160
If you put him in like glory and you put him up like one of the,
the,

1766
01:37:56.161 --> 01:38:00.630
you know Andy wristy or one of those like really high level Moitai guys,

1767
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.670
he might not be able to beat those guys.

1768
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.270
But when it comes to putting all that shit together,
he's one of the best at it.

1769
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:10.380
But if you get a guy like Andy rusty who learns all the shit that he's doing,

1770
01:38:10.381 --> 01:38:11.250
the t is learning,

1771
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:15.840
then he will have an advantage over TJ at least in that one aspect of the game.

1772
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:19.470
Whereas Tj will always have an advantage over him and wrestling cause that's his

1773
01:38:19.471 --> 01:38:20.520
base.
There's a lot,

1774
01:38:20.521 --> 01:38:23.850
it was an interesting schools of thought there that some people think that it's

1775
01:38:23.851 --> 01:38:28.540
best to learn everything from the get go.
Like a Rory Macdonald.
Yeah.

1776
01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:31.130
And some people think it's better to be like a Damien Maia where you,

1777
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:35.280
you come in,
you have this one insane discipline,

1778
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:38.250
the worldclass Brazilian Jujitsu and then everything else you've got to kind of

1779
01:38:38.251 --> 01:38:39.120
learn to go with it.

1780
01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.110
But worst case scenario you could always take it to that place and you'll have

1781
01:38:43.111 --> 01:38:44.700
this giant advantage over everyone else.

1782
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:47.850
Like do you remember when Damien Maia took Rick story down?

1783
01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:52.620
Like rich stories is fucking beast of a wrestler.
Super strong guy.

1784
01:38:52.621 --> 01:38:55.470
But Damien Maia took him down,
smushed him,

1785
01:38:55.471 --> 01:38:59.460
transition to his back and squoze his fucking head like a Zit and I remember

1786
01:38:59.461 --> 01:39:03.960
watching it going,
Holy Shit,
I never let anybody do that to Rick story before.

1787
01:39:04.530 --> 01:39:08.950
But it's that next level Jujitsu that he has that no one else had or that you

1788
01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.560
know.
Very few [inaudible] that tape.

1789
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:14.220
I don't know how I did the same thing to add Hermine as Hermoine was a team

1790
01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:14.791
quest guy,

1791
01:39:14.791 --> 01:39:18.940
good wrestler and he's like taking them down mountain and trial the right and

1792
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:20.280
triangle and finished it and like this,

1793
01:39:20.281 --> 01:39:22.300
it was like when Danny and I went on that like three fights,

1794
01:39:22.301 --> 01:39:24.870
submission streak where he just ran through the tail.

1795
01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.290
Sudden remember we lateral dropped him.
Yeah,
lateral dropped him,

1796
01:39:28.291 --> 01:39:31.920
went right into a mounted triangle and tapped him.
It's like what the fuck?

1797
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:34.680
And then just to take child down like that too,

1798
01:39:34.710 --> 01:39:37.980
to just fucking throw him like a rag doll was crazy.

1799
01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:39.720
He's the next level grappler.

1800
01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:44.190
But you know when he fought Anderson like good luck.
He couldn't even catch him.

1801
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.710
But Anderson,
that was a crazy fight.

1802
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:49.290
That was the one in the Aba Dhabi where Anderson came out,

1803
01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:53.040
guns blazing for like the first two rounds and then just took off hide.
Yeah,

1804
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.020
just stop fighting for the last three

1805
01:39:55.150 --> 01:39:58.930
<v 0>as I understand it.
That was a class warfare thing.</v>

1806
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:03.670
The play who kept taunting him and calling him playboy?
I asked some Brazilian,

1807
01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.440
why are you calling him a playboys?
I look,
uh,

1808
01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:08.500
it's kind of a compliment that call somebody a playboy I think in the states.

1809
01:40:08.501 --> 01:40:13.150
And he said Eh,
it means kind of like a rich kid who was not too serious.
And uh,

1810
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:16.030
I,
you know,
obviously Anderson Silva was raised by his uncle,

1811
01:40:16.031 --> 01:40:19.510
his uncle was a cop and that heads parents didn't have any money at all,

1812
01:40:19.511 --> 01:40:23.050
didn't have the money to raise their own son,
gave him to the cup and the cup,

1813
01:40:23.051 --> 01:40:24.760
I don't think I had a whole ton of money.

1814
01:40:24.761 --> 01:40:28.390
So he came up poor and I think that's where all the shoot they box guys came

1815
01:40:28.391 --> 01:40:30.840
from was,
was,
was poor neighborhoods.
And so that there,

1816
01:40:30.841 --> 01:40:34.660
there was some rivalry there and I think that's what was going on as he knew he

1817
01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:38.710
could beat him up but just wanted to rough up the rich kid,
the preppy kid.

1818
01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:40.990
It was crazy.
But it was,
it was real weird

1819
01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.790
<v 3>watch cause it didn't make any sense cause Damien Maia was never really a shit</v>

1820
01:40:43.791 --> 01:40:45.230
talker.
He's a gentleman.

1821
01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:49.550
So to see Anderson and like screaming at him and then not fighting for the last

1822
01:40:49.551 --> 01:40:51.530
three rounds like that whole arena was,

1823
01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.690
they were so pissed because this was a huge event,
Nobile,
dobby,

1824
01:40:55.691 --> 01:40:59.800
and it was right after shake talk noon had bought 10% of the UFC.

1825
01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:03.130
He was kind of embarrassing for them to have that event there and have the

1826
01:41:03.131 --> 01:41:04.720
greatest fighter in the world at the time.

1827
01:41:04.721 --> 01:41:07.540
Anderson fight this guy and Damien Maia,

1828
01:41:07.541 --> 01:41:10.810
who's well respected and people thinking this was going to be some sort of a

1829
01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:14.530
crazy war and then Anderson just doesn't fight for the last three rounds.

1830
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:15.603
I remember around.

1831
01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:18.800
<v 0>I remember afterwards Dana White said,
if he does it again,
I'm going to fire him.</v>

1832
01:41:18.801 --> 01:41:20.450
And I was like,
oh my God,
sweet.

1833
01:41:20.451 --> 01:41:22.590
Jesus is the greatest fighter in the world and that fight,

1834
01:41:22.591 --> 01:41:23.900
it was so bad you're going to fire him

1835
01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.950
<v 3>and on that crazy.
That's crazy talk.
You know,
how do you do that?</v>

1836
01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:32.150
You can't really fire somebody really fiery guy winning.
Oh for when they know,

1837
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:36.500
you know.
I mean he won,
but do that and lose out.
Well,

1838
01:41:36.501 --> 01:41:38.090
Anderson is a crazy,

1839
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:43.570
crazy sort of special example of a guy who had this aura of invincibility.

1840
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:49.910
Everybody thought he was just indestructible until he met Weidman and why,

1841
01:41:49.911 --> 01:41:53.320
but just smashed him and then all of a sudden he's not the same guy anymore.

1842
01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:56.450
Like you seem in the Nick Diaz fight with Nick Diaz felled the ground and like

1843
01:41:56.451 --> 01:41:59.360
put his hands up like he was sleeping because he was bored with them and he's

1844
01:41:59.361 --> 01:42:00.051
taunting him.

1845
01:42:00.051 --> 01:42:03.350
And you could see Anderson was fucking with his head to the point where after

1846
01:42:03.351 --> 01:42:06.110
the fight was over,
Anderson fell to the ground.

1847
01:42:06.111 --> 01:42:10.490
It was crying after he beat Nick Diaz and he's weeping,
openly weeping.

1848
01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:12.260
I was standing over him.
I was doing it.

1849
01:42:12.261 --> 01:42:16.250
He was openly weeping just because it was so much pressure to get through it.

1850
01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.290
Because of those two fights with Weidman,
like Weidman stole something from him.

1851
01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:24.260
You know,
he just beat him when he knocked him out.
And then the second fight,

1852
01:42:24.261 --> 01:42:27.080
when he broke his leg,
we didn't just beat him.

1853
01:42:27.081 --> 01:42:29.720
He like stole all of his confidence.

1854
01:42:29.721 --> 01:42:32.330
He stole who he was as a champion.

1855
01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.540
Those moments are crazy because before that,

1856
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:39.320
when he fought Stephan Bonner in Brazil and put his back up against the cage,

1857
01:42:39.321 --> 01:42:40.300
it's like,
come on,
try to hit man.

1858
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:42.950
They just moved out of the way and then blasted them with a knee to the body and

1859
01:42:42.951 --> 01:42:46.370
it took 'em out and then jumped up on the cage and all the Brazilians went
crazy.

1860
01:42:46.371 --> 01:42:49.850
It was like,
who's better than that guy?
Who the fuck is going to beat that guy?

1861
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:53.180
I mean,
wow.
Chris Weidman was watching the whole thing at home.
Not impressed.

1862
01:42:53.730 --> 01:42:55.670
Impressed at all.
So crazy.

1863
01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.940
It's crazy how that happens and we get this idea in our head,

1864
01:42:58.941 --> 01:43:01.790
whether it's a Mike Tyson or an Anderson Silva or anybody,

1865
01:43:01.791 --> 01:43:05.000
we get this idea in our head that you can never be beat and it's one of the

1866
01:43:05.001 --> 01:43:06.050
great things about this,

1867
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.640
any sport like especially fighting is that you know this going to come a day.

1868
01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:14.390
Sometimes you're the hammer and sometimes you're the nail is going to come a day

1869
01:43:14.391 --> 01:43:17.230
when you're the nail bitch.
You know,

1870
01:43:17.250 --> 01:43:20.270
you better get ready for it or you better get out.
Like George Saint Pierre did.

1871
01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:22.550
Right.
And he's,
when he's been the nail,
you know,

1872
01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:25.340
he's been the nail with Matt Serra.
It's going to happen.

1873
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:29.530
<v 0>The,
the mental game I think is,
is way under way,
way,</v>

1874
01:43:29.531 --> 01:43:33.190
way under appreciated.
And it hit me when I was a kid,

1875
01:43:33.191 --> 01:43:36.340
I learned that Sir Roger Bannister,
the first man to break the four minute mile,

1876
01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.713
um,

1877
01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:40.630
everybody thought you couldn't break the four minute mile and he finally did it.

1878
01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:44.620
And once he did it within like 60 days for other guys did it because they knew

1879
01:43:44.621 --> 01:43:49.390
it could be done.
And then when you,
when you have an idea in your head in sports,

1880
01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:52.150
but particularly in combat sports,
whether it's I'm invincible

1881
01:43:52.150 --> 01:43:55.010
<v 3>or I'm going to beat this guy or whatever,
when you have that id in your head,</v>

1882
01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:59.690
it's actually physically,
physiologically really,
really powerful.
But that got,

1883
01:43:59.691 --> 01:44:01.250
that got taken away from Anderson Silva.

1884
01:44:01.251 --> 01:44:05.810
He realized he was not in fact invincible.
And then I think,

1885
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:08.720
I think life's a lot tougher for him now.
I thought it was way tougher.

1886
01:44:09.230 --> 01:44:11.870
Still my hero.
I think that's why I got like Mcgregor right now.

1887
01:44:11.871 --> 01:44:15.800
He literally thinks he's invincible and it's that power of his mentality that

1888
01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:19.190
pushes.
He literally thinks he can't lose.
He can call us fights,

1889
01:44:19.191 --> 01:44:23.750
call the round and he does it because he's so confident all that he believes it.

1890
01:44:23.751 --> 01:44:27.320
He knows it in his,
in his own head and it's,
it's powerful.

1891
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:31.970
It's carries him through just destroying these guys that Chad Mendez is a good

1892
01:44:31.971 --> 01:44:34.490
fighter.
Chad Mendez is way out of shape for that fight.

1893
01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.050
Let's be honest about things.
First of all,

1894
01:44:36.051 --> 01:44:40.490
Chad Mendez and your eyes stated this and Duane Ludwig said the same thing when

1895
01:44:40.491 --> 01:44:44.660
I talked to him.
Chad takes time off in between fights.
He likes to go hunting.

1896
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:48.410
He likes to spend time doing other shit and for him to accept a fight like down

1897
01:44:48.411 --> 01:44:48.831
on two weeks,

1898
01:44:48.831 --> 01:44:51.260
notice he did it because he thought he's going to be able to win anyway.

1899
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:53.690
But if you gave Chad Mendez a full camp,

1900
01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:56.120
if you gave Chadman is six to eight weeks and you know,

1901
01:44:56.121 --> 01:44:59.930
really let him know three months preferable,
it would be a different fight,

1902
01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.660
be a very different fight as long as he wasn't injured.
And you know,

1903
01:45:02.690 --> 01:45:04.520
Connor actually was injured going into the fight.

1904
01:45:04.521 --> 01:45:05.390
He had something wrong with his knee.

1905
01:45:05.391 --> 01:45:07.240
He was getting stem cell injections in his name.

1906
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:09.070
I heard that like eight weeks before the fight.

1907
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:10.550
Now of course told me that a couple of months,

1908
01:45:10.551 --> 01:45:12.800
a lot of people knew about that book.
He's,
we're talking about it,

1909
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:15.590
but Chad just didn't have the wind.
It was really obvious.

1910
01:45:15.591 --> 01:45:18.710
It was also obvious he wasn't prepared for that kind of fucking movement.

1911
01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:22.220
I mean it takes a long time to get ready for a guy who can kick like Connor can,

1912
01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:22.821
you know,

1913
01:45:22.821 --> 01:45:27.821
in Connor's long and big for one 45 he fucking socks a lot of weight.

1914
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:32.630
I don't know what the number is,
but I know that when he was there on Wayne Day,

1915
01:45:32.631 --> 01:45:33.890
he looked like skeletor.

1916
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.910
I mean he looked like total like total starvation.

1917
01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:41.600
And then the next day he looked big again and I'll probably put on shocked if he

1918
01:45:41.601 --> 01:45:44.120
was one 70 in the cage.

1919
01:45:44.121 --> 01:45:47.600
25 pounds walks around at one 70 I wouldn't be surprised if he was at begging

1920
01:45:47.601 --> 01:45:51.140
the cage.
I've known guys who cut that much weight and put it all right back on.

1921
01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.690
So cars are,
and even the guys that don't cut a lot,

1922
01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.720
the 55 is there still 68 69 they don't even have hard cuts and that's t bow.

1923
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:03.640
He's like one 90 in the cage.
He's gigantic weight.

1924
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:07.040
He fights at one 55 and he's fucking huge.

1925
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:09.160
I mean he is a god Damn Superhero.

1926
01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.960
He doesn't even look like a real person when he gets in that cage.

1927
01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.950
He just saw muscular and thick and just,

1928
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:18.560
it doesn't make any sense actually have no idea how he does it.
It's too much.

1929
01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.160
And he competes though.
He doesn't like

1930
01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:26.150
he has acid gas tank on.
Usually there's guys that get sucked down a lot.

1931
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:28.550
They got the good round in them and they kind tired.

1932
01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:30.350
But tiva can fight three fives.

1933
01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.060
No problem being that gigantic after a huge weight cut.

1934
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:37.220
Yeah,
well,
biodiversity is a real thing.

1935
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:40.250
Some people just have abilities that other people just don't have.

1936
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:44.750
Like Cain Velasquez has always had this incredible ability to have a phenomenal

1937
01:46:44.751 --> 01:46:47.210
cardio,
you know,
which was so ironic.

1938
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:51.030
Here's another example of a guy you think he's invincible and then Fabrizio for

1939
01:46:51.031 --> 01:46:51.510
doom,

1940
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:56.510
literally out cardio cane by training really hard and doing a lot of cardio at

1941
01:46:56.551 --> 01:47:01.551
8,000 feet above Avalon elevation above sea level and Co Cain does sot,

1942
01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.220
Hey,
I got the best cardio in the sport.
I don't even need to go to Mexico early.

1943
01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.270
So they're fighting in Mexico City has heavyweight to 7,500 feet above sea
level,

1944
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:12.270
super high altitude,
ridiculous for heavyweights,

1945
01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:16.020
and Fabrizio had been training a thousand feet above that.

1946
01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:17.460
Now he really prepared.

1947
01:47:17.461 --> 01:47:21.840
He really got ready for it and you see Cain gassing and he see Cain gassing that

1948
01:47:21.841 --> 01:47:25.050
saccharine.
I was like,
I don't even fucking believe what I'm seeing.

1949
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:27.450
Cain Velasquez is exhausted.

1950
01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:31.590
He's going back to his corner on rubbery legs and he's taking these big heaving

1951
01:47:31.591 --> 01:47:33.780
deep breath.
I'm like,
I've never seen this from him before.

1952
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:36.620
<v 0>The UFC had a one of their,
I don't know if it was an embedded,</v>

1953
01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.120
there's some kind of a little,
a video that they shot of a,

1954
01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:45.290
a very doom in his,
uh,
in his camp.
And I saw he was sleeping on the floor.

1955
01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:48.800
They showed him,
he had four fighters in the room and he'd just had a tiny low,

1956
01:47:48.801 --> 01:47:51.320
wasn't even a cot.
He just had a pallet on the floor.
And I looked at that,

1957
01:47:51.321 --> 01:47:53.840
I looked at the elevation.
I was like,
this guy's going to win.

1958
01:47:53.841 --> 01:47:57.680
He's sleeping on the floor for two months at a time.
He's at elevation,

1959
01:47:57.890 --> 01:48:01.550
he's gonna win this fight.
You could sleep on the floor all day wrong.

1960
01:48:01.551 --> 01:48:05.900
Chris Weidman is still punching.
He'll have a nice comfy bed,

1961
01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:09.830
wake up with his little fucking footie pajamas on and beat the shit out of you.

1962
01:48:09.831 --> 01:48:10.820
I don't know if that helps.

1963
01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.990
We were just talking about wide when we were trying to figure out exactly why

1964
01:48:14.991 --> 01:48:18.530
he's so dominant.
And we don't have any genius answers.

1965
01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:22.430
<v 3>Beat him up,
beat him up all his life.
His brother brutalized him,</v>

1966
01:48:22.431 --> 01:48:26.180
his dad's an NFL player.
His brother was an animal and his brother bullied him.

1967
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.900
And uh,

1968
01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:30.920
I think when you grow up like that and you're constantly defending yourself

1969
01:48:30.921 --> 01:48:31.760
against your brother,

1970
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:35.030
I think that's one of the reasons why Matthews was so dominant.

1971
01:48:35.031 --> 01:48:37.160
Him and his brother used to beat the fuck out of each other.

1972
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:40.040
I think it's one of the reasons why John Jones is such a bad ass.

1973
01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:43.850
Him and his brothers are all super athletes and they beat the fuck out of each

1974
01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:46.490
other.
I think that is super normal.

1975
01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:50.390
I think when you develop in a household where you're constantly competing with

1976
01:48:50.391 --> 01:48:54.170
your own brother and in Weidman's cases,
brother was older than him,

1977
01:48:54.171 --> 01:48:55.370
his brother was older and bigger.

1978
01:48:55.371 --> 01:48:57.590
And this isn't like a bad stories that came out of that too.

1979
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:59.330
Like he had to go to the hospital once.

1980
01:48:59.331 --> 01:49:01.490
I think his brother dropped a weight plate on his head.

1981
01:49:01.491 --> 01:49:02.870
And I don't know if that's a true story,

1982
01:49:02.871 --> 01:49:07.871
but that's my brother and I have caused blood bloody wounds more than once

1983
01:49:08.331 --> 01:49:11.240
growing up.
But he still ended up a pussy.
I don't understand.

1984
01:49:11.241 --> 01:49:13.860
Like you got beat up this hole right here and it doesn't have a mic.

1985
01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:17.450
This is so fun.
Well,
I taste think that,

1986
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:20.720
that there's an advantage in that psychological advantage of,

1987
01:49:20.770 --> 01:49:23.720
and not being afraid because you're constantly going to war with your own

1988
01:49:23.721 --> 01:49:24.321
brother.
You know,

1989
01:49:24.321 --> 01:49:29.321
you just develop a steel hardened sense of competition where you're just ready

1990
01:49:29.451 --> 01:49:32.450
to go.
You're ready to go.
I'm ready to go right now.
Mother,
are you ready to go?

1991
01:49:32.451 --> 01:49:33.410
You know,
like you have this,

1992
01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:37.440
like when Chris Weidman Gotten Anderson Silva's face,
when they,
uh,

1993
01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:39.980
first weighed in and Anderson Silva walked up to him and kissed him,

1994
01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.340
like he pressed to fate and Wyman didn't move.

1995
01:49:43.730 --> 01:49:48.010
And a Anderson staring at them and say,
we'll see you tomorrow.
He,
yeah,
I'm not

1996
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.830
<v 1>afraid of you,
motherfucker.
So he said,
he goes,
I'm not afraid of you.</v>

1997
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:54.400
And you could see in his eyes like,
it wasn't like,
I'm not afraid.
You,
man,

1998
01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:58.090
like there's no craziness.
It was just a real calm.
I'm not afraid of you man.

1999
01:49:58.210 --> 01:50:02.710
I'm not afraid of you.
And Weidman was like,
tomorrow we will see,
we will see.

2000
01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:05.080
Yeah.
But looking even there,

2001
01:50:05.081 --> 01:50:09.850
you see how God damn big Weidman is big and this is what he weighed in at one 85

2002
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:14.110
you know the amount of weight that that guy cuts.
I don't know how much it is,

2003
01:50:14.111 --> 01:50:17.590
but it's not a small amount.
It's,
it's multiple pounds.

2004
01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:19.720
Cause when he fought Damien Maia,

2005
01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:23.170
that was a fight that he had to take on Fox on very short notice.

2006
01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:27.340
And he's sucked a tremendous amount of weight to fight that fight.

2007
01:50:27.341 --> 01:50:31.210
And he was just absolutely drained and exhausted because of it.

2008
01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:33.130
Even when they put the water back on them.

2009
01:50:33.370 --> 01:50:36.250
One of the things that Ray Longo said in between the corner,
he said,

2010
01:50:36.251 --> 01:50:38.500
I saw what you did yesterday to make weight.
If you did that,

2011
01:50:38.501 --> 01:50:40.870
you could fucking do anything to go out there and kick his ass.

2012
01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:44.800
Like he had to say that to Weidman when Weidman was exhausted.

2013
01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:49.810
I didn't realize how strong Weidman was until he did that helicopter knee bar

2014
01:50:49.811 --> 01:50:53.860
and Anderson Silva and it blew my mind as much as anything I've ever seen in a

2015
01:50:53.861 --> 01:50:54.370
fight.

2016
01:50:54.370 --> 01:50:57.430
There was a fajita talks about how the whole sport is based on holy fucking shit

2017
01:50:57.431 --> 01:50:59.530
moments.
Every single UFC,

2018
01:50:59.531 --> 01:51:03.220
at some point something's going to happen that makes you go holy fucking shit.

2019
01:51:03.221 --> 01:51:05.230
And that's the heart of the sport.
For me.

2020
01:51:05.231 --> 01:51:09.400
It was when he did that helicopter knee bar on Anderson Silva.
I'm like,
really?

2021
01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:12.430
You're trying to NIB arm?
And he got kind of close.

2022
01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:16.180
That's when I realized this mentally it's just a nother,

2023
01:51:16.181 --> 01:51:19.430
wasn't scared of taking them down,
I knew could take him down.
Well,
what,

2024
01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:22.790
what gotten me was the Vituro fight when he shot on vetoed.

2025
01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:27.070
That was such a deep double.
And when he shot on him and class,

2026
01:51:27.071 --> 01:51:31.270
there's hands together.
I'm like,
this is,
no one's defending not defending this.

2027
01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.600
And then once he got veto to the ground,
the difference between,
first of all,

2028
01:51:34.601 --> 01:51:37.840
the different [inaudible] veto or the veto fought Rockhold and the v toward that

2029
01:51:37.841 --> 01:51:41.980
flood Bisbing.
I mean,
he's just not the same dude you take away the TRT,

2030
01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:46.810
TRT gone,
no testosterone injections,
and he's just this fucking regular guy.

2031
01:51:46.930 --> 01:51:51.930
He actually has had a deficit because his body has really low testosterone as

2032
01:51:52.631 --> 01:51:56.130
opposed to a normal 36 37 year old man.
His body man,

2033
01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:59.320
he's been taking that shit for so long.
I mean,

2034
01:51:59.321 --> 01:52:02.440
if you go back to the Randy couture fight like we were talking about before was

2035
01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:03.610
240 pounds.

2036
01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:08.940
He's been messing with his system and hyper human levels for so long that his

2037
01:52:09.911 --> 01:52:12.670
regular endocrine system is probably really fucked up.

2038
01:52:13.210 --> 01:52:16.540
That's also the fight where Wyman gotten his face at the weigh ins and he was

2039
01:52:16.541 --> 01:52:20.080
yelling at him about the levels that he showed in camp because his levels in

2040
01:52:20.081 --> 01:52:22.990
camp were three times higher than Weidman's.

2041
01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:28.570
The level that they test sensible,
right.
It was under the limit,

2042
01:52:28.571 --> 01:52:33.460
but it was 1200 and this is a guy that needed testosterone replacement.

2043
01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:36.250
I mean,
it's all,
it wasn't right and it was wine and I was like,

2044
01:52:36.251 --> 01:52:38.680
you're fucking juice and you're fucking juice.
He goes,

2045
01:52:38.681 --> 01:52:40.210
I know you're fucking juice in the camp.
And he goes,

2046
01:52:40.211 --> 01:52:42.610
I'm going to make you pay for it.
I'm going to punish you for this tomorrow.

2047
01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:47.000
And you could see vittores eyes.
And he said something to him.

2048
01:52:47.001 --> 01:52:49.970
I couldn't hear what he said to him.
So I asked Weidman when he said,

2049
01:52:49.971 --> 01:52:52.820
and you know,
and he just was going off about the levels.
He goes,

2050
01:52:52.821 --> 01:52:56.120
I knew something was wrong with his levels,
you know,
he goes,
I'm busting my ass.

2051
01:52:56.121 --> 01:53:00.370
I'm 10 years younger than I am and I'm testing it 300.
You know,
and that's what,

2052
01:53:00.371 --> 01:53:03.470
what happens,
the guys in camp,
they breakdown mean you're,

2053
01:53:03.471 --> 01:53:07.520
you're going through these two and three days and you're just God damn
exhausted.

2054
01:53:07.521 --> 01:53:08.870
You just trying to push through it,

2055
01:53:08.871 --> 01:53:12.020
trying to push through it just to keep your conditioning high.
And uh,

2056
01:53:12.021 --> 01:53:13.520
when he found out the vittores level,

2057
01:53:13.610 --> 01:53:17.060
he was so angry and you could see he was so fucking angry.

2058
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:20.660
And then he did punish them for it.
When he got him down.
How he beat him up bad.

2059
01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:23.750
He beat him up bad.
It was.
That was a bad beat down.

2060
01:53:23.751 --> 01:53:28.100
I never saw Vitorin that was sort of a position either mounted like that with

2061
01:53:28.101 --> 01:53:31.490
just no hope of getting up,
wanting to be out of there.
I've I've,
yeah,

2062
01:53:31.491 --> 01:53:35.420
there it is so hopeless.
He was punching up,
which we know doesn't work.

2063
01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.320
Nobody does shit.
Never wash.

2064
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:41.330
He was just flailing like he was trying to hit him back and why boots?

2065
01:53:41.331 --> 01:53:44.750
Just smashing them.
Just boom,
boom and look on his face.

2066
01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:48.560
He's just so like see if you can get a video Jamie or the final flurry.

2067
01:53:49.190 --> 01:53:53.360
Awful.
But it saw also like vittores body when he got into the cage,

2068
01:53:53.361 --> 01:53:57.560
like all this loose skin,
it was all,
it was weird.
It was weird to see.

2069
01:53:57.561 --> 01:54:01.580
It's like he looks like a welterweight.
Like he could be welterweight like easy.

2070
01:54:01.610 --> 01:54:06.080
If he could stay off this shit.
He could be one 70 like and not a big one.

2071
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:10.520
He would compare him to like Brandon Thatch.
Like faccia is a big welterweight.

2072
01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:12.540
Anthony Johnson,
when he made welterweight,

2073
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:17.790
I didn't even make sense once.
I think for sure.
I made it three or four times,

2074
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:21.710
three or four times a couple of times he missed it and now he has to cut weight

2075
01:54:21.711 --> 01:54:22.730
to get light heavyweight.

2076
01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:25.850
Chris and I were at masks funeral and that was the first time I met him in

2077
01:54:25.851 --> 01:54:28.580
person and it's one of the most fun,

2078
01:54:28.710 --> 01:54:32.630
like two 41 the most unbelievable things.
If you were mass funeral,

2079
01:54:32.631 --> 01:54:34.460
I was there too,
so we saw each other.

2080
01:54:34.630 --> 01:54:39.380
You remember that fucking blow hard speech that that director went up and gave

2081
01:54:39.381 --> 01:54:43.370
that mask died on a certain day so that he could promote the movie.

2082
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:44.480
Do you remember that shit?

2083
01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.340
Do you remember that guy and I heard he barely even norm that they are now.

2084
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:52.280
They were not best friends or no or I just assumed it was the best friend and he

2085
01:54:52.281 --> 01:54:56.960
was distraught and out.
Why he was being a blowhard.

2086
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:59.390
The guy shouldn't even been able to talk at the female and then that's how

2087
01:54:59.391 --> 01:55:03.980
literally know him and he went up and gave this unbelievably ridiculous

2088
01:55:03.981 --> 01:55:07.320
Hollywood speech of mask dying at a store.

2089
01:55:07.330 --> 01:55:09.350
I was wondering why did he die at this time?

2090
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:12.830
And then I realized he died so that he could promote our movie,

2091
01:55:12.831 --> 01:55:17.000
which is coming out June 20 Ballou
Hollywood.

2092
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:21.740
It was so gross Hollywood,
it was so gross.
Like every you heard like,

2093
01:55:21.810 --> 01:55:25.010
oh,
you heard it like all throughout the,
the,
the,
the room,

2094
01:55:25.011 --> 01:55:27.320
like all these people going,
Oh,
fucking Christ.

2095
01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.660
But it was one of those things where no one could say anything because you're

2096
01:55:29.661 --> 01:55:32.870
trying to be respectful because it's that,
you know,
this funeral.

2097
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:34.740
And then like Dan,
um,

2098
01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:38.770
punk ass went up and told like a real heartfelt thing and you could sell it.

2099
01:55:38.771 --> 01:55:42.440
That was his really good friend and a brother.
And he was,
they were just,

2100
01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:46.210
he was really broken up and like,
you know,

2101
01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:48.270
Tim went up and he was really broken.
I've been in,

2102
01:55:48.271 --> 01:55:52.950
this guy goes up and case this fucking disgusting speech.
How disgusting.

2103
01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:57.920
I mean,
on a one to 10,
it was a tag as a 10.
Yeah,
that was,
that was perfect.
Lead,

2104
01:55:57.921 --> 01:56:00.140
disgusting.
Um,
and I,

2105
01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:04.140
I just assumed that he was being so inappropriate because he was broken up

2106
01:56:04.141 --> 01:56:07.420
inside and I asked a couple of people and like they weren't bear.

2107
01:56:07.421 --> 01:56:09.810
They were barely,
they were acquaintances.
He's just a fraud.

2108
01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.960
Just one of those Hollywood frog who were the two guys that tried to fight at

2109
01:56:12.961 --> 01:56:15.960
the dinner afterwards.
Like two guys are in the UFC,

2110
01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:18.930
maybe I won't name names but two guys in the UFC where the,

2111
01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:22.260
we would have dinner but it's still like a somber experience.
You know,

2112
01:56:22.290 --> 01:56:26.190
we just came from the funeral and two guys in UFC almost got into a fight at

2113
01:56:26.191 --> 01:56:27.990
dinner,
like yelling and screaming at each other.

2114
01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:29.700
If someone just said that like guys,

2115
01:56:29.701 --> 01:56:34.140
shut the fuck down your other book Morial dinner.
Like relax Jesus.

2116
01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:38.790
It's so crazy.
It's so people can't let it go.
They never,

2117
01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.410
there's no safe place at,

2118
01:56:40.411 --> 01:56:42.650
I'm pretty sure they never fought to this day though cause I think they're all

2119
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:44.780
in different weight classes now.
But here's a,

2120
01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:47.610
here's the final thing with retort and Weidman.

2121
01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.030
Vito is trying to hit him with the tour,
had him hurt.

2122
01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:54.990
He hit him with a couple of good shots and Chris stayed right in front of them

2123
01:56:54.991 --> 01:56:58.620
and took the shot.
And then once he got him down,

2124
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.570
he just started smashing them,

2125
01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:05.640
moved into full mount and just beat the fuck out of him.
Here we go.
Boom,

2126
01:57:05.641 --> 01:57:07.230
boom,
boom,
boom.

2127
01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:14.690
Just brutalized them.
And I,
it's a,
it's an old,
old,
old line,

2128
01:57:14.691 --> 01:57:17.470
but you talk about punch black belt once and he's a brown belt and so on.

2129
01:57:17.471 --> 01:57:20.130
And now if he towards just got punched in to being a white belt,

2130
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:24.870
well I don't know.
You know how good vittores tours just straight ground game is.

2131
01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:29.010
I've never seen him roll Jujitsu with like a high level guy.
I've never seen it.

2132
01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:34.020
I saw him almost catch,
he almost caught um,
Jon Jones with an arm bar,

2133
01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:37.080
but John counted wasn't respecting his ground game.

2134
01:57:37.081 --> 01:57:40.470
He's just kind of leaving it out there.
It just,

2135
01:57:40.471 --> 01:57:45.240
it wasn't like a difficult armbar to catch it mean any purple belt who's worth

2136
01:57:45.241 --> 01:57:49.200
his salt could have got that same kind of arm armbar if a guy's like doing that

2137
01:57:49.201 --> 01:57:53.670
with his arm.
But I wanted to love to see like,
you know,

2138
01:57:53.671 --> 01:57:56.550
you hear about guys like this guy's a black ball,
that guy has a black belt,

2139
01:57:56.551 --> 01:58:00.300
like one level.
Are they really like in a real jujitsu sense.
You know,

2140
01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:03.000
it used to be like 10 years ago you heard black belt,
you're like,

2141
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:06.600
this has got to be amazing,
right?
And now you're here black belt.
You're like,

2142
01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.980
well,
what kind of black belt?
Exactly.

2143
01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:12.140
Because there are black belts in their black belts as well.

2144
01:58:12.150 --> 01:58:15.080
There's [inaudible] of the world.
Fucking Jesus,

2145
01:58:15.090 --> 01:58:16.650
the John [inaudible] of the world.
You know,

2146
01:58:16.651 --> 01:58:21.180
there's black belts to just chew up other black belts and his black belt to tap

2147
01:58:21.210 --> 01:58:22.540
other black belts,
you know,

2148
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:26.170
like come come Prieto got tapped by hydro Gracie at that,
uh,

2149
01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:31.380
the um,
UFC event.
You know,
when they have all the grappling thing.
Yeah,
the expo.

2150
01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:35.490
But look competos obviously like super high level black belt,

2151
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:40.260
but Hodra Gracie's level,
that's another level.
And like,

2152
01:58:40.261 --> 01:58:42.130
it's hard to explain that to people and they say like,

2153
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.890
<v 3>well,
this guy's a black.
That guys go,
well,
here's the deal.</v>

2154
01:58:45.190 --> 01:58:49.450
That guy could do anything he wants to me but that guy could do anything you

2155
01:58:49.451 --> 01:58:54.310
want to him.
Like there's levels,
just level set of shovels and there's,

2156
01:58:54.311 --> 01:58:57.900
it's,
it's hard to wrap your and you can't really quantify it.

2157
01:58:57.910 --> 01:59:01.900
It's like black or purple or red or you know at a certain point in time it's

2158
01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:05.680
just a matter of Wa that's Hodrick Gracie and this is just all there is to it

2159
01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:09.640
because I haven't rolled with black belts and look pretty competitive and then

2160
01:59:09.641 --> 01:59:12.750
they rolled with the higher end guys and I feel like I never learned Jujitsu

2161
01:59:13.050 --> 01:59:16.080
wrote with Eddie tonight.
You can grow that.
He was wonderful.
Towel Roll Lips.

2162
01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.920
I can't wait to get fucking tortured by,

2163
01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:22.130
I have rolled away before a couple of times out here.
Wonderful time.
Good.

2164
01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:23.580
He actually will tie it up my years zone.

2165
01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:28.660
It is completely responsible for my ears.
All the cauliflower?
No higher percent.

2166
01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:31.330
No,
I didn't have cauliflower for seven years.

2167
01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:35.040
I had a fight because it's high guard is so terrified and I got hit a couple of

2168
01:59:35.041 --> 01:59:37.990
times so my ears were sore.
I came to la for like a month.

2169
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:42.220
I trained at the lot and the first night he just put me in his rubber guard and

2170
01:59:42.221 --> 01:59:47.080
just shins rubbing across my ears for like four hours and I left and they were

2171
01:59:47.081 --> 01:59:50.440
fucking like that.
They were like,
oh,
why didn't you drain them?

2172
01:59:50.630 --> 01:59:53.410
I so like I didn't know about draining than back then.
This was like,

2173
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:57.670
I had no idea.
I'm like,
I did not know about draining though.
It was like two,

2174
01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:00.910
they were doing that.
The fifties because of a role though,

2175
02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:03.650
there's a Roman statue,

2176
02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:08.020
if you've seen the statue of a gladiator with cauliflower ear that's leaking,

2177
02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:12.040
if it's got a Kylie my cauliflower ear and there's drops coming out of the ear.

2178
02:00:12.490 --> 02:00:16.870
So I have ears like this and the next night I go to the big John's gym and he

2179
02:00:16.871 --> 02:00:20.200
looks at me and goes,
holy fuck,
your years are big.
And he's like,

2180
02:00:20.201 --> 02:00:23.470
you want me to drain them?
I'm like,
I don't know what that means.
And he's like,

2181
02:00:23.590 --> 02:00:26.180
come with me.
And he takes me into the back and like gets,

2182
02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:28.240
gets needle out and drains my years and they go down.

2183
02:00:28.241 --> 02:00:32.560
But I never got them like cut out and stitch.
So they're just fucking big now.

2184
02:00:34.450 --> 02:00:37.720
Well,
they could fix that too.
My friend Brent had his ears cut open.

2185
02:00:37.721 --> 02:00:41.590
They filet them like a salmon and they get in there and they scrape out all the

2186
02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:45.220
cartilage.
I had that shit in my nose.
Oh yeah.

2187
02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.340
Well I always wear ear guards so my ears are okay.

2188
02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:51.730
I will look a little bit of cauliflower and little few spots,
but most of it,

2189
02:00:51.731 --> 02:00:52.900
it's fine.
But you're,

2190
02:00:52.901 --> 02:00:57.130
my nose had been broken so many times that what with cauliflower ear is,

2191
02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:00.780
is when your skin breaks and it fills up with blood.
The blood remains in the,

2192
02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:03.520
in the skin and then it calcifies.

2193
02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:06.760
So when the blood is trapped under the surface of the skin and bulges up and

2194
02:01:06.761 --> 02:01:10.840
like the little Hematoma or whatever you would call it,
that blood becomes hard.

2195
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:14.410
It calcifies and literally becomes like a stone in your body.

2196
02:01:14.590 --> 02:01:18.590
That's why cauliflower ears are harder.
The Rock because they are a rock.
Yeah.

2197
02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.080
It's a calcium rock.

2198
02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:25.150
So what they can do is they cut you open and then they scrape that stuff out and

2199
02:01:25.151 --> 02:01:29.170
then they stitch you back up.
There's the Roman statue,
I think it's Roman,

2200
02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.470
might be Greek.
Is it Roman and Greek says Roman,

2201
02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:35.210
see that those cuts and it's leaking.
I mean,
that's crazy.

2202
02:01:35.211 --> 02:01:37.030
It's a cauliflower ear or they had it back then.

2203
02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:40.220
That will not only do they have color flower here back then,
but a,

2204
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:41.210
<v 0>uh,
uh,</v>

2205
02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:45.980
an MD in New York saw this and he believes he's pretty confident that that's

2206
02:01:45.981 --> 02:01:47.240
actually draining an ear.

2207
02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:50.450
It wasn't just the guy got hit in the ear and he had a cauliflower and just he

2208
02:01:50.451 --> 02:01:53.960
was bleeding.
He believes that that's a medical procedure.
Wow.
And that they were,

2209
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:58.990
they were cutting and draining the ear on purpose in 1100 BC or whenever it was.

2210
02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:02.710
That's crazy because it makes sense if you,
uh,
I mean,

2211
02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.950
you don't really see slices like that.
Right?
Right.
Too much.

2212
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.830
<v 4>He is my cousin weapon now.
Like when I'm grappling,</v>

2213
02:02:08.831 --> 02:02:11.680
I like grinded into someone's head.
And the whole,
the other side because it is,

2214
02:02:11.681 --> 02:02:13.060
it's hard as a rock like you said.

2215
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:15.620
<v 0>Yeah,
look at that picture of the guy when you scroll down,</v>

2216
02:02:15.621 --> 02:02:18.800
like it's on my website wrapped,
blogged about that a couple of years.
Oh really?

2217
02:02:18.801 --> 02:02:23.360
Yeah,
that's,
that's the,
that's the Ugi.
Wow,
that's crazy.

2218
02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:28.460
One of my favorite a cauliflower your stories is I shot a boxing from a DVD with

2219
02:02:28.461 --> 02:02:29.960
a Joe Loza and his brother Danny,

2220
02:02:29.961 --> 02:02:33.990
and they're boxing trainer and Danny comes in late and he's like,
God,

2221
02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:37.910
I can't shoot this.
Look at my ear.
And his ear was all huge and shows like,
oh,

2222
02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:41.210
I can fix this.
So they get a needle and a,

2223
02:02:41.211 --> 02:02:46.010
they go in the bathroom and Joe Jams and needle in and Danny starts screaming

2224
02:02:46.011 --> 02:02:47.870
and they're basically in a fist fight with each other,

2225
02:02:47.871 --> 02:02:51.080
with a needle through the year and somebody looks at it and he goes,
dude,

2226
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:54.500
that needle is going all the way through the ear.
So the,

2227
02:02:54.501 --> 02:02:58.550
the needle didn't stop in the middle to drain the fluid out and it's cured all

2228
02:02:58.551 --> 02:02:59.720
the way through Danny's ear.

2229
02:02:59.721 --> 02:03:02.340
And the two of them are wrestling around with each other.
Right.

2230
02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:07.570
<v 4>It is on video.
Well that was another example.
Two brothers,</v>

2231
02:03:07.571 --> 02:03:10.060
you'd beat the fuck out of each other and they both became very tough.

2232
02:03:10.090 --> 02:03:10.923
There's a wrench.

2233
02:03:10.930 --> 02:03:14.410
You ever see the video and I'm fighting on the front lawn and their analysts and

2234
02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:17.760
they were fighting.
It was like NHB headbutts and Ella.

2235
02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:20.800
Joe used to always get the better of it,
but yeah,
he was always the big brother.

2236
02:03:20.801 --> 02:03:23.710
He started training first.
That's my problem.
Good man.

2237
02:03:23.711 --> 02:03:27.100
He just doesn't have that same like drive that Joe has like the mental side.

2238
02:03:27.101 --> 02:03:31.330
Danny is incredible.
He's the guy that like leaves the gym for four months,

2239
02:03:31.331 --> 02:03:34.870
comes in and beats up everybody.
But he doesn't have that like whatever.

2240
02:03:34.871 --> 02:03:38.350
They shape the like to stay in shape,
to stay motivated to stay in the gym.

2241
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:39.223
Does he still fighting?

2242
02:03:39.970 --> 02:03:44.470
Fighting fight August 16th for local show up.

2243
02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:48.670
Tell him or island.
So did you train hard now?
He's trading now pretty well.

2244
02:03:48.690 --> 02:03:51.940
We'll see you guys.
Yeah,
and he traded a couple of other local gyms.

2245
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:54.790
There they are.
Yeah.
This is like,
oh,

2246
02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:59.660
this is before the USC 2002 maybe.
Oh my God.
Yeah,

2247
02:03:59.661 --> 02:04:00.494
this is a fight.

2248
02:04:00.710 --> 02:04:04.580
They fight twice cause Joe wins and then Danny wants to fight again.
Oh my God,

2249
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:05.414
look at this.

2250
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:06.240
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2251
02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:09.300
<v 4>Did he win by arm bar here?
I think he does it fit.
Oh,</v>

2252
02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:12.580
I don't remember specifically now.
It's so crazy.
There's brothers just,

2253
02:04:12.630 --> 02:04:16.430
and this is all family on the front lawn watching family and friends and like

2254
02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:21.270
the pig and they're fighting.
Yeah.
I mean they are fucking fighting.
Yeah.

2255
02:04:21.271 --> 02:04:23.520
This is a tight ass triangle.
Does he tap here?
Yeah,

2256
02:04:23.521 --> 02:04:26.460
but then he pushes him and they fight again.
There it is.

2257
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:28.263
<v 6>No</v>

2258
02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:35.730
<v 4>big biggie though.
Rough.
Huh?
Ah,
that's literally like a south shore community.</v>

2259
02:04:35.731 --> 02:04:38.100
Family Street,
like neighbors are there.
Like

2260
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:41.820
<v 1>the cousins are there and you guys had a pig roast too,
right?
Yeah.
Well his uh,</v>

2261
02:04:41.850 --> 02:04:44.700
his parents for years.
How the pig roast every summer.
So that's what we were,

2262
02:04:44.701 --> 02:04:48.270
there's like a hundred people there and I don't know how it even started.

2263
02:04:48.271 --> 02:04:52.020
It's just,
hey,
fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
And that was like,

2264
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:56.670
what's five shorts on and a cop and gloves and the whole deal.
Funny,
Danny,

2265
02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:00.240
since he was 18,
it has never worn jeans without sprawl.

2266
02:05:00.241 --> 02:05:03.960
Shorts underneath him for his entire adult life.
He's always ready to go.

2267
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:08.160
So he just takes his pants off and can fly.
You know he's,
he wears his pants.

2268
02:05:08.161 --> 02:05:11.490
Lewis.
He's got big jeans.
Have you seen the goals,
these pants called?
Uh,

2269
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:16.290
the column,
barbell shorts,
not shorts,
a barbell,

2270
02:05:16.291 --> 02:05:19.890
jeans,
barbell brand jeans.
I'm wearing them right now.
These guys sent them to me,

2271
02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:24.030
their jeans,
but they're stretching.
Oh Shit,
dude.
They're incredible.

2272
02:05:24.031 --> 02:05:28.770
I think I need to really look at us.
They don't hold you back at all.

2273
02:05:29.370 --> 02:05:30.780
They don't,
they don't bind up at all.

2274
02:05:30.781 --> 02:05:33.690
Like you could throw full power kicks at least can you work out in it?

2275
02:05:33.691 --> 02:05:37.450
Can you say that?
Yeah.
You could do anything.
Can No,

2276
02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:40.450
no worry about the way your legs move half to Google.
Those things,

2277
02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:45.570
having tights on barbell jeans?
I have no,
uh,
they're called,

2278
02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:48.510
this is a company that I have no affiliation with them.

2279
02:05:48.511 --> 02:05:51.240
They just sent me a pair of these and I fucking love them.
They're amazing.

2280
02:05:51.241 --> 02:05:53.500
They make shorts now too.
So they have a,

2281
02:05:53.501 --> 02:05:56.120
the MMA shorts are the same material but the,

2282
02:05:56.121 --> 02:06:00.360
the jeans look and feel like jeans except in the way you move.

2283
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:03.210
There's just some sort of elastic quality to them,
to the pants.

2284
02:06:03.810 --> 02:06:06.190
And this is a new company there.
I've,

2285
02:06:06.410 --> 02:06:10.080
I bought some before from some other companies that make them like for hockey

2286
02:06:10.081 --> 02:06:14.040
players and stuff because I don't fit in regular pants cause I have a fucking

2287
02:06:14.041 --> 02:06:17.760
troll body.
My uh,
I have a third really my,

2288
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:19.920
I wear 32 but I have to wear a belt.

2289
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:24.660
I really have a 30 inch waist but I have big ass thighs and so I have to like a

2290
02:06:24.661 --> 02:06:26.850
lot of times I wear a 33 inch pants,

2291
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:31.560
straight leg just so I can get them past my mid thigh cause otherwise I can't

2292
02:06:31.561 --> 02:06:34.770
like Levi's five o ones are a joke.
I can't even wear them.

2293
02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:38.610
I literally can't get them on like they get to right here and they just lock up.

2294
02:06:39.210 --> 02:06:44.130
But these,
these barbell pants,
they just fit like a glove.
It's incredible.

2295
02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:47.310
Look at that.
Look at all their stretch was snap.

2296
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:51.360
We were talking about how technology improves things.
This is embarrassing,

2297
02:06:51.361 --> 02:06:54.620
but I remember in the 80s I bought Chuck Norris kicking jeans.

2298
02:06:56.400 --> 02:07:00.330
They had ties in the front and a a pleaded crotch and the advertising.

2299
02:07:00.331 --> 02:07:02.970
It was the secret.
It's in the crotch.

2300
02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:09.480
Somehow I found that compelling and checked ours always through kicks with the

2301
02:07:09.481 --> 02:07:14.100
fucking cowboy boots on.
He always had those cowboy boots on with the heel.

2302
02:07:14.101 --> 02:07:17.790
The wooden,
he'll look it up.
Awesome

2303
02:07:20.630 --> 02:07:23.130
man.
Team 95 that's what I've had.
Well,

2304
02:07:23.131 --> 02:07:25.560
they had a gusset and then there's another band.

2305
02:07:25.590 --> 02:07:29.850
There's another brand called diamond gusset jeans and I used to buy those a lot

2306
02:07:29.851 --> 02:07:33.270
too,
and that's what they were.
It was like a regular pair of jeans,

2307
02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:36.640
but they put a gusset and the crotch so that you can move around better,

2308
02:07:37.450 --> 02:07:41.170
but none of those can fuck.
Don't buy new way.
Don't bind your legs,

2309
02:07:41.290 --> 02:07:45.340
but none of those can fuck with the barbell jeans,
barbell jeans,
they nailed it.

2310
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:47.980
They know what the fuck they're doing.
But those tie in the front,

2311
02:07:47.981 --> 02:07:52.000
that's bullshit.
That's how those uh,
these to have those uh,
karate,
PKA,

2312
02:07:52.001 --> 02:07:56.560
karate pants.
I used to wear those with my taekwondo.
Gee,
my taekwondo,

2313
02:07:56.561 --> 02:08:01.420
the doe buck.
I used to wear those,
those different pants,
the,

2314
02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:03.850
the century pants at tied up in the front because they kicked better.

2315
02:08:03.851 --> 02:08:06.340
They were better.
They were looser.
They're looser on your body.

2316
02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:11.320
They figured out a way to make them less binding.
Like even Moy Thai shorts,
man,

2317
02:08:11.321 --> 02:08:14.890
a lot of them only Thai shorts fucking bind on you.
I get to see a lot.

2318
02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.510
Alan Belcher used to fight.
They'd be all rolled up,
all like got to,

2319
02:08:20.050 --> 02:08:23.830
they pulled them out cause Alan has those giant tree trunk legs,
you know,

2320
02:08:23.831 --> 02:08:26.500
and a lot of those pants they bind out like Melvin Manhoef.

2321
02:08:26.501 --> 02:08:31.420
He would wear like a gladiator skirt,
you know,
because his legs are huge.

2322
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:32.710
I wonder if it is a,

2323
02:08:32.711 --> 02:08:36.700
a western body kind of a thing because I've never really seen a tie guy with

2324
02:08:36.701 --> 02:08:38.710
huge,
huge,
huge thighs.
Yeah.

2325
02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:43.740
Maybe they're designed for more slight 145 to 105 pound definite tie fighters.

2326
02:08:44.171 --> 02:08:45.070
Definitely.
I mean why,

2327
02:08:45.071 --> 02:08:48.550
why would they design them for people that don't even wear them and their world

2328
02:08:48.551 --> 02:08:53.260
at least.
But the um,
the thing about like guys who weight lift,

2329
02:08:53.261 --> 02:08:57.160
if you lift weights and you developed a big ass fucking football player thighs

2330
02:08:57.161 --> 02:09:00.430
or something like that,
your regular pants are just not going to fit you.
I will.

2331
02:09:00.490 --> 02:09:04.720
I'm always amazed when I wear XL.
I'm like,
I'm fucking five eight.

2332
02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:10.060
What about a real XL person?
What the hell do they were?
You know how,
how is,

2333
02:09:10.070 --> 02:09:11.410
how am I an XL?

2334
02:09:11.411 --> 02:09:15.280
What the fuck does a guy like big John Ware or Stephan struve.

2335
02:09:15.330 --> 02:09:19.780
I mean how many x's is in his fucking clothes?
They must be custom made.

2336
02:09:19.781 --> 02:09:24.510
I mean how many guys are Stephen's truths and big John has to 50 or some to 40.

2337
02:09:24.570 --> 02:09:28.240
I love him.
She said he was two 50.
Going to talk about his weight though.

2338
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:30.760
Don't ask them about it.
Don't ask him.

2339
02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:33.850
Well if you go back to UFC one and you'll look at them,

2340
02:09:33.851 --> 02:09:38.310
then you look at them now in terms of sharing something about the dark.

2341
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:42.040
Yeah,
I don't think he's two 40 I think it's quite a bit bigger than that,

2342
02:09:42.041 --> 02:09:45.880
but point being is he's a real XL dude.
That's a real,

2343
02:09:45.881 --> 02:09:50.800
I'm not fucking XL,
so what?
What?
Why do they do that?
Who the hell small?

2344
02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:55.210
Who the hell was wearing a small the sun oven and you have to be really fucking

2345
02:09:55.260 --> 02:10:00.220
a small,
would you look at that?
It's,
it's bizarre.
It's bizarre.

2346
02:10:00.221 --> 02:10:02.380
The sizing,
you know,
the people have,

2347
02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:06.370
I think in the future we're going to get all of our clothes from three d

2348
02:10:06.371 --> 02:10:09.820
printers.
That's what I think.
Just printed the fit.
Yeah,
I really do.

2349
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:13.750
They're there.
They're doing all kinds of crazy shit with three d printers now.

2350
02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:16.150
I think that's probably the future of pretty much everything.

2351
02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:21.220
They can firearms already or arms or something that gets subject to a lot more

2352
02:10:21.221 --> 02:10:23.020
stress than than than closing does.
I mean,

2353
02:10:23.021 --> 02:10:27.130
if you can make firearms pretty soon they'll be able to make clothing on demand.

2354
02:10:27.190 --> 02:10:28.920
I think that's what you're going to get.
Like everything.

2355
02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:32.170
If you want to buy a computer,
what you're gonna do is you're gonna,
you know,

2356
02:10:32.171 --> 02:10:34.190
it's like buying a license

2357
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:35.690
<v 3>for your computer from somewhere.</v>

2358
02:10:35.691 --> 02:10:38.960
You're going to get a license for it and then you're just gonna like a,
you know,

2359
02:10:38.961 --> 02:10:41.780
like a one click on apple or something like that and then you're just going to

2360
02:10:41.781 --> 02:10:44.210
print up your computer.
I really think that,

2361
02:10:44.211 --> 02:10:45.980
I think you're just going to have like a printer,

2362
02:10:46.190 --> 02:10:50.390
but that printer is going to have raw materials like metals and minerals or

2363
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:53.660
whatever you need for batteries or what have you and you're just gonna print it.

2364
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:56.410
<v 0>Have you invested in any of that?
No.
This is one of the most,</v>

2365
02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:59.440
la is one of those creative areas and the

2366
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:03.850
<v 3>silicone valley.
That's where all the computer stuff's going down.</v>

2367
02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.960
<v 0>You must have opportunities though to people must approach you with okay.</v>

2368
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:10.400
<v 3>Kinds of stuff.
I wouldn't thinking God investing in anything.</v>

2369
02:11:10.401 --> 02:11:13.640
I don't have time to do what I'm already doing.
I'm trying to size down.

2370
02:11:13.641 --> 02:11:14.750
I'm trying to do less shit.

2371
02:11:14.770 --> 02:11:17.840
The last thing I want to do is this kind of making it a t shirt here at Jamie.

2372
02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:21.670
Is that what this is?
Look at this how so?
They're already ready.
Look,

2373
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:25.130
every time this is my problem,
whenever I have an idea,
they've already done it.

2374
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:29.960
There's a video online about it.
Let me see the video.
That's it.

2375
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:35.300
Oh,
okay.
So what he does is he takes,

2376
02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:37.940
uh,
a pattern in there,

2377
02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.790
locks in place and that's the printer.

2378
02:11:40.791 --> 02:11:45.200
And then it just starts adding material to that pattern.
Wow.
Makes sense man.

2379
02:11:45.490 --> 02:11:47.450
And then it makes it a wife beater,

2380
02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:51.380
put it on and you fucking go to the pizza place.

2381
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:55.430
Order a slice.
It's funny that they use wife beaters,

2382
02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:57.470
like why they decided he's a wife beater there,
right?

2383
02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:01.100
That you're a target market.
The wife either market.
Yeah.
A lot of dudes.

2384
02:12:01.101 --> 02:12:02.990
You'd beat the shit out of their wives.
They like to make their own shirt

2385
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:08.120
in the future.
Man,

2386
02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:12.530
I think medical technology is the most fascinating thing as far as MMA.

2387
02:12:12.690 --> 02:12:17.660
I about hit like healing people,
like figuring out a way to uh,
fix brains,

2388
02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:21.200
figuring out a way to,
uh,
people that had been injured.
You know,

2389
02:12:21.201 --> 02:12:24.650
people that have been KOD there,
they're talking about,
uh,
you know,

2390
02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:28.490
taking people that have been injured and directly putting him in like cryo

2391
02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:30.860
chambers and that the amount of,
uh,

2392
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:35.480
damage that they can stop and the damage they can mitigate and once they can

2393
02:12:35.481 --> 02:12:37.250
figure out how to,
right now,

2394
02:12:37.251 --> 02:12:41.390
there's no real technology to reverse brain damage.
You know,

2395
02:12:41.391 --> 02:12:44.420
like if they break your,
if you break your arm,
they can fix it.
You know,

2396
02:12:44.421 --> 02:12:47.090
if you have a knee injury,
they can fix your ligaments.

2397
02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:50.570
If you have a brain injury,
you're pretty fucked.
You know,

2398
02:12:50.571 --> 02:12:52.410
there's not a whole lot they can do.
You know,

2399
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:54.380
they can help you try to heal yourself.

2400
02:12:54.381 --> 02:12:58.930
There's a little bit of therapy they can do as a few new ways that they can kind

2401
02:12:58.931 --> 02:13:02.150
of mitigate the issues.
But for the most part,
when you have a brain injury,

2402
02:13:02.151 --> 02:13:05.870
you have a brain injury.
Yeah.
Puts you in a helmet so you will get worse.

2403
02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:08.150
<v 0>They,
they really don't know.</v>

2404
02:13:08.151 --> 02:13:11.150
I've got a friend of the family at girl I used to Babysit who uh,

2405
02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:15.140
had a terrible brain injury from a,
that street luge sport.

2406
02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:18.590
She Bang the hell out of her head and she would do,
you know,

2407
02:13:18.591 --> 02:13:22.970
the doctor just said don't go outside for six months and don't read any books

2408
02:13:22.971 --> 02:13:26.150
for six months in the reading the books don't do anything,

2409
02:13:26.151 --> 02:13:30.530
just cocoon your entire consciousness from the entire outside world.

2410
02:13:30.531 --> 02:13:31.770
Sterilize the house.

2411
02:13:31.771 --> 02:13:36.150
And after like I think four months she said you can get a baby chicken because

2412
02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:36.900
the,
you know,

2413
02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:39.450
don't spend a lot of time with people cause that's an awful lot of thought.

2414
02:13:39.451 --> 02:13:42.660
And even a cat would be too interactive but she thought a little baby chick

2415
02:13:42.661 --> 02:13:46.680
would be some human thing you could interact with a little bit low,
low,
low.

2416
02:13:47.550 --> 02:13:48.060
But you know,

2417
02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:53.060
at a top MD at mass general hospital saying buy a chicken to fix your brain

2418
02:13:53.851 --> 02:13:57.690
indicates at the level of understanding is,
as you said,
that very low.

2419
02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:02.040
There's not much they can do.
Don't even talk to people.
Yeah,
he do that.

2420
02:14:03.650 --> 02:14:07.050
She had some family money and sort of cocoon herself away.

2421
02:14:07.051 --> 02:14:10.470
And how old was she when this happened?
Mid Forties

2422
02:14:10.990 --> 02:14:14.860
<v 3>Oh my God.
Mid Forties when it happened.
Yeah.
Whoa.</v>

2423
02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:17.620
So she was on a street luge,

2424
02:14:17.621 --> 02:14:20.450
like like a skateboard type thing rolling down the hill.
I don't,

2425
02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.220
I don't understand the scope they do with the x games is like a Bob sweat on

2426
02:14:24.221 --> 02:14:26.140
wheels and they go down steep hills.

2427
02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:29.440
It makes you think about all those videos that you laugh out on live leak where

2428
02:14:29.441 --> 02:14:31.360
a guy gets fucking clipped on his ankles,

2429
02:14:31.361 --> 02:14:35.220
buy a car and flips through the air and lands on the CAC.
I can't watch it.

2430
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:40.120
How many people would just get so fucked up by those things and we never think

2431
02:14:40.121 --> 02:14:44.950
about it again.
Yeah.
Or The guy dead UCM montage in those shows.

2432
02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.600
They get hit by a truck going across the highway.
Ah,

2433
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:51.970
maybe that guy is dead or brain dead.

2434
02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:55.960
Well there was a guy in la that are California southern California that got in

2435
02:14:55.961 --> 02:15:00.961
trouble recently cause they were drifting and he drifted into a pass into a

2436
02:15:01.181 --> 02:15:05.650
bystander,
clipped him.
There's a video of it.
See if you can find out giappo link.

2437
02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:10.900
A drifter hits pedestrian and took off.
I don't know what the story is,

2438
02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:13.990
but they were all trying to find this guy and it was a total hit and run.

2439
02:15:14.230 --> 02:15:18.120
He clipped this guy with a side of his car as he was going sideways and you,

2440
02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:22.060
you would think you would like fall,
like got knocked back or something.

2441
02:15:22.061 --> 02:15:25.240
I know you flipped through the fucking air.
Like you weigh nothing.

2442
02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:28.600
You flip to the air like one of those little paper footballs think,
you know,

2443
02:15:28.630 --> 02:15:31.240
you know when you do those things,
yeah.
You remember those.

2444
02:15:31.570 --> 02:15:35.260
That's what it looks like when this guy gets clipped sideways on him by his

2445
02:15:35.261 --> 02:15:39.890
ankles and goes hurling through the air.
It's terrifying.
And now that you,

2446
02:15:39.891 --> 02:15:40.890
you know,
I,

2447
02:15:41.050 --> 02:15:44.980
my exposure to people getting hit in the head is so much more than the average

2448
02:15:44.981 --> 02:15:48.910
person's,
I don't think this is it,
but it's one of them.
Here's one.

2449
02:15:49.570 --> 02:15:53.830
Oh no,
that's different.
That guy got hit head on.
That guy broke his legs.

2450
02:15:54.370 --> 02:15:58.120
This one.
Um,
he got hit with the back and he goes hurling through the air.

2451
02:15:58.300 --> 02:15:59.260
But point being,

2452
02:15:59.650 --> 02:16:02.710
I can't look at those anymore and not think about the consequences.

2453
02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:07.930
I know there's a woman who fights in the UFC that I'm not even the,

2454
02:16:07.931 --> 02:16:08.890
her last fight,

2455
02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:13.690
but the fight before that fucked her up so much that to this day she's got all

2456
02:16:13.691 --> 02:16:16.840
these hormone problems.
Her cortisol levels are too high.

2457
02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:19.450
She gains weight and she doesn't know why she gets depressed.

2458
02:16:19.451 --> 02:16:23.800
She has no why her equilibrium's all fucked up and it's not even from our last

2459
02:16:23.801 --> 02:16:27.310
fight.
It's from the fight before her last fight.
He's,
yeah,

2460
02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:30.910
and we don't think about it because we watched those.
What a war.
Wow.

2461
02:16:30.911 --> 02:16:33.520
Those girls really fucking put it out there.
You move on,

2462
02:16:33.521 --> 02:16:36.850
you with your life and then she,
the lights go off.
You know the,

2463
02:16:36.851 --> 02:16:40.690
the spotlights are down and she's by herself.
Her fucking head is going to

2464
02:16:43.390 --> 02:16:45.610
the throbbing and the pain and the aches.

2465
02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:49.840
I'm sure both of you have experienced that before.
Every day of the week.

2466
02:16:49.841 --> 02:16:53.620
Pretty much at my gym.
Unlike the punching bag at my gym,
cause I'm just,

2467
02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:58.450
here it is.
There it is.
That's the one,
watch this,
watch this.
He goes sideways.

2468
02:16:58.451 --> 02:17:02.830
Watch this guy.
Oh,
see how the guy flies through the look of this?

2469
02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:04.893
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

2470
02:17:06.530 --> 02:17:11.450
<v 3>Oh my God.
That's crazy.
Right being,
yeah,</v>

2471
02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:12.620
I don't want to watch it again,

2472
02:17:13.090 --> 02:17:17.900
but don't go to the street while people are drifting.
Right.
Cocky bitch.

2473
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:19.880
Don't watch the street while they're doing it.
Yeah.

2474
02:17:19.881 --> 02:17:22.280
I don't know if they caught that guy and find out if they called that guy.

2475
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:26.930
But the damage that these guys receive on a daily basis,

2476
02:17:26.931 --> 02:17:28.700
like we were talking about the Rory Macdonald fight,

2477
02:17:28.701 --> 02:17:32.360
or like a lot of these fights,
you watch it and you,
you don't think about it.

2478
02:17:32.390 --> 02:17:33.710
You just go on with your life.

2479
02:17:33.711 --> 02:17:38.711
But every now and then you'll run into one of those guys years later from that

2480
02:17:39.171 --> 02:17:40.430
doesn't fight it anymore and you're like,

2481
02:17:40.431 --> 02:17:43.280
whatever happened to that guy and then you'll see him somewhere and you're like,

2482
02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:47.420
oh shit.
Yeah.
And you'll talk to them and you'll hear him slurring their words.

2483
02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:51.860
I remember the first time I was a training in,
um,

2484
02:17:51.890 --> 02:17:56.860
in Boston and my boxing coach was this guy,
Joe Lake Kawanna training.

2485
02:17:56.890 --> 02:18:00.500
Uh,
Dana Rosenblatt.
I remember David Rosenblatt.
Dangerous.
Yeah,
dangerous.

2486
02:18:00.501 --> 02:18:03.470
Tana Rosenblatt,
who was a,
a training partner of mine.

2487
02:18:03.471 --> 02:18:06.830
He was one of the guys that got me convinced me to stop fighting because I

2488
02:18:06.831 --> 02:18:09.470
realized like I wasn't training the way he was training cause I was trying to do

2489
02:18:09.471 --> 02:18:12.380
comedy and all these different things at the same time,
but I was still fighting.

2490
02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:13.910
And then I really didn't,

2491
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.000
I wasn't realizing how much dedication I let slip by until I watched him train.

2492
02:18:19.311 --> 02:18:22.900
I trained with them and I realized,
okay,
I need to get out of here.
And I'm only,

2493
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:27.740
I was only 21 at the time.
He was like 17 or 18,
I think it was 18.
But,

2494
02:18:27.741 --> 02:18:32.270
um,
we,
we train at this gym with a bunch of like really tough guys.

2495
02:18:32.271 --> 02:18:35.180
And Joe Lake,
who was my boxing coach,
was that,

2496
02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:40.130
that prototypical South Boston boxing trainers,
fucking wars.

2497
02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:42.620
It was wars in the gym every day there was wars.

2498
02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:44.710
There wasn't no pity pat bullshit.
You,

2499
02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:49.610
you were going to war and I watched a few guys that I knew from a few years back

2500
02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:53.270
come in the gym and they would just slur and start talking funny.
I was like,

2501
02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:57.320
Holy Shit,
I'm looking at fucking brain damage.

2502
02:18:57.470 --> 02:19:00.260
Like I'm looking at it and here's the guy that I knew five years ago and he

2503
02:19:00.261 --> 02:19:02.360
didn't have it and now I'm talking to him.

2504
02:19:02.361 --> 02:19:05.480
I haven't seen him in awhile and he's got it and it started to sink in like

2505
02:19:05.540 --> 02:19:09.170
these headaches and I'm getting from these training sessions like this isn't

2506
02:19:09.171 --> 02:19:12.410
free,
isn't it free?
I'm not,
I'm not immune.
You know like,

2507
02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:15.710
and you watch Joe Frazier talk on TV.
Where do you think that came from?

2508
02:19:15.930 --> 02:19:18.620
It came from getting punched in the head.
It's,
no,
there's no way around it

2509
02:19:18.890 --> 02:19:22.040
<v 0>because the thing about it that I find that haunts me and yeah,</v>

2510
02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:23.710
I'll be honest in Huntsville in,
in,

2511
02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:28.670
cause it may start happening in our sport is a CT sometimes doesn't manifest

2512
02:19:28.671 --> 02:19:31.400
itself until five or even 10 years after retirement.

2513
02:19:31.401 --> 02:19:35.150
The guy's fine could be a commentator on TVS.

2514
02:19:35.151 --> 02:19:38.570
Everything in his brain is working well and then five years kicks in six years

2515
02:19:38.571 --> 02:19:41.210
and all of a sudden he starts getting a little more aggressive and his gate

2516
02:19:41.211 --> 02:19:46.211
isn't as good and he said d becomes a different person and his soul starts to to

2517
02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:49.850
to to piss away and that,
that scary.
If that starts to happen,
it'll,

2518
02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:52.220
it'll give me,

2519
02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:54.320
<v 3>that doesn't scare you Chris.
You just staring at the table.</v>

2520
02:19:54.370 --> 02:19:58.880
They get about your brain.
I don't know.
I've never been really hit hard enough.

2521
02:19:58.881 --> 02:20:01.160
I guess I my head gigantic.

2522
02:20:01.161 --> 02:20:05.110
I'd never done nothing like Gary Goodrich.
Gigantic.

2523
02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:07.700
You guys in your gym though that have punchy,

2524
02:20:07.930 --> 02:20:11.510
I know guys that have fought like twice in their whole career in already.

2525
02:20:11.511 --> 02:20:12.260
Like they just,

2526
02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:14.990
that one fight did the men and they should never fight again because they're

2527
02:20:14.991 --> 02:20:18.680
just punchy.
Oh,
Julio Cesar Chavez and Meldrick Taylor,

2528
02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:21.980
they fought one time and Meldrick was never the same again.

2529
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:26.090
Now who's Chavez beat him into a different person now who lost?
I was like,
Dad,

2530
02:20:26.091 --> 02:20:29.090
this Sean Gannon,
when you fought Kimball for a half hour,

2531
02:20:29.091 --> 02:20:33.170
he was never the same from that day on.
That fight was fucking crazy.

2532
02:20:33.171 --> 02:20:38.171
And that was an underground exclusive because everybody talked about that on the

2533
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:41.910
Ugi I was streaming fight.
You set that?
I set that up.
Yeah.

2534
02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:46.610
That was after Kimbo had become this internet celebrity.
What year was that?

2535
02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:52.190
Truth was in in two.
No later than two,
five,
two,

2536
02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:56.390
five ish because I had to drive,
drove home from college to get to that fight.

2537
02:20:56.391 --> 02:21:00.170
So then when the 2002 to 2004 yeah,

2538
02:21:00.171 --> 02:21:02.960
I was in college in Boston,
still a so someone was like,
dude,

2539
02:21:02.961 --> 02:21:05.810
Kim over scans going down in that hour,
you gotta get down here.
I'm like,

2540
02:21:05.811 --> 02:21:10.750
Kenny Florian posted about it on the Uga pops up like he's done,
he's done.

2541
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:15.190
He's back.
He's basically,
yeah,
he gets back like a week ago.
Well,

2542
02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:18.090
he hasn't fought in a while.
It's feelings won't get hurt as bad.
Right.

2543
02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:20.810
They talk a lot of shit on his commentary though.
Yeah,

2544
02:21:20.811 --> 02:21:23.780
I'm sure they did an excellent comments.
Taste very good.
But it doesn't matter.

2545
02:21:23.781 --> 02:21:25.010
People are cons.
Yeah,

2546
02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:27.880
they touched you and everyone who's good at their job but they don't want to

2547
02:21:27.881 --> 02:21:30.920
give a Falk was though people that don't give a fuck,

2548
02:21:30.921 --> 02:21:34.370
they're just looking to be mad at anybody but their mom or whoever's fucking

2549
02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:37.940
yelling at them at work or you know,
whatever your issue is,

2550
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:40.400
you're taking it out on Kenny Florian.

2551
02:21:40.401 --> 02:21:43.430
But really you're mad that you live in your mother's basement and that's the

2552
02:21:43.431 --> 02:21:46.480
reality.
That's reality.
You know,
100% this,

2553
02:21:46.690 --> 02:21:49.070
there's a certain amount of people that are just getting fined.

2554
02:21:49.310 --> 02:21:54.250
People mad at anything.
But Kenny I think was posting about it on the Eugene.

2555
02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:57.590
That's how I found out about it because a,
I knew about Sean,

2556
02:21:57.591 --> 02:22:01.940
I knew Sean Gannon from the fight world and I knew about Kimbo obviously from

2557
02:22:01.941 --> 02:22:05.300
these youtube videos and I couldn't believe that they had actually organized a

2558
02:22:05.301 --> 02:22:08.540
fucking real fist fight.
And it went down.
Jamie,

2559
02:22:08.541 --> 02:22:11.180
pull that video up cause that's a fucking God damn crazy video.

2560
02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:15.770
That was the first time Kimbo fought someone who actually knew how to fight and

2561
02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:16.100
you know,

2562
02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:21.100
he became this internet celebrity by just lighting these idiots up in backyards

2563
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:23.850
and we'll move away from those satellite dish.
And you know,

2564
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:30.050
their metal said guy where he left on his eyeball or something or he beat the

2565
02:22:30.151 --> 02:22:33.690
fuck out of some people and he showed some good hands,
showed some good skills.

2566
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:38.550
But then he fought Sean Gannon and Sean Gannon.
First of all he was in shape,

2567
02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:43.110
you know,
and he had an iron chin and he's a cop and he's got an iron heart.

2568
02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:46.770
He was a boxer.
Golden gloves at least though just isn't as you know,

2569
02:22:46.771 --> 02:22:50.910
it's not everything but he was a boxer but for sure he was in like the South

2570
02:22:50.910 --> 02:22:53.410
Boston.
Jim's forever like training.
He was a good vibe there.

2571
02:22:54.030 --> 02:22:59.030
They both came out of that wrecked and the the funny thing is they came up with

2572
02:22:59.251 --> 02:23:02.160
a bunch of crazy rules in this fight.
Like as it was going down,

2573
02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:05.850
there was a 30 count.
Mike Littlefield still has the rules written down.

2574
02:23:05.851 --> 02:23:07.830
He had the glasses and it's got blood on it.

2575
02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:12.090
It's crazy because Kimbo tagged him with a bunch of punches,

2576
02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:14.190
but they weren't taking them out.

2577
02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:18.690
And after a while Gan and started hitting the body and we started working like,

2578
02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:18.920
hey,

2579
02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:23.920
this combination mean he's tagging Kimbo and to Kimbos hanging in there and then

2580
02:23:24.050 --> 02:23:28.920
that Kimbo shoots,
that was illegal.
That was the first,
uh,
rule break.

2581
02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:32.820
But entire fight with Canon is getting a standing guillotine and he's holding

2582
02:23:32.821 --> 02:23:35.850
onto him in a choke.
And then all of these,
uh,
these,

2583
02:23:36.090 --> 02:23:39.760
that was the legal according to the rules,
that was,

2584
02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:42.140
he had the alligator jacket elegant a suitcase.

2585
02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:46.140
You guys touching them while they're fighting?
Oh No,
not them.
And he's saying,

2586
02:23:46.141 --> 02:23:49.560
let go,
let go.
And he's trying to pry him away and then they're prying him away.

2587
02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:52.500
He's like this crazy,
like what are the fucking rules?

2588
02:23:53.490 --> 02:23:55.920
I was very convinced I was going to get shot that night.
No,

2589
02:23:55.921 --> 02:24:00.420
all the Kimball's guys had been disarmed.
Well there are cops,
you know,

2590
02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:04.290
and then Kimbo got him down and Kimbo was trying to ground and pound him,

2591
02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:06.860
which was against the religion was against the rules.

2592
02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:10.730
So Kimbo try to ground and pound began and got back up to his feet and just

2593
02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:15.840
heart,
you know,
you just couldn't wear again and out that easy.

2594
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:18.600
He was,
he was a guy who was used to brawling too.

2595
02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:23.280
He had been in the deep water before and figured out a way to swim,
you know,

2596
02:24:23.281 --> 02:24:25.890
and Kimball.
I don't think he'd really been in deep water.

2597
02:24:25.891 --> 02:24:30.450
This was like the first time hood fights for like a minute and a half long.

2598
02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:34.200
Now you're looking at Kimbo was already exhausted and Gannon is just starting to

2599
02:24:34.201 --> 02:24:38.490
beat the fuck out of him and now you know Cambos there's the punches are coming

2600
02:24:38.491 --> 02:24:41.610
real labor and he's trying to push Gan and off the fucking wall.

2601
02:24:41.611 --> 02:24:43.360
You there when we built that wall?
No,

2602
02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:46.230
we hit to show up early and build that wall because they didn't have one there

2603
02:24:46.231 --> 02:24:49.710
for this fight.
It's funny,
it didn't,
didn't last long either.

2604
02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:53.310
This is a crazy fight that's available online.
You can watch it.

2605
02:24:53.311 --> 02:24:55.070
But I remember it was a,

2606
02:24:55.071 --> 02:24:59.870
a bunch of us were alive watching this and commenting on the underground while

2607
02:24:59.871 --> 02:25:02.610
it was happening.
I was reading thread and watching the fight.
I was like,

2608
02:25:02.611 --> 02:25:07.410
this is crazy.
You know,
we're all trying to figure out what was going to happen.

2609
02:25:07.411 --> 02:25:11.700
And they showed Shawn's face at the end of it and that's when it really hit home

2610
02:25:11.701 --> 02:25:14.280
because you're watching,
this is all blurry,
grainy,

2611
02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:18.750
really shitty fucking webcam video looking.

2612
02:25:18.930 --> 02:25:21.990
But you see the end of,
you see the end of the video,

2613
02:25:21.991 --> 02:25:24.120
they get a closeup of Sean's face and

2614
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:27.880
<v 4>he looks like the elephant man.
Yeah,
we have all that old footage.
We own that.</v>

2615
02:25:28.450 --> 02:25:29.290
We own the copyright.

2616
02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:33.640
How good is the footage is it gets better than the webcam stuff because they had

2617
02:25:33.641 --> 02:25:38.260
like at least like camcorders back then and look at his face like when,

2618
02:25:38.261 --> 02:25:40.360
when they're doing a 30 count and Kimbos down,

2619
02:25:40.361 --> 02:25:43.410
they gave him a 30 count and eventually Kimbo just could not get up well.

2620
02:25:43.430 --> 02:25:46.690
But look at his face and the first two times his friends just picked him up and

2621
02:25:46.691 --> 02:25:49.120
made them keep fighting.
He never got up from his own freewill.

2622
02:25:50.590 --> 02:25:55.420
But Sean just,
okay,
he got up again and he got up again.
Yep.
Cookies.

2623
02:25:55.570 --> 02:26:00.070
He's like,
aw,
he's up.
And Sean punched him again like after that.

2624
02:26:00.071 --> 02:26:05.050
It's so crazy.
I remember we someone easily could've died.
Not Fight.
Yeah,
we,
we,

2625
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:09.310
part of the,
the rules were the winners got the footage.

2626
02:26:09.430 --> 02:26:13.450
So what they were like six guys with cameras and so like I see Mike and those

2627
02:26:13.451 --> 02:26:16.570
guys,
they all had their own cameras and Sean [inaudible] and we're like,

2628
02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:19.570
you hand over the tapes.
So there's all this we like,

2629
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:23.410
we figured they just taped the fights with is all this footage than driving up,

2630
02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:27.920
kept going in the hotel and go into the hotel and like,
you know,

2631
02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:31.400
we're gonna kill this again.
I can't probably can't use that language here.

2632
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:35.020
You can look,
come on Nigga,
go kill this guy.
We're going like,

2633
02:26:35.021 --> 02:26:37.810
and they get there and like Rhode Island and like the bad part of the Rhode

2634
02:26:37.810 --> 02:26:41.740
Island and it's hilarious.
And I think I have it there.
Fuck,

2635
02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.610
I think it's still on that old computer.
I have my basement.
So Sean,

2636
02:26:45.611 --> 02:26:49.030
before this fight and then Sean after the fight,
what was the difference?

2637
02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:53.110
Totally different.
He was like,
I don't think he was ever like super smart,

2638
02:26:53.111 --> 02:26:54.010
but he was coherent,

2639
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:57.670
smart guy and I remember seeing them like a month later and I was like,

2640
02:26:57.730 --> 02:27:01.510
this guy has brain damage.
Like he's like not right anymore.

2641
02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:04.570
Just like it had like this weird look to his face all the time.

2642
02:27:04.571 --> 02:27:09.270
Did he get fired from that fight?
No discipline.
Bad.

2643
02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:11.330
He's cop now.
Why did it?

2644
02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:13.510
Because that picture was on the front page of the Herald,

2645
02:27:13.511 --> 02:27:18.511
so it was just a bad publicity thing.

2646
02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:23.850
Police Union got behind him and,
and uh,
he uh,
he stayed on the forest.
Well,

2647
02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:27.830
it's a sparring.
It was what it was.
It was,
it was as far.

2648
02:27:28.090 --> 02:27:32.680
He's still on the force today.
Uh,
I haven't talked to him about six months,

2649
02:27:32.681 --> 02:27:35.460
but we didn't talk about work last time.
I just scroll up to that picture.

2650
02:27:35.470 --> 02:27:39.160
That dude's I right below that.
Look at that.
That's the dude that Kimbo fought.

2651
02:27:39.161 --> 02:27:43.560
What the fuck is going on with his eyes?
His,
I have a hose out.

2652
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:47.140
It's not in the right place or is that what it is?
Or is it just swelling?

2653
02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:49.510
I don't know what that is,
is that,
that might not even be real.

2654
02:27:49.511 --> 02:27:53.080
That might be Photoshop,
but it certainly looks like it's eyeball's missing.

2655
02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:55.650
And the way Kimbo was built back then too.

2656
02:27:55.651 --> 02:27:58.300
It's just so he was built so much different than he is now.

2657
02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:00.420
Like look at that picture right there.
They lead x.

2658
02:28:00.421 --> 02:28:04.030
He picture right below it was get his arms up in the air.
Jamie Click on that.
Uh,

2659
02:28:04.031 --> 02:28:08.830
he was SWOT and he seemed,
now when he fought Ken shamrock the other day,

2660
02:28:09.250 --> 02:28:12.730
it just didn't look the same.
It just looks like a completely different guy.

2661
02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:17.290
That's the old Ken shamrock one from the one that Ken backed out of and then he

2662
02:28:17.291 --> 02:28:22.130
wound up finding Seth Petras.
Ellie.
Yeah,
that's

2663
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:25.490
<v 1>the old one.
I'm pretty sure because Ken looks younger there too.</v>

2664
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.810
Ken already looks fairly old there,
but Ken,
um,

2665
02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:34.170
backed out of the fight like last minute and then he fought South Petros.

2666
02:28:34.171 --> 02:28:39.020
Ellie and I knew that that was deep water for him.
I was like,
yeah,

2667
02:28:39.021 --> 02:28:41.630
this is not your,
you can't fight back guy.

2668
02:28:41.631 --> 02:28:44.600
But look how good can look there for a guy who's 51.

2669
02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:46.670
That was a super disappointing fight though.

2670
02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:52.970
I couldn't believe that everybody thought that was a word.
I do.
Not at all.

2671
02:28:53.010 --> 02:28:53.920
I'm not,

2672
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:58.070
I just think it was two 50 year old guys fighting each other and that's just not

2673
02:28:58.071 --> 02:29:00.640
going to look like the best athletic competition.

2674
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:03.350
I just couldn't believe that Ken couldn't finish that rear naked choke.

2675
02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:06.840
I thought that bring up a video of Ken from 20 years ago.
No,

2676
02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:09.370
he does the same style.
He cups like the top of the head.

2677
02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:10.730
He doesn't come behind the neck.

2678
02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:13.820
Like you don't have the same style of choke in 20 years ago guys didn't know

2679
02:29:13.821 --> 02:29:16.190
what to do.
So they tapped to it.
Yeah,
there it is right there.

2680
02:29:16.191 --> 02:29:21.191
You can see the picture of him with Kimbo but Kimball's not even defending and

2681
02:29:21.471 --> 02:29:23.660
he's not even grabbing the fucking,
I don't,

2682
02:29:23.690 --> 02:29:26.160
I just couldn't imagine that Ken couldn't finish that.

2683
02:29:26.810 --> 02:29:28.130
That doesn't make any sense to me.

2684
02:29:28.430 --> 02:29:31.370
I mean it might not be a word I said it looked fake as fuck cause it did kind of

2685
02:29:31.371 --> 02:29:34.640
look fake as fuck.
But one of the things that might've made it look fake as fuck,

2686
02:29:34.641 --> 02:29:39.641
cause it was a 51 year old man who was fought combat sports for 20 plus years

2687
02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:43.070
and his body just is not capable anymore.
I mean anybody,

2688
02:29:43.071 --> 02:29:46.940
I like Luke Rockhold gets your neck like that.
Can I bill?
You're going to sleep.

2689
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:48.410
You know it just a fact.

2690
02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:53.480
But just to see Ken not be able to finish a perfectly placed rear naked choke

2691
02:29:53.481 --> 02:29:55.520
hand on the bicep.
You know,

2692
02:29:56.300 --> 02:29:59.600
most anybody who's really good at Jujitsu is going gonna finish that.

2693
02:30:00.010 --> 02:30:04.580
But it just doesn't make any sense.
Or even not that great at Jiu Jitsu.
Yeah,

2694
02:30:04.581 --> 02:30:06.740
I mean a purple belt,
a good purple belt.

2695
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:09.920
But it's sad that a guy like can,
you know,

2696
02:30:09.921 --> 02:30:13.970
is in this position in his life when he's,
you know,
he's a legend in the sport.

2697
02:30:14.170 --> 02:30:16.220
You know,
you think about a guy like Arnold Palmer,

2698
02:30:16.610 --> 02:30:19.430
he never has to fucking work again.
You know,
you look at a,

2699
02:30:19.580 --> 02:30:23.690
a legend in baseball,
those guys want have to work,
have to work again.

2700
02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:27.530
You look at a legend like Ken Shamrock,
he just missed the fucking money.

2701
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:29.660
Combat Sports are all like that though.
I mean,

2702
02:30:29.661 --> 02:30:34.490
look at Mike Tyson made $300 million and it doesn't have $300 million now.

2703
02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:37.850
That's cause he pissed it all away.
Ken Sharmarke didn't make $300 million,

2704
02:30:38.930 --> 02:30:41.590
$10 million a fight when Ken shamrock was good.
No,

2705
02:30:41.810 --> 02:30:45.080
I like the guys like the GSP or making now.
He didn't have that opportunity.

2706
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:49.010
I wonder what the most anybody's ever made for an MMA fight is.
I would like to,

2707
02:30:49.011 --> 02:30:50.390
it would have to be in the UFC.

2708
02:30:50.391 --> 02:30:54.440
I wonder if it has to be a cut of a paper view on probably four or 5 million for

2709
02:30:54.441 --> 02:30:58.280
GSP.
I think maybe my guess is I think more than five they,

2710
02:30:58.310 --> 02:31:02.360
the rumor is that Mcgregor made four or 5 million and well I'm sure he had a

2711
02:31:02.361 --> 02:31:04.460
piece of the paper you and he fucking deserved it.

2712
02:31:04.461 --> 02:31:06.740
If anybody deserved a piece of the paper view,
it's Mcgregor.

2713
02:31:06.741 --> 02:31:09.410
We were just talking about that in the car yesterday.
Without him,

2714
02:31:09.411 --> 02:31:12.560
that card would have done four hundred thousand five hundred thousand buyers

2715
02:31:12.561 --> 02:31:13.430
instead of a million.

2716
02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:16.670
You know what impressed me almost as much as his performance and the fight

2717
02:31:16.671 --> 02:31:21.140
itself was the Irish people.
I just couldn't believe they the family.

2718
02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:23.400
I said that like when I did the post fight interview,
I'm like,

2719
02:31:23.401 --> 02:31:24.630
these people are a credible,

2720
02:31:24.631 --> 02:31:28.740
it's humbling that they flew all the way over there from Ireland to watch their

2721
02:31:28.741 --> 02:31:32.700
guy fight.
There's not,
if you had a fucking American flight,
an Ireland,

2722
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:36.520
good luck getting 10 people to get on a plane and fly to America,

2723
02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:39.960
other sister and cousin.
It's just not the same.
And somebody was like,
yeah,

2724
02:31:39.961 --> 02:31:44.340
it's because they don't have anything.
So what?
So what?
It's you don't,

2725
02:31:44.370 --> 02:31:48.900
you don't think it's impressive that they have so much patriotism and so much

2726
02:31:48.901 --> 02:31:53.010
love for their country,
men that they,
they planned way in advance.

2727
02:31:53.011 --> 02:31:58.011
Those tickets sold out in the blink of an eye and thousands of those 15,000

2728
02:31:58.681 --> 02:32:02.850
people,
thousands,
like 40% came from Europe.

2729
02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:06.410
<v 0>And it's not like a rock concert where if it's a stones cancer,
you know,</v>

2730
02:32:06.411 --> 02:32:07.880
it's gonna be a phenomenal concert.

2731
02:32:07.881 --> 02:32:11.180
Half the people lose every fight and they could have flown all that,

2732
02:32:11.181 --> 02:32:13.480
spent all her money and he might've lost it.

2733
02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:15.520
<v 1>He hadn't,
when he fought Mayweather,
a member,</v>

2734
02:32:15.521 --> 02:32:18.000
they were singing all this Ricky Hatton songs.
Yep.

2735
02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:19.750
Right before Mayweather put them to sleep

2736
02:32:24.850 --> 02:32:29.410
or the frank,
if I could have been five commands about warring,
sucky fight,

2737
02:32:29.470 --> 02:32:30.910
he could have been.
It could have been,

2738
02:32:30.911 --> 02:32:33.070
but they were willing to take the chance and then they won.

2739
02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:36.160
He won and they won with them.
I'm telling you,
man,

2740
02:32:36.161 --> 02:32:38.000
you never seed celebration like that.
Every,

2741
02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:41.950
I had a run from place to place just to keep them getting a costed by Irish

2742
02:32:41.951 --> 02:32:43.180
people to try and drag you into.

2743
02:32:43.181 --> 02:32:46.480
My brother was out there and he said it was awesome to see like everywhere he

2744
02:32:46.481 --> 02:32:48.070
walked they were like crazy Irish guys.

2745
02:32:48.071 --> 02:32:50.860
They were so pumped up and aunt up and there's drinking.

2746
02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:54.150
They were singing and they were come.
I was leaving for the,

2747
02:32:54.370 --> 02:32:58.210
for my flight at like seven 30 in the morning and these guys were stumbling in,

2748
02:32:58.390 --> 02:33:01.210
still singing seven 30 fucked up.

2749
02:33:01.211 --> 02:33:05.800
Probably just getting home from the spearmint rhino
hammered.

2750
02:33:06.570 --> 02:33:08.250
It was amazing.
It's like it,

2751
02:33:08.350 --> 02:33:11.860
it moved me because I had been there before when a lot of Brazilians had shown

2752
02:33:11.861 --> 02:33:14.290
up to maybe see Anderson fight or something along those lines.

2753
02:33:14.590 --> 02:33:18.790
But the level of patriotism that the Irish had was on a completely different

2754
02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:23.950
scale.
It was just,
it was another level,
like several notches crazier.

2755
02:33:25.810 --> 02:33:28.500
<v 0>That's why I like,
I mean for me personally,</v>

2756
02:33:28.501 --> 02:33:31.320
my favorite shows are just a little amateur ones when I'm,

2757
02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:35.340
I'm actually coaching or somebody that I've helped train or something.
Cause he,

2758
02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:37.980
if you do,
the more of a connection you have with a person,

2759
02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:42.090
the deeper the fight becomes.
And I think with those Irishmen,
they're there.

2760
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:46.470
They're so tight as a,
as a nation that uh,
that when he's in there,

2761
02:33:46.530 --> 02:33:48.570
they feel like they're right in there with him.

2762
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:51.750
And that must make the experience.
It's also an incentive.

2763
02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:57.450
Maybe that photo Jesus fucking Christ,
that's a crazy photo.

2764
02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:01.340
Look at that shit.
11,000 people were at the way in,
right?

2765
02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:05.210
<v 1>Guys take off their clothes in the sand,
in their underwear.
It's insane.</v>

2766
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:08.480
And the roar,
the roars that those people were cheering,

2767
02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:11.870
screaming when he got on that scale.
There's nothing like it.

2768
02:34:12.260 --> 02:34:14.570
There's no one like him.
I mean Ronda Rousey,

2769
02:34:14.571 --> 02:34:17.770
this is the other biggest star in MMA at this.
You know,

2770
02:34:17.771 --> 02:34:21.160
everybody talks about who's the biggest star in MMA?
I love Rhonda Rousey.

2771
02:34:21.161 --> 02:34:22.570
I think she's a one of a kind.
I don't,

2772
02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:24.370
I don't think there's anybody that's ever been like her.

2773
02:34:24.371 --> 02:34:25.930
I think she's spectacular,

2774
02:34:26.290 --> 02:34:30.160
but she does not have nearly the appeal this motherfucker does.

2775
02:34:30.161 --> 02:34:33.820
It's not even close.
How many Americans are flying to Brazil to watch her fight?

2776
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:39.190
Me,
Joe.
It's my job.
I'm gone.

2777
02:34:39.310 --> 02:34:41.530
But I am very,
very,
very curious.

2778
02:34:41.531 --> 02:34:44.470
I'm going not just because it's my job,

2779
02:34:44.471 --> 02:34:48.490
but I'm very curious to see how they're gonna treat her in Brazil.

2780
02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:50.710
Whether or not,
you know,
this batch clay,

2781
02:34:50.711 --> 02:34:54.310
a chick has that kind of love and respect what they think she has a chance.

2782
02:34:54.311 --> 02:34:55.780
What kind of crowds going to show up?

2783
02:34:56.050 --> 02:35:00.750
What does it going to be like if Rhonda Beats Her
when Rhonda Beats?

2784
02:35:00.751 --> 02:35:03.550
Or should I say,
I mean,
anything can happen.

2785
02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:08.580
Anything can happen that I learned that in the late nineties or could have been

2786
02:35:08.801 --> 02:35:10.600
the,
I was the late nineties,
uh,

2787
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:14.660
pep touch fought Dan Severn and I got the tape afterwards from a,

2788
02:35:14.661 --> 02:35:16.430
for Monte would promoted it and they,

2789
02:35:16.460 --> 02:35:19.780
they're doing the preflight interview and they say,
uh Oh pat,

2790
02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:21.430
what do you think's going to happen?
And Pat goes,

2791
02:35:21.431 --> 02:35:23.710
I don't know what's going to happen.
That's why we're having the fight.

2792
02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:24.701
And he was fighting,

2793
02:35:24.701 --> 02:35:27.670
guy was a hundred pounds heavier than him and I think it ended up being a draw

2794
02:35:27.671 --> 02:35:29.890
but cause nobody tapped anybody.
But Pat,

2795
02:35:30.430 --> 02:35:33.280
pat really did win that fight and ever since then I've been like,

2796
02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:37.600
you don't know what's going to happen.
That's why I have the fight.
I mean,
yeah,

2797
02:35:37.601 --> 02:35:40.000
fights are crazy.
Throw bones of people.

2798
02:35:40.001 --> 02:35:43.990
You Zig when you should have zagged and pretty sure we were all thinking when

2799
02:35:44.170 --> 02:35:46.210
Anderson Silva Beats Chris Weidman and what's next?

2800
02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:50.920
I didn't then that now new radio.
I didn't think I did.
I did not think that.

2801
02:35:51.370 --> 02:35:54.670
Oh I was saying,
I mean I wasn't lying when I did that pre fight thing.
I'm like,

2802
02:35:54.671 --> 02:35:59.380
this guy is different.
He's,
he's,
he's a special kind of a destroyer.
You know,

2803
02:35:59.381 --> 02:36:02.650
there's something about Weidman.
He's so fucking stupid.
Is that something,

2804
02:36:02.651 --> 02:36:05.860
because the three of us were talking about it in the car yesterday.
What is it?

2805
02:36:05.890 --> 02:36:09.610
I don't know.
I had met some guys have it.
Some guys don't.
You know,
it's like,

2806
02:36:09.611 --> 02:36:12.910
what is it that makes a guy that fucking good?
I don't know what it is.

2807
02:36:12.911 --> 02:36:17.230
There's intangible qualities that some people possess and he's born that way.

2808
02:36:17.290 --> 02:36:20.080
These moon,
it's all of the above.
What we talked about,

2809
02:36:20.081 --> 02:36:23.950
his dad was in football player.
His fucking brother beat the shit out of them.

2810
02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:28.960
All that stuff I'm sure has an effect on his mental state and his,
his resolve,

2811
02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:32.950
his,
he has unflappable,
will unflappable resolve.

2812
02:36:32.951 --> 02:36:36.850
Like he's just got this iron will and you just sense it when you look at them.

2813
02:36:36.851 --> 02:36:40.150
You sense it when you see him fighting.
Like you got to beat that fucking guy.

2814
02:36:40.151 --> 02:36:45.010
He's not beating himself and he's skillful.
He's very good,
very well prepared.

2815
02:36:45.011 --> 02:36:48.550
Toughest Shit can knock guys out,
can knock guys out with their hands.

2816
02:36:48.551 --> 02:36:52.030
You ever see him fight Uriah Hall and bring a fire?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2817
02:36:52.031 --> 02:36:56.890
It caught your eye hall with his long left Hook boom and put them away standing

2818
02:36:56.891 --> 02:36:57.121
me.

2819
02:36:57.121 --> 02:37:01.660
He puts guys away standing puts Mark Munoz away with that fucking brutal elbow.

2820
02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:06.730
Oh,
he's no joke,
man.
He's an animal,
you know.
And now as a middleweight champion,

2821
02:37:06.731 --> 02:37:10.450
what's fascinating right now is now that he's passed v tour,
which was,

2822
02:37:10.451 --> 02:37:13.660
is sort of a mandatory fight.
There are so many good fights there.

2823
02:37:13.661 --> 02:37:17.390
There's Jacques Perrey,
you'll Romero Luke Rockhold.

2824
02:37:17.390 --> 02:37:22.250
<v 4>Fuck man.
There's some mother Isro lining up.
Oh God.
You know,</v>

2825
02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:27.400
I mean in the way Rockhold beat down Machida Foch and then the Ray Romero did

2826
02:37:28.431 --> 02:37:31.380
the same goddamn thing he beat him down to,
it's like the,
the,

2827
02:37:31.381 --> 02:37:33.620
the contenders are rising to the top.

2828
02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:36.950
They're clearly being established and Jack Hurray.
I mean,

2829
02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:40.880
fuck you want to talk about Worldclass Jujitsu?
That guy's insane.

2830
02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:44.870
He's insane.
He's so fucking good and so strong.

2831
02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:50.030
<v 0>It's the tool five division I felt like with five years ago or four years ago or</v>

2832
02:37:50.031 --> 02:37:53.030
something was kind of like they had John Jones on top and everybody else in the

2833
02:37:53.031 --> 02:37:55.820
top 10 was a killer.
But it's definitely one 85 right now.

2834
02:37:55.870 --> 02:37:58.710
<v 4>Jewel fives actually,
they're pretty weak right now.
That division.
Right.</v>

2835
02:37:58.890 --> 02:38:00.510
Well you know Joan relatively,

2836
02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:05.130
hopefully Jones comes back eventually gets his life in order and it comes back.

2837
02:38:05.370 --> 02:38:09.240
That situation is so sad and you know,
you're not hearing anything from John,

2838
02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:11.190
you know,
I'm sure he's got all sorts of legal problems.

2839
02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:14.730
Just gets you to stay out of the media and just take care of his shit right now.

2840
02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:17.040
Which state,
you know,
clear,

2841
02:38:17.450 --> 02:38:21.600
clear his mind and his life and make restitution and do whatever he's got to do

2842
02:38:21.601 --> 02:38:25.560
and hopefully he'll be back again.
But you want to talk about talent?

2843
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:28.650
Hopefully man,
he,
I want to see him back,

2844
02:38:28.651 --> 02:38:31.800
like get this shit together and come back and just be on top again.

2845
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:34.860
Because that guy was incredibly talented.

2846
02:38:35.370 --> 02:38:38.550
I watched all his fights because he grew up fighting and Massachusetts,

2847
02:38:38.551 --> 02:38:40.050
cause New York,
they couldn't fight.

2848
02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:43.620
So all his fights were in Massachusetts and I saw that kid fight like three

2849
02:38:43.621 --> 02:38:46.260
times.
Like this kid's got it.
Like this kid's going somewhere.

2850
02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:51.300
He fought six times in three months.
Did you get to the UFC three months,

2851
02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:55.680
six times three weekends in a row once and it took a last minute fight in the

2852
02:38:55.681 --> 02:38:58.500
UFC.
Wow.
Yeah,
it was incredible.

2853
02:38:58.550 --> 02:39:02.870
<v 0>My first experience was I was cornering somebody at a show in Massachusetts and</v>

2854
02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:06.260
Chris,
I think my guy lost.
I'm just kind of sit in their arm around them,

2855
02:39:06.261 --> 02:39:09.170
giving him water or whatever.
And Chris goes,
there's this new guy,

2856
02:39:09.550 --> 02:39:12.800
he says it's a fight and it's only the five seconds you can come here.

2857
02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:16.250
And so he grabs me and we go running up to the cage and it was over the flight.

2858
02:39:16.251 --> 02:39:20.420
It ended in 19 seconds and I know the guy fought and the guy fight is like tough

2859
02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:24.080
and got crushed by him.
And Chris just said,
this guy is going to be the,

2860
02:39:24.470 --> 02:39:27.950
he's going to be the next one.
Wow.
That's amazing.

2861
02:39:29.570 --> 02:39:30.403
He's a murderer.

2862
02:39:31.210 --> 02:39:32.650
<v 4>So lucky he never fought Tom.</v>

2863
02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:37.690
He was supposed to fight Tom Walla for the like local title.
Really?
Yeah.

2864
02:39:37.691 --> 02:39:40.390
Cause Tom Lawler fought master.
He's a Massachusetts guy originally.

2865
02:39:40.930 --> 02:39:44.410
And this was to fight for the title.
I had set it all up for Tom and I'm like,
oh,

2866
02:39:44.411 --> 02:39:46.510
he looks good,
but Tom,
you can fight him.

2867
02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:50.020
And like a week later the UFC call Jon Jones and I'm like,

2868
02:39:50.021 --> 02:39:52.540
thank God that I never happened.
Or total I guess talking about,

2869
02:39:52.541 --> 02:39:55.600
I never had a UFC career.
I mean,
not to say he would have lost for sure,

2870
02:39:55.601 --> 02:39:57.940
but it was a tough fight to take,
you know,

2871
02:39:57.941 --> 02:39:59.770
in retro said he would have lost for sure.

2872
02:40:00.250 --> 02:40:02.530
What are you doing when you're lying to people?

2873
02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:08.810
Anything can happen.
And it happened in the fight and Tom hits hard.
So.
Yes.

2874
02:40:08.890 --> 02:40:12.510
I mean it does.
Most people thought he was gonna lose this fight last weekend.
Um,

2875
02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:14.380
it was,
uh,
it was a tough fight for him for sure.

2876
02:40:14.381 --> 02:40:19.290
I'm getting beat up and he had taken 27 months off.
Ring.
Rust is real.

2877
02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:22.740
Why did it take so much time off?
So I cornered him,
and this is funny,

2878
02:40:22.741 --> 02:40:26.110
according to him in that Mega Kuyper fight in Sweden and uh,

2879
02:40:26.190 --> 02:40:29.210
we walk in after the first round and you look to this as like,

2880
02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:31.500
I think I blew my fucking knee.
Now I'm just like,

2881
02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:33.600
what do you mean you blew it might blew my knee.

2882
02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:37.320
And so the other corner is a Jiu Jitsu coach.
He's like,
you should sit down.

2883
02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:42.060
He's like,
I can't,
I won't be able to get back up.
Whoa.
And we're like,
all right.

2884
02:40:42.090 --> 02:40:45.030
He's like,
what should I do?
Should we not fight?
And like,
do you want to fight?

2885
02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:47.100
He said,
yeah.
So go out there and stand up.

2886
02:40:47.490 --> 02:40:50.220
And he guillotines the guy in the second round,

2887
02:40:50.250 --> 02:40:54.840
chokes him unconscious and he tore his ACL,
completely blew his ACL.

2888
02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:59.130
Wow.
And so he recovered for like a year and then blew his meniscus and the same

2889
02:40:59.131 --> 02:40:59.964
knee.

2890
02:41:00.030 --> 02:41:04.230
And so then another six month recovery and just then he had a book of fight and

2891
02:41:04.231 --> 02:41:08.670
get back in shape is just injury after injury and the same knee.
What a guys do.

2892
02:41:08.671 --> 02:41:09.421
I've always wondered,

2893
02:41:09.421 --> 02:41:11.820
what does a guy like Tom Lawler who doesn't make that much money,

2894
02:41:11.850 --> 02:41:14.590
what do they do for money when that happens?
Oh,

2895
02:41:14.591 --> 02:41:17.910
Tom's made some good money in the UFC that he could sit on and Thomas Filthy.

2896
02:41:17.911 --> 02:41:21.310
He doesn't like need nice things if you've ever,

2897
02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:23.940
so he won a bonus at UFC 100,

2898
02:41:23.941 --> 02:41:28.650
which was $100,000 and he went and bought a condo in Providence,

2899
02:41:28.651 --> 02:41:32.770
which it wasn't expensive.
Like bought it straight out and in Rhode Island.
Yeah.

2900
02:41:32.771 --> 02:41:35.790
And he's from that area.
Like no he did.

2901
02:41:36.450 --> 02:41:38.810
He lived there for years because he used to,
um,

2902
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:41.100
that's where he grew up like Swanzi Summerset area.

2903
02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:44.340
And you like real island cause everything's a small city.
Everything's close.

2904
02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:47.190
And he looked in the nastiest condor you've ever been in.

2905
02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:52.140
It was like cat piss everywhere and like just like smell the,
you know,

2906
02:41:52.350 --> 02:41:55.920
everything,
it was terrible.
But you know,
he doesn't need all the money.

2907
02:41:55.921 --> 02:41:59.970
So for him,
like $100,000,
it was like five years of living cause he doesn't need,

2908
02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:02.370
you know,
Nice Amenities,
nice things.

2909
02:42:02.910 --> 02:42:07.910
And you just teach you Jitsu here and there and do seminars and I don't think

2910
02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:12.570
he's,
I don't think he's worked a regular job since,
since after four or five.

2911
02:42:12.571 --> 02:42:12.980
Then new music,

2912
02:42:12.980 --> 02:42:16.940
like the high school history teacher for awhile and then just got in a fight and

2913
02:42:16.941 --> 02:42:20.600
then that's it.
He just figured out the way they survive on,
you know,

2914
02:42:20.700 --> 02:42:21.630
not having a lot,

2915
02:42:22.290 --> 02:42:25.770
it's a hard world out there for guys who are like the lower level guys that are

2916
02:42:25.771 --> 02:42:28.650
trying to make it.
It's very,
very hard world.
It's very,

2917
02:42:28.651 --> 02:42:32.670
very difficult for those guys to to make enough money to actually get by.

2918
02:42:32.730 --> 02:42:33.563
It's terrible.

2919
02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:36.960
I have a guy that fights in the UFC now that went back to having a real job full

2920
02:42:36.961 --> 02:42:39.960
time,
still fights but has a job.

2921
02:42:39.961 --> 02:42:44.160
He's a corrections officer who was on Joe proctor.
He has a full time job now.

2922
02:42:44.250 --> 02:42:48.500
He's six fights in UFC,
UFC career and has a fulltime job watching inmates.

2923
02:42:48.660 --> 02:42:53.460
Plymouth County.
That's crazy because he used to suck job too,

2924
02:42:53.461 --> 02:42:55.330
by the way.
He had a training partner,

2925
02:42:56.370 --> 02:42:59.700
horror fucking stories where people throwing shit on them and oh yeah,

2926
02:42:59.701 --> 02:43:01.210
they would,
they do that.
They throw shit at you.

2927
02:43:02.730 --> 02:43:05.790
There was a guy who used to help out from,
from a master's,

2928
02:43:05.791 --> 02:43:08.730
there's actually from Connecticut and it was,
it was a good fighter.
He,

2929
02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:11.590
I think he probably had Europe see potential and then he

2930
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:16.490
<v 0>decided just not,
the future's not for me and so he,
he told me,
no,
I,
yeah,</v>

2931
02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:19.270
I got sort of bad news.
I'm going to go to law school instead of

2932
02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:23.530
<v 1>fighting.
I was like,
hello.
Yeah,
that's awesome.</v>

2933
02:43:24.010 --> 02:43:25.480
What do you do when a guy's going,

2934
02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:28.120
going through your jam and he wants to fight and you know,
he's got no shot.

2935
02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:32.460
Do you just say,
look,
you've got to figure this out for yourself.
Like if you,
you,

2936
02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:36.790
you got a guy who's uncoordinated and just,
you know,
not tough,

2937
02:43:37.380 --> 02:43:41.220
<v 0>but for whatever reason decides to,
to fight,
tell him it's not for them.</v>

2938
02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:44.520
You tell it straight up,
tell them you can't,
you can't fight from here.
I said,

2939
02:43:44.521 --> 02:43:47.760
there's unscrupulous promoters that are looking for sharks versus fish.

2940
02:43:47.930 --> 02:43:49.350
I explained the whole deal to warm it though,

2941
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:52.620
how the sport works at the low level,
there's big ticket sellers.

2942
02:43:52.621 --> 02:43:56.460
They're going to sell 200 tickets at $50 each,
$35 each.

2943
02:43:56.820 --> 02:43:59.910
And the promoters always looking for some fish to feed the,

2944
02:44:00.130 --> 02:44:01.770
to feed to the sharks so that the guy,

2945
02:44:01.771 --> 02:44:03.720
I'll have 200 friends show up in the next and when,

2946
02:44:03.721 --> 02:44:06.120
and the next town in order to say,
you can get a fight,

2947
02:44:06.420 --> 02:44:09.240
like there's a million and scope of his promoters in this state that will give

2948
02:44:09.241 --> 02:44:13.980
you a fight,
but it's not good for you.
Um,
it's a dangerous sport.
Does,

2949
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:18.600
so you can't fight out of here.
And,
uh,
sometimes they keep going,
but not usually,

2950
02:44:18.601 --> 02:44:19.710
you know,
if you could,
cause it's,

2951
02:44:19.711 --> 02:44:24.020
it's not the type of sport where you can be nice to people.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's,

2952
02:44:24.021 --> 02:44:26.130
it's,
it's too important.
Um,
you know,

2953
02:44:26.131 --> 02:44:28.980
if you tell a girl she's pretty and she's not or something,

2954
02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:30.330
there's no bad consequences.

2955
02:44:30.331 --> 02:44:33.210
But if you let somebody think they have a chance at fighting and really they're

2956
02:44:33.211 --> 02:44:37.320
not very good,
they can get a scrambled brain.
So I tell people,
don't do that,
man.

2957
02:44:37.321 --> 02:44:39.300
A lot of people just let them figure it out for themselves.

2958
02:44:39.420 --> 02:44:43.340
<v 4>Yeah,
I see it in other gyms are Jim,
if you don't think you're ready to fight,</v>

2959
02:44:43.341 --> 02:44:44.810
you don't fight.
And the guys will leave.

2960
02:44:44.811 --> 02:44:49.610
They'll go to the taekwondo school that lets them fight MMA with no experience

2961
02:44:49.611 --> 02:44:52.010
and then just see them get killed.
Cause they're just not prepared.

2962
02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:55.610
Guys that come to Raj,
I'm don't fight for years.
Even amateurs,

2963
02:44:55.611 --> 02:44:58.970
they come in and they learn everything.
They learn how to Bristle Jujitsu.

2964
02:44:58.971 --> 02:45:02.810
Kickbox and then maybe we,
if you think they're ready,
you take a fight.

2965
02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:04.400
<v 1>What's your gem?
So people will listen.</v>

2966
02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:08.750
A Lowe's or on MMA back in Massachusetts at j use z.
O n right?
Yes.

2967
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:12.590
Lozan MMA.
Uh,
we've got to wrap this up.
Anything else you want to say?

2968
02:45:12.591 --> 02:45:14.480
Mixed martial arts.com the website.

2969
02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:16.540
<v 4>Fuck the,
Oh gee,</v>

2970
02:45:16.700 --> 02:45:19.800
<v 0>fuck.
Oh Gee.
I thought it was fuck that Uga.
I guess</v>

2971
02:45:20.530 --> 02:45:23.560
<v 1>fucking both.
Okay.
Well you guys</v>

2972
02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:30.540
that series,
seriously,
the best mixed martial arts website in the world.
Uh,

2973
02:45:30.541 --> 02:45:33.930
you guys are always on top of the news.
He always miss spell people's names.

2974
02:45:33.931 --> 02:45:38.430
It's great.
You misquote me almost every time,
every day.
Uh,
but it's,
uh,

2975
02:45:38.610 --> 02:45:42.450
like as far I,
I still post all the fucking time.
I'm on the last of the Mohicans.

2976
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:46.290
I'm still in there getting shit on call a fag and whenever they want to call me

2977
02:45:47.010 --> 02:45:50.250
Dick,
Dick Rider,
no matter what you're going to get shit on.

2978
02:45:50.251 --> 02:45:54.060
But I think overall,
I,
I look at it the opposite way.
I'm a,

2979
02:45:54.061 --> 02:45:55.260
I'm an optimist.

2980
02:45:55.290 --> 02:45:59.880
I think it's like 10% douchebags 90% cool people maybe.

2981
02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:05.250
But either way you guys have fucking made it through the storm.

2982
02:46:05.251 --> 02:46:09.710
That was the beginning of MMA and I think this website was an integral part of

2983
02:46:09.711 --> 02:46:12.600
keeping the,
the core fanbase alive.
So a character,

2984
02:46:12.601 --> 02:46:15.650
thank you very much for everything that you've done.
A really,
really appreciate.

2985
02:46:15.651 --> 02:46:19.120
It gave me a place to waste a lot of fucking time and uh,

2986
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:22.760
talk a lot of shit about all kinds of different fights and read a lot of cool

2987
02:46:22.761 --> 02:46:26.090
information and news and whenever anybody's hurt or breaking news,

2988
02:46:26.091 --> 02:46:28.100
I always find out about it on the underground.

2989
02:46:28.210 --> 02:46:31.730
Imagine if you track the hour he spent on like how much would that be of your

2990
02:46:31.731 --> 02:46:35.570
life while I was one of the first 400.
So shit,

2991
02:46:36.430 --> 02:46:41.000
it would be a lot 15,
17 years at an hour,
a couple hours a day.

2992
02:46:41.001 --> 02:46:44.300
And a lot of God damn waste of time.
But thank you.

2993
02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:46.970
I don't want to be an ass kissed,
but uh,
but I,
but I,

2994
02:46:46.971 --> 02:46:49.160
but I will be as I've told these guys before,

2995
02:46:49.161 --> 02:46:51.950
when there's a UFC that you're not on it to me.
And again,

2996
02:46:51.951 --> 02:46:54.350
I don't want to sound like an ass kiss,
but it's just what I've said,

2997
02:46:54.530 --> 02:46:56.420
not in front of you,
but to these guys previously.

2998
02:46:56.510 --> 02:47:00.920
It doesn't feel like a UFC without,
without you there.
The weigh ins aren't just,

2999
02:47:00.980 --> 02:47:02.570
it's just not the same.

3000
02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:07.380
So thanks to you for making the UFC the UFC for,
for me.
Well,

3001
02:47:07.410 --> 02:47:09.540
thank you very much man.
I appreciate it.
All right.

3002
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:14.120
Mixed martial arts.com go check it out and,
uh,
love the Ugi.

3003
02:47:14.121 --> 02:47:17.540
Loved the Oji.
Take it easy.
Everybody.
Cheers.

3004
02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:28.470
<v 7>I've told people the hardest thing.</v>
