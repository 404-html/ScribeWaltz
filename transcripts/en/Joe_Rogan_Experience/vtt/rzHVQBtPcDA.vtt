6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.400
He'd call a sex toy.
But it's not a toy.
It's fucking serious shit,

7
00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:25.080
It's a friend.
It's a friend sex friend for men.

All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,
Tim Ferriss is in the house.

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.630
We're going to get down to the nitty gritty.
We're going to learn some shit.

10
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.810
We're gonna figure this out together and experience together.

11
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.640
Bitches run the music.

12
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.650
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.840
<v 0>the power of the internet once again manifest itself or causes things to</v>

14
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:52.470
manifest or whatever.
Tim Ferriss here,
Ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah.

15
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.270
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for coming man.

16
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:59.271
And a much requested a man on the Internet because a lot of people really enjoy

17
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:04.500
your work and you got some,
uh,
some fascinating theories and uh,
some,
uh,
you've,

18
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:09.390
you've obviously spent a lot of time breaking things down and analyzing things

19
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:13.800
and you know,
people really love that they love when someone does the hard work

20
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.800
<v 2>harness my OCD for something useful.
Is that what it is?
I don't think it's,</v>

21
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:21.950
it's a diagnosed,
but I'm glad,
certainly when I was a kid,

22
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:25.370
the ADHD didn't have a prescription associated in a label with it.

23
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:27.150
Cause I would have been thrown straight into a,

24
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.970
<v 0>I would have a page I would have as well for sure.
But here's the thing,
man,</v>

25
00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:33.370
there's nothing wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you at all.

26
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.210
Why is it that people want to medicate someone for being unusual or exceptional

27
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.060
or energetic or someone who can't sit and do boring shit?
They,
they,

28
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.940
they resist the machine.
So we tell them they're sick.
Yeah.
No,

29
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:47.230
because if you'll sit in some boring,

30
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:49.210
monotonous class about some fucking subject,

31
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:52.180
you don't really give a shit about your instincts as a five year old kid or a

32
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:56.710
six year old kid is to run out of the room or even 15 or whatever the f even
now,

33
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.570
that's normal.
That's like you don't want to be around shit.
It's not stimulating,

34
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.770
but we're like,
there's something wrong with you if you don't submit to the hive.

35
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.560
Yeah,
there's something wrong with you.
Oh,
you can't?
What?

36
00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:12.130
Do you want to write your own books?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

37
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.200
You got to memorize all the shit that we wrote.

38
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.120
We don't want you coming up with music.

39
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:20.560
We don't want you figuring out movies or cartoons or starting your own comic

40
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:22.240
book.
Did,
did,
did,
did,
did,
did,
did.

41
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.980
He can't call a guy who writes books like you do.
You can't say you have OCD,

42
00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:28.390
dude.
You don't get a disease.

43
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.760
<v 2>No,
no,
not at all.
It is.
One of my friends,
I remember in,</v>

44
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.810
I think it was third grade,

45
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:35.300
he was one of the smarter kids in the class and he got bored out of his mind,

46
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:38.030
so he took a fork,
walked over to the side of the room.

47
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:42.950
The teacher was on the blackboard and he goes,
I am the master of the universe,

48
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:45.290
and he stabbed the fork into the electric outlet and shot.

49
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.720
So he was immediately lead into the dispelled from the class for a period of

50
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.160
time,
but he was one of the smarter kids in the class.
It was just boring.
Oh,

51
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.250
and the classic only move is as quickly as the slowest kid and he was born.

52
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.010
I've done that with before.
I took a wire to

53
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 3>the top outlet and and wanted to transfer the power from the top outlet to the</v>

54
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.660
bottom.
I was like,
why?
I want to see if I could do this,

55
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.240
and I did it and just blew up.
Flew across the room.

56
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.920
<v 4>That's what they use for cooking hot dogs at science fairs.</v>

57
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.530
Explains a little bit more about Brian.
Joe,
we found another link in front.

58
00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.590
Another little piece of evidence.
The missing puzzle.
Yeah,
man,

59
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.890
school is boring as fuck.
That's a big problem.

60
00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:27.860
A big problem when it's not addressed because we figure,
well fuck it,

61
00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:31.220
I got out of it.
They can get out of it too.
I went through all that boring shit.

62
00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:32.600
You go through all that boring shit too,

63
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.840
but it is the worst way to inform the mind ever does make it so it sucks and

64
00:03:39.111 --> 00:03:42.710
it's boring and you have to get up early when you're tired and be around some

65
00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:46.250
uninspired fucks of beginning paid pennies to teach you this nonsense.

66
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.443
<v 3>I slept through them.</v>

67
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.540
I honestly can say I slept through at least 80 to 90% of all of my school high

68
00:03:52.761 --> 00:03:53.530
school years.

69
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.470
Like my dad gave me this camel cigarette hat that back in the day you were

70
00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:01.550
allowed to wear a cigarette hats to school and stuff.
Yeah.
He's like,

71
00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:03.560
some guy at work gave this to me.
Do you want this?
He,

72
00:04:03.561 --> 00:04:07.910
my dad doesn't smoke and so I was like,
okay,
and so I wore my whole,
you smoked?

73
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.220
No,
it was before I smoke.
He gave it to me.

74
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.430
Like I worked my whole four years of high school.
It was kind of cool but it,

75
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.400
cause no one had cigarette hats I guess.
Right.

76
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.250
But I found that way folded perfectly.

77
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:22.280
Where like if I sat like look the right way,

78
00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:24.050
it looks like I was looking at my book.

79
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.840
And so I s I mastered all through high school,

80
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.160
but the problem is now I'm trying to learn things that I should have learned

81
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:35.270
already.
Like the Holocaust and the civil war and started academy.

82
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.680
Have you seen Khan Academy?
No.
K.
H a n academy.
It's astonishing.
And this,
uh,

83
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.960
gentleman who decided he wanted to teach his kids,

84
00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:45.620
I think it was remotely about calculus or something like that to help them with

85
00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:48.200
their schooling.
And then he ended up blowing it off for the entire world.

86
00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:51.650
And now it has gates support.
And what some of these charter schools,

87
00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:53.990
the most successful charter schools are doing is they're actually taking the

88
00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:56.060
lecture piece of school,
which puts kids in sleep.

89
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.910
They're signing that as homework.
And then when the kids come in,

90
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.750
they focus on projects and experiments and actually putting what they heard and

91
00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:05.090
learned in a practice pretty,
if that makes sense.

92
00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:09.530
That seems like a lot better approach than just sitting there with a monotone

93
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:13.100
voice pointing at chalkboards and going through a huge books and looking at

94
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:14.690
stupid pictures nowadays.

95
00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:17.410
I think that would be pretty good at school because it be interactive with like

96
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.530
iPads and stuff like that.

97
00:05:18.531 --> 00:05:21.500
I think that that's probably a lot better than it was when we went to high

98
00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:22.100
school or

99
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.680
<v 4>why do you think they use iPads in class?</v>

100
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.990
<v 3>Yeah.
A lot of schools are your life goals.</v>

101
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.810
You're given iPads really nowadays.

102
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.240
<v 4>Real.
I'm pretty wild stuff.
Yeah.
That's pretty awesome.
Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.540
You remember when you used to get a movie and like science class,

104
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:38.860
you are so excited.
Fuck yeah,
movie,
man.
This is going to be good.

105
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.170
I'm going to get some pleasure out of this as opposed to this normal nonsense

106
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:44.981
with this asshole.

107
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:48.850
Just droning on with those like sex ed when no one was comfortable enough to

108
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.140
present the material,
they'll be like,
all right,

109
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.380
now we're going to watch some like breaches.
I don't think we had sex ed.

110
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.160
I don't think I ever had sex ed.
I don't think I did in Massachusetts.

111
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.440
<v 0>I don't,
I don't believe they taught a sex Ed.</v>

112
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.110
<v 3>I really don't.
I don't remember a goddamn thing.
That projector movie of like uh,</v>

113
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.890
your body.
The penis as good against the chin.

114
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.870
Maybe they did and I blocked it out,

115
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.590
but I don't remember out of my four years of Newton south high school,

116
00:06:13.591 --> 00:06:17.580
I don't remember anybody telling me anything about sex.
Not a fucking peep.

117
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.810
It was just nonsense.
Just droning on,

118
00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:25.380
become a part of the machine.
Submit.

119
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.370
You are around peg,
you are not a square peg.
As I remember,

120
00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:32.580
a lot of school was watching movies and they were all made by Disney.

121
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.150
Do you remember that?
Like they would like and now the natural forest

122
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.780
and it was like,
wait,
the Disney raised me back then to like

123
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.880
<v 0>if you raise kids with fascinating documentaries he would,</v>

124
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.530
they would learn so much more that I've learned so much more from documentaries

125
00:06:49.531 --> 00:06:51.960
as long as it's verifiable.
If it's like a legit documentary,

126
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.890
you can get a little crazy and fun.
Some documentaries on on worms,

127
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.570
those flying worms in the air.
If you're a fucking man,

128
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.870
dad is one of the greatest things ever.

129
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.080
Do you know about this now there was a guy who was absolutely convinced that

130
00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:07.830
there was these things.

131
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.860
He called them rods and they were flying around us too fast for us to see and

132
00:07:13.561 --> 00:07:18.030
that you could only capture these things on video tape that the human,

133
00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:21.810
I was incapable of registering cause they were going so fast and that they look

134
00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:24.630
like almost like jelly fish with winged appendages.

135
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.020
This guy spent years in years and this shit and made documentaries about it,

136
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.030
had a website dedicated to it and then monster quest found out that these things

137
00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:39.630
were just video artifacts when bugs flew too close to the lens.
So this guy,

138
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.980
his whole life,

139
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.050
he had dedicated to a video artifacts and he thought there was cs flying,

140
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.610
tubular fluorescent looking for,
or not fluorescent,
but uh,

141
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.460
the translucent looking a things flying.

142
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.330
<v 3>Do you imagine the stress and like obligation to society?</v>

143
00:07:56.331 --> 00:08:00.020
This guy felt only to find out that that's a video artifact thought they were.

144
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:04.070
He aliens,
they're flying around this.
We just,
we just can't register them.

145
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.400
It's like those flares and pictures that people think are ghosts.
You know,

146
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:11.360
there's obvious to proof what they are,
but yet people still have no,
no,
no.

147
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.320
Did you my spirit,

148
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:16.000
how fascinating was Pinchbeck saying that ghosts were real Lincoln Raven.

149
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.070
I didn't get raped by the way.
I wanted to put that on record.

150
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.780
I offered the ghost to rape my ass all night to go story.
Yeah,
no,

151
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.870
goes rape me.
That night.

152
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.290
<v 0>Guy On the other day was absolutely convincing.
Costs are really so,</v>

153
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.020
so smart and every other way.
And I'm like,
wow,

154
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:32.450
ghosts really like ghost stories.

155
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.780
<v 3>There is some weird stuff out there though.
Like a meaning.</v>

156
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.980
One of the reasons I ended up going to Princeton Undergrad,

157
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.690
but one of the reasons I wanted to go,

158
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:43.820
which I didn't tell people cause that that they'd make fun of me was because of

159
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:47.000
a lab called the scientific anomalies laboratory.
I'm not making this up.

160
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.800
And they had statisticians,
mathematicians looking at stuff like bigfoot remote,

161
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:56.040
not big foot.
Uh,
the huge yeah,
remote viewing.
Exactly.
So they looked at

162
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.110
<v 2>remote viewing really closely and uh,</v>

163
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.410
professor John who ran this entire a research lab gave his wrap up speech before

164
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.470
they closed.
Like the year I landed at school and he was talking about,

165
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.870
for example,
with the remote viewing for people who don't know what it is,

166
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.070
you have a transmitter.
It who goes out with the field team.

167
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:17.730
Then you have a receiver in a room with a pad of paper and a recorder.

168
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.410
The job of the transmitter,
they,
they,
they choose one of five envelopes.

169
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.760
They get gps coordinates,

170
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.540
they go to that location and then they take the imagery and they transmit it to

171
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:28.860
the person who's supposed to be a receiver.

172
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.220
And what they found with one location a is an example,

173
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.790
the drawings came back very consistent with the best receivers,

174
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.100
but they were at a gas station and it wasn't like,

175
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.030
I think it was the gas station,

176
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.540
it wasn't a gas station in the picture and they couldn't identify what it was.

177
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.050
And I ended up being barracks that had been destroyed like 120 years ago.

178
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:49.590
Something like that.
Pretty Wild Shit.
Um,
the,

179
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.960
there was an accurate depiction of these things.
The drawings were consistent,

180
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.420
consistent,
and it was an accurate depiction.
Uh,

181
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.880
<v 0>doesn't the government employ a bunch of people to,</v>

182
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:02.500
I listen to art bell coast to coast am,
that's where I get my information.

183
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.220
But I've,

184
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.660
I've heard on several occasions that the government as employed people to be

185
00:10:07.661 --> 00:10:08.040
remotely

186
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.960
<v 2>viewers and Oh yeah,
they'd go submarines in particular.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

187
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.100
Yeah.
This,
uh,
the,
so there's something to it.

188
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.330
There's like start off international,

189
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:18.240
a bunch of research institutes that have been funded by the government for that

190
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:22.770
particular purpose.
And I think that the math is compelling.

191
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:26.100
I mean the data are compelling.
So you look at,
for example,
they had this huge,

192
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.950
it looked like a Pachinko machine.
I saw it in person.

193
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:31.230
So if you see these Japanese pinball machines,

194
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.860
they're vertical and have these pins and then these small steel balls bounce

195
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:37.920
down,
you have to get them in somewhere.
And uh,

196
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.070
and this thing's about 10 feet high,
maybe five feet wide.

197
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.610
And the objective of the person who is the subject was simply to get the balls

198
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:47.280
to deviate to the left or right hand column.
That's all you had to do.

199
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.000
And so the ren thousands and thousands and thousands of trials looking at what

200
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:55.140
doesn't affect telekinesis and they were able to show that,
you know,

201
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:58.830
with both the a p value significance value,
those very compelling.

202
00:10:58.831 --> 00:10:59.850
Like there's no way,

203
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.580
there's almost no way you can attribute this to chance if you,

204
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.770
if you crunch all the data.
Pretty wild stuff.

205
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.720
But it doesn't mean I can move stuff around my eyes.

206
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.360
<v 0>Well,
if we,
you know,
we actually talked about this very recently,</v>

207
00:11:10.361 --> 00:11:11.760
that the idea of um,

208
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.330
being able to watch something and that the observer actually changes the

209
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:16.931
particles,

210
00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:20.050
changes subatomic particles and changes the way they interact with their

211
00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:21.780
environment.
And that's if that,

212
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.260
if that's happening on some level somewhere and a very small level,

213
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.520
it must be an ethic that permeates through the whole thing.
Yeah.

214
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:34.650
We probably just are slowly evolving and developing this ability to ultimately

215
00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:38.950
alter everything around us.
We just,
right now we're in this,
you know,

216
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.930
fishy arm,
leg co crawling out of the water stage,
you know,

217
00:11:43.931 --> 00:11:46.750
we're just like those freaky things that made their way out of the ocean and it

218
00:11:46.751 --> 00:11:47.860
became land down in the house.

219
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.380
<v 2>Yeah.
I think that there's,
yeah,
there's a lot of evolution left.</v>

220
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.010
I think the physical side,
obviously it's sort of cut

221
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.310
<v 3>off once you have all the,
the creature comforts and Maslow's hierarchy candle,</v>

222
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.650
then you don't have to breed for physical fitness necessarily.

223
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:05.050
But I think certainly with toxins and whatnot,

224
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:07.850
like that's going to force people to evolve environmental toxins and the

225
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.570
estrogen,
endocrine disruptors and all that.

226
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.560
They're going to figure out a way to do everything that you and I do in the gym

227
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.450
in a fucking shot.
You know?
It's going to be real simple.
It's going to be,

228
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.670
we're just going to program your body to operate at this level.

229
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.280
You don't need to go to the gym.
You know what?

230
00:12:23.281 --> 00:12:25.900
I need to do anything and you're going to walk around looking like aqua man.

231
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.880
Oh sure.
How that's going to happen.

232
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.330
Or like they're going to laugh with people that lift weights.
Like you get what?

233
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:35.050
You fucking dummy.
Why didn't you just take the shot?
Just go take a shot.

234
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.170
Seeing some pretty wild stuff with gene therapy in the course of doing the

235
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.050
foreign body and meeting with all these athletes.
I mean I've,
I've written about,

236
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.260
you know,

237
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.730
how I've used a GH and antibiotics and different things postsurgery among other

238
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.910
times,
but the most fascinating thing I saw it,

239
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:52.600
I think it's probably the most dangerous also is interleukin and gene therapy.

240
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:55.000
I know one guy,
I won't mention them,
this is actually an MMA fighter.

241
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.650
Ended up going to China to have gene therapy performed and you used interleukin

242
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:02.260
therapy gain almost 40 pounds of muscle in one month.

243
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.190
And that was with no change to his training or diet gene therapy.

244
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:09.460
So what they do is they'll take let's say 40 pounds of muscle in a month.

245
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.470
How does his heart not explore?
Right?

246
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.150
How's this heart all of a sudden working for 30,
40 extra pounds?
Exactly.

247
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:20.110
So there are a lot of risks involved.
Of course,
he's also taking things like g h,

248
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.880
uh,
IGF one,
et Cetera,
vitamin D.

249
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.330
But the,
uh,
what's fascinating about the gene therapy,

250
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:34.370
you can also use like vector based viruses to increase muscle synthesis and

251
00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:35.770
specific areas of the body.

252
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:40.180
So the hope is of course that that doesn't then malfunction and lead your heart

253
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:43.090
or intestines to hypertrophy cause then you end up looking like some of these

254
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:46.720
pro bodybuilders who were like,
that's crazy.
Like whoa,
that's so weird.

255
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.990
Just the word to the wise if you're going to use,
uh,

256
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.010
something like t h and there's,
there are definitely places to do that.
Uh,

257
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.310
you know,
watch the dosages.

258
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.470
Cause if you have organ growth that's not going to reverse as muscular growth.

259
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:00.950
When I approached free wood,
uh,

260
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.780
but you look after my reconstructive shoulder surgery,

261
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:09.490
I used a high frequency low dose growth hormone is twice a day,

262
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:13.240
six days a week and would absolutely do it again in a heartbeat.
Absolutely.

263
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.100
You to no reservations whatsoever.
But yeah,
I mean that's just step one.
You know,

264
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.030
what this is is it's,
it's genetic manipulation at a very base level.

265
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.120
It's like we're just adding chemicals that don't,

266
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.260
they don't make any chemicals into my,
what's add them.
We make our own.

267
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.470
Then we scored them in there.
Yeah.

268
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.620
And then the glands don't know what the fuck's going on.
Like,
why is there this?

269
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:34.600
That's why I dude's like in MMA fighters,

270
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.560
there's several different occurrences of this where guys are very young and they

271
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:43.260
have to get on testosterone.
And uh,
it could be a natural issue.
It could be a,

272
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.940
you know,
something happened to them when they were young and you know,
their,

273
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:47.680
their testicles never fully developed.

274
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.010
Or it could be that they took steroids and they shocked fucking shit out of
their

275
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.440
<v 4>system to the point where your ball shut down.
Yeah.
That happens to dudes.</v>

276
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.380
It's pretty common,
man.
Yeah.

277
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.421
<v 5>Common,</v>

278
00:14:58.421 --> 00:15:01.420
especially if you're doing the black market and you don't have proper post

279
00:15:01.421 --> 00:15:02.980
psychotherapy,
you don't know how to use,

280
00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:06.400
let's say Clomid or one of these don't the fuck you're doing and you still go to

281
00:15:06.401 --> 00:15:10.750
a dog,
don't go to a doctor,
your blood levels,
and then you stop cold Turkey.

282
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.610
It's like stupid stupid.

283
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:18.180
You see a lot of incidences also where it appears that a testosterone molecule

284
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.410
Saas drone binds with,
uh,
let's say in some cases dopamine receptors.

285
00:15:23.411 --> 00:15:27.640
So when people take antidepressants,
also serotonin's involved,
uh,

286
00:15:27.641 --> 00:15:32.290
antidepressants plus testosterone really can be a really nasty combo.
Whoa.
Yeah.

287
00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:34.480
So you see these cases of let's say,

288
00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:38.230
suppose it roid rage or people committing suicide.
They blame it on anabolics.

289
00:15:38.231 --> 00:15:39.670
It's actually the combination of,

290
00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:43.090
let's say an antianxiety or antidepressive with the antibiotic.

291
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.820
I know guys who are on both.
It's dangerous.
Yeah.

292
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.370
<v 4>And they're dangerous.
Guys do
not dangerous.</v>

293
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.280
Brian's been on the juice for a couple of months.

294
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.950
I take them to the squat rack every day after the show.
Oh God.
It's my vagina.

295
00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.883
Heart

296
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.130
shows on the toilet just started.

297
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.470
The genetic manipulation that we're doing though with adding testosterone or

298
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:11.400
adding estrogen,

299
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:14.310
adding anything is nothing compared to what it's going to be like when they

300
00:16:14.311 --> 00:16:18.270
figured that shit out of genetic level and they know how to engineer the body

301
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.850
and they figure out how to make your cells literally become 20 year old cells.

302
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.460
They bring your whole body to a state of where it was when you were at your peak

303
00:16:29.821 --> 00:16:33.870
of youth.
That's so possible,
man.
They're so close to that.

304
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.580
They're within a lifetime.
In our lifetime.
By the time we,
you know,

305
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.430
grow old and die,
they're going to have figured out a way that no one grows,

306
00:16:41.431 --> 00:16:45.150
all think they're within 10 years of figuring a lot of that out.
So crazy.

307
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.750
You're going to have like old ladies that all of a sudden become hot again.

308
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.250
Do you know how bad ass that would be?
Yeah,
if there was this,
oh Jesus,

309
00:16:53.251 --> 00:16:58.080
don't be mean.
Don't be mean Brian.
Yeah,
she was good.

310
00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.250
I know you're talking about if you like,

311
00:17:02.251 --> 00:17:05.400
there was an old lady and she lived on your blog and she was all hunched over

312
00:17:05.401 --> 00:17:08.280
and shit.
And then over the course of like a couple of months,

313
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.220
all of a sudden her posture came back,
pop up,
up,
up,
up.

314
00:17:11.221 --> 00:17:15.210
Her ass started sticking out and she started turning into a young woman again.

315
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.250
She was a 50 year old kind of semi hot lady and then all of a sudden the next

316
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.090
couple of weeks she's a 40 year old hot lady.
You know,

317
00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:25.890
like what the fuck is going on?
It would be fine.
Have a fixed everything.

318
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.770
But the next thing you know,
she's his 80 year old mind,

319
00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:32.380
but with this hot 20 year old body that would be on mother fucker having

320
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.780
marriages threatened from both.

321
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.810
My husband left me for an 80 year old and eight year old

322
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.910
<v 5>mortal.
If it made the vagina and everything grow back to young age,</v>

323
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:45.700
it'd be perfect in all right.

324
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.530
<v 4>Oh,
the whole body.
It wouldn't,
it wouldn't just leave the vagina.</v>

325
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:49.800
Our team got good news.

326
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.410
<v 3>Good news is you can be 20 again.</v>

327
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:55.850
The bad news is your vagina has to stay 90 yeah,
but what'd you do?

328
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.260
What'd you teeth or would it do?
Well,

329
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:02.040
the idea is she going to get hot chick that's pooping all the time because she

330
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:04.740
can't control her poop.
Why is it going to do everything?
Well,
yeah.

331
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:07.620
Well then if you have a,
does your whole body makes your whole body younger.

332
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.500
Whatever issues you have that are age related will go away because you won't

333
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.570
have hormonal deficiencies anymore.

334
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.710
You know what keep funny though is that if like she still liked hard candy and

335
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.010
pie,
the hot young chick,
but she liked like old rhubarb,
our pies and you're like,

336
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.810
I like Rhubarb Pie,
creepy food,
Dan.

337
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.580
Like what do I stuff carrots?
Like she says,

338
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.430
I just love mashed up carrots with my vitamins.
You know,

339
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.370
like she had all the behaviors of an 80 year old.

340
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.270
I wonder if she was still using a walker with the tennis balls.

341
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.610
Still like to watch more little bitch.

342
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.460
When you see people that are cranky and old,
old shitty people,

343
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.440
<v 0>the reason most of them are like that,
it's because their life is miserable.</v>

344
00:18:45.441 --> 00:18:48.880
Their body feels like shit.
It's falling apart.
Every day is just act.

345
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.240
I'll fuck off my lawn,

346
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.210
<v 3>you know?</v>

347
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.290
But if you all of a sudden gave them gene therapy and their body became 20 I

348
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:59.280
wonder if their behavior would revert to a 20 year old behavior again,
just,

349
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:02.490
you know,
obviously a little more experienced,
but yeah,
you would,
right?

350
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:05.910
You wouldn't be able to be here like almost a racing memories then why?

351
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.360
Because it's you're,
you're,
it's,
you're saying that you're getting younger,

352
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:12.240
so it's going,
you're going to act younger and that's meaning like,

353
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:14.780
you're just forgetting that you're not old.
They don't know.

354
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.980
You would still have experienced,

355
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.100
<v 0>so you'd still have life experience,
but you would have,</v>

356
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.550
you'd be a lot of what people do.
They fucking woo.

357
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.550
A lot of that is just extra energy that you have.
You know,
a lot of,

358
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.770
a lot of dumb shit that young people do.
It's just,

359
00:19:26.771 --> 00:19:28.900
they're all charged up with life.
You know,

360
00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:33.070
they're charged up with life and all day long they're either stuck behind a desk

361
00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:37.000
or some unnatural thing for their body.
And then when they get out at night,

362
00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:41.290
they want to fuck woo.
That it's just,
you know,
it's firing it off.

363
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.390
As you get older,
you have less and less of that shit.
You know,

364
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.270
you're the only time you see like a 50 year old guy.

365
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.690
There's like when he's just about to get arrested.

366
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.370
<v 3>No,
he has to be so drunk.
He's already punched out.
Do you know who I am?</v>

367
00:19:54.371 --> 00:19:58.720
Stage where they're dragging them out?
You mother fucker.
You know,
my cousin is,

368
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.833
yeah,

369
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:02.990
<v 0>your life energy.</v>

370
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:08.620
It's not just being clueless is also this bursting in Ferno of shit inside you

371
00:20:08.931 --> 00:20:11.030
because you're 20 years old and your body's alive.

372
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:15.480
<v 2>I think with the,
with the reversal of some of the symptoms of aging,</v>

373
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.430
looking at telomeres and all that stuff,

374
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:20.020
I think a lot of it will be combined with regenerative medicine.
Sona,

375
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.090
some guys who are printing,

376
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.940
I mean I've seen them print heart cells and lung cells and so forth.
So my,

377
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.820
my theory is that if you can keep your neural,
your neurological functioning,
um,

378
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.100
and,
and at at a high level and mitigate stuff like Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's,

379
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:35.610
et Cetera,

380
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.240
that you'll ultimately be able to get a replacement for just about anything
else.

381
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.630
So the simplest,
the simplest approach,

382
00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:46.500
and this has been looked at for a decade or more,
is creating monohydrate.

383
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:47.990
Actually five grams a day for a

384
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.700
<v 5>reaper staving off Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is three a team,</v>

385
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.330
their clinical studies.
So you can go on pub,
pub med or medline and look them up.

386
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.300
They've done a lot of research,
how much,
what is the dosage of very low,

387
00:20:58.301 --> 00:20:59.340
like five grams.
You,

388
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.930
you'd get creative Glen Creatine to prevent the water attention.

389
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.000
So I had read something and Creatine,
you know,

390
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:08.020
like people would always say that it makes you gain water and people would say

391
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:10.660
that it's not good for your liver.
But then I read online,

392
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:13.090
there's no evidence is not good for your liver.
There's no evidence.

393
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:14.890
It's bad for you.
I'm like,
well,
where'd that come from?

394
00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:18.670
Where'd the the rumor come from?
Is that pharmaceutical companies or something?

395
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:22.000
Like what is the,
I think it started with wives tales.
Uh,

396
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.410
it started with few things.

397
00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:27.520
I think the first is that if you have a preconditioning kidney problems,

398
00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:32.080
so it's a kidney issue,
but then here's what happens is then people substitute,

399
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.260
let's say at one point in a forum or thread liver.
And so they'll,

400
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:38.250
you hear about the liver a lot,
but it's actually not affected,
uh,
uh,

401
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.010
with the creatine,
uh,

402
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.320
as long as you don't have renal insufficiency or some really major kidney issue,

403
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.740
I,
I've really,
it's one of the most innocuous supplements you could take.

404
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.620
From my perspective,
I really don't think it will cause much problem.

405
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.370
I used to take that shit before Google as the problem took it before Google.

406
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.620
I thought it actually is bad for you.
People like,

407
00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:59.530
don't do the fucking crew teens bad for your live liver was like,
I'm like,
oh,

408
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:04.050
it is.
Oh,
I know.
I know.
Before he could do any factcheck.
Creatine is good.

409
00:22:04.051 --> 00:22:05.860
It makes you gain weight.
I gained a lot of weight.

410
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:07.960
I gained like five pounds of muscle using this stuff.

411
00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:10.390
It really does make you gain weight because it's,

412
00:22:10.391 --> 00:22:11.860
it makes your somehow or another,

413
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:15.250
your body retains more water and your cells are mostly water,

414
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.930
so it just makes your cells bigger.

415
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.660
You actually get physically cocksucker sodium cock sucker.
Um,

416
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.170
what was I going to ask you?
You were talking about,
I said Tiller arms.

417
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.530
What is the telomeres,
telomeres,
do you know about Ti ta 65?

418
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.830
Uh,
yeah,
I was that bullshit.
What does,
it's not necessarily bullshit.

419
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:35.830
I just don't think it's explained to people what it is.
So yeah,

420
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:40.831
ta 65 is an approach to in long gating or protecting the deterioration of the

421
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:43.360
caps of telomeres.

422
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:48.370
So this is related to sort of chromosomal aging and Tia 65 is it's expensive.

423
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:50.080
I don't know what the prices are now,

424
00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:52.510
but it's an approach that is supposed to be,

425
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:55.350
at least in rodents if demonstrated it able to,
uh,

426
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.520
extend the functional lifespan of your telomeres.

427
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:02.050
Like that's a good way if you look at telomeres and how they slowly,
uh,

428
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:06.220
shorten over time,
you could almost think of it like rings on a tree,
right?

429
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.770
So just in the opposite direction,
like the shorter your telomeres are,

430
00:23:08.771 --> 00:23:13.600
the closer you are to your end point a ta 65,
my feeling is there,

431
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:18.601
there hasn't been enough widescale testing that I would feel comfortable using

432
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:22.240
it myself.
Um,
exceptionally comfortable.
Uh,

433
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.580
let's say using a moderate,
you know,

434
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:28.120
responsible use of antibiotics and different types depending on your thyroid,

435
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:29.050
potentially thyroid,

436
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.250
and then combining that with creating and a few other things.
But,
uh,

437
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:39.100
personally I would not use tsxd five at this point.
Uh,
I've,
I've don't know,

438
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:40.570
I know one guy who used it,

439
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.500
but I only know him online and I know him in real life,
but his,
uh,
bad,

440
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:46.130
Bobby,

441
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.110
<v 4>his dad started using it and his dad started getting really good results with
it.</v>

442
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.600
Like,
so he stopped using it.
He just tried,

443
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:55.190
he said he didn't feel like it was doing anything for him,

444
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.090
but his dad apparently,
who's,
you know,
an older guy,
it's like,

445
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.170
it's helping them see better.

446
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.150
<v 5>I have a buddy who's a,
who's using it and he's a,
you know,</v>

447
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:07.420
CEO in Silicon Valley and he said that he's noticed gray hair turning black

448
00:24:07.421 --> 00:24:12.370
again and things like that.
Whoa,
right hair,
right.
You have a crystal on his neck?

449
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.290
No,
no,
this is,
this is,
this is,
this is an engineer type.
He's,
he's no bs.

450
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:21.070
Uh,
but for me,
I'm happy to wait.
Like if this stuff works,

451
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.470
as people say it works well,
if I wait three years,
it doesn't matter.
Right,
right,

452
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.850
right.
Good point.
I'll let those Beta testers,

453
00:24:27.851 --> 00:24:30.820
you don't throw fucking horns or whatever and then I'll be like,
yeah,
yeah.

454
00:24:30.821 --> 00:24:33.040
They didn't tell you about the horns turned the chimpanzee

455
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.400
tea 65 is interesting though.
I mean,
what's also interesting is lobsters.

456
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.240
People look at lobsters to study life extension because they don't exhibit any

457
00:24:43.241 --> 00:24:45.250
of the normal signs of aging.
So people,

458
00:24:45.251 --> 00:24:46.810
there are people who believe that they would live for,
you know,

459
00:24:46.811 --> 00:24:50.860
hundreds and hundreds of years if they weren't caught and killed.
Oh really?
Yeah.

460
00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.480
<v 4>What does the oldest one we've ever observed?
I don't know.
It's a good question.</v>

461
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.950
I don't know.
I'll start taking lobster oil or something.
That's the next thing.

462
00:24:58.951 --> 00:25:02.520
Lobster oil dishes.
I remember being high as fuck once at Morton's,
you know,

463
00:25:02.521 --> 00:25:03.480
and Morton steak house,

464
00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:06.690
they walked by with a cart and they show you this is the prime,
you know,

465
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.410
a sirloin cut in,
you know,
you can have it with this and that.

466
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:15.620
And then he holds up the lobster and the lobsters moving and barbecued.

467
00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:17.640
I'm sitting there with Eddie Bravo.

468
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:21.660
We're both going to look at that motherfucker out of the debt alien thing that

469
00:25:21.661 --> 00:25:22.560
he's holding up.

470
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:27.360
Like how buzz that fucking soulless emotionless creature,

471
00:25:27.361 --> 00:25:31.330
that giant bug that lives in the ocean,
they're holding onto.

472
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.530
It doesn't even need to imagine the first guy

473
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.700
<v 5>like I'm going to eat this.</v>

474
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.640
Like the first guy who pulls that up in front of the villagers.
He's like,
yeah,

475
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:39.650
you guys,
I've had enough to drink.
I'm going to eat this.

476
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.140
That's a bold motherfucker.
Yeah.
Yeah.

477
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.850
So speaking of documentaries,
that'd be curious.
Do you have any particular top,

478
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:47.690
top favorites?

479
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.750
<v 4>Wow.
All time favorites.
And the corporation was one of my all time.</v>

480
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:58.680
I've heard this is good.
I haven't seen at Turbin fucking documentary Enron,

481
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.040
the smartest guys in the room.

482
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.210
That was a really grumpy motherfucker burn when California is going down.

483
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.410
Unbelievable guy who wasn't there.
It's pretty good.
Yeah,
that's,

484
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.290
I incorporated food is corporate guys.
Urban man on wire.

485
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.680
No,
I haven't seen it all.
That's about the tight rope walker.
Right.

486
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.660
But the guys who get,

487
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.600
who sneak into the World Trade Center and then tight rope walk across to the

488
00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:24.060
other tower,
like between the two towers.
Oh my God.
Did he really?

489
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.840
And he made it.
He had,
they've,
they've video.
It's awesome.
Really.

490
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.150
That hurts my dick just sitting here thinking about it.
Oh yeah.

491
00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:32.320
He not only walked across it,

492
00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:35.620
he stayed up there for like 30 minutes or something and she laid down on the

493
00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:39.190
wire then stood back up.
That was hard to watch.

494
00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:44.850
These fucking guys have the limits of like physicality

495
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.730
<v 0>when we really truly don't you?
No,
we don't.
No one is,</v>

496
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.380
no one has really sort of a actualized the,
the,
the,

497
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:57.180
the full potential of all the human athletic abilities like gymnastics and

498
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:01.440
basketball and track and field and fighting and you know,
eventually,
you know,

499
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:05.550
will people live long enough so one person could be like a master at all sports

500
00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:06.810
and all games and all things

501
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.290
<v 5>life extension.
That's why a lot of the,</v>

502
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.360
the sort of singularity focused or just life extension focused,
uh,

503
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.530
tech CEO's,
guys who've made hundreds of millions of dollars,

504
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:18.360
they're pouring it into these startups,

505
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:21.930
they think we'll be able to make them live forever because that's what they see

506
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:24.600
is their rate limiting step for all learning all this stuff.

507
00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.330
<v 0>Well,
yeah,
I mean if you really think about it,</v>

508
00:27:26.331 --> 00:27:29.720
if you could live to be a thousand years old,
how many languages would you learn?

509
00:27:29.721 --> 00:27:32.150
How many books would you read?
How many things would you be into?

510
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:33.830
How many things would you,
you know,

511
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.090
I don't believe you ever truly master anything.
You know,
you,
you,
you get,

512
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.210
you master a certain level proficiency.
But there's always levels.

513
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.240
There's always levels above.
The is always more to learn.

514
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.820
But how amazing would it be to build,

515
00:27:46.821 --> 00:27:50.630
accumulate a thousand years worth of information.
But then again,

516
00:27:50.631 --> 00:27:53.360
maybe you just wasted your time spinning your wheels here and this stupid

517
00:27:53.361 --> 00:27:56.750
dimension,
you know,
and that once we pop through to the next thing,
we're like,

518
00:27:56.751 --> 00:27:59.150
why would it be waste any of our fucking time?

519
00:27:59.151 --> 00:28:02.570
You were just playing with blocks and kindergarten just constrained by the

520
00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:06.580
monkey ego tied into this fucking caveman body.
You know,

521
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.420
living with all these other savages,
shooting missiles at each other.
That's,

522
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.500
that's really what's going on.
They will for sure.
One day,

523
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.910
thousands of years from now,

524
00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:20.670
the way we study Sumir and we looked at who studied Mesopotamia and we see that

525
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:25.370
the pictures of the carriages and how they rode into battle would fucking sticks

526
00:28:25.371 --> 00:28:27.860
with big pieces of metal on the end of the sticks and how we go,

527
00:28:27.861 --> 00:28:31.820
what could these fucking retards we,
they're gonna look at us like that too.

528
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.720
For sure.
100% right?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
For sure.
No doubt about it.

529
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.010
It's impossible to avoid.

530
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.060
<v 5>Yeah.
I don't think we're a,
I dunno man.</v>

531
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.600
<v 0>Do you wonder what's going to happen between all this stuff?</v>

532
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.950
Cause the life extension,
if you,
if,

533
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.510
if it actually becomes something mainstream and popular,
what,
what the fuck band.

534
00:28:49.511 --> 00:28:52.450
No one's going to die and it's going to be way too many of us.
Almost immediate.

535
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.810
<v 5>I think we'll have a pandemic in the next three years.
Do you think so really?</v>

536
00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.980
I think that whether it's,
whether it is naturally three years.

537
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.420
Ah,
I just,

538
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.660
I just think that if you look at the population density and the,

539
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.670
uh,
the technological capabilities and the cost of biotech,
so I had,

540
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:13.520
for example,
I asked,
hey,
a friend of mine,

541
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.900
he runs a publicly traded biotech company,

542
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:17.670
said I have a hundred of the best scientists in the world.

543
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:20.910
If we want it to end the world,
like we could do it.
Absolutely.
It's like,

544
00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:25.110
give us six months.
We could,
we could engineer a,
you know,
a virus containing a,

545
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:27.720
B and c that would be communicable.
Just like the common cold.

546
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.320
We'd seen it in three or four months,
Paul and areas and a story.

547
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.730
<v 0>He had a great idea.
What if you infuse the common cold with Lsd</v>

548
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.780
so that as people,
as people,

549
00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:44.140
it was it your idea or Dunkin Dunkins idea so that as you get the cold,

550
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:48.910
you also trip your fucking balls off and you could literally get a whole state

551
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:50.160
sick with ls.

552
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.320
<v 5>Well,
you have,
well,</v>

553
00:29:52.321 --> 00:29:55.980
you'd have to find something that was either replicable by virus or by bacteria.

554
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.230
I'm sure there's something out there like maybe it's something naturally

555
00:29:58.231 --> 00:30:00.120
occurring like 5:00 AM 5:00 AM you know,

556
00:30:00.121 --> 00:30:03.460
DMT or something like that as opposed to,
you know,

557
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.600
less surgical Starbucks.
That's all it's going to be.
Yeah.

558
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.550
<v 0>Well the thing I would think about what the reason why acid would be a good ones</v>

559
00:30:09.551 --> 00:30:11.310
because it's so small.
Let's you,

560
00:30:11.311 --> 00:30:13.720
do you need such a small amount of it to affect you?

561
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.530
<v 5>Yeah,
you could do it.
I think that,
uh,
you do need a very small amount.
If you,</v>

562
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.610
if you were using,
let's say five Meo Dmt,

563
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.460
I'd say you could get away with as little as two milligrams.
Uh,

564
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.960
and particularly if it's self replicates.
So let's say the virus is tiny itself,

565
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:31.840
but then it builds up to an active dose by replication and your body.

566
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.900
Then you just need the variant,
like the Cedar,
the seeder to start

567
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.720
<v 0>five meo GMC is a crazy thing to get people sick with because in acid when you</v>

568
00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:44.080
have acid,
you know,
as far as I understand,

569
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:49.060
you're still sort of there that the big thing about the five Meo DMT
experiences,

570
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:52.590
you don't,
you don't exist anymore.
It's like a near stop being there.
Yeah.

571
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.140
You go to some other place,
you,
you,
you like,

572
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.840
you feel like your consciousness leaves your body and enters into some other

573
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:01.180
place so you wouldn't be paying attention to your body it all,

574
00:31:01.181 --> 00:31:05.890
which is really a dangerous to get people sick that way.
If you engineered that,

575
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.340
you engineered some sort of a cold that gets people to just drop to the ground

576
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:11.080
and DMT trips.
That's just rude.

577
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.400
<v 5>Yeah,
right.</v>

578
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.740
That's what your objectives are for seeding a state with LSD.
Enlightenment.

579
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.713
Yeah.

580
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.770
<v 0>That's ridiculous because most people use it for recreational purposes,</v>

581
00:31:21.771 --> 00:31:23.960
but I think any sort of a,

582
00:31:23.961 --> 00:31:28.961
a mass ego erasing experience like that could only help people look September

583
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.310
11th was a terrible thing that,
that that happened.
It was,
it was horrible.

584
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.400
I knew people that knew people that died there.
I knew people,

585
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.250
I've talked to people that saw bodies hitting the ground.

586
00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:42.920
Rent is easy was in that bill,
but what it would,

587
00:31:42.921 --> 00:31:47.921
it did do and it was really strange was made everybody really nice for a while.

588
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.440
Everybody was really like friendly and neighborly and there was a real sense in

589
00:31:53.691 --> 00:31:58.691
New York of everybody being together in a way that I never felt there before.

590
00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.600
It was always the New York is always like Donald Logan man fuck you out of my

591
00:32:02.601 --> 00:32:03.470
way.
There was always in this,

592
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.760
this thing that happens when you have this a diffusion of responsibility because

593
00:32:07.761 --> 00:32:09.710
of the population numbers are so high.
It just,

594
00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:13.670
you'd get this non non feeling and friendly environment,
you know,

595
00:32:13.671 --> 00:32:16.550
it's impossible to interact with everyone so you just fucking put your blinders

596
00:32:16.551 --> 00:32:18.960
on you.
He pressed ahead,
but that,

597
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:24.020
that terrible experience was ego dissolving a lot of ways and it humbled a lot

598
00:32:24.411 --> 00:32:28.920
of people and it made people appreciate life and it made people appreciate all

599
00:32:28.921 --> 00:32:32.810
the,
all the people around them.
And it was fucking terrible,
terrible tragedy.

600
00:32:32.811 --> 00:32:37.460
But what a beautiful time I had right after that tragedy in New York.

601
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.570
I remember I was there a few months later.
I was like,
wow,
everybody is so cool.

602
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.140
I hope this sticks.
That's all I remember thinking,
I hope this sticks,
man.

603
00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:47.630
I hope people realize,
you know,
we should all be like this.

604
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:50.930
We should all be like brothers and sisters and friendly to each other and

605
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.650
firefighters should get laid.
There should be checks that are fun trying to blow.

606
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:56.330
Firefighters were all fired up,
you know,

607
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.170
cause for awhile firefighters were fucking rock stars in New York and then

608
00:33:00.171 --> 00:33:02.330
eventually just fucking died off.

609
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:06.170
And you've got a few fucking older firefighters with young guy haircuts and talk

610
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:10.090
about the glory days of September 11 you know,
they're like 50 now,
bro.

611
00:33:10.091 --> 00:33:13.010
I was 40 I was just divorced.
Okay.

612
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.800
I'm just walking around everywhere I go and my fire hat on.

613
00:33:15.801 --> 00:33:19.070
I didn't even bother to take it off.
They just dive in on my Dick,
you know.

614
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.630
<v 3>Did they have a nine 11 firefighter calendar?
Like a sexy calendar?</v>

615
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.720
Like they must've had to,
right?
Yeah,
they must have.

616
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.630
They had to write the gay community capitalizes on things like that with

617
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.330
children.
This is Tony Obey Unit Jean.

618
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:38.390
<v 5>Yeah.
Did the,
the ego dissolving though is important?</v>

619
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:43.610
I think you can,
well,
you know this,
but you can definitely engineer it.
Uh,
I've,

620
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.660
I've always,
once a year I do high dose of mushrooms,

621
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.100
Psilocybin as a reset.

622
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.930
So around my birthday at home with two or three of my closest friends,

623
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:55.220
we have always have a sitter.

624
00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:00.330
We always have somebody who's smoking pot or otherwise semi coherent to watch

625
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:03.770
people make sure they can handle their weed too.
You know why he just,
yeah,

626
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:08.630
he popped by themselves freaking out.
You need a veteran.
Yeah.
No Paranoia and uh,

627
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.660
but that reset really I think strips away the superficial layers of manufactured

628
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:19.550
in need and so forth and allows you to look at problems that are very easy to,

629
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.420
easy to overcomplicate when you intellectualize things or rationalized.

630
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:26.060
So you accept whether it is a bad relationship or whatever it might be.

631
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:31.460
And the afterglow effect that I've felt a after each of these resets and each

632
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:35.780
one has been transformative and it's in solving one or two major problems in my

633
00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:39.530
life is there's this afterglow effect,
uh,
after the effect of,

634
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.850
of supreme clarity in terms of your priorities and values for a few months.

635
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:46.970
For me,
it really lasts a long time.
I'm taking serious quantities,

636
00:34:46.971 --> 00:34:51.110
but how many grams?
Uh,
I don't know the grams.

637
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:56.030
I've done it sort of eyeball portioning,
but I would say like a half a gallon.

638
00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.080
Let's see what ziplock bags like gallons that,
right?
Like half of that.

639
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.570
<v 3>Whoa.
That's a lot of fucking shrooms or are you getting really bad?
Sure.</v>

640
00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.250
I probably combination of two.
But I mean it's,
it's time travel.

641
00:35:08.251 --> 00:35:12.500
You're not humble,
you don't function.
What do you think the way to that is?
Yes,

642
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:16.380
that sounds,
that sounds like a half ounce or,
I mean a friend of mine,

643
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.080
a friend of mine used to,
used to grow really extensively.

644
00:35:19.081 --> 00:35:20.010
So we've never actually,

645
00:35:20.011 --> 00:35:23.820
I've never seen him way anything I've just started with visual is tell you it

646
00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:26.460
should weigh it.
You should weigh it so you know what you're doing.

647
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.930
I accidentally took a,

648
00:35:27.931 --> 00:35:32.550
I think six or seven grams recently and it was the closest to death that I've

649
00:35:32.551 --> 00:35:36.720
ever felt on mushrooms.
It was to the point where it felt like I was poisoned.

650
00:35:36.721 --> 00:35:38.370
It don't where I'm puking

651
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.230
<v 5>up.
How much do fuck with the isolation tank?</v>

652
00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.860
I have never been in an isolation tank.
I've been dying to do it.

653
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:48.861
I actually had a Charlie who works with me find locations in San Francisco and

654
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:54.240
this was a few months ago and then I had to take off for travel and wasn't able

655
00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:54.721
to do it.

656
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:59.710
But I've been dying to do isolation tanks for a long time and uh,

657
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.080
wanted to have also,

658
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.730
I want it to do it extremely clear in terms of sobriety.

659
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:07.910
And then I want to try uh,

660
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.460
something with visual hallucinations in the isolation tank to see,

661
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.840
<v 0>yeah,
get comfortable with the Tanja experience first.
Go sober for sure.</v>

662
00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:18.370
I always tell everybody if you can go sober,
unless you're a marijuana,
Jed,

663
00:36:18.371 --> 00:36:20.540
I unless you just one of those dudes that gets high,

664
00:36:20.541 --> 00:36:22.720
does everything and then my God,
go in there,
get in there.

665
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:23.583
It's not going to hurt you.

666
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.870
But if you're just like a regular dude who works a regular job and doesn't get

667
00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:31.070
high all day every day and go sober,
I always say,
and then when,
when you do it,

668
00:36:31.071 --> 00:36:34.850
you got to get comfortable with the experience to get good at it and by get good

669
00:36:34.851 --> 00:36:38.660
at it,
there's a certain things in life to take a while to get used to it.

670
00:36:38.661 --> 00:36:40.700
Like Jujitsu for example,
you know,

671
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:45.730
you're fucking getting in there and wrestling full blast with other grown men,

672
00:36:45.981 --> 00:36:47.660
you're sweating each other's eyes.

673
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.710
Dudes will be on top of you and they'll armpit sweat would drip in your face and

674
00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:54.590
you just deal with that because that's a part of Jujitsu and it's one of those

675
00:36:54.591 --> 00:36:57.200
things where once you've been doing Jujitsu for 10 years,

676
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.030
when you get on the mat and you just,
you know,

677
00:36:59.031 --> 00:37:00.920
you tap hands with people and you start sparring.

678
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:04.940
It's a normal thing because you're so used to this weird fucked up experience

679
00:37:04.941 --> 00:37:07.040
and you put yourself in this sort of zen state.

680
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.410
Even though this is a bizarre experience for most people.
Yeah.

681
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:14.650
Well the tank and in that it's so alien that this,

682
00:37:14.811 --> 00:37:18.950
this,
this time where your body doesn't move at all is so bizarre to you.

683
00:37:18.951 --> 00:37:22.100
Like we're up.
We're constantly shifting our weight.
Even when we sleep,

684
00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.420
we're moving around,

685
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:27.410
we're reacting to gravity were reacting to the pillow and our neck.
You know,

686
00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:29.690
you're always,
there's,
there's input that's coming in.

687
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.820
It's the only time where there's no input.
It's so hard to just manage that.

688
00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:39.350
It's so hard to just relax because you'll start coming up with fake things like

689
00:37:39.351 --> 00:37:40.460
my ticket,
which is fucked,

690
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.350
which you'll start thinking like I'm just eating my Dick,

691
00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:45.830
but then I'm going to get the salty water on my deck and then it's going to,

692
00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:49.430
if some more and it takes a long time.

693
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.300
It takes a bunch of different uses to the,

694
00:37:51.301 --> 00:37:54.650
you get to where like when I go in that thing,
that's my home man.

695
00:37:54.651 --> 00:37:58.670
I'm so used to that thing.
I closed that door,
I lie back and I go,

696
00:37:58.671 --> 00:38:01.340
let's find out what's up,
what's,
find out,
what's up,
what's,
see what's up.

697
00:38:01.341 --> 00:38:02.930
And I never go in sober anymore.

698
00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.370
I'm always blissed when I get in there because I just feel like marijuana,

699
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.580
especially high doses make you very,
very sensitive,

700
00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.790
very sensitive and it makes you very,
uh,

701
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.010
you contemplate things you might not have contemplated.

702
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.100
My mind is always racing and a million different directions thinking about

703
00:38:19.101 --> 00:38:19.670
things.

704
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:24.500
And there's nothing like the isolation tank to enhance that cause when you have

705
00:38:24.501 --> 00:38:27.440
nothing coming in to your,
to your mind from the body,

706
00:38:27.441 --> 00:38:29.330
the body is sending no signals.

707
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.990
Like all of a sudden you have radio silence and the mind is on its own.

708
00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:38.080
He had the mind without any sensory input is fucking superpowered man in a way

709
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:41.020
that it's very difficult to describe because nobody ever experiences if this the

710
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:45.670
only environment like that in the world where there's nothing coming in and it

711
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:50.140
is beyond bizarre to me that more people aren't aware of this fucking thing.

712
00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.570
I mean I taught,
I've been talking about it for years.

713
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:56.380
We put videos up about it and people come to me about it and they asked me like,

714
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.920
dude,
tell me about the isolation deck.
I'm like,

715
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.450
how could I possibly be an expert in this fucking thing?
All right.

716
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:04.360
All I am is just some dude who has one who uses it.

717
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:09.040
How are they're not scientists that are studying the benefits of this shit and

718
00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:13.780
pushing it to everyone has stress relief as a clarity device,

719
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.560
as a device for objective reasoning and thinking and creativity.

720
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.130
Every artists should have won.
Every athlete should have won.

721
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:24.670
Every fighter should have one.
Anybody where you need deep,

722
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:27.040
intense thought without distraction,

723
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.490
you don't even fucking know what that is until you get in an isolation tank.

724
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.770
You got to get in there.
It's,

725
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.030
I've been pestering the shit out of you did to see it.

726
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:36.150
I've never achieved Ceylon.
You never seen him.
Well,

727
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:39.040
mine's different than anyone you've ever seen because mine is like a custom made

728
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:40.450
one by float labs.

729
00:39:40.451 --> 00:39:43.420
There's one company in Venice that makes the very best in the world.

730
00:39:43.421 --> 00:39:45.400
Their float labs.com no question about it.

731
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:49.330
They make the best equipment and the guy crash who builds it is a a freak.

732
00:39:49.331 --> 00:39:52.270
He's a,
he's the mad scientist of isolation tanks.

733
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:55.780
He's actually come up with this new device.
You would love this guy.

734
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.220
He's right up your alley.

735
00:39:57.221 --> 00:40:00.400
I want to introduce you guys to each other because he's so fucking nuts.

736
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.410
Super Genius,
brilliant but nuts.
And he's,

737
00:40:02.411 --> 00:40:07.411
his latest thing is he's got this screen that he's developed for use above the

738
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:12.160
isolation tank and speakers that float in the water right next to your ear.

739
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:16.660
So you center yourself in between these two speakers and then the screen in
meds.

740
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.510
So little light that you cannot see the edges.

741
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.560
You cannot see anything except the image because you're in complete pitch

742
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:27.160
blackness when you're in that tank.
So anything,
you know,
his visual,

743
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.001
anything is visible.

744
00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:32.170
So it's still the lowest amount of light physically possible for these things.

745
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.790
So literally the image is just floating in space in front of you would no other

746
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:40.770
distractions.
And apparently you can learn like a motherfucker.

747
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.860
This way you retain an incredible amount of information.
You,
you have all these,

748
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:49.450
uh,
the access to all this resources of your mind that are usually thinking about

749
00:40:49.451 --> 00:40:49.941
like,
man,

750
00:40:49.941 --> 00:40:53.350
my ass is fucking uncomfortable and should I take my wallet out of my back

751
00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:56.090
pocket or these shoes suck.
And I got a,

752
00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:00.310
of my sock all this information and keeps constantly coming into the mind about

753
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:02.410
just social things and noises.

754
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.040
There's none of that was none of that in there just as floating image.

755
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.310
So he's dedicated a considerable amount of time over the last three years.

756
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:13.420
He keeps talking to me about it.
I'm not interested in it because to me the,

757
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.111
what's the,

758
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:18.280
what's fascinating about the isolation tank is the quiet and solitude and I want

759
00:41:18.281 --> 00:41:21.300
to go in.
I want,
I don't want to,
I don't want to see things right.

760
00:41:21.301 --> 00:41:24.340
I want to go in,
I want to,
I want to explore the mind.

761
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.700
I want to explore a possible directions of consciousness.

762
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.990
Whether or not you can control that shit.
You know how much of your,
your,

763
00:41:31.991 --> 00:41:34.250
your thought and how much of creativity

764
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.730
<v 4>can control it.
That's all I'm concerned with.
That's why I like to use the thing,</v>

765
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.460
but if you wanted to use it as an educational tool,

766
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:42.530
it would be fucking incredible.
It'd be great.

767
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.140
Have you played around with lucid dreaming at all?

768
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.670
This is a very interesting subject because we just started selling this stuff

769
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:52.310
called Alpha brain and what Alpha brain is,

770
00:41:52.311 --> 00:41:57.311
it's a nootropic and it's basically a bunch of different naturally occurring

771
00:41:57.441 --> 00:41:59.600
chemicals.
Things from plants and what have you,

772
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:02.720
and synthesize things that are supposed to enhance cognitive function.

773
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.850
So we put it out and it makes me feel clearer how much of that is a placebo

774
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:11.330
effect.
I'm more than willing to admit that.
I don't know,

775
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.010
because the placebo effect is an affinity,
phenomenal thing.
And on top of it,

776
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:16.241
it's,

777
00:42:16.241 --> 00:42:20.810
it's been proven that the placebo effect actually can work even on people who

778
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.280
know it's a placebo,
you know?
So it's,

779
00:42:23.281 --> 00:42:26.270
it's a very bizarre and misunderstood thing.

780
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.420
But the dreams lead me in my objective analysis of it to say there's something

781
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:38.000
very clear that's happening.
The dreams are much more vivid and they're lucid.

782
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.820
I'm having lucid dreams all the time.
And on top of that,

783
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:45.620
I remember a good deal of them when I wake up,
which is pretty rare,
you know,

784
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.320
I'm in the middle of dreams and I just stopped and I go,
Whoa,

785
00:42:48.321 --> 00:42:51.560
I'm in the middle of a dream now.
And I'm not even close to waken up.
Like,

786
00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:54.620
this is weird because a lot of times I'd be in the middle of a dream and go,

787
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:56.930
fucking,
this is amazing.
Oh my God,
I'm a dreaming.
Oh,
I'm awake.

788
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:02.240
I freak out that I'm dreaming and I just,
I blow the illusion away.

789
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.000
But with this stuff,
for whatever reason,
when I take this,

790
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:07.010
these Alpha brain pills,
especially at night,

791
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:11.360
I wake up while I'm having these lucid dreams and I'm able to stay in the dream.

792
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.800
I don't they say it's Coleen.
Do you know?
Yes.
The acetylcholine,

793
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:19.010
the neurotransmitter,
modern,
uh,
modern.
It's a lot of this and the,

794
00:43:19.011 --> 00:43:23.230
I'm wondering if your product has huperzine a in it.
Who has seen a,
okay,

795
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.260
so [inaudible] is an Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor.
So the ace,

796
00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:30.020
if you ever received one,
I'll show you what it is.
Yeah.
So the ace,

797
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.470
like Acetylcholine Esta race is something that breaks down acetylcholine.

798
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.990
So if it's an,
if it's a Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor,

799
00:43:35.991 --> 00:43:38.210
it means that it allows you to call into,
lasts longer.

800
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.380
So it pretty much stays awake longer.
It's more,
it increases.

801
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:44.720
And I may get some of the technicalities wrong with the half life of

802
00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:49.290
Acetylcholine.
So who present a is uh,
is,

803
00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:53.480
is really fascinating for [inaudible].
Yeah,
sure.
So this is,

804
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.790
I can't read this should,
why?
Yeah,
this is challenged I font GPC calling.
Oh yeah.

805
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.940
Hooper,
Zia Serato.

806
00:43:58.941 --> 00:44:03.260
So that's the 0.5% who present a that definitely will help vimpat vinpocetine

807
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.960
have been posted and also very cool.
Uh,

808
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.660
I used to have this in the product that I used to make back in the day.

809
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.710
We'll do take one of those and tell me what you think of it because,
uh,
I,

810
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.420
I Bobo a light me up giving it to my friends.

811
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.240
Every single one of them has had positive experiences with it.

812
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:21.680
I really do think it makes my mind seemed clearer with people who are interested

813
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:24.920
in,
we sell it@onatdotcomonnit.com.

814
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.720
We sold out of all of our orders in like the first couple of weeks of August.

815
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.040
It was cool.
We sort of underestimated

816
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.420
<v 0>the amount of,
uh,
of demand for this stuff.
But it works.
I swear it works.
I,</v>

817
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.110
I shit you not,
I wouldn't be talking about this.
And it's one of the,
you know,

818
00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:43.530
like when I tell people if I'm selling something or if I'm promoting something,

819
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:48.660
I guarantee you 100% I believe it.
You might not agree with me.

820
00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:51.990
You might say it doesn't work,
but I would never bullshit you never.

821
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.400
And this stuff to me,
I feel it does something to,

822
00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.750
allows my mind to function at a smooth and energetic level.

823
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:01.620
It feels good.

824
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.620
<v 2>Yeah.
The,
the ingredients makes sense.
I used to,</v>

825
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.890
I got started with the smart drug stuff in college.

826
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:12.360
I decided to use the FDA personal importation policy to bring in,

827
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.540
uh,
Prasad Tam,
hider,

828
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:18.540
gene vasopressor on all of these drugs from Europe to test on myself

829
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.050
for learning purposes.

830
00:45:22.051 --> 00:45:27.000
And one of them Vasopressin is used as an antidiuretic hormone and kids,

831
00:45:27.001 --> 00:45:29.970
if they're older and they wet the bed,
they start using this nasal spray,

832
00:45:29.971 --> 00:45:33.150
which is vast present.
What's fascinating about it is part of the reason,

833
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:37.180
if some people feel that they experience the same memory loss with alcohol,

834
00:45:37.181 --> 00:45:39.750
they drink too much.
Is it depletes you of vasopressor,

835
00:45:39.751 --> 00:45:44.450
which is necessary for short term memory,
some types of pot also.
Uh,
but if you,

836
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.980
if you,
Jack,
you know,

837
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:50.190
if you squirt and vasopressor and into each nostril wa I was able to do is

838
00:45:50.191 --> 00:45:52.080
before Chinese character test,

839
00:45:52.081 --> 00:45:57.081
we would have these character quizzes and I could literally take two shots.

840
00:45:57.181 --> 00:45:58.170
One in each nostril,

841
00:45:58.171 --> 00:46:03.171
flip through the characters sit to has a very short effect and then 10 minutes

842
00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:08.240
later score 98 plus on these,
these recall tests.

843
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.640
Wild.
Really wild.

844
00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.880
<v 0>What is the shelf?
I mean,
what is the,
uh,
the act of life of it?
Yeah,</v>

845
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.060
<v 2>it's very,
very short.
Well,
the,
here's the thing with our,
uh,
yeah,</v>

846
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:21.110
something like that I would guess,
but,
well actually it probably lasts longer,

847
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.560
but the learning effect that I experienced was very short.
It's like 30 minutes.

848
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.530
But since it's antidiuretic,
I mean it doesn't as a parent wouldn't,

849
00:46:27.531 --> 00:46:30.200
didn't do very much good to have your kid not pissed for 30 minutes.

850
00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:34.590
And then just what the bed,
so I'm imagining it last longer.
Uh,
but the,

851
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:35.540
the other one,

852
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.520
<v 0>what is the,
what's going on though?
Why is it that allow you to</v>

853
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.500
<v 2>my,</v>

854
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.800
my understanding may in somebody who's listening can probably do a better job on

855
00:46:42.801 --> 00:46:45.740
Google of getting the,
getting the details of Wikipedia or wherever.

856
00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:46.450
But vasopressin,

857
00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:51.290
my understanding is that it is a hormone that is necessary for short term

858
00:46:51.291 --> 00:46:53.780
memory.
So the actual formation of the short term memories,

859
00:46:53.781 --> 00:46:56.750
which is all bio biologically limited.
Uh,

860
00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:01.820
and I think we are very optimistic about how much we know about the brand.

861
00:47:01.821 --> 00:47:02.660
I think that it's,

862
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.150
I mean [inaudible] have to rewrite it all in five years probably,

863
00:47:05.151 --> 00:47:08.810
but most people think of short term,
you have working memory,
short term memory,

864
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:11.220
long term memory for that transfer to short term and longterm.

865
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.940
Once it makes that jump,
you're good to go.

866
00:47:13.941 --> 00:47:17.900
So it's not like when I stopped using vasopressor and I lost those memories as

867
00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:22.370
long as I repeated it used intelligent space repetition to repeat it at some

868
00:47:22.371 --> 00:47:26.690
point before I lost it.
Uh,
with like the Ebbinghaus curve and all of that.
So,
uh,

869
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.000
Pimsleur,
if people are interested,
Pimsleur is the,

870
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.070
who looked very closely at this,
what's s spells a p.
I m s l e,

871
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:38.050
U R and they have a lot of language programs based on,
on his methodology.

872
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:40.870
I find it really slow.
I think they're faster ways to do it,

873
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:45.871
but the Vasopressin and then hydrogen I found to have a really favorable sort of

874
00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:50.860
effect to side effect ratio.
Uh,
where's it been posting?

875
00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:54.370
I didn't see anything from some of the really strong stuff like modafinil have

876
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:57.380
you see if you're at an Olympic Games.
I try that.
Vim proceed.

877
00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:02.380
How do you say that?
Uh,
yeah.
Oh No,
there's,
there's uh,
yeah,

878
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.460
so I think this has been posted teen right here,
which is in the,

879
00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.850
<v 0>I've tried that on its own and I didn't,
didn't really feel anything with it.</v>

880
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.340
<v 2>You'll feel a lot if you,
and I don't recommend this,</v>

881
00:48:12.341 --> 00:48:15.370
but what it does is it sensitizes you to other things,

882
00:48:15.371 --> 00:48:18.370
which is part of the reason why it makes sense to have in small doses and a

883
00:48:18.371 --> 00:48:22.450
product like this,
which is why I'm not,
I'm happy to pop one of these,

884
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:26.470
but I'm going to wait about 30 minutes because I know that the blood caffeine

885
00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:27.580
concentration I have right now,

886
00:48:27.581 --> 00:48:30.310
if I combine it with simplicity and I'll be fucking ricocheting off the,

887
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:35.370
<v 3>really give me that.
Let me try it.
See what happens.</v>

888
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.910
That's,
so I wish,
I,
I wish I could be like you.
I wish I,

889
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.600
you seem like you have everything exactly planned out.
You know what,

890
00:48:42.601 --> 00:48:47.160
this will happen to your body with your body that you know everything.

891
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.070
<v 0>Brian,
listen,
I love you,
but you're a man child.</v>

892
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:54.770
<v 3>No,
but I mean most of the most fittest people in the smartest people aren't</v>

893
00:48:54.771 --> 00:48:56.660
connected to their body as much as you are.

894
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.400
I'm going to show you an experiment where I need some,
uh,

895
00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:01.130
<v 2>I'm going to need to grab some of your water then in that case.
Sure.</v>

896
00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:06.170
So I'll encourage everybody to listen carefully as my word per minute rate goes

897
00:49:06.171 --> 00:49:08.990
through the roof.
Uh,
cool.
Thank you.

898
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.050
But powerful drugs,
smart drugs.

899
00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.030
We have quite a quite a combination of things going on.
What?

900
00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.400
<v 0>Oh,
we do.
Yeah,
we got caffeine,
weed,
this stuff.
We've got a lot lot happening.</v>

901
00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.230
We're experimenting with the mind.

902
00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:28.870
So what we add on at.com we just started putting this stuff out and uh,
the,

903
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:32.090
the positive feedback has been fucking crazy,
man.

904
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.750
People love this shit and I really,
you could have that male,

905
00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:35.870
I'm not going to drink out of it now.

906
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:39.603
<v 3>Nice guy.</v>

907
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.430
<v 0>Yeah,
you traveled all over the world.</v>

908
00:49:41.431 --> 00:49:44.640
Dude knows what kind of exotic shit you brought back with you.

909
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:49.680
How did you get into this?
A whole writing books and,
and,
and,
and,
and you know,

910
00:49:49.681 --> 00:49:50.640
and breaking things down.

911
00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:52.920
You have so many internet speeches and so many different,

912
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.970
I mean I saw a fascinating one that you did on dating that I thought was very

913
00:49:56.971 --> 00:49:59.280
frank and honest and you know,

914
00:49:59.281 --> 00:50:03.750
it was like you had a really great analysis and the analysis was that you don't

915
00:50:03.751 --> 00:50:05.820
put all your eggs in one basket in your life.

916
00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:08.400
You don't judge your own self worth by one singular thing.

917
00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:12.330
And that's why you said you're invested in athletics and knowledge and

918
00:50:12.331 --> 00:50:15.030
experience and you have a bunch of different things you're interested in.

919
00:50:15.031 --> 00:50:19.080
So if something happens in some chance of fate,
one thing goes wrong.

920
00:50:19.081 --> 00:50:20.250
You're not devastated,

921
00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:22.890
you're still an accomplished human being and all these different areas.

922
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:27.800
But that so many people will get involved in relationships and from the get go

923
00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:30.620
they would just grab one girl and just stick with this one.

924
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.670
And you were like date a few different women.
It seems so self evident.

925
00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.620
It seems so obvious but date more than one woman until you find the one you'd

926
00:50:38.621 --> 00:50:42.440
like the best.
If you stick with one like right off the bat.

927
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.303
Just because this was,

928
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:46.670
especially when you're first know each other and you're both completely full of

929
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:50.150
Shit,
you know what I mean?
Oh God.
Especially when you're young,
I mean,

930
00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:54.380
what 24 year old is really that person when you first start dating them,

931
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.770
and especially guys were completely full of shit when we first started dating a

932
00:50:57.771 --> 00:51:00.890
check.
We want them to like us,
we're on our best behavior,

933
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:04.540
and then we slowly let our real personality come out.
You know?

934
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.850
And I think you know,
your,
your advice was a,

935
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:11.480
was something that a lot of people wouldn't say because it makes you seem like

936
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:16.210
you're a player or it makes you seem like you're trying to be a sleazy guy and

937
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.500
you know,
look guys,
I'm going to show you how to get laid.
This is how it goes.

938
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:23.600
Number one,
who's going to do date other chicks?
Man,
what the fuck bro?

939
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:27.080
Why cut yourself short bro?
But you're saying exactly what that guy's saying,

940
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:30.620
but you're saying it and you've in a sense that you an intelligent way.

941
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:33.770
You've analyzed the situation.
He said,
well,
there's clear,

942
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.520
there's a clear way to eliminate a lot of the problems that people run into.

943
00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:38.354
And this is one of them.

944
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.750
<v 2>Yeah.
And it's,
uh,
for me,</v>

945
00:51:40.751 --> 00:51:43.690
I think that's part of the reason I get so much shit online too,
is that I,

946
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:49.200
I s if I have a strong opinion based on experiments or data or whatever,

947
00:51:50.261 --> 00:51:54.490
I'll share it.
And then there's a lot that is then misconstrued from that.

948
00:51:54.491 --> 00:51:57.250
Or maybe I just come across like a deck.
I don't know.
It could be that too.

949
00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.760
But the way this all started was a,

950
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.230
<v 0>I can help you there.
Okay.
You don't come across like a dick at all.</v>

951
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:06.360
This is what you come across like you come across like a confident guy who's

952
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.790
smarter than me,
you know?
And when I hear a guy talk like that,
I'm like,
oh,
hey,

953
00:52:10.791 --> 00:52:14.840
here's a guy that is well-read,
knows a bunch of different fucking languages,

954
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.630
thinks of things,
and then goes after them,

955
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.070
enjoys learning and information travels the world.
That makes me uncomfortable.

956
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.830
That makes me uncomfortable.
And then you say,
date a bunch of different women.

957
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.670
Oh you fucking piece of shit.
They're looking for something to be wrong with you.

958
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:33.350
That's what it is.
I mean,
I'm not blowing smoke up your ass.
You're a young,

959
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:36.560
smart guy with a lot of interest and that makes people upset.

960
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:41.680
And if you try to put logic and attach logic to anything that involves men and

961
00:52:41.871 --> 00:52:42.920
women in relationships,

962
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:46.410
people will call you a piece of shit or chauvinist or you know,

963
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:51.560
or a player.
That's what it is,
guys trying to get laid.

964
00:52:51.561 --> 00:52:54.980
What's the fuck what happened there and this and that when everybody's trying to

965
00:52:54.981 --> 00:52:58.880
do,
isn't that why you're selling me fucking cars with no chicks in bikinis

966
00:52:58.881 --> 00:53:02.030
straddled on the hood.
What?
What are you selling me here man,

967
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:05.930
you're selling me pussy.
And then if somebody actually likes pussy and they,

968
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.310
oh he goes after pussy.

969
00:53:07.311 --> 00:53:11.220
What's he doing you fucking weak weak thing with your ego and no,

970
00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:14.240
I think she's a hunt shit.
So you know Chinese fuck,

971
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:18.860
you know it says something about someone who's like out there just doing a bunch

972
00:53:18.861 --> 00:53:21.620
of shit while you're sitting at home with a beer in your lab.
You know,

973
00:53:21.621 --> 00:53:25.420
like this fucking queer know.
He just,
that's what it is.
That's hale.

974
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.840
<v 4>Do anything wrong.
There's a big,
yeah,</v>

975
00:53:27.841 --> 00:53:30.990
there's a large contingent of people aren't convinced that I'm gay also.
Really?

976
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.750
I,
yeah,
yeah.
It goes both ways,
but the talk too smart.

977
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.800
You don't have enough flavor in your voice.
I masked it.

978
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:40.980
I'm from long island originally.
Man.
It takes a while.
Yeah.
You're smart guy.

979
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:45.390
You look,
here's the deal.
You might find a Boston accent.

980
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:48.690
I had a Boston accent for awhile.
I got rid of my Boston accent.
I had it.

981
00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:50.880
When I listen to myself on TV when I was 19 years old,

982
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.700
I heard myself talking in an interview and I was like,
oh my God,

983
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:58.230
I sound like the biggest fucking Maura taekwondo tournament that I won.

984
00:53:58.231 --> 00:54:00.720
And I was on TV.
And they're like,
yeah,
we've been working really hard.

985
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.340
Listen to me.
What is wrong with that?
You could shake that shit loose.

986
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.270
But you know,
we,

987
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.860
we obviously imitate our environment and your environment over the,
you know,

988
00:54:10.861 --> 00:54:14.310
a big period of your life has been around thinkers and your environment has been

989
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:19.311
around people that are likeminded and in these subjects that you're pursuing.

990
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.350
That's why you sound like you gay.
Okay,
fair enough.

991
00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:25.470
I think you sound like you sound like nobody.
They know.

992
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.490
See they don't know anybody like that.
It wouldn't know anybody.
Super Smart.

993
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:33.310
You know,
I've met a lot of mistakes and a couple of narrow areas and I think it,

994
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.160
<v 2>that allows me to talk,
I use a lot of vocabulary and a few places,
but the,</v>

995
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:41.990
the writing part was totally accidental.
Yeah.

996
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.730
I find writing really difficult.
I,

997
00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:47.940
<v 4>well this fucking books giant.
Yeah.
It's a big one.
It's like a chooser.</v>

998
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:52.770
Our body has let latest one is your latest one.
This is a giant ass books on one.

999
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.310
Yeah.
That was after cutting 150 pages.
Tiffany Campbell.
Yeah.

1000
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.980
There's like 600 fucking pages I promise myself

1001
00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:03.460
<v 2>after,
uh,
after college because my senior thesis almost killed me.</v>

1002
00:55:03.461 --> 00:55:07.420
I actually took a year off of school in large part because this project became

1003
00:55:07.421 --> 00:55:09.440
such a monster for me.
Uh,

1004
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.910
and I promised myself that I would never write anything longer than an email

1005
00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:16.540
when I graduated.
And now he said that didn't work out very well.
But,
uh,

1006
00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:21.160
I knew I wanted to be a teacher because of a few people in my life who had

1007
00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:27.910
a huge impact on me,
like my wrestling coach,
uh,
Mr Buxton,
uh,

1008
00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.290
but a number of Reverend Greenleaf,
uh,

1009
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:35.170
in a number of others and I just wanted to have that impact on other people,

1010
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.090
but I felt like,
all right,
I'm going to have to go out in the real world,

1011
00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:40.390
actually do something and then I'll go back and teach.
Probably in ninth grade,

1012
00:55:40.391 --> 00:55:43.780
I think I to be really sensitive,
malleable time.

1013
00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:48.910
But when I stumbled across the writing stuff is because I was teaching a class

1014
00:55:48.911 --> 00:55:52.930
twice a year and one of the students in a feedback form said something along the

1015
00:55:52.931 --> 00:55:55.570
lines of,
I don't know why you're teaching 50 students in the class.

1016
00:55:55.571 --> 00:55:57.850
You just write a book and be done with it.
Like,
Hahaha.

1017
00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:02.380
And I started gathering these notes because I had terrible insomnia at the time

1018
00:56:02.381 --> 00:56:05.140
and I would wake up and I'm just write down whenever I was thinking to go back

1019
00:56:05.141 --> 00:56:05.740
to sleep,

1020
00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.800
it wasn't to keep the notes and these notes start piling up with sort of

1021
00:56:08.801 --> 00:56:11.080
hypothetical chapters and this,
that and the other thing.

1022
00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.990
And finally just asked a friend of mine who's a writer,
I was like,

1023
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.220
what is this full of Shit?
Or should I actually go for this?
And he says,
yeah,
no,

1024
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:19.180
you should go for it.
And he introduced me to four agents.

1025
00:56:19.181 --> 00:56:20.620
Three of them turned me down flat.

1026
00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:24.670
One was brand new but had a lot of experience publishing.
So he signed with me.

1027
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:29.060
I use very early stage and then 26 publishers turned it down.

1028
00:56:29.061 --> 00:56:32.500
Then 27th one took it and then I was like,
Oh shit,
now I have to write a book.

1029
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:37.510
And Wow.
Yeah,
initial print run was like 9,000 bucks or something like that.

1030
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:37.960
It was this,

1031
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.260
the premise behind your first book is the four hour workweek and what is the

1032
00:56:41.261 --> 00:56:44.470
premise?
The premise behind that.
I'd say it's two fold.

1033
00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:49.300
The first is that the deferred life plan I e or retirement based career planning

1034
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:54.250
model is fundamentally flawed in a number of ways,
fatally flawed,
uh,
both,

1035
00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:58.560
both financially to sort of numerically and then also it's,

1036
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
it's assuming you will live a long time,

1037
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:05.350
which is I think of really foolish way to Spec out the next 2030 years of your

1038
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.510
prime physical lifetime.

1039
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:12.900
Second is that if you use a few approaches to analyzing your ideal lifestyle

1040
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:17.200
that you're reserving for retirement and you actually arrive at a number like a

1041
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:20.710
target monthly income to finance that whether it's the Aston Martin,

1042
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:22.660
the fricking Chateau,
whatever the hell it might be,

1043
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:27.310
that there are ways to analyze your work so you can get five to 10 x per hour

1044
00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:28.090
more done.

1045
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:30.970
Whether you choose to then reduce your hours or just work the same number of

1046
00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:34.870
hours and just get 10 x the output.
There are things like Parkinson's law,

1047
00:57:34.871 --> 00:57:38.380
80 20 analysis that you can apply to your life just like you would apply it to a

1048
00:57:38.381 --> 00:57:42.310
company if you a CEO and you can jack up your productivity.
Uh,

1049
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:46.000
that's the premise of the first button.
And so,
uh,
you know,
working with,

1050
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.780
I'm involved a lot of startups in Silicon Valley and uh,
you know,

1051
00:57:49.781 --> 00:57:52.840
investor in Facebook and Twitter and stumble upon Evernote,
things like this.

1052
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.720
And you see this type of split testing.

1053
00:57:55.721 --> 00:57:58.390
They do like testing two homepages and then they look at the numbers and then

1054
00:57:58.391 --> 00:58:00.520
they'll test two different buttons and then they'll look at the numbers.

1055
00:58:00.521 --> 00:58:03.670
And you can,
that led me to do that first with my own business,

1056
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:05.440
which was in the sports nutrition world.

1057
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.260
And then after to look at language the same way,
I'm like,

1058
00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:12.670
I'm going to test Pimsleur versus Michelle Thomas for two weeks and these are

1059
00:58:12.671 --> 00:58:17.671
the objective criteria I'm going to use to assess which is the better method.

1060
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.850
And I just started applying that same type of split testing,
uh,
like the drugs.

1061
00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:24.400
Same deal.
I,
you know,
I'll tests,
I'll test to,

1062
00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:28.030
yesterday I was writing a book about a cooking and food right now and I'm trying

1063
00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:30.640
not to chop my fingers off.
So I actually bought a knife and a cutting board.

1064
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:33.910
I'm traveling with it,
have it in my bag right now actually.
But,
uh,

1065
00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:37.720
and I was chopping and I separated like celery out into,
uh,

1066
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:40.870
into equal lengths to test,
to Chinese method of chopping.

1067
00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:42.370
And then like a French method of shopping.

1068
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:45.280
I just want to see which one was fastest.
And so like laid it out.

1069
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:46.540
It's kind of weird,
but

1070
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:51.860
<v 4>you're a fucking Weirdo when you're measuring celery looking after the Chinese</v>

1071
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:55.160
method.
Just chop that shit up,
dude.
What are you doing?
That's ridiculous.

1072
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:56.151
But you know what?

1073
00:58:56.151 --> 00:59:00.320
You never get to the mindset to write a book like the four hour work week unless

1074
00:59:00.321 --> 00:59:03.140
you have some sort of,
you know,
you can call it OCD,

1075
00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:05.480
but it's really just an exceptional interest in things.

1076
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:08.510
And I owe that to my parents,
honestly,
but,
well,
my parents

1077
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.450
<v 2>never,
I came from very moderate background.</v>

1078
00:59:12.451 --> 00:59:15.420
Both my parents work dual income family and uh,

1079
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.410
they didn't have a lot of money for all sorts of trips and things like that.

1080
00:59:19.411 --> 00:59:22.130
But they would expose me to sorts of different

1081
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.600
<v 5>types of things like the aquarium or take me to the beach to let's say pickup</v>

1082
00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.940
magnetic sand,
like the black sand with magnets and so forth.

1083
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:33.470
And then when I have a younger brother and when one of us would become fixated

1084
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:35.030
on something that we really were drawn to,

1085
00:59:35.031 --> 00:59:37.460
then my parents would just put everything behind it.

1086
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:41.930
And so they didn't have a budget for him.
Bb guns out,
like a new bike out,

1087
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.040
but they said we always have a budget for books.

1088
00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:47.630
And I remember I got really into fish and sharks more specifically.

1089
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.380
So my mom bought me this really expensive book.
It's like $40 hardcover.

1090
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:54.380
A Audubon society was Audubon society,

1091
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:57.740
but it was fish and I took it to school and the teacher said to my mom,

1092
00:59:57.741 --> 00:59:59.470
at some point,
she's like,
you know,
you really shouldn't happen.

1093
00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.360
The have allowed him to bring the book to school,
he'll destroy the book.

1094
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:06.470
And my mom was like,
he's not going to destroy them.
You're an idiot.
And a,

1095
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:08.640
I think that by the,

1096
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:12.450
the training of the conditioning that I've had through my,
uh,

1097
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:17.450
through my parents to just go after whatever I'm interested in and feel

1098
01:00:17.451 --> 01:00:20.090
supported in doing that is what's led me to all this stuff.

1099
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:22.520
Has it ever backfired when it comes to chicks?

1100
01:00:22.521 --> 01:00:26.510
If you ever become an unwanted stalker and didn't realize you were doing it,

1101
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.250
you would just trying to be so persistent and shaky and that it became a

1102
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:34.700
sickness.
Uh,
not,
not so much as a stalker.
The one habit I have,

1103
01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:37.420
which gets me into a lot of trouble with guys as much as,

1104
01:00:37.421 --> 01:00:42.120
as checks this might be also related to the gay thing is uh,
uh,

1105
01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:46.970
you know,
really it's sucking all the GAA cause it's a terrible habit.

1106
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:49.370
And once you start,
I don't think it's like cigarettes,

1107
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:53.120
but I would know what I was going to say is that that guy that can be edited

1108
01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:53.954
terribly.
But

1109
01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.580
I was a,
I look at,
I,

1110
01:01:00.581 --> 01:01:03.990
I'm fascinated by people and so I'll look at them.
And so I,

1111
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.920
if I'm looking at Lucy and attractive girl across the bar and she's like smiling

1112
01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:09.560
and okay cool.
I go from like flirty,

1113
01:01:09.561 --> 01:01:13.790
I contact to creepy eye contact really quickly and it doesn't register with me

1114
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:15.510
because I'm just fascinated at,

1115
01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:18.260
so you're a scientist and they think you're a killer.

1116
01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:20.690
They think I'm a serial killer.
Yeah,
but you're just a scientist.

1117
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.140
I'm just fascinated by visual stimuli.

1118
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:27.440
Need to sound like you're high when you're not high.

1119
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:31.440
I might be kind of high when you're not high.
We're right now you oh,

1120
01:01:31.441 --> 01:01:34.670
you know what I mean?
It sounds like that's what a high person doll.
Absolutely.

1121
01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:38.300
And I mean I think that I could,
I mean I can get high.

1122
01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.230
I tried to engineer highs doing other things,
so I do,

1123
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:45.530
I tend to do that say five to 10 minutes of Pasta and a meditation.

1124
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:50.390
Just awareness meditation in the mornings.
And I always have either a poo,
air t,

1125
01:01:50.391 --> 01:01:53.740
which is a Chinese like dark tea or Yerba latte.

1126
01:01:53.741 --> 01:01:57.170
I really like Argentine.
Yerba Monte has three different stimulants in it.

1127
01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:01.640
So I tried to time it when I wake up so that it hits my bloodstream as I met as

1128
01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:04.940
a meditating.
Oh.
And uh,
it's not very strong,

1129
01:02:04.941 --> 01:02:09.941
but the after effect that I have for two or three hours is absolutely a high,

1130
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:14.090
most of one of those guys that is really productive in the mornings.
Uh,
no,
no,

1131
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.920
not uh,
but I try,
I recognize from me at least that how I set up my morning,

1132
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.250
the first 60 minutes

1133
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.710
<v 2>will determine my productivity for the rest of the day.</v>

1134
01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:26.680
<v 0>Now are you,
you're,
are you so organized that you have like every day lined up,</v>

1135
01:02:26.681 --> 01:02:30.660
like you have objectives for each day and you have like a schedule for each day?

1136
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.720
<v 2>I have one or two pretty much work for yourself,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1137
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:34.800
I have one or two,

1138
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.240
no more than one or two primary to dues per day and I actually try to calendar

1139
01:02:39.241 --> 01:02:41.700
as very as least as possible.

1140
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:44.760
It's actually something I realized that Swartz Nagger does and a handful of

1141
01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.740
other people,
they will not put things on the calendar.
There's like,

1142
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:51.300
call me if I'm available,
I'm available.
If I'm not,
I'm not.
And that provides,

1143
01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.134
at least me,

1144
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:55.440
particularly if I'm writing on writing deadline with a lot of flexibility,

1145
01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:00.270
but I still have,
you know,
one or two to do's that I try to get done,
uh,

1146
01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.870
or may or hit a milestone in progress for uh,

1147
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:05.880
before I check email.

1148
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:09.600
So I try to set one hour in the morning to at least focus on one of those two.

1149
01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:11.850
Purdue's before any kind of reactive work.

1150
01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:15.080
<v 0>You sound like such a,
I don't think I've ever met someone so productive.</v>

1151
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.050
Have you ever met anybody that even sounds

1152
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.030
<v 2>no,
but it's pretty awesome and like I'm spiker this book at how many interesting</v>

1153
01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:26.410
things are in it?
Uh,
the Diet that you have in here,
that's the four hour body.

1154
01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:30.760
That's a difference.
The four hour body,
the diners is lose 20 pounds in 30 days.

1155
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:34.240
And I was looking at through,
it's an all carb diet.

1156
01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.150
It's very weight watcher you almost like,
but kind of edits.

1157
01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:41.620
I lost a six 65 pounds in three months.

1158
01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:44.920
And when I did is I pretty much took a weight watchers and I cut out all the

1159
01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:48.050
bullshit.
So I just,
I didn't do like the fruits and,
and,

1160
01:03:48.051 --> 01:03:50.530
and I stay away from nuts and,
and things like that.

1161
01:03:50.531 --> 01:03:54.040
But it was pretty much I was getting the nutrients I needed and stuff.

1162
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:59.190
But I it just more sought doing it like you missed foods but it just burned

1163
01:03:59.561 --> 01:04:00.394
calories.

1164
01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.630
The slow carb is actually closest to something I tried before arriving at that,

1165
01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.120
which was the cyclical ketogenic diet.

1166
01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:10.600
So Atkins has just a brand name applied to the Ketogenic Diet,
right,

1167
01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:14.800
where your body's working off of Ketones instead of glucose dangerous?

1168
01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:19.600
I don't think so.
No.
So what's dangerous is Keto acidosis that you see in Diabet,

1169
01:04:19.601 --> 01:04:21.550
like diabetics for example,
as opposed to ketosis.

1170
01:04:21.551 --> 01:04:25.480
But the diet was originally designed for epileptic children but should be put

1171
01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:28.840
kids on what people think of as an Atkins diet,
high,

1172
01:04:28.841 --> 01:04:31.810
high fat and then high protein and next to no carbs.

1173
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.040
High fat is really important.

1174
01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:37.170
So you see a lot of cream in the diets for kids cut downs on it will cut down on

1175
01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.380
epilepsy,
epileptic seizures like 75 80% in many cases.

1176
01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:45.160
It's astonishing.
And the slow carb Diet,

1177
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:49.060
cyclical ketogenic diet is where you combine it with exercise so that you're in

1178
01:04:49.061 --> 01:04:51.190
Ketosis for five or six days.

1179
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:56.320
Then you carbohydrate load for 24 hours for the insulin and anabolic effects and

1180
01:04:56.321 --> 01:05:00.580
then you go back into ketosis.
Uh,
but it's a huge pain in the ass that one is.

1181
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:05.710
But if you do roughly sort of a Paleo type diet with legumes and then you eat

1182
01:05:06.041 --> 01:05:09.370
whatever the fuck you off for one day,
it's like an approximated version of that.

1183
01:05:09.371 --> 01:05:10.330
That works really,
really well.

1184
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:13.970
<v 0>I don't think of a,
in terms of doing a B,
having a paleo diet,</v>

1185
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.370
but I try to cut back way back on my bread and is,

1186
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.340
I try to eat very little of that stuff and I try to eat only shit the grows.

1187
01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:24.600
That's what I try to eat or treat it.
Anything that grows,
anything that's alive,

1188
01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:28.180
it's salads or vegetables or animals.
Anything that grows face or on the ground.

1189
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:31.480
Yeah,
that's it.
That's,
that's what,
that's what I like to eat.
You know,

1190
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:35.510
when you start eating a lot of pastas and breads and you know,
and sodas and,
and,

1191
01:05:35.511 --> 01:05:36.610
and just nonsense.

1192
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.200
I absolutely feel a difference in how my body processes it.

1193
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.820
What kind of energy my body has.

1194
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.050
I always feel way healthiest when I'm just eating a lot of vegetables and just

1195
01:05:47.051 --> 01:05:50.560
meet and stuff along those lines,
which I guess is the Paleo Diet,
right?

1196
01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:51.561
<v 5>It is.
I mean,</v>

1197
01:05:51.561 --> 01:05:55.610
I think it's been that the term has been cooptive by a lot of people who turn it

1198
01:05:55.611 --> 01:05:57.080
into like a mania fad.

1199
01:05:57.190 --> 01:06:00.950
And I see you have a think on both extremes and not everyone who,

1200
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:04.370
who had self identify with Paleo is extreme,

1201
01:06:04.371 --> 01:06:08.420
but you find that like the Paleo is in the vegans have this like extreme war

1202
01:06:08.421 --> 01:06:12.680
going on.
There's a war.
It's war of,
I'll take the Paleo,

1203
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:18.420
I got five bucks on the Paleos.
Uh,
but,
but I think that we're a lot of,

1204
01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:21.960
a lot of folks miss the boat.
Uh,
and I think your approach is,

1205
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:26.630
is right in the sense that when you become really militant about one side or the

1206
01:06:26.631 --> 01:06:29.240
other,
if your,
if your goal is to help other people,

1207
01:06:29.241 --> 01:06:32.360
you have to look at the compliance as much as how effective it is.

1208
01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.010
So it's like you might be able to get,

1209
01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:37.940
let's say someone on biggest loser and shaped by duct taping bowling balls to

1210
01:06:37.941 --> 01:06:40.220
their hands and having to run through the fucking desert with a weighted sled

1211
01:06:40.221 --> 01:06:40.910
behind them.

1212
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:44.540
But once they're off of national television and they're not shamed into crying

1213
01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:46.750
with product placement,
like how long are they going to actually do that?

1214
01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.800
Probably never again cause that what they do on that show,

1215
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.790
I saw a tweet at one point that I thought was great,

1216
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.190
which was a biggest loser equals fat people crying and product placement,

1217
01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:01.360
which I though was really dead on because you can't fill an hour or whatever it

1218
01:07:01.701 --> 01:07:06.080
is,
half hour even on a weekly basis with simplicity,
you can't do it.

1219
01:07:06.081 --> 01:07:08.630
You can't be like,
all right,
Kettlebell swings three times a week.

1220
01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.970
You'd fucking done focus on your diet because that's the only way you're gonna

1221
01:07:10.971 --> 01:07:11.360
lose fat.

1222
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.900
You can't do that because you have to fill 30 minutes of fat people running

1223
01:07:14.901 --> 01:07:17.570
around.
Um,
so I did actually see when,

1224
01:07:17.571 --> 01:07:21.200
where they had these morbidly obese people with weighted sleds attached to them

1225
01:07:21.201 --> 01:07:23.950
running through like sand dunes.
So terrible.
Yeah.

1226
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.470
This is the doing yoga cruel and unusual punishment.
You know,

1227
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:30.880
<v 0>when you lose a lot of weight really fast,
it fucks your metabolism up to,</v>

1228
01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:35.140
it doesn't,
especially when you do it at a really low calorie level,

1229
01:07:35.141 --> 01:07:38.380
if you like cut your calories,
like if you're supposed to have a thousand a day,

1230
01:07:38.381 --> 01:07:41.330
there's people that will go 500 a day just to lose weight quicker.
Yeah.

1231
01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:42.410
But when they do it,
Jack,

1232
01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.650
<v 5>fuck yeah,
it'll kill your thyroid among other things.</v>

1233
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.960
And that's why you see women who've lost,

1234
01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.930
they lose 50 60 pounds when they do by starving themselves,

1235
01:07:50.931 --> 01:07:55.310
and then they really fuck their thyroid and they not only plateau,

1236
01:07:55.311 --> 01:07:57.110
but they start to have all sorts of hormonal issues.

1237
01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.670
<v 0>And then they have empty tits as a Saturday when they're there,</v>

1238
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.070
when they're plump and their tits are big and full.

1239
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:07.180
And then they get crazy and go anorexic and lose a ton of weight and their tests

1240
01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:10.770
become like empty little bags,
goats,
boobies.

1241
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:16.040
It's the saddest thing.
Or when a girl is a perfect ass,
then she just gains

1242
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.790
<v 4>a little bit of weight and all of a sudden their stretch marks on her ass.
Like,</v>

1243
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.230
man,
what the fuck happened?
Like you didn't,

1244
01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:24.560
you weren't in a pain while your ass was growling.
You kept eating.
Like,

1245
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:28.110
look what it did to your ass,
your ass as railroad tracks on it.
And you know,

1246
01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:32.420
at a nowhere,
what the fuck is that?
How do girls get stretch marks on the Ras?

1247
01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:36.020
So quick?
I saw guys get stretch marks on their packs,
I guess.
You know,

1248
01:08:36.021 --> 01:08:38.510
it's just like,
it's a lot easier to gain fat than it is to gain muscle.

1249
01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:41.900
So I'd like you see these guys with these incredible stretch marks on the

1250
01:08:41.901 --> 01:08:45.420
outside of the packs.
And I think that,
you know,
for women,
uh,

1251
01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.710
like guys put it on the Gut and women put it right on the ass and the legs.

1252
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.060
Isn't it like genetic though as far as stretch marks?

1253
01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:53.620
Like some people just don't get straight like some women,
oh yeah.
Stretch.

1254
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.240
But I think it has a lot.
I think that humidity actually plays a part too.
Yeah.

1255
01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:01.220
So the more humid the climate,
the frustration you're going to have,

1256
01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:02.420
but that totally makes sense.

1257
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:05.610
<v 5>Charles Poliquin who's,
uh,
uh,
Olympic level,</v>

1258
01:09:05.611 --> 01:09:07.830
professional level strength coach recommends it.

1259
01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.250
His athletes or women who are losing a lot of weight or men I suppose for that

1260
01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:15.780
reason,
um,
use,
I think it's Gotu Kola as a cream,

1261
01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:20.040
which helps with the stretch marks.
Hmm.
Apparently that's what he prescribes.

1262
01:09:20.610 --> 01:09:21.130
Uh,

1263
01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:24.430
<v 4>I use oil Valais Olay on of,
of,
so to answered my question,</v>

1264
01:09:24.431 --> 01:09:27.460
you never get creepy with checks because you're obsessed with getting them.

1265
01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.980
I've been dating a great girl for about five months,
so I'm,

1266
01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.220
I'm not on the market,
but before that,
before that did you,

1267
01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:37.810
I'm not accusing you of anything.

1268
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:42.370
I'm just saying that you have this incredibly inquisitive mind and this,
this,

1269
01:09:42.371 --> 01:09:47.371
I'm going to accomplish my goals mentality and there are certain people who have

1270
01:09:47.981 --> 01:09:51.630
that mentality and it works all great until it comes to people like you that

1271
01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.330
yeah.

1272
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:56.080
Communicating with people because it to be super successful at a lot of things.

1273
01:09:56.090 --> 01:10:00.860
There's a certain amount of bull dog aggression or book,
you know,
the,
the,

1274
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:05.870
the ability to push forward and keep your eye on the prize and focus and focus.

1275
01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.400
And if you're a socially retarded person and you have that and you are into a

1276
01:10:11.771 --> 01:10:13.150
chick,
it could get ugly.

1277
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:17.830
<v 5>Oh yeah,
for sure.
I think that I've definitely creep girls out,
but it's usually,</v>

1278
01:10:17.831 --> 01:10:20.590
it's usually because I'm doing some fucking experiment.

1279
01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:24.790
Like I remember one time I went,
I went on,
I went,
I went on this first date,

1280
01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:28.150
I was set up with gorgeous girl and showed up and then I was like,

1281
01:10:28.151 --> 01:10:29.020
don't let this weird you out.

1282
01:10:29.021 --> 01:10:33.220
And I pulled this electric scale out of my bag and started weighing all of the

1283
01:10:33.221 --> 01:10:37.510
pieces of food on the table.
And,
uh,
that was the beginning of the end.

1284
01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.280
Why didn't you do that?
Uh,

1285
01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:44.340
because I was trying to prove that the calories in calories out model as

1286
01:10:45.521 --> 01:10:48.370
cooptive by a nutritionist is totally inaccurate.

1287
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.690
They don't understand thermodynamics.
So what I was doing is eating a seven,

1288
01:10:52.691 --> 01:10:55.240
I think it was 6.8 times my resting metabolic rate.

1289
01:10:55.241 --> 01:10:58.060
Like what you're supposed to eat,
need to maintain weight on a daily basis.

1290
01:10:58.061 --> 01:11:03.061
I ate seven times that in about 12 hours and to show that I could prevent myself

1291
01:11:03.461 --> 01:11:06.010
from getting fat even if I eat that way.
Uh,

1292
01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.820
so to clock in later with lower body fat like two days later.

1293
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:13.320
And so I was weighing all my foods that I could do an accurate calorie count

1294
01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:15.510
later.
So if I had whatever amount of cheese,

1295
01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:16.680
I want to know how many grams that was.

1296
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:18.720
So later I can do the multiplication and do all the adding.

1297
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:22.120
<v 0>So you,
your contention is that it's based on a,</v>

1298
01:11:22.121 --> 01:11:25.190
a weight to energy to what like I don't know.

1299
01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.530
<v 5>Oh No,
no.
So it is,
what were they wrong about?</v>

1300
01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.480
What they're wrong about is they'll say,
all right,

1301
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.900
you have calories and eating and then you have calories out exercise.

1302
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:35.420
So that's your balance.
In reality,

1303
01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:39.260
there are many different ways you can get rid of calories besides extra stress,

1304
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:43.280
stress,
heat.
So if you put yourself in cold,
so,
uh,
Ray,
who was the,

1305
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:44.900
one of the NASA scientists and the book,

1306
01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:48.800
he tripled his fat loss by using color treatments where they're like a cold

1307
01:11:48.801 --> 01:11:52.680
showers or ice baths,
tripled his rate of fat loss.
I mean that's the,

1308
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:54.680
that's the equivalent of taking like methamphetamine

1309
01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:56.960
<v 0>jasmine and when and how do you do that?
What do you do?</v>

1310
01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:58.370
You just getting a cold shower every day.

1311
01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:00.870
<v 5>Blues.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How about how long have you got to be in that show?</v>

1312
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:02.210
I do like the few minutes.

1313
01:12:02.211 --> 01:12:05.840
I mean very short and I actually have it makes you lose fat.
I prefer,

1314
01:12:05.841 --> 01:12:08.630
it triggers a hormone that I think people are going to hear it a lot more about

1315
01:12:08.631 --> 01:12:11.910
in the next few years.
Probably the next one or two years.
Adiponectin,

1316
01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:15.170
most people have never heard of this improves,
uh,

1317
01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.820
among other insulin sensitivity.

1318
01:12:16.821 --> 01:12:21.320
But also the rate of fat loss and when you,
and cold triggers,

1319
01:12:21.321 --> 01:12:24.230
this also triggers a Luton Ising hormone,

1320
01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:27.650
which you of course seeing your blood panel when you do a testing looking at

1321
01:12:27.651 --> 01:12:31.610
testosterone,
which I think is the primary driver behind sex drive.

1322
01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.840
So if you're able to jack up your LH,
you,
you're like,

1323
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.900
you want to go hump a corner,
it's really pretty,
it's pretty awesome.

1324
01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:41.930
But the cold showers make you horny.
Uh,

1325
01:12:41.931 --> 01:12:44.990
you have to take it like an opposite of what they always told us.
Well,

1326
01:12:44.991 --> 01:12:49.910
it'll definitely make you look like less of a Ron Jeremy,
but if an ice bath,

1327
01:12:49.911 --> 01:12:54.530
but the,
the intermediate and a longer term effects.
Yeah.
Higher sex drive.

1328
01:12:54.531 --> 01:12:55.010
Absolutely.

1329
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.930
<v 0>That's incredible.
Because that's what they always say,
right?</v>

1330
01:12:56.931 --> 01:13:00.410
Take a cold shower and it cools you off your horn.
Yeah.
But in fact,

1331
01:13:00.411 --> 01:13:01.640
it just makes you harder.

1332
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.790
<v 5>It'll make you,
yeah.
You'll need some recovery time for taking ice baths.</v>

1333
01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:08.520
I like an ice bath up to like mid chest.
Okay.
So when you,
uh,
when you,

1334
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:10.460
you need 120 pounds of ice,

1335
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:13.850
how much recovery time do you need before you're ready to rock?
A 20 minutes,

1336
01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:14.700
20 minutes,
right.

1337
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:18.140
<v 0>Do you have to get in any warm water to rejuvenate or,</v>

1338
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.460
<v 5>I would take a hot shower afterwards.</v>

1339
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:22.470
I would actually take a hot shower beforehand.
Uh,

1340
01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.820
so there's something called contrast therapy that the east Germans used to use

1341
01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.580
where you take a,
for example,
hot,

1342
01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:33.050
a very hot shower so that the blood vessels dilate,
uh,
in an area,

1343
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:35.510
this is after sports.
So I started using this for sports stuff.

1344
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:37.320
I've all sorts of back in.

1345
01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.010
So I do hot on the back and then go right into the ice bath.
And then that way,

1346
01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:44.030
like hyper constricted and then you get out and you do the,

1347
01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:49.150
you do the hot shower to finish and that's supposed to help flush out debris and

1348
01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:53.060
a damaged tissue and so forth really works.
It's amazing.
It's like,

1349
01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:55.140
it's like an extra two days of recovery and

1350
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.720
<v 0>cold therapy.
And they used to do that back,
uh,
for injuries on a long time ago.</v>

1351
01:13:59.721 --> 01:14:03.440
In the,
in the 80s.
I tore my Sartorius muscle.
Yeah.

1352
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:05.960
There was a big one too because this is,
uh,
I was uh,

1353
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.240
this was the third year that I was defending the state championship.
Yeah.

1354
01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.560
And Taekwondo and I couldn't do any sparring.
I couldn't kick the bag.

1355
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:15.310
I used to have the only,

1356
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:18.430
the only thing I can do is throw kicks in a swimming pool and a,

1357
01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:21.190
I had a bunch of different therapies to,
to fix that.

1358
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:23.440
And one of the big ones was getting a hot,
hot,

1359
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:28.370
hot bath and then plunge right into a bath full of ice cubes.
Yeah.
It was crazy.

1360
01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:31.540
Sartorius.
Yeah.
Early.
Yeah.
It was bad.
It was a bad tear.

1361
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:35.440
It went right up to the hip.
Yeah.
You know,
you're doing taekwondo,

1362
01:14:35.441 --> 01:14:37.600
you're whipping your legs around his crazy,

1363
01:14:37.601 --> 01:14:41.500
unnatural motions with all this torque.
There's amazing amount of Torque,

1364
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:44.440
especially.
You get really good and really flexible.
And then you know,

1365
01:14:44.441 --> 01:14:49.030
I was really young too.
When your body,
when you're like 1718 years old,

1366
01:14:49.031 --> 01:14:52.660
it just has some elasticy to it at springs and whips,
you know,

1367
01:14:52.661 --> 01:14:56.440
so you generate so much force you can rip things apart.
Tore my ACL,

1368
01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.560
tore my sartorial rip rib cartilage.

1369
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:04.060
No I haven't turned my eyes for tore his hamstring as the worst leg.

1370
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.720
Muscular done connective tissue issues that I've had.
I did it once so bad.

1371
01:15:07.721 --> 01:15:12.490
My whole leg was black and blue.
I just hopped and then the rest of my leg,

1372
01:15:12.491 --> 01:15:16.870
like from my balls all the way down to like below my knee was total black and

1373
01:15:16.871 --> 01:15:17.950
blue like I got shot.

1374
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:21.190
<v 2>That's terrible.
They're saying this guy,
I know he lives actually around here,</v>

1375
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:22.510
Scott Mendelson,

1376
01:15:22.511 --> 01:15:26.290
he's broken nine records in the bench press world records like I can bench about

1377
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:31.030
1200 pounds of Macedonian and I've seen him do warm ups with five plates on

1378
01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:35.710
either side just like somebody would use an empty bar.
And he,

1379
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.560
he's a huge guy.
No big surprise there and it's like three.

1380
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.410
The last time I saw him,
he was three 20 and had a six back to give you an idea.

1381
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.880
Uh,
but when,
uh,

1382
01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.070
people don't realize when you start handling those types of weights,

1383
01:15:45.071 --> 01:15:47.710
you're using your legs in a major way,
even for the bench press.

1384
01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:50.200
And so I remember seeing him at one point and he was hobbling around.

1385
01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:54.220
He showed me his leg,
his entire,
he tore his entire quad,
which is like the size,

1386
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:57.220
it's like twice the size of my torso,
uh,
doing the bench press.

1387
01:15:57.370 --> 01:16:00.760
So his entire quad was ripped off of his,
yeah,

1388
01:16:00.761 --> 01:16:04.330
it was just completely black.
It looks like,
I'm sure what you're like look like.

1389
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:09.170
<v 0>Yeah.
Muscle tears are a mother fucker,
man.
It took a long time.
I do.
Yeah.</v>

1390
01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:12.010
I'm so careful as I get older about warming up and you know,

1391
01:16:12.011 --> 01:16:15.970
and getting really loose before I do any of that,
that has helped me so much,
man.

1392
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:19.840
Yeah.
If you're done any in any of the rolling like lacrosse balls or from a

1393
01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:24.200
footballer's,
those are great.
I find that there's a deep tissue.
God,

1394
01:16:24.201 --> 01:16:28.660
I go to the fucking hurts like hell man.
And it's a dude,

1395
01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:32.050
which is uncomfortable cause I always used to go and get deep tissue massages

1396
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:32.860
from checks.

1397
01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:36.640
But then I started getting real sports massages from someone who's a,

1398
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:40.000
who was a strength coach at Purdue and like he's legit.

1399
01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:44.710
He breaks your shit down dude.
It's fucking painful.
You know,

1400
01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:47.140
he has all these emotion things.
He does too.

1401
01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:51.040
He stretches you in all different range of motions while he's like just dig and

1402
01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:55.710
elbows into the muscle.
It's fucking,
you want to tap out left and right.
It's,

1403
01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.460
it gets pretty.
Sounds like art.

1404
01:16:57.461 --> 01:17:00.910
It has even ever mentioned that is fucking painful.
Yeah,

1405
01:17:00.911 --> 01:17:02.940
it's painful but it's fucking amazing.

1406
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:06.050
It allows you to go back to training like much quicker.
You know,

1407
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.800
there's all sorts of different things that we don't like to do that are

1408
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:12.860
uncomfortable like the ice bass and like this kind of shit.
But God,

1409
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:15.660
when you do do them,
it's so important.
He a big difference.
You

1410
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:20.950
<v 2>other thing I've found to help a lot with muscle muscular injuries is either</v>

1411
01:17:21.901 --> 01:17:25.560
Arnica or this is a,
and this is an actual,

1412
01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:29.820
is that topical ethics stuff aren't,
so the Arnica can be,
it can be homeopathic.

1413
01:17:29.821 --> 01:17:34.560
What I prefer the,
the,
I have a lot of issues with most of homeopathy,

1414
01:17:34.561 --> 01:17:39.561
but the trauma is a product that you can get at a whole foods and it's t r a u m

1415
01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.520
e l and it is astonishing effective.

1416
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:47.220
I don't know exactly the mechanism of action,

1417
01:17:47.221 --> 01:17:52.221
but it really works really like muscular Musculo a connective issues.

1418
01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:56.790
Oh it's fantastic.
Like helps healing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like the speed of healing.

1419
01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.820
So how do you spell this stuff sort of for people out there,

1420
01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:03.880
t r a u m e l and you can get both ingestible and topical if you have a serious,

1421
01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:09.990
if I have an acute injury,
I had one recently,
a few months ago in the hamstring,

1422
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:11.730
went immediately to whole foods,

1423
01:18:11.731 --> 01:18:15.470
got a bunch of bags of ice for an ice bath and bought a bunch of trauma and like

1424
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.760
high dose vitamin C and a few other things too.

1425
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.600
Immediately sort of tried to address the short term inflammation because I was

1426
01:18:21.601 --> 01:18:25.570
at a certification for crossfit endurance and had to do,

1427
01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.920
I had to do the second session the next day and I wanted to do the session the

1428
01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.800
next day.
How did you do it with a blown hamstring?
Uh,

1429
01:18:31.801 --> 01:18:36.420
it was like a partial strain,
I would say.
Uh,
was certainly wasn't any type of,

1430
01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.890
of of severe tear,

1431
01:18:37.891 --> 01:18:41.190
but it was enough that I was hobbling around after a few hours and you know,

1432
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.990
if you feel it that day,
you know what I mean?

1433
01:18:42.991 --> 01:18:45.780
Like you're really gonna feel it the next day.
Uh,

1434
01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:49.870
but it worked with the ice trommel contrast therapy and uh,
I was,

1435
01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:51.720
was able to go to the next day.
I wasn't 100%,

1436
01:18:51.721 --> 01:18:53.650
but I was able to actually do a running sir.

1437
01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:56.820
<v 0>Well you must not have been that big of an injury cause I've got to assume that</v>

1438
01:18:56.821 --> 01:18:59.280
that's,
that would fuck you up for quite a while if it really was.

1439
01:18:59.281 --> 01:19:02.520
I mean there's nothing that was going to make you heal overnight,
right?
No,
no,
no,

1440
01:19:02.521 --> 01:19:04.470
not,
not overnight.
I think that stuff you believe

1441
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:08.050
<v 2>what you can do it,
it does help longterm.
In this particular case,</v>

1442
01:19:08.051 --> 01:19:12.280
my concern was just addressing the inflammation and stiffness so I could train

1443
01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:13.920
the next day.
The following week.
Yeah.

1444
01:19:13.921 --> 01:19:16.660
I was a mess because I took an injury and then built on top of it.
Oh,

1445
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:19.960
so it became worse.
Yeah,
but in this,
in that case,

1446
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:22.600
I was willing to do it because I just wanted to finish the cert and I was in

1447
01:19:22.601 --> 01:19:23.580
Colorado,
so

1448
01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.730
<v 0>it's amazing how much we know about fixing the body though,
man.
I mean,</v>

1449
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.540
I have both of my knees had been reconstructed ACL reconstruction.
It's,

1450
01:19:31.541 --> 01:19:34.750
it's amazing that,
you know,
if we live just one lifetime earlier,

1451
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:38.470
I'd be a criminal or it shouldn't,
you know,
people don't like that.

1452
01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:39.580
They think that's an offensive term.

1453
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:42.650
I would have be a person who is both knees are fucked up.
How about that?

1454
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.080
Now there would be no,
meanwhile they work a hundred percent they work great.

1455
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:49.750
Yeah,
no problems.
Kick boxing,
Jiu Jitsu,
everything works great.
And just fix it.

1456
01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:52.150
Put it back together again.
Yeah,
it is wild.
It's incredible.

1457
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:54.190
It's amazing when you think about it.
I think,

1458
01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:58.510
<v 2>oh no,
I was just going to say that.
Uh,
for people who we really want to take the,</v>

1459
01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:00.140
the regenerative stuff seriously,

1460
01:20:00.141 --> 01:20:04.700
what I would encourage people to start researching is looking at banking stem

1461
01:20:04.701 --> 01:20:05.534
cells.

1462
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:10.540
So getting stem cells at a younger age to bank so that you can use them later if

1463
01:20:10.711 --> 01:20:13.920
you want to get like a,
a,
what does the term I'm looking for?

1464
01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:17.370
It's not mesenchymal.
Uh,
Polly,

1465
01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.580
Paula plurry potential stem cell.

1466
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:24.210
So you bank the stem cells that are like your younger stem cells and then later

1467
01:20:24.211 --> 01:20:26.460
on if you need a liver or you needed this,

1468
01:20:26.461 --> 01:20:29.040
you needed that to ensure that you don't get rejection.

1469
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:32.370
You can actually take that stem cells differentiated into what you need and then

1470
01:20:32.371 --> 01:20:33.950
grow it.
Have you done that?
Uh,

1471
01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:37.710
I am in the process of trying to do as it expensive.
Is it?

1472
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:40.620
I don't think it needs to be expensive because there are some doctors who are

1473
01:20:40.621 --> 01:20:42.090
trying to get different,

1474
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:45.420
I believe so cells that you can differentiate from skin as opposed to having to

1475
01:20:45.421 --> 01:20:48.090
take it out of,
let's say bone marrow.
I was willing to do bone marrow,

1476
01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:51.930
so I was going to,
I was actually going to do bone marrow harvesting.
Oh my God.

1477
01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:55.680
Drilling through the hip.
That must be painful.
It's not fun.
That's not fun.

1478
01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:58.230
How long are you out for when you do something like that?
I don't know.

1479
01:20:58.260 --> 01:20:59.320
I haven't done it.
Uh,

1480
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.580
but I was going to do that and then one of my buddies who actually designed a

1481
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:03.570
device for that,
I was like,
well,

1482
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.710
maybe want to consider looking at skin or blood or something like that.

1483
01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:12.450
And I was like,
all right.
Yeah,
I'm happy to store whatever I can,
but wow.

1484
01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:15.750
Yeah,
good idea actually.
Yeah,
it's wild stuff,
man.

1485
01:21:15.751 --> 01:21:20.160
I do think that the life extension folks who take,
you know,
200,
300 pills a day,

1486
01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.790
I think they're making a sort of,

1487
01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:28.500
I think they're setting themselves up for a fast in bargain because your liver

1488
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:31.410
talking about the liver does not handle 200 pills a day.
Very well.

1489
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.020
I mean it's uh,

1490
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.960
<v 4>that's part of their vitamins you think are bad for breaking down for your
liver?</v>

1491
01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:39.850
<v 2>Uh,
it depends on the vitamins.
Yeah,
I would say,</v>

1492
01:21:39.851 --> 01:21:42.520
I mean I tried to get everything I can through whole foods,

1493
01:21:42.521 --> 01:21:46.630
which is a very new thing for me because few years ago I was like,
blood test,

1494
01:21:46.631 --> 01:21:50.350
identify problem,
sniper shot with a pill fixed or injection fixed.

1495
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.880
And what I've realized when you start looking at,
uh,
uh,

1496
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.930
that the history of,
of uh,
let's say Beta carotene,

1497
01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.640
so it was found to be good for world.

1498
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.100
He was thought to be very good for eyesight among other things.

1499
01:22:03.101 --> 01:22:05.080
So people start taking isolated Beta carotene,

1500
01:22:05.081 --> 01:22:06.610
which then caused a lot of problems.

1501
01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:09.990
So I'm trying to get whatever I might be deficient in.

1502
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:11.960
Let's say I found out that I was deficient in selenium.

1503
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.600
You did a test called spectracell.

1504
01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.520
You can go just about anywhere in a hundred bucks you're done,

1505
01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:20.980
and I found out as deficient salinium fixed that doubled my sperm count and

1506
01:22:20.981 --> 01:22:24.070
tripled my testosterone by addressing a selenium deficient

1507
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:25.240
<v 4>double your sperm count.</v>

1508
01:22:25.241 --> 01:22:29.040
You shouldn't loads in the cups on a regular basis until as your loads.
Yeah,

1509
01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:33.280
I was really in that too.
Yeah.
Also,
probably not good first day conversation,

1510
01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:34.510
just from experience.

1511
01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:37.600
Did you bring that up the same date when you're measuring the a different is a

1512
01:22:37.601 --> 01:22:39.940
different date in their life.
They were like,
so what are you up to?

1513
01:22:39.941 --> 01:22:42.250
And I was like,
man,
I'm doing some experiments.
Like what kind of experiments?

1514
01:22:42.251 --> 01:22:44.630
I was like,
well,
let me tell you.
And then yeah,

1515
01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:48.010
I find that you can't even bring up your loads of girls.

1516
01:22:48.011 --> 01:22:49.650
Ashley been around them once.

1517
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:51.760
Once you've had sex and they had been around your loads,

1518
01:22:51.761 --> 01:22:53.050
then you're allowed to bring up your loads,

1519
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:56.050
but until that moment loads are off the table,

1520
01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.180
it's you don't get promoted.

1521
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.970
It's like if you're talking to a girl on a first date and she starts talking

1522
01:23:00.971 --> 01:23:04.870
about her yeast infection issues.
Yeah.
What buzz?

1523
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.160
What is this

1524
01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:10.120
<v 3>nonsense?
Fairy tale.
Kill the bitch.</v>

1525
01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:16.660
Oh Man.
Find out what that problem was by the way.
It's squirting.
Oh,

1526
01:23:16.661 --> 01:23:21.550
with your girl and why don't you explain to the whole world g spot stimulation.

1527
01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.710
Yeah.
Okay.
She's peeing on you bro.

1528
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.480
[inaudible] you got an issue with his girl p and all over the place just
started.

1529
01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:30.460
It is g spot.
Orgasm is,
I think is what you just rock.

1530
01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:32.890
You're just killing it down hard.
That's what it is.

1531
01:23:32.891 --> 01:23:36.040
The doctor said that because the doctor's not there when the piss comes out,

1532
01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.200
the dog doesn't know what the fuck is talking about.

1533
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.100
Doctor needs to shut his mouth.
He's just trying to make you feel better.
God,

1534
01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:44.560
I had one buddy,
there's a close friend of mine and he,

1535
01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:48.280
he called me at like four in the morning at one point,
uh,

1536
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:51.280
traumatized because this girl,
he was really into head.

1537
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.320
It's actually the first time and she was,

1538
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:58.470
she was riding in Calgary and then she's,
she's about to come jumps up like,

1539
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.210
like post on his chest and jumps up to her feet and then like score,

1540
01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:07.010
it's all over his chest and he was,
so he was really into her.

1541
01:24:07.011 --> 01:24:10.240
This is the first time they had sex and he was just so traumatized by this like

1542
01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:13.930
power role reversal.
He was,
uh,

1543
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:16.870
he was really like beyond constellation,

1544
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.140
but he called me a four in the morning and start sending me text and they were

1545
01:24:20.141 --> 01:24:24.700
just incomprehensible.
So do it on his chest on purpose.
Like,

1546
01:24:24.701 --> 01:24:26.950
like a god coming on a girl's Ted's,
I mean,

1547
01:24:26.951 --> 01:24:30.430
I can't imagine why else you would like prop yourself up to the sumo squat and

1548
01:24:30.431 --> 01:24:33.460
do that.
It's awesome.
Yeah,
it seems like a very aggressive,

1549
01:24:33.461 --> 01:24:38.350
so that's a very aggressive like alpha dog move.
Exactly.
It's like an animal.

1550
01:24:38.351 --> 01:24:42.790
I think that if some girl did that first time she had sex,
that's insane.

1551
01:24:44.730 --> 01:24:45.421
<v 0>But meanwhile,</v>

1552
01:24:45.421 --> 01:24:50.421
dudes do that all the time when we come on your kids or somehow that's

1553
01:24:50.491 --> 01:24:53.930
acceptable.
Why is that acceptable?
It seems like it is though.

1554
01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:56.520
It seems like it is acceptable for guy to come on a girl's Ted's,

1555
01:24:56.521 --> 01:24:59.640
but it's not acceptable for a girl to fucking piss all over your chest.

1556
01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.280
<v 3>I wouldn't know what that girl looks like.
Just sounds so advertising.</v>

1557
01:25:05.281 --> 01:25:07.530
I don't know why we have so much resistance.

1558
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.100
<v 0>Yeah,
I don't know what it,
but you know,
loads wire girls.
Why they allow that?</v>

1559
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.410
Why don't some of them actually like it?
That's ridiculous.

1560
01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.550
It's the most ridiculous shit ever.
Like loads all over you protein.

1561
01:25:18.551 --> 01:25:21.880
It has nothing to do with protein.
It's just dirtiness.
That's what it is.

1562
01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:25.870
Being bludgeoned by porn.
It's just sheer.
It's good for your skin.

1563
01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:29.560
That's got to have a boat.
Shar,
do you,
do you look at porn?

1564
01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:33.260
Does that have a bizarre,
I mean I,
I have,
uh,
I,

1565
01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.780
I'm not nearly as organized as you are,
as analytical as you are,
I don't think.

1566
01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:40.000
But I have this thing about porn and the,

1567
01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:45.001
the big thing that I have is that I know that this only happens when someone

1568
01:25:45.671 --> 01:25:50.350
abuses someone.
It just,
it might happen with guys,
but with girls,

1569
01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.520
it only,
they only do that.
They only let guys fuck,

1570
01:25:53.521 --> 01:25:56.860
I'm on camera because something happened at an early age.

1571
01:25:56.861 --> 01:26:00.850
It's almost like unanimous.
It's almost like 100% of them have been molested.

1572
01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.680
Some,
it bothers me,
you know,

1573
01:26:02.681 --> 01:26:05.090
and even though they're having a great time and even though they're hot and

1574
01:26:05.091 --> 01:26:08.180
maybe they love Sax and maybe it is fun for them,
maybe they do enjoy it.

1575
01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:12.590
I can't not do the math,
you know,
I can't,
you know.

1576
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:16.580
So when you being this analytical guy,
how do you look at stuff like that?

1577
01:26:16.581 --> 01:26:19.130
How do you look at like Internet porn and things along those names?

1578
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:24.320
<v 5>Yeah,
it's,
you know,
I,
it's,
it's a tricky,
it is tricky.
Like to look at it,</v>

1579
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:29.910
I have no,
uh,
yeah,
I don't have like a strong moral stance against Portma.

1580
01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.800
It's hard not to think of the backstory,

1581
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:36.770
particularly if you actually see any type of documentary or any type of coverage

1582
01:26:36.771 --> 01:26:39.500
or this,
you know,
adult film or pornography.

1583
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:44.320
You do see the patterns really clearly.
Uh,
but she,
this,
I mean,
just as a,

1584
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:47.980
you know,
a healthy male.
It's,
it's tough.
I just,

1585
01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.720
I know you're right.
You're right.
It's still with his father.
I talked,

1586
01:26:53.721 --> 01:26:55.400
I remember talking to think about it.

1587
01:26:55.430 --> 01:27:00.430
I talked to one of these tech guys who worked with anchor free I think was if

1588
01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:02.990
they have a program called the hotspot shield,

1589
01:27:02.991 --> 01:27:06.170
which is great if you're traveling,
for example,
if you go to China it won't work.

1590
01:27:06.171 --> 01:27:09.680
But if you go to some countries where they blocked Pandora or youtube,

1591
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:13.840
you can use hotspot shield and it,
it,
uh,
it allows you to,

1592
01:27:13.841 --> 01:27:17.300
to get around that really like if you're in like Dubai and it gives you a
tunnel.

1593
01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:19.280
Exactly.
So it's fuck as he bring up Dubai,

1594
01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:22.610
I asked him who most of his users were and he said people in the Middle East

1595
01:27:22.611 --> 01:27:26.210
watching porn,
it was like,
this is called again,
what's it called?

1596
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.510
It's called a hotspot shield.
And how do you get,
is it a software?

1597
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:33.000
It's free software program.
You can download it.
It works.
Yeah,
it works.
So it's,

1598
01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:36.740
it's Kinda like tour in the sense that if you're trying to route,
you know,

1599
01:27:36.741 --> 01:27:40.600
like in Iran or other places where people are trying to route out or route,

1600
01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.940
<v 0>can they lock you in jail forever if they catch you with this?</v>

1601
01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:46.110
<v 5>Probably.
Oh,
I don't think so.
I mean,
as,
as a visitor for example,</v>

1602
01:27:46.111 --> 01:27:48.690
when I was in Turkey and I wanted to watch stuff on,

1603
01:27:48.691 --> 01:27:50.820
I think it was youtube or was Pandora one of the two.

1604
01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:55.020
And I got really irritated that I couldn't access one of the other and I just

1605
01:27:55.021 --> 01:27:58.410
use hotspot shield and it was problems with this work with people who if they

1606
01:27:58.411 --> 01:27:59.200
work

1607
01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.460
<v 0>in an office and the office block certain things,</v>

1608
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:02.870
could they put this on their computer?

1609
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:07.370
<v 5>Uh,
if,
if the,
if the it is set up so that they can install and download,
yeah,</v>

1610
01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:11.120
they should be able to,
oh shit,
bitches.
I just found a solution to your problems.

1611
01:28:11.121 --> 01:28:16.070
Your boss was sleeping.
Feel free to walk off in new cubicle.

1612
01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:16.760
Now,

1613
01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.410
MSNBC Guy Hacked yesterday by the hackers and they did a fake terrorist,

1614
01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:24.590
uh,
thing on Twitter.
This,

1615
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:28.850
somebody hacked MSNBC and was just like,
oh my God,
you know,

1616
01:28:28.851 --> 01:28:32.270
there's a terrorist shit going on at Ground Zero in New York City and like did

1617
01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:35.950
all this shit and it's fucked up.
Yeah.
And then,
uh,
somebody uh,

1618
01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:39.920
announced yesterday that Steve Jobs died that's connected to some kind of news

1619
01:28:39.921 --> 01:28:44.090
publication,
but then they deleted it immediately and they said,
sorry,

1620
01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:47.300
we got our facts wrong or something.
But thinking that,

1621
01:28:47.301 --> 01:28:49.540
so someone's hacking newspapers now.
Yeah.

1622
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:53.320
Either that or someone at that particular newspaper is shorting apple.
Yeah.

1623
01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:57.020
Right.
Just trying to set up,
just trying to tee it up for a nice double,
oh,

1624
01:28:57.021 --> 01:28:59.510
sorry guys,
we've got our facts wrong,
but thanks for selling all your apple,

1625
01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.750
android,
z.
Would

1626
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:01.740
<v 0>that to be right?</v>

1627
01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:04.620
<v 2>That would be pretty easy to do at this point in time.</v>

1628
01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:08.520
People just waiting for the,
the story of jobs being dead.

1629
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:11.940
Did you see the photo of him where he's kind of wearing this black dress looking

1630
01:29:11.941 --> 01:29:14.400
thing?
It looks like he weighs like 90 pounds.
Yeah.

1631
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:17.160
Everyone at the apple store is like,
ah,
that's,
that's Photoshop.
That's not,

1632
01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.710
that's not real.
Like they're defending his boss,
like King Bee.

1633
01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.890
<v 0>What is it guy like that there's a,</v>

1634
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:25.220
there's clear evidence that no matter how much money you have,

1635
01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.850
either is only a certain amount and you can do for your health.
Yeah.
You know,

1636
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:32.030
there's only a certain amount do you attribute when you see a guy that's got

1637
01:29:32.031 --> 01:29:33.850
like,
that's sick like that and um,

1638
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:37.790
I've talked before about a girlfriend that I had to go to a great boss.

1639
01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:41.390
He was a really nice guy who had massive cancer at 50.
It was dead like that.

1640
01:29:41.391 --> 01:29:44.060
Yeah.
And it was a guy who worked,

1641
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:48.800
he worked for a studio and he had an incredibly stressful job to his constant

1642
01:29:48.801 --> 01:29:51.680
every day,
six,
seven days a week,
all day long.

1643
01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:55.580
He made a good living because of it.
But the guy just lived in a hurricane,

1644
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.960
you know.
Do you think that that has a direct result on,
on physical health?

1645
01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:04.290
<v 2>I think it has to,
uh,
because elevated cortisol,</v>

1646
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.670
you have interrupted sleep.
Uh,

1647
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:11.580
I think it has to have a direct impact on,
on just about everything.
Uh,

1648
01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:16.710
this part of the problem with looking at studies that try to look at or disprove

1649
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:22.710
the correlation between stress and cancers that a lot of these people define

1650
01:30:22.711 --> 01:30:24.660
stress differently.
Um,

1651
01:30:24.690 --> 01:30:28.080
but I would think that in addition to those types of stresses,

1652
01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:32.460
which are definitely biochemical events,
uh,
carbohydrate intake,

1653
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:35.880
so there's a great book called good calories,
bad calories,
and there's,
uh,

1654
01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:38.250
there's one section on disease states and carbohydrates.

1655
01:30:38.251 --> 01:30:41.550
And I think that if you remove gluten,
grains,
et Cetera,

1656
01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:46.540
it's very hard for certain types of cancers to grow a really.
Yeah.
And one,

1657
01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:51.510
I remember at one point,
one of my close friends,
young woman,
uh,
was,

1658
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.600
had been diagnosed with,

1659
01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:57.620
I think it was cervical cancer and spoke with his doctor percent at a Ted,

1660
01:30:58.190 --> 01:30:59.760
uh,
William Li,
l I,

1661
01:30:59.770 --> 01:31:04.770
and he actually has a white and green tea blend that selectively inhibits blood

1662
01:31:05.701 --> 01:31:09.940
cell growth in cancer tissue.
How cool is that?
So,
yeah,

1663
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.880
obviously if the cancer can't get nutrients,
can't get blood than it,
it dies.

1664
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:17.190
And so I've been,
uh,

1665
01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:20.910
I consume that ti as a preventative measure and also obviously cut out the

1666
01:31:20.911 --> 01:31:23.760
refined carbohydrates six days a week.
And then I go ballistic

1667
01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.140
<v 0>there.
We gave a cheat day,
nice ice cream,
whatever the fuck you,</v>

1668
01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.540
whatever on whatever I want.
That's a smart move.
You know,

1669
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:33.380
my friend Eddie was doing that.
Eddie Bravo was all Atkins diet.

1670
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:37.490
He would be Atkins all week.
And then on the weekends he would start off,

1671
01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.850
it started off with just Sunday,
but then it became Saturday,
Sunday,

1672
01:31:40.851 --> 01:31:45.770
and then it was Friday after midnight and now he weighs 400 pounds.
He's fit,

1673
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.730
he takes care of himself.

1674
01:31:46.731 --> 01:31:50.390
But it was hilarious being around them on Sunday because Sunday go off like a

1675
01:31:50.391 --> 01:31:53.380
rocket.
Is that what you do?
Do you eat like donuts and shit or,
well,

1676
01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.850
<v 2>what I find is that I encourage people,</v>

1677
01:31:55.851 --> 01:32:00.220
particularly when they're getting started to just go crazy and after two,
three

1678
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.940
<v 5>or four weeks and making themselves sick,
second,
they start cutting back.</v>

1679
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:06.880
They start chilling out.
Uh,
and they'll still have fun.

1680
01:32:06.881 --> 01:32:09.820
Like when I have my cheat days,
I mean I'm having chocolate croissants,

1681
01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:13.060
I'm also having some good food during the day,
but then I'll have,
you know,

1682
01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:15.970
wild nettle pizza with an egg on top of whatever.
It's great stuff,

1683
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:19.870
but I don't strive to make myself sick anymore.
It's not a point.

1684
01:32:19.871 --> 01:32:24.010
It's not like I want to reach that threshold where I used to just,
it was like,

1685
01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:27.760
oh,
I wonder how many boxes of donuts I can eat.
It's fucking cheat day and uh,

1686
01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.920
you get,
you get past that point pretty quickly.

1687
01:32:29.921 --> 01:32:33.460
But for people who are very phobic of diets of any type,

1688
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:38.830
it's really helpful in the beginning stages to allow them that psychological

1689
01:32:38.831 --> 01:32:40.090
release valve.
What it also does,

1690
01:32:40.091 --> 01:32:43.690
we were talking about thyroid is when you selectively overfeed like that,

1691
01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:48.860
you can actually improve conversion of t four to t three active thyroid so that

1692
01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:51.970
you actually find that people lose more weight over time when they have that

1693
01:32:51.971 --> 01:32:55.600
overfeeding once a week.
It was pretty cool.
Really.
Yeah.
Also affects Leptin,

1694
01:32:55.601 --> 01:32:58.990
like recalibration.
Well,
you lose more weight by being a pig.
Yeah.

1695
01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:02.340
By being in one day a week just being a savage.
Yeah.
Why would that be that your,

1696
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:06.130
your body just realizes that it has to kind of deal with that every now and

1697
01:33:06.131 --> 01:33:08.090
again and so it just ramps everything up.
Yeah.

1698
01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:13.100
What it doesn't do it I think partially is it doesn't downshift because it

1699
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:19.470
believes that it's in a starvation mode or that some type of food category is

1700
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:23.920
in,
in famine essentially.
So I think that when you,

1701
01:33:23.921 --> 01:33:26.260
when you overfeed the mechanism isn't entirely clear,

1702
01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.100
but there have been a lot of studies looking at this where if you,
you,

1703
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:33.400
you calorie load that one day it has an effect on everything from Leptin to

1704
01:33:33.401 --> 01:33:36.580
thyroid to just about everything else.
It's cool.
Antibiotic positive.
Oh yeah.

1705
01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.740
Very positive effects on that.
So it's good to be a pig one day a week,

1706
01:33:39.741 --> 01:33:41.010
one day a week now it's amazing.
Yeah.

1707
01:33:41.011 --> 01:33:45.080
If you're an athlete you would end up doing it with other types of foods.

1708
01:33:45.081 --> 01:33:47.950
So you'd use like a keen while or yams,
root vegetables,

1709
01:33:47.951 --> 01:33:50.620
things like that to jack up your calories if you don't want to do the donuts.

1710
01:33:50.621 --> 01:33:52.210
And all that shit.
Cause if you don't want to cheat,

1711
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:54.040
yeah cause if you want to carve up properly,

1712
01:33:54.041 --> 01:33:57.750
like having a lot of fructose and table sugar is half fructose,
right?

1713
01:33:57.790 --> 01:34:01.330
The sugar that's in and fruits,
it fucks up your car bloat terribly.

1714
01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:04.420
So if you're actually training like your GSP and you want to fuck with Carbo

1715
01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:05.920
load,
whatever,

1716
01:34:05.921 --> 01:34:09.460
after when then you don't want to be getting like table sugar is a terrible

1717
01:34:09.461 --> 01:34:13.120
choice.
Right?
So you'd want to avoid that.
But I like the chocolate croissants.

1718
01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:17.360
So that's table sugar though,
right?
Oh yeah.
Lots of convection or sugars,
sucrose,

1719
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:20.160
fruit sugar won't have the same issues like fruit,
sugar,

1720
01:34:20.161 --> 01:34:22.550
Google will mess up your,
your,
your carb up.

1721
01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:26.170
So you want to avoid that tip you want to avoid for other,
so when you carve up,

1722
01:34:26.171 --> 01:34:29.200
it's all just breads and pastas and you'd be focusing on a lot of that.

1723
01:34:29.201 --> 01:34:31.150
Or if you wanted to get really fancy with it,

1724
01:34:31.151 --> 01:34:34.660
you'd use something like waxy maize starch or some type of actual supplement.

1725
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:38.890
There are guys who do that.
There's a really good product called waxy maize.

1726
01:34:38.891 --> 01:34:43.690
Say that waxy maize starch,
there's a product issue.
Eat it.
Yeah.

1727
01:34:43.691 --> 01:34:46.360
You could convert it into a powder and you eat it just like you would a protein

1728
01:34:46.361 --> 01:34:51.280
powder.
Um,
yeah.
You drink it in.
Exactly.
And what is the benefit of this starch?

1729
01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:56.050
It has a,
uh,
you avoid some of the side effects of let's say,

1730
01:34:56.051 --> 01:35:00.350
consuming something that's too rapidly digested like glucose where you're just

1731
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:04.190
basically injecting yourself with Gatorade.
Yeah,

1732
01:35:04.191 --> 01:35:06.140
Gatorade would have,
I'd have to look at it.

1733
01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:07.490
It's going to have probably some glucose,

1734
01:35:07.491 --> 01:35:10.610
but also it probably has sucrose gross in it.
Um,

1735
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
but what I used to do when I was getting really crazy about the CKD,

1736
01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.440
the cyclical ketogenic diet is that I wouldn't say that again,

1737
01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:20.870
see the cyclical ketogenic diet.
When I was doing that,

1738
01:35:20.871 --> 01:35:23.690
when I started my carb up day,
I would start with glucose tablets,

1739
01:35:23.691 --> 01:35:25.350
which are disgusting.
Oh,
I would,

1740
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:29.360
I would start with the fastest and then move out to the slowest that more slowly

1741
01:35:29.361 --> 01:35:32.990
digested.
So I didn't use waxy maize,
but I would start with Lucas Tablas.

1742
01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.460
Then I would move to some type of more rapidly digest.
Let's say white rice,

1743
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.600
and then I would go into other grains and slowly move out to the,

1744
01:35:41.601 --> 01:35:46.601
the longer digested carbohydrates and then also start infusing a protein because

1745
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:50.270
the carb up can be helped with protein depending on the ratio.

1746
01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.070
<v 0>This is MMA.</v>

1747
01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:55.980
MMA teams need a dude like you on hand to tell him how to fuck a carb up and had

1748
01:35:55.981 --> 01:35:58.040
to eat before a fight.
Yeah,
I can help them with that.

1749
01:35:58.130 --> 01:35:59.840
Why don't you write a book on that Shit,
man.

1750
01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:01.890
<v 5>I,
uh,
you know,
it's,
uh,</v>

1751
01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.940
I've been quite frankly because it's just not much of a market for it,

1752
01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.010
but I have,

1753
01:36:08.011 --> 01:36:13.011
I've done some fun stuff with some NFL Lineman as well as I've worked with a

1754
01:36:14.221 --> 01:36:17.760
couple of fighters,
uh,
just on the cutting weight stuff.

1755
01:36:17.761 --> 01:36:22.150
Not so much the carbing up,
but like cutting for weight classes.
So dangerous.

1756
01:36:22.151 --> 01:36:22.650
Yeah,
it's real.

1757
01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:27.070
I used to cut 20 plus pounds twice a week in high school for rest.

1758
01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:30.390
Oh my God.
It's really dangerous and stunt your growth.

1759
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:33.570
I don't think it's stunts my growth.
I think it fucked up my,
uh,

1760
01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:38.370
I think it's screwed up my,
some of Mike,
my feedback loops in the body.

1761
01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.730
Absolutely.
Uh,
because I mean I had a resting pulse when I wanted,

1762
01:36:41.731 --> 01:36:44.450
when I had to go to sleep and I would assume that I would lose it,

1763
01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.880
say half a pound to Penn and a half just over,
over the evening,

1764
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:52.470
over the sleep on my resting pulse was like one 20 plus.
I mean it's like one 40,

1765
01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:55.350
it was just laying in bed trying to go to sleep and my blood is like ketchup,

1766
01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:58.650
so it's just like [inaudible] is horrible,
horrible.
It's so bad for you.

1767
01:36:58.890 --> 01:36:59.820
And that year,

1768
01:36:59.850 --> 01:37:03.990
I remember that year there were a couple of wrestlers who had a organ failures

1769
01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.380
because of dehydration and at that point they then changed the rules.

1770
01:37:07.381 --> 01:37:09.160
I don't know what they are now.
Where you,

1771
01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:10.980
you weighed in as you went onto the mat.

1772
01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.200
So you actually weighed in right before your wrestled,

1773
01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:16.710
so you disincentivized from cutting too much water because you'll obviously,

1774
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:20.520
<v 0>yeah,
they do that at the Monday owls,
the Jujitsu championships,</v>

1775
01:37:20.521 --> 01:37:21.960
and a lot of people believe in that.

1776
01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:26.010
They think that the way MMA fighters do it is ridiculous and dangerous that they

1777
01:37:26.011 --> 01:37:29.880
weigh in,
you know,
the day before,
20 hours,
24 hours,

1778
01:37:29.881 --> 01:37:34.881
and they gained oftentimes 10 1520 pounds depending on the guy,

1779
01:37:35.311 --> 01:37:37.950
you know,
six,
seven,
eight bags of IV drips,

1780
01:37:37.951 --> 01:37:42.951
constantly drinking pedialyte and electrolyte replenishers and it's intense.

1781
01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:45.720
Fucking scary.

1782
01:37:45.721 --> 01:37:48.360
The load that puts on the body though and the thing that you're going to throw

1783
01:37:48.361 --> 01:37:51.740
that same body in the combat 24 hours later,
you know,

1784
01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:56.040
<v 5>power lifters are the same way.
Oh yeah.
They cut</v>

1785
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.560
<v 4>crazy amounts of weight.
They're strong for their weight class.</v>

1786
01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.730
Did they cut weight and then did they have time after they weigh in before they

1787
01:38:02.731 --> 01:38:05.250
regenerate?
It's generating,
it's like the,

1788
01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:08.730
it's like the same type of time and yeah,
it's not much.

1789
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:12.930
I mean you have 24 36 hours maybe.
Oh,
you do have 24 hours.
You might have 24.

1790
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.230
That's crazy.
They should weigh a man right before they live.
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1791
01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:18.270
Because these guys,
I mean they're doing the same thing.

1792
01:38:18.271 --> 01:38:21.170
They're doing like Celine bag drips with electrolytes and so forth.

1793
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:24.120
You see a lot of people do it the wrong way and they end up losing because

1794
01:38:24.121 --> 01:38:27.930
they'll try to rehydrate and they won't take into account the electrolytes or

1795
01:38:27.931 --> 01:38:29.730
they won't take into account that you're,

1796
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:34.790
you're like gastrointestinal track is not designed to handle six gallons a PDL.

1797
01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:38.520
Yeah,
no shit.
And so they just get this horrific diarrhea,

1798
01:38:38.521 --> 01:38:41.640
which of course compounds the problem and then they get ruined when they,

1799
01:38:41.641 --> 01:38:46.530
when they got to fight.
Uh,
so yeah,
if you're going to lose weight like that,

1800
01:38:46.531 --> 01:38:49.050
you have to use,
if you're going to use any diuretics,

1801
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:50.460
potassium sparing diuretics,

1802
01:38:50.461 --> 01:38:54.360
you also see guys cramp up really badly because they don't have enough
potassium.

1803
01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:58.010
Anyway,
I could go on and on about this,
but yeah,
it's a,

1804
01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.580
the cutting weight's really bad for you,

1805
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:02.280
which were one of the most dangerous things,
at least in wrestling.

1806
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:03.210
There's not head trauma.

1807
01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.740
And one of the things they've shown in boxers that the deaths in ring deaths,

1808
01:39:07.890 --> 01:39:11.900
almost all of them have been men cutting weight.
Yeah.

1809
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:13.890
The lower weight classes is where it's an issue.

1810
01:39:13.891 --> 01:39:15.720
And the heavyweight classes of course,
you know,

1811
01:39:15.721 --> 01:39:17.840
there's still instances of brain damage and you know,

1812
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.740
pugilistic good dementia or whatever they call it.
You know,

1813
01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.210
when you see guys like Joe Lewis and,
or Joe Frazier rather who could,
you know,

1814
01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:27.140
his,
his speech is clearly affected,
uh,

1815
01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:30.210
of being punched in the head that's still exists,
but no deaths.

1816
01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:34.230
The deaths like the Duck Kook hymns and you know,
the,
all the uh,

1817
01:39:34.231 --> 01:39:38.130
in ring desk to the really bad injuries like Gerald McClellan,

1818
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:39.750
Gerald McClellan was a famous wait cutter.

1819
01:39:39.751 --> 01:39:42.420
He cut a lot of weight and in this fight with Nigel Benn,

1820
01:39:42.421 --> 01:39:47.100
he had a cerebral hemorrhage and wound up being severely disabled.

1821
01:39:47.101 --> 01:39:51.720
He's blind now and mostly deaf and barely remembers his past.

1822
01:39:51.721 --> 01:39:54.960
And it's weight cutting mat.
Horrible.
Yeah,
it's weight cutting.

1823
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:58.400
I think another reason,
at least this is,
and trauma of course,

1824
01:39:58.401 --> 01:40:00.490
it's something I've thought about is that the lighter weights too,

1825
01:40:00.491 --> 01:40:04.160
you see these guys mean they'll take 12 rounds of headshots.
Yup.

1826
01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.120
And there has to,
I mean,

1827
01:40:06.121 --> 01:40:10.380
I'm just thinking that there has to be a cumulative effect of the cerebral edema

1828
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.620
and the swelling that perhaps you just don't get if you're a heavyweight and you

1829
01:40:13.621 --> 01:40:16.740
get hit once and you just fill out like a light.
I don't know.

1830
01:40:16.770 --> 01:40:18.150
It's any head trauma.
Rihanna,

1831
01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:21.900
they're finding soccer players have serious issues and they're telling kids not

1832
01:40:21.901 --> 01:40:23.070
to head the ball anymore.

1833
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:27.600
They're finding a lot of soccer players actually you become sick with Lou

1834
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:30.950
Gehrig's disease.
You have,
uh,
issues with,
they're all sorts of,

1835
01:40:30.951 --> 01:40:34.650
I mean they basically have the same issues that boxers have cause a good head.

1836
01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:34.921
You know,

1837
01:40:34.921 --> 01:40:37.920
when you hit a ball that's coming at you really hard and you catch with your

1838
01:40:37.921 --> 01:40:42.280
head,
that's like getting slapped with a jab.
It's not a lot.
I mean they,

1839
01:40:42.281 --> 01:40:44.130
they're fine.
They're not pussies.

1840
01:40:44.131 --> 01:40:46.980
So they just run it off after they got hit in the head.
But that soccer ball,

1841
01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:50.940
but the reality is every time you get up pop,
every little pop is bad.

1842
01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:54.310
You know you can,
you're practicing on the field

1843
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:57.250
<v 0>and you're kicking the ball and heading it at each other back and forth and</v>

1844
01:40:57.370 --> 01:40:59.890
you'll realize it.
But you're getting jabbed in the face.

1845
01:41:00.810 --> 01:41:05.290
We are just now coming to terms with how dangerous head trauma is.

1846
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:08.830
You know they're there.
That's something that would be fascinating,

1847
01:41:08.831 --> 01:41:12.610
but that's exactly how the plant of the apes got started.

1848
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.540
They wanted to fix people's brains and then they fucking used it on monkeys.

1849
01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.020
The monkeys could smarter than people.

1850
01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:20.470
So that could be an issue of how to be careful.
You got to come their thumbs,
man,

1851
01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:24.220
we've got to figure out how to,
how to make grains rich.

1852
01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:28.180
You can rejuvenate brain tissue and re rehabilitate brain trauma.

1853
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.690
That would be amazing.
Then people could fight and never even worry about it.

1854
01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.050
You know,
they just fix your brain after done church charge it back up.

1855
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.600
Cause right now,
man,
like you've,
you've,
you've,

1856
01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:40.750
you've been aware of those NFL players that they've done autopsies on them and

1857
01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:44.080
found that of their 40 year old men and they have the brain of an 80 year old

1858
01:41:44.081 --> 01:41:47.890
Alzheimer's patient.
It's horrible.
That's not good.
Yeah.

1859
01:41:47.891 --> 01:41:51.730
I mean they get Alzheimer's,
you get so many different diseases,

1860
01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:56.110
Lou Gehrig's disease,
so many different trauma related ailments.

1861
01:41:56.830 --> 01:42:01.350
Meanwhile,
football's awesome.
So how do we fix that science step in?

1862
01:42:02.710 --> 01:42:07.240
I don't like seeing fighters get brain down as it kills me.
It drives me nuts.

1863
01:42:07.241 --> 01:42:11.370
And I've seen guys,
you know,
we were talking before the show about,
uh,

1864
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:17.310
oh yeah.
You know,
what if there's more that
you can kill it with.

1865
01:42:19.090 --> 01:42:20.020
I was just saying,
you know,

1866
01:42:20.021 --> 01:42:24.130
even watching some of the recreational MMA guys,

1867
01:42:24.131 --> 01:42:26.860
if they do it for long enough and they're training with guys who are hitting

1868
01:42:26.861 --> 01:42:30.520
them a lot,
thank you.
Uh,
you can see it over the span of years.
I mean,

1869
01:42:30.521 --> 01:42:35.290
you see their speech patterns change.
They're also tired all the time too.

1870
01:42:35.291 --> 01:42:39.040
That's one thing to take into consideration.
We think that it's,
you know,

1871
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:41.290
that a lot of times they're all,
dude's got brain damage,

1872
01:42:41.630 --> 01:42:45.280
guys fucking doing three a days and he's exhausted when you talked to him,

1873
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:48.430
you know,
and he's got black eyes,
so you're just assume he's got brain damage.

1874
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:53.080
We want,
he's just fucking tired.
You know,
just training,
training alone,

1875
01:42:53.081 --> 01:42:57.670
even just doing Jujitsu one night a week,
every day,
every night is,
it kills you.

1876
01:42:58.090 --> 01:42:58.720
It's brutal.

1877
01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.380
But when you add in strength training and kickboxing and wrestling to all that,

1878
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.990
I don't think there's an athlete on the planet that works as hard as mixed

1879
01:43:04.991 --> 01:43:08.500
martial arts fighters.
I really don't.
I think it's the most difficult physically,

1880
01:43:08.501 --> 01:43:11.590
emotionally,
mentally,
psychologically.
I think everything about it.
It's hard.

1881
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.120
Who among the MMA fighters that you've met or interacted with her and just know

1882
01:43:16.121 --> 01:43:20.620
of who are,
who have the most grueling training regimens?
George Saint Pierre,

1883
01:43:20.621 --> 01:43:25.420
probably he's,
he's right up there.
He's,
um,
always fit,
you know,

1884
01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:29.950
and yeah,
Anderson Silva and George George is never out of shape,

1885
01:43:29.951 --> 01:43:33.350
never takes an opponent.
Likely always stays to the game plans.

1886
01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:36.040
The only time he ever took an opponent lightly was Matt Serra and he got knocked

1887
01:43:36.041 --> 01:43:38.050
out and never did it again.
And you know,

1888
01:43:38.051 --> 01:43:41.770
he's a real honest guy who learns from his mistakes,

1889
01:43:41.771 --> 01:43:44.970
but he trains very hard,
but pretty much they all do at this point.

1890
01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:49.420
Rashad Evans is notoriously tough,
uh,
in,
in a training camp.
Very hard worker.

1891
01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:53.960
You know this John Jones kid course,
he's,
he's got a furious work ethic.

1892
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:56.260
They have to the,
all the great ones have a great worker.

1893
01:43:56.330 --> 01:44:00.020
There's no room right now at the top levels of mixed martial arts.

1894
01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:02.300
There's no room for mediocrity.
There's no room,

1895
01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:04.020
there's no room for anybody that thinks there's are,

1896
01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:07.730
there are natural doesn't want to put it at a time that sport eliminates all

1897
01:44:07.731 --> 01:44:11.570
that shit eliminates all the luck and all the just natural talent.

1898
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:14.180
That doesn't mean shit when you're fighting five,
five minute rounds,

1899
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:17.900
you got a fucking train man.
You've got to train everything.
You've got to train,

1900
01:44:17.901 --> 01:44:21.830
wrestling,
wrestling,
defense,
kickboxing,
Jujitsu,
Jujitsu,
defense.

1901
01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:25.000
You got a train getting up from the fucking bottom.
You got to train,
take downs.

1902
01:44:25.001 --> 01:44:26.630
You've got to train the whole fight.
And if you don't,

1903
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:29.300
someone's going to find that chink in your armor and they gonna Jack You,

1904
01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.470
there's no room anymore.

1905
01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:33.140
It used to be that all you had to do was be a good striker.

1906
01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:34.790
All you had to do is be a good wrestler.

1907
01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:38.990
But nowadays it's getting to that point where you just have to always be fit.

1908
01:44:38.991 --> 01:44:41.990
You have to always be ready.
You have to,
you know,
there's just,

1909
01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:47.020
it's just such an intensely close and competitive environment right now.

1910
01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:51.830
Yeah.
You know,
so everyone has at the top has a serious work ethic.

1911
01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:53.110
Cain Velasquez.
No.

1912
01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:54.880
<v 5>Yeah,
I've seen it.</v>

1913
01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:59.870
I've watched the Canon Aka d skis as you've seen him live train.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1914
01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.810
Cause I mean I trained with,
um,
do you live up Dave Camera?
Yeah,

1915
01:45:02.811 --> 01:45:04.710
I used to live in San Jose,
actually.
Dave Kamaria.

1916
01:45:04.711 --> 01:45:07.250
Maria lived at my house real and so high.
Yeah.

1917
01:45:07.251 --> 01:45:11.330
We had Matt in the garage and we would,
uh,
I would train in his classes at Aka.

1918
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:15.260
Dude,
that's awesome.
Die.
Oh,
he's a great teacher too.

1919
01:45:15.261 --> 01:45:18.800
A lot of people don't realize it unless they've looked into it.
I mean,

1920
01:45:18.801 --> 01:45:22.370
he used to teach chess in his spare time.

1921
01:45:22.371 --> 01:45:25.880
He reads Noam Chomsky.
The guys were really smart,
very,
very,

1922
01:45:25.881 --> 01:45:28.670
and he's very good at taking,
let's say,

1923
01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:33.170
a curriculum for Jujitsu and then sequencing it in a way that makes a lot of

1924
01:45:33.171 --> 01:45:36.980
logical sense.
There's a progression to it.
And for that reason,
I mean,

1925
01:45:36.981 --> 01:45:38.510
the guys who trained with him are,

1926
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:42.560
let's just say you look at a low level blue belt,

1927
01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.760
they're still notoriously difficult to deal with because they don't violate

1928
01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:51.050
their fundamentals.
They're really,
they have that drilled into them.
Uh,

1929
01:45:51.051 --> 01:45:52.380
it was a great school.
I mean,
a lot of the,

1930
01:45:52.381 --> 01:45:56.380
obviously it can cost check says fundamentals are so important.
Yeah.

1931
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:59.640
<v 0>Jujitsu,
it's something that people really don't truly don't understand.</v>

1932
01:45:59.641 --> 01:46:03.390
And if you,
if you train with a guy who,
you know,
may be,

1933
01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:06.720
isn't so technical,
it can really,
it really,

1934
01:46:06.721 --> 01:46:11.190
it kind of can stunt your growth,
Jujitsu practitioner,

1935
01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.970
Jujitsu.
Is it like a language in my opinion?
Yeah.
And you,

1936
01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:16.070
you got to learn grammar.

1937
01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.690
<v 5>Yeah.
I was just gonna say the Samsung.
Yeah.
If you don't have the framework.
Yeah,</v>

1938
01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:22.030
just amassing vocabularies and then it becomes,
becomes

1939
01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.650
<v 0>an argument.
But the way I described you Jitsu,</v>

1940
01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:29.120
like most people have no idea how to defend themselves against Jujitsu.

1941
01:46:29.121 --> 01:46:34.121
So really what it's like is them not knowing a language and you yelling at them

1942
01:46:34.281 --> 01:46:36.980
in that language and they just can't possibly keep up.
Right.

1943
01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:39.890
That's what it's like when you're in a grappling match with someone who doesn't

1944
01:46:39.891 --> 01:46:42.740
understand Jujitsu.
And then the guy says,
well,
you know what?

1945
01:46:42.741 --> 01:46:45.740
I'm going to take Jujitsu classes.
Well,
good fucking luck.

1946
01:46:45.770 --> 01:46:49.230
Because you know what that's like?
That's like you,
you saying,
well,

1947
01:46:49.231 --> 01:46:52.680
I'm going to learn English and then I'm going to tell that American comedian

1948
01:46:52.681 --> 01:46:54.930
what the fuck is up.
Yeah.
No,
you're not going to,

1949
01:46:54.931 --> 01:46:56.520
it's going to take you forever to get to his speed.

1950
01:46:56.670 --> 01:46:58.320
You're gonna be able to talk at that guy speed.

1951
01:46:58.321 --> 01:47:00.750
He's a fucking community and he stands on stage with a microphone in front of

1952
01:47:00.751 --> 01:47:05.070
thousands of people and he can bust out the right thing to say at a moment's

1953
01:47:05.071 --> 01:47:05.610
notice.

1954
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:08.520
And you're going to compete with them because you're learning this new language

1955
01:47:08.521 --> 01:47:12.210
called English and you're gonna eventually get as good at him.
Good fucking luck.

1956
01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:15.260
That's what it's like when you learn Jujitsu.
Cause someone could say,
you know,

1957
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:17.490
matter,
but practice in Jujitsu,
I've been doing it six months,

1958
01:47:17.491 --> 01:47:21.140
I'm gonna tap you now and you can just start laughing and laughing.

1959
01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:22.800
Cause that's actually kind of funny.

1960
01:47:22.990 --> 01:47:25.830
It's like you're a person who's just learning English and you want to get into

1961
01:47:25.831 --> 01:47:29.400
an argument with a Harvard scholar.
Yeah.
I mean that's literally what it's like,

1962
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:32.800
you know?
And as,
as you get better at it,
you know,

1963
01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:36.870
you realize that even your level of understanding of the language pales in

1964
01:47:36.871 --> 01:47:39.210
comparison to other people's like,
Oh,
you know,
uh,

1965
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:44.300
I've rolled with John John Machado who's a multiple time world champion and he

1966
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:48.540
gave me my brown belt and he's a great guy and a good friend.
But Rowan,

1967
01:47:48.541 --> 01:47:51.570
hem is like,
he's a master,
he's a master.

1968
01:47:51.571 --> 01:47:54.750
And you just feel like it's so fucking Claude.
Like,
why did I have my arm there?

1969
01:47:54.751 --> 01:47:57.720
Why is my leg here?
I know what I'm doing.
I've been doing this for 20 years.

1970
01:47:57.721 --> 01:48:01.740
Almost doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Oh look,
you're mounted.
Oh,
what's that?

1971
01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:03.180
A triangle.
A better tap.

1972
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:06.870
The world's going black shit and then you do it again and you can tap you

1973
01:48:06.871 --> 01:48:09.970
whatever he wants to.
Man,
he could just keep doing it.
You're getting your,

1974
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.000
you wrote with a guy like Marcello Garcia.

1975
01:48:12.210 --> 01:48:15.900
It's like you're doing chopsticks and he's playing Beethoven with six arms.

1976
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:20.910
You know?
It's like you can't just fucking,
there's no way.
It is like a language.

1977
01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:21.773
It is

1978
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.890
<v 5>totally,
as I remember,</v>

1979
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:26.910
I've been recently getting to know for a host of weird reasons,

1980
01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.680
people in the hedge fund world and I recently got out of the public markets

1981
01:48:31.681 --> 01:48:33.630
completely like I don't,
I'm not trading any stocks.

1982
01:48:33.631 --> 01:48:37.740
And part of the reason was that I remember this guy saying to me at one point,

1983
01:48:37.741 --> 01:48:40.980
he's like,
would you ever play poker grants a professional poker player?

1984
01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.770
It's like,
would you put million of your own money down and play that guy?

1985
01:48:43.771 --> 01:48:45.060
I was like,
absolutely nice.
Like,
okay,

1986
01:48:45.061 --> 01:48:48.300
would you put a million of your money down and play Tiger Woods in golf?

1987
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:50.280
Was like,
of course not.
He's like,
okay,

1988
01:48:50.281 --> 01:48:52.680
well why would anyone do that with their money?

1989
01:48:52.681 --> 01:48:56.700
And then think they compete against the guy who runs $20 billion in a hedge fund

1990
01:48:57.210 --> 01:48:59.590
in the public markets.
It's the same thing.
And I was just like,

1991
01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:04.500
that's a good point.
I think.
I'll think I'll opt out of that.
Uh,

1992
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:08.750
but uh,
yeah,
some of got to be Marcello.
So Marcello was school.
He,

1993
01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.620
he opened with Marcello Garcia.
Yeah.
With,
with Josh waste.
So Jj is,

1994
01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:15.390
Josh has a good friend of mine.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Awesome guy.
And he's very,

1995
01:49:15.391 --> 01:49:18.630
he's a very good roller too.
He's great.
He's great.
Good on the mass.
But I mean,

1996
01:49:18.631 --> 01:49:21.090
Marcello is,
people don't understand.
Let's explain who Josh is.

1997
01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:25.350
Josh is the guy who was the inspiration for the movie searching for Eddie
Fisher.

1998
01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:28.360
Uh,
yeah.
Lobster fishery.
The fishery searching for Bobby Fisher about the chess.

1999
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:32.170
Prodigy has pros about Josh.
Yeah,
it's about Josh.
So Josh has a,
Hey,
you know,

2000
01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:35.090
world class chess player,
you know,
he,
he,

2001
01:49:35.091 --> 01:49:38.340
he's done the simultaneous exhibitions where we'll play like 40 games at once

2002
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:42.210
and we'll just go from board to board to board the board.
That's such a trip.
Uh,

2003
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.040
and a mind fuck that is,
you're a little fucking retard,
you know,

2004
01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:48.070
land play

2005
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.640
<v 0>in mind.
Trying to like what's his next move going to be?</v>

2006
01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:55.750
What your next moves and he's walking through a room,
there's sick click,
click,

2007
01:49:55.751 --> 01:50:00.250
click,
click,
click.
Probably Awhile Song is playing in his head at the same time.

2008
01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:02.500
It's a trap.
It's amazing.

2009
01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:07.070
<v 2>I've seen him,
uh,
I,
I've seen him play,
why not really play chess?</v>

2010
01:50:07.071 --> 01:50:07.904
Teach chess.

2011
01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:13.030
He one time to the Rizza of Wu Tang clan and a WHO's really into chess.

2012
01:50:13.031 --> 01:50:15.830
And so they were,
they were going through opening,
opening moves.

2013
01:50:15.831 --> 01:50:17.920
I remember they went about 15 moves into the game,

2014
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:20.710
not even like 10 moves into the game and Jessica was aren't,

2015
01:50:20.711 --> 01:50:21.850
let's take a look at what just happened.

2016
01:50:21.851 --> 01:50:25.660
And he just like pressed reverse and went back one move at a time and then could

2017
01:50:25.661 --> 01:50:29.860
jump forward three moves.
And uh,
that just blew my mind.

2018
01:50:29.861 --> 01:50:30.750
And he and

2019
01:50:31.190 --> 01:50:32.570
<v 0>Billy can,
it's like a language.</v>

2020
01:50:32.571 --> 01:50:36.350
It's like you and I communicating with readily available nouns and verbs to us.

2021
01:50:36.351 --> 01:50:37.580
It's a normal thing to him.

2022
01:50:37.581 --> 01:50:41.390
The language of chasses is just so ingrained in his mind is just so cool.

2023
01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:45.050
It's such a,
a game for thinkers to chasses.

2024
01:50:45.051 --> 01:50:48.740
It's such an impressive game to get good at because everyone I know that's truly

2025
01:50:48.741 --> 01:50:51.020
great.
A chasse is fucking brilliant.
Yeah.

2026
01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:53.240
When I was playing pool back in the day when I was,

2027
01:50:53.241 --> 01:50:56.570
when I first moved to New York,
I had a real pool addiction and uh,

2028
01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.330
I hung out with this pool executive billiards in white plains.

2029
01:50:59.331 --> 01:51:01.550
I was there every day.
And one of the things I've found,

2030
01:51:01.551 --> 01:51:06.200
there was guys who had been to prison who learned how to play chess in the air.

2031
01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.540
They would just talk,
they would say,
you know,

2032
01:51:08.541 --> 01:51:10.790
night to queen five or whatever the fuck it is.

2033
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:13.970
And they would play chess standing in front of each other,
back and forth.

2034
01:51:13.971 --> 01:51:16.760
And one of the kids that used to come there,
this is a young kid,

2035
01:51:16.761 --> 01:51:20.690
I forget his name,
Adam,
I believe his name was,
he was a chess champion,

2036
01:51:20.691 --> 01:51:22.130
a young a chess champion.

2037
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:26.150
And his father used to take him to Geez chess tournaments and stuff like that.

2038
01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:29.450
And he used to sit in the pool hall.
It became addicted to pool too.

2039
01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:33.050
And he was just sitting in the pool hall and play chess with this guy who was

2040
01:51:33.051 --> 01:51:34.760
this older dude who had been to jail.

2041
01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:36.680
And he had learned how to play chess in the air too.

2042
01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:39.170
So they would just sit there staring at each other and the kid would just

2043
01:51:39.171 --> 01:51:43.130
checkmate them left and right out of the air.
Wow.
Who's fucking amazing.

2044
01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:47.240
It's just so weird to think that some is like they were speaking the language.

2045
01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:49.700
I totally didn't understand.
Like,
I know that you,
you know,

2046
01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:53.120
I know that you move the rook like this and I know you moved the night like
that.

2047
01:51:53.121 --> 01:51:54.020
I know,
I know that,

2048
01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:57.770
but when there are rattling off those numbers and I'm trying to piece together

2049
01:51:57.771 --> 01:52:01.340
the grid and um,
you know,
I had no information in front of me,
so I was like,
okay,

2050
01:52:01.341 --> 01:52:04.430
how many pieces are there on a fucking chest playing battleship without a boy?

2051
01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:07.400
You know,
I'm on a simpler level.
Yes.
So impressive.

2052
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:10.370
I'm so impressed by people who are good at chess and it transfers,

2053
01:52:10.371 --> 01:52:15.370
it transfers as well.
Like the,
the logical thinking.
Oh yeah.

2054
01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:16.880
<v 2>Yeah.
So I mean the,
uh,
you know,</v>

2055
01:52:16.881 --> 01:52:20.870
don't go for a submission or what does it position before submission.
I mean,

2056
01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:24.510
that's like,
oh yeah.
I mean there are different styles of chess,

2057
01:52:24.511 --> 01:52:27.530
but definitely thinking strategically so that you,

2058
01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:31.310
you dominate certain positions,
certain,
certain directions and so forth.
I mean,

2059
01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:33.100
it's,
I think it's very analogous,
I guess.

2060
01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:37.360
<v 0>Did you Jitsu?
I'm scared of it.
I'm scared of chess.
Like I'm scared of golf.
Yeah.</v>

2061
01:52:37.770 --> 01:52:40.890
I'm scared of anything that I think that I might get addicted to.
And I like,

2062
01:52:40.891 --> 01:52:43.090
I used to listen to Howard stern talking about chess all the time.

2063
01:52:43.091 --> 01:52:46.370
It became a chest nut for awhile and he was taking lessons and shit.
I was like,

2064
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:48.260
that is what I don't need in my life.

2065
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:51.200
I don't need to be online playing fucking chest 10 hours a day.

2066
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:52.310
Cause that shit could happen.

2067
01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:54.500
<v 2>Yeah.
Well that's,
that's why,
you know,
people,
uh,</v>

2068
01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:57.440
I don't watch much TV and they're like,
oh,
you one of these guys who's like,

2069
01:52:57.441 --> 01:53:00.200
well I don't watch TV.
I'm like,
no,
no,
no.
You don't understand.
People are like,
Oh,

2070
01:53:00.201 --> 01:53:02.020
you should watch lost.
It's the best thing I've ever seen.

2071
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:05.030
Or you should watch the wire.
It's the best thing I've ever seen.
I'm like,
look,

2072
01:53:05.031 --> 01:53:07.460
the reason I won't watch it is because I think it will be the best thing I've

2073
01:53:07.461 --> 01:53:07.821
ever seen.

2074
01:53:07.821 --> 01:53:11.780
And then I have to sit in a fucking cave and watch like 20 weeks of this and

2075
01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:13.310
then that's going to lead me to whatever you know,

2076
01:53:13.311 --> 01:53:15.950
six feet under and it's like I can't afford to have that happen.

2077
01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:19.220
I used to play d and D,
I know I can go off the off the rails.

2078
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:24.040
<v 0>You can d is the number one thing for going off the rail.
Right.</v>

2079
01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:28.670
Everquest was another one.
What's an off the rails and he's like,

2080
01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.630
I'm a where we were last night and he would tell you,

2081
01:53:30.631 --> 01:53:33.660
Ari and I went to dinner last night,
a Denny's after we did the ice house.

2082
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:37.200
So we're going to start doing the ice house in Pasadena all the time now folks

2083
01:53:37.201 --> 01:53:38.550
that fucking places.
Awesome.

2084
01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:42.540
And we're also going to do a podcast from the Ice House that we're going to call

2085
01:53:42.541 --> 01:53:45.260
it an evening at the ice house.
And what it's going to be is just,

2086
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:48.480
we're going to set up microphones and a table and we're just going to have the

2087
01:53:48.481 --> 01:53:52.620
comic shoot the shit before they go on stage and then come off stage and shoot

2088
01:53:52.621 --> 01:53:55.980
the shit again.
Like,
oh,
this fucking crowds awesome.
Or there's this drunk bitch.

2089
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:59.760
The front won't shut the fuck up and we're going to sit down and do this.
Um,

2090
01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:01.620
so what,
what was my point?
What was I talking about?

2091
01:54:02.730 --> 01:54:05.730
Video Games or something happened,
you went to Denny's with our,
oh,

2092
01:54:05.731 --> 01:54:08.100
we went to Denny's.
That's right.
Sorry.
So after the show,

2093
01:54:08.101 --> 01:54:11.790
we went to Denny's and they're all playing magic.
The gathering is this packet.

2094
01:54:11.791 --> 01:54:15.120
That's a whole,
this is not white.
Pasadena is okay.
There's a,

2095
01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:19.770
a giant table of dorks and they seem very nice.
I'm sorry if I call you dorks,

2096
01:54:19.771 --> 01:54:21.890
if you're a podcast fan,
but they're,

2097
01:54:21.891 --> 01:54:24.240
they're sitting down there and they all have their things that they're like,

2098
01:54:24.241 --> 01:54:27.000
well,
this spell has to bring,
this is the bottom of the barrel spell.

2099
01:54:27.001 --> 01:54:28.140
This brings you back to the law.

2100
01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:31.620
And I'm sitting there watching these guys and they are in their own world.

2101
01:54:31.621 --> 01:54:32.880
We're staring at them.
And I'm like,

2102
01:54:32.970 --> 01:54:35.100
the moment they look up and realize I'm staring,

2103
01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:38.780
I'm going to feel like an asshole.
They never looked up.
They never looked up.

2104
01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:43.230
We just looked at each other and they were absorbed in their darkish fucking

2105
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:44.990
magic,
the gathering games,

2106
01:54:44.991 --> 01:54:48.510
stacks of cards and their table and dice and they were just,
you know,

2107
01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:53.540
eating moons over my Hammy at three o'clock in the morning on a Friday night

2108
01:54:54.630 --> 01:54:59.000
<v 2>villain.
Would you be into that magic?
The gathering?
It's a,
it's very immersive.</v>

2109
01:54:59.001 --> 01:55:01.180
I mean I remember playing magic,
the gathering walnut or no,

2110
01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:02.220
not magic for me and it's,

2111
01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:06.890
I came before I was advanced d and D and I was all about great elves and a

2112
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:10.850
number of other things.
I felt like I was very,
I was a racist.
I was like,

2113
01:55:10.851 --> 01:55:13.220
I was all about the,
the,
the grail for race.

2114
01:55:13.221 --> 01:55:15.860
But I remember at one point this friend of mine,

2115
01:55:15.861 --> 01:55:19.160
because I built up this pretty fucking bad ass character and this buddy of mine

2116
01:55:19.161 --> 01:55:21.650
is playing with me and then we had the dungeon master,
right?

2117
01:55:21.651 --> 01:55:25.470
Who's kind of like the referee and my buddy took it really seriously,

2118
01:55:25.471 --> 01:55:27.800
but he's just being a dick.
He was like bitching and whining.

2119
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:31.340
You've been doing it all day and so dungeons and none of know about all sorts of

2120
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:33.680
other stuff.
And he kept on bitching as we were playing.

2121
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:36.950
And so we're supposed to be going on this module together.

2122
01:55:36.951 --> 01:55:38.980
We're supposed to be like going through this labyrinth together and at one point

2123
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:40.160
my turn and I say,
okay,

2124
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:44.190
I'm going to take my fucking like Mithril dagger and Stab Nick Right

2125
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.350
<v 4>in the face.
And Nick's like,
Wah,
Wah Wah.</v>

2126
01:55:46.351 --> 01:55:48.580
And so I rolled and I just killed this character.

2127
01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:52.960
I was so pissed and he flipped and stab me in the thigh with a pencil.
Uh,

2128
01:55:53.630 --> 01:55:57.390
yeah,
he went absolutely homicidal.
Wow.
Where's that guy today?

2129
01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.840
He's actually really successful in New York City,
so I don't know.

2130
01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:04.170
It wasn't the worst thing.
He eight this Sunday.
His name Duncan Trussell.

2131
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.750
He's really successful.

2132
01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:10.800
He stabbed you with a fucking pencil and the thought that you're sitting right

2133
01:56:10.801 --> 01:56:12.750
next to each other.
Imagine.
How old was he at the time?

2134
01:56:13.110 --> 01:56:17.930
He was probably say 12 or 13 oh,
okay.
I thought you were going to say.

2135
01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.580
Yeah,
but in his defense you wouldn't stop fucking with them.

2136
01:56:23.581 --> 01:56:27.300
You were sitting behind him poking him while he was in?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2137
01:56:27.301 --> 01:56:28.650
We're not going to talk about this.
No,
no,
no.

2138
01:56:28.710 --> 01:56:31.140
We're not going to talk about this and that.
This is a ridiculous one.

2139
01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:34.560
You want just got fucked and he stabbed you with a pen because he had to get you

2140
01:56:34.561 --> 01:56:37.290
to stop fucking with them.
Yeah,
but if I were sitting in the front,
it messed up.

2141
01:56:37.291 --> 01:56:39.870
You're sitting behind him poking and while I was trying to sleep and he fucking

2142
01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:44.460
stabbed whatever it was,
you didn't want you to know the story.
I know the story.

2143
01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:46.620
I know he stabbed you in the hand because you were an annoying,

2144
01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:50.400
that's what was going on.
Okay.
You were in knowing him and you wouldn't stop,

2145
01:56:50.401 --> 01:56:51.750
so he stabbed you in the hand of the pen.

2146
01:56:51.751 --> 01:56:55.380
I just find it weird that people take it to the next level hand or head,
hand,

2147
01:56:55.381 --> 01:57:00.270
hand.
She's this
really aggressive to the next level.

2148
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:02.430
But also people should stop fucking with people when they say,

2149
01:57:02.431 --> 01:57:03.450
stop snacking with me.

2150
01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.760
I know you didn't expect that.
I know you didn't expect that,

2151
01:57:08.761 --> 01:57:13.720
but I didn't want to talk about it.
Now here we are.
God dammit.
Yeah.

2152
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:15.600
Dudes can get wrapped up in any kind of gay man.

2153
01:57:15.601 --> 01:57:17.130
I've seen violence after pool games.

2154
01:57:17.131 --> 01:57:19.430
I've seen violence after to basketball games.
You know,

2155
01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:21.690
competitive people get apparently like Michael Jordan.

2156
01:57:21.691 --> 01:57:23.700
If you beat him at fucking anything,
beat him at checkers.

2157
01:57:23.701 --> 01:57:26.490
He won't talk to you for like a month.
Yeah.
There's a,

2158
01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:28.320
there's one guy who shall remain nameless.

2159
01:57:28.321 --> 01:57:32.400
He's in as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley,
very famous guy.

2160
01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:37.560
He likes to play chess and he's,
no,
no,
not Kevin,
but he's famous.

2161
01:57:37.590 --> 01:57:39.420
He's very good chess player.
But if someone beats him,

2162
01:57:39.421 --> 01:57:42.990
he swipes all the pieces off the board and at one point someone is like,
Whoa,

2163
01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.670
you're really bad lizard.
And he goes,

2164
01:57:44.970 --> 01:57:48.900
show me a bad loser and I'll show you a fucking loser.
This blind.

2165
01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:53.810
But yeah,
it does not lose.
Show you a good loser.
Oh,
that's right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2166
01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:56.850
Show me a good loser and I'll show you fucking lizard.
Exactly.
Yeah.

2167
01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.690
Gas But utilize,
you don't have to be like,
I mean for,
yeah,

2168
01:58:00.691 --> 01:58:05.691
for every stereotype that you have in a given industry,

2169
01:58:05.701 --> 01:58:08.610
like for example,
a lot of people think that in order to be a good chef,

2170
01:58:08.611 --> 01:58:10.080
you have to be a fucking asshole.

2171
01:58:10.081 --> 01:58:13.740
Like you have to be willing to fucking curse at people and make them cry in the

2172
01:58:13.741 --> 01:58:18.690
kitchen.
And that's,
I think a dominant trait.
But you can always find exceptions.

2173
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:20.550
You can always find people who are like,
all right,

2174
01:58:20.551 --> 01:58:24.180
I came from a frickin abused family and the last restaurant that I was brought

2175
01:58:24.181 --> 01:58:26.970
up in,
and I'm not going to have that in my restaurant.
And they make it work.

2176
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.440
You like,
you don't have to do that.

2177
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:32.790
There's a funny episode of one of those kitchen shows were Gordon Ramsey was

2178
01:58:32.791 --> 01:58:36.180
yelling at this guy calling them an idiot.
And the guy just goes,

2179
01:58:36.210 --> 01:58:38.820
I ain't no bitch.
Don't talk to him either.
I ain't no bitch.

2180
01:58:38.821 --> 01:58:41.770
And he throws his thing down and he got right and Gordon Ramsay's face

2181
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.870
<v 0>and he's like,
yeah,
I thought so.
What the fuck you talking bout?
You create?</v>

2182
01:58:44.871 --> 01:58:47.260
And then Gordon Ramsey was like,
you're being ridiculous.
Like Oh,

2183
01:58:47.261 --> 01:58:50.020
I'm being ridiculous.
Don't talk to me like that.
Stupid.

2184
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:53.500
And then they separated him and pulled the guy away.
But it's true.

2185
01:58:53.501 --> 01:58:56.920
Gordon Ramsay's acting like this guy's an idiot.
He's going to kick his ass.

2186
01:58:56.921 --> 01:59:00.940
He's threatening him,
is yelling at him and the guys are like fuck you stupid.

2187
01:59:01.570 --> 01:59:04.900
You know,
fuck you and your fucking ridiculous way of communicating.

2188
01:59:04.901 --> 01:59:08.680
How bout I Trump you?
You want to go champ?
I'll go chip back.
How about that?
Oh,

2189
01:59:08.681 --> 01:59:11.890
you weren't set up for a reply.
He just set up to be a shithead.

2190
01:59:11.891 --> 01:59:15.820
I think those shows are gross.
When I hear those guys yelling at people,

2191
01:59:15.821 --> 01:59:19.300
I'm praying someone punches them.
That's what people were supposed to do.

2192
01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:22.540
And you act completely out of line like that and act like a shit head.

2193
01:59:22.541 --> 01:59:24.570
People were supposed to hit you.
Yeah.

2194
01:59:24.850 --> 01:59:27.880
Has never been hit no then but no properly.

2195
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:31.600
And so when they think they're gone to the fucking panic,
they lock up.

2196
01:59:31.601 --> 01:59:33.130
Like all of a sudden this posturing,

2197
01:59:33.131 --> 01:59:37.240
all this screeching they'd been doing is ineffective and it's come down to

2198
01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:39.940
crunch time.
There's a line in the sand.
Will they cross it?

2199
01:59:40.610 --> 01:59:43.760
<v 2>Yeah,
Lord of the flies,
man,
I'm a fleecy and people ask me what I am.
I'm like,</v>

2200
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:48.710
I think people behave as well as their circumstances and allow them to,
yeah,

2201
01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:49.873
I'm amazed.

2202
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:51.940
<v 0>Society keeps it together as well as it does.</v>

2203
01:59:51.941 --> 01:59:55.360
The electricity is almost always on.
Everything runs smoothly.

2204
01:59:55.361 --> 01:59:57.850
Food arrives in time,
but God damn it,

2205
01:59:57.851 --> 02:00:00.720
if it did and things would go ugly so quick.
There's

2206
02:00:00.750 --> 02:00:04.050
<v 2>a,
I saw a sign on the way over here that said,
uh,
I think it's,</v>

2207
02:00:04.051 --> 02:00:08.100
it's cert training,
CRT,
which is the disaster response training.

2208
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:11.640
And there's one in northern California called nerd that sews the northern

2209
02:00:11.641 --> 02:00:14.750
California emergency response training.
And if you do that,
they,

2210
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:19.740
they prepare you for the most likely type of disaster scenario in your area.

2211
02:00:19.741 --> 02:00:22.470
And in San Francisco,
of course,
it's a,
among other things,
earthquake.

2212
02:00:22.471 --> 02:00:25.680
And I remember doing this was done by the fire department and Police Department

2213
02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:28.410
and they said,
all right,
how many people live in San Francisco?

2214
02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:30.180
Eight hundred thousand nine hundred thousand in the city,

2215
02:00:30.181 --> 02:00:33.900
like Greater San Francisco,
whatever it is,
7 million.
4 million.
Said,
all right,

2216
02:00:33.901 --> 02:00:38.860
how many firetrucks you think we have people that like 50 a hundred 120 and

2217
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:41.940
they're like,
we have 12 firetrucks or something like that.
It was so small.

2218
02:00:41.941 --> 02:00:45.300
So they said if we get hit by a seven point,
whatever Richter scale earthquake,

2219
02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.280
what do you think the response time is going to be like?

2220
02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:51.210
No one is coming to save you.
So you can be without water for seven,
10 days.

2221
02:00:51.211 --> 02:00:52.350
And these following scenarios,

2222
02:00:52.351 --> 02:00:55.020
and it's like the first day or two people are gonna behave and then people are

2223
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:59.580
gonna get their knives and their guns and take your water.
So that's true.

2224
02:00:59.610 --> 02:01:02.640
And this is,
their children are starving.
Oh yeah.
And this is,
you know,

2225
02:01:02.641 --> 02:01:04.470
they're giving this type of,
and they're like,

2226
02:01:04.471 --> 02:01:07.950
so just to get that out of the way and now we can move on to actually what to
do.

2227
02:01:07.951 --> 02:01:11.850
But when you get the disaster recovery or assistant certification,

2228
02:01:11.851 --> 02:01:16.590
you get hardhat,
uh,
one of those yellow emergency vests,

2229
02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:19.050
you get a special badge.
So hypothetically,

2230
02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:21.780
if you were to want to evacuate during this type of emergency,

2231
02:01:21.781 --> 02:01:24.080
if you have all of that gear and let's say a motorcycle,

2232
02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:28.410
she can get through traffic,
you're actually very well prepared.
So that was a,

2233
02:01:28.411 --> 02:01:31.170
I'm friends with Neil Strauss who's down here who wrote the game.
Uh,

2234
02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:33.300
emergency emergency was about a lot of this.

2235
02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:38.360
But the more I look at the realities of how people behave in

2236
02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.550
<v 5>situations where there are scarce resources,
especially water,</v>

2237
02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:47.240
the more I think that stuff is not entirely crazy.
You know,

2238
02:01:47.241 --> 02:01:51.650
to have six months of canned food.
I just don't,
I think it's cheap insurance now.

2239
02:01:51.651 --> 02:01:55.790
You can go off,
you can go off the deep end and start doing crazy,
crazy stuff,

2240
02:01:55.791 --> 02:02:00.560
but get those pallets of freeze dried astronaut meals delivered to your house.

2241
02:02:00.561 --> 02:02:04.700
And you guys with generators and then they have underground,

2242
02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:08.510
uh,
let's see,
what is the electromagnetic pulse?

2243
02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:13.130
EMP electromagnetic pulse proof boxes to hold the backup chips.

2244
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:15.130
Cause it's because a number up there,

2245
02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:18.290
quite a few people who think one of the more likely attacks if someone wanted to

2246
02:02:18.291 --> 02:02:21.070
really wipe out a lot of,
uh,

2247
02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:25.020
functioning in the u s is to attack computer systems.
So they would drop,

2248
02:02:25.021 --> 02:02:29.990
let's say an electromagnetic pulse bomb in one of the Great Lakes and take out

2249
02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:34.140
like,
you know,
Chicago or whatever.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
Hold up.
Yeah.

2250
02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:38.060
What the fuck is electromagnetic pulse bomb?
So I,

2251
02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:41.210
I'm thinking I'm getting this right.
And Google would,
would tell us quickly,

2252
02:02:41.211 --> 02:02:45.930
but it's fine.
It's something that does not,
it doesn't kill humans,
but it's,

2253
02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:50.000
and it fries,
it will fry all the computers,
all the generators,
everything else.

2254
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:54.010
Why throw it in the great legs?
Why don't I just drop it on Chicago?
Uh,

2255
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:56.660
because I think it,
uh,
what,
what the hell was the rationale?

2256
02:02:56.661 --> 02:03:00.290
That would just be easier to do if you're on top of water.
So you could actually,

2257
02:03:00.291 --> 02:03:02.450
you wouldn't even necessarily have to,
you know,
drop it.

2258
02:03:02.451 --> 02:03:03.740
You could just send it out in a boat.

2259
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:07.100
The only thing that has something on it as above top secret,

2260
02:03:07.101 --> 02:03:12.101
that's like the top one always does a number one.

2261
02:03:12.621 --> 02:03:16.250
And then there's how stuff works.
Videos.
Nice.

2262
02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:19.470
There's a how to video on how to build an electromagnetic pulse.
Fun.

2263
02:03:19.730 --> 02:03:21.880
I always love the Internet for that road.

2264
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:27.050
Apparently North Korea has this nice test missiles for electromagnetic pulse

2265
02:03:27.051 --> 02:03:29.690
weapon,
these mother fuckers.

2266
02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.890
So the reason I know a lot about this stuff as you meet,
you know,

2267
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:36.950
these eccentric,
uh,
not a bad way,
but eccentric,
very brilliant,

2268
02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:41.600
very wealthy people and like they have a contingency for the contingency for the

2269
02:03:41.601 --> 02:03:45.730
contingency.
And this is something that's come up again and again and again.
Um,

2270
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:49.640
I can't take it that far for a host of reasons,
including financial,
but I'm like,

2271
02:03:49.641 --> 02:03:50.001
all right,

2272
02:03:50.001 --> 02:03:54.650
like maybe having some basic defense and food and water in place,

2273
02:03:54.710 --> 02:03:57.620
maybe not a bad idea if I'm going to live in San Francisco on the ring of fire

2274
02:03:57.621 --> 02:04:01.550
is crazy.
Just get the extended warranty.
To this.
Right.
Bomb is crazy.

2275
02:04:01.551 --> 02:04:02.384
Listen to this shit.

2276
02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.990
The field of modern warfares never cease to amaze me in amongst more interesting

2277
02:04:05.991 --> 02:04:09.200
weapons that I've read about.
Had to be the emp bomb,

2278
02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:12.770
which disables all forms of electronics,
was within the vicinity.

2279
02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:17.180
South Korea has just developed an advanced electromagnetic pulse device,

2280
02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:20.810
which is cable being deployed on the battlefield in order to make short work of

2281
02:04:20.811 --> 02:04:25.310
enemy computers according to the defense official.
Wow.
So they really can do it.

2282
02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:28.910
They've developed it.
That's insane.
Yeah,
very much so.

2283
02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:32.220
Wild stuff man.
It's wild world.
We live in and a,

2284
02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:36.530
I've gone from thinking that all of that was just conspiracy theory or people

2285
02:04:36.531 --> 02:04:38.910
with too much time on their hands to realizing that,
you know,

2286
02:04:38.911 --> 02:04:43.020
for a couple hundred bucks you can actually buy herself a lot of insurance

2287
02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:45.370
against worst case scenario.
So like I think,

2288
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:46.900
<v 4>do you like living in San Francisco?</v>

2289
02:04:46.901 --> 02:04:50.560
Cause that's a tricky town if you want to talk about disasters is that fucker

2290
02:04:50.561 --> 02:04:54.610
burns when earthquakes,
it burns.
Every house is connected.

2291
02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:58.490
<v 5>Yeah.
It's,
it's,
I'm,
I've positioned myself close,</v>

2292
02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:02.480
actually very close to one of the main freeways and,
uh,

2293
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:07.100
also very close to a large park,
but it is tricky,

2294
02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.200
tricky city.
Uh,
given the,

2295
02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:13.580
how things are architected and also just the geography of the city itself,

2296
02:05:13.581 --> 02:05:15.800
it's pretty hard to get out of.
So if you want,
if you have to get to,

2297
02:05:15.801 --> 02:05:20.180
let's say a private airport or an airstrip or something to get out of,

2298
02:05:20.181 --> 02:05:24.980
let's say California,
you have to plan ahead for that type of thing.
Uh,
the,

2299
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:26.390
but for me,
I mean,
San Francisco,

2300
02:05:26.391 --> 02:05:30.770
I've lived all over the place and I've been to so many countries,

2301
02:05:30.771 --> 02:05:35.120
35 or so countries.
Never thought I would land somewhere and say,

2302
02:05:35.121 --> 02:05:37.790
this is where I'm going to live.
I always thought it was six months,

2303
02:05:37.791 --> 02:05:41.480
six to 12 months.
I get bored.
Then I move on.
We may just stay in San Francisco.

2304
02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:46.970
The cock besides the Mitchell brothers.
Yeah.
Right.
Easy access.
A little orphan.

2305
02:05:46.971 --> 02:05:50.960
Andy's,
we need a,
yeah,
so that's strong weed.
I would say sharks.

2306
02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:55.190
Sharks.
I went to the Fairland islands once.
That's a fucking creepy story I saw.

2307
02:05:55.191 --> 02:06:00.070
Kill.
I saw like a 400 pound seal get hit on the water on the surface.
Yeah.

2308
02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:01.990
That was trippy before.
Great Way.
Yeah.

2309
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:04.560
Before getting into a cage and a lot of great whites out there,
man.

2310
02:06:04.561 --> 02:06:09.230
You know the tide ocean between Alcatraz in San Francisco.
Yeah.
It's Sharkey.
Uh,

2311
02:06:09.231 --> 02:06:11.120
but the Hia San Francisco,

2312
02:06:11.121 --> 02:06:14.510
it would be immediate access to beautiful nature everywhere.
Uh,

2313
02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:18.410
the startup seniors,
the creative vibe there is

2314
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:23.330
<v 4>to very intelligent city.
I recorded one of my cds there.
Shiny,
happy Jihad.</v>

2315
02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:25.790
I think it's my,
you know,
that's this one right?

2316
02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:27.570
Is that the current bout to blow up the thing.

2317
02:06:28.230 --> 02:06:31.070
It's one of my favorite cities of all time.
It's such a bright city.

2318
02:06:31.071 --> 02:06:35.540
They seem so more in tune and open minded.
Just on average.
You know,

2319
02:06:35.541 --> 02:06:40.080
I always said that a boulder is like a frozen San Francisco.
A little bit yellow.

2320
02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:42.140
Very similar.
Very similar.
Yeah.

2321
02:06:42.230 --> 02:06:46.760
And it's also an Austin is sort of like Justin's very similar to San Francisco.

2322
02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:49.520
Super similar.
Austin has its own vibe though.

2323
02:06:49.590 --> 02:06:52.050
<v 5>Yeah,
they have,
they've more barbecue,
more music.</v>

2324
02:06:52.051 --> 02:06:53.730
San Francisco has the food though.

2325
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:56.730
That's another reason I really love San Francisco is I,

2326
02:06:56.731 --> 02:06:58.980
the last stat I heard was something like,

2327
02:06:59.810 --> 02:07:03.050
so you have 800,000 people in San Francisco.
I think there are 4,000,
uh,

2328
02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:07.380
restaurants.
That's insane.
If you live in the city.
I live in the city,

2329
02:07:07.381 --> 02:07:10.200
but sort of down in the near the mission.

2330
02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:13.770
So I told you about living in northern California,
like a little further away,

2331
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:17.310
maybe even,
um,
in a wooded Carmel,

2332
02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:21.900
beautiful checkout Morin.
Morin County is gorgeous right over the golden gate.

2333
02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:26.010
It's beautiful.
Like Mill Valley.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Nice.

2334
02:07:26.011 --> 02:07:30.420
But with less people,
uh,
up in Marin and then you're close to San Francisco,

2335
02:07:30.421 --> 02:07:34.410
it's 15 minutes away.
And uh,
I mean,
mountain biking was created in Marin.

2336
02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:38.350
I beautiful if Mount Ham,
it's,
if I were to like,

2337
02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:41.650
when I get married and have kids,
uh,
or have kids,

2338
02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:42.790
I'm not sure about the married part,

2339
02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:47.800
then I can see Morin very clearly being a,
an awesome choice.

2340
02:07:47.850 --> 02:07:51.730
I really,
yeah,
it's beautiful.
I mean,
you've surfing,
you have everything,

2341
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:55.450
it's gorgeous and you're close to Tahoe.
You close to nappy or close to,
uh,

2342
02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:58.420
you have 70.
It's,
it's a,
it's a great look.

2343
02:07:58.490 --> 02:08:01.910
<v 0>It's amazing how some parts of the country actually geographically become</v>

2344
02:08:01.911 --> 02:08:05.210
awesome spots.
You know,
it's like,
it is not just a weather thing,

2345
02:08:05.211 --> 02:08:09.470
it's just like some,
some places are great spots,
you know,
I mean w w you know,

2346
02:08:09.471 --> 02:08:14.471
the factors that come into to making a Boston or a Seattle or as opposed to a

2347
02:08:14.661 --> 02:08:18.290
Paducah,
Kentucky or you know,
Wilmington Delaware or something.
You know,

2348
02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:23.680
it's interesting how some spots are just like way better places to live in San

2349
02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:27.500
Francisco for the,
as far as creativity and mind and thinking and people,

2350
02:08:27.501 --> 02:08:32.500
it's a great spot.
Great.
Like the spot defined interesting thinkers.

2351
02:08:32.630 --> 02:08:35.090
<v 5>It is.
And what I really like about it is,</v>

2352
02:08:35.091 --> 02:08:38.870
and it's not true for everybody of course,
but there's very much a,

2353
02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:43.580
don't judge a book by its cover via ethos because you just,

2354
02:08:43.581 --> 02:08:48.530
you don't know who the college kid is who's unemployed or the billionaire.

2355
02:08:48.531 --> 02:08:50.540
They could both be wearing the same thing.
You have no idea.

2356
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:54.410
And I remember at one point I went into best buy,

2357
02:08:54.411 --> 02:08:57.890
I remember to buy my first like real TV,
still have it.
This is,

2358
02:08:57.891 --> 02:09:00.800
I don't know if I 10 years ago.
So anyway guys,
I love it.
Anyway,

2359
02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:04.160
went in and the sales guy was great.
He's like,
come back in a couple of days,

2360
02:09:04.161 --> 02:09:06.580
this other managers,
terrible negotiator and get a better price.
It's like,

2361
02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:08.690
fantastic.
I love you already.
I'm going to buy a lot of stuff from you.

2362
02:09:08.691 --> 02:09:12.500
But he told me a story.
He said a lot of my uh,
you know,

2363
02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:14.560
he was African American and lived in East Palo Alto.

2364
02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.220
He said a lot of my coworkers,

2365
02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:18.530
they want to go for the guy in the suit and he's like,

2366
02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:23.560
I always want to go for like the slightly scraggly early forties white dude and

2367
02:09:24.291 --> 02:09:27.230
like the torn jeans and flip flops.
And he did that.
At one point they were like,

2368
02:09:27.231 --> 02:09:28.910
take back,
I,
we don't want him.
And so he took,

2369
02:09:28.911 --> 02:09:32.250
this guy ended up being the founder of Ikea and he's like,
yeah,

2370
02:09:32.251 --> 02:09:35.600
I'll get 10 of those flat screens,
I'll get 15 of those.

2371
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:40.130
And he was buying shit for the Ikea that Ge just opened next door.
And uh,

2372
02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:43.510
so this guy just,
you know,
I made,
he's quoted for the next decade as a whole,

2373
02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:47.210
is pretty awesome.
You still have this Sony Wagga because it weighs 5,000 pounds.

2374
02:09:47.211 --> 02:09:48.580
It's really,
I can't,
I can't,

2375
02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:51.830
I can't move the thing I got to work on my dead lift.
It's a bit,
well,

2376
02:09:51.831 --> 02:09:53.210
it's certainly not a flat screen.

2377
02:09:53.211 --> 02:09:58.211
I mean it's a flat front flap front and then it's just a cathode ray tube.

2378
02:09:58.851 --> 02:10:00.440
The thing is,
it's like a refrigerator.

2379
02:10:00.590 --> 02:10:04.370
I kept him a hold of mine probably like three years longer than I wanted to just

2380
02:10:04.371 --> 02:10:06.740
because every time I tried to move I'm like,
yeah,
I'm not going to,

2381
02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:09.230
I just can't get here.
Yeah.
So heavy.

2382
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:13.760
I remember watching hi death,
uh,

2383
02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:17.750
animal planet fish.
That was the fuck I brought it home.

2384
02:10:17.751 --> 02:10:20.330
I turned it on and I landed on that and I was just like,

2385
02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:23.900
I cannot fucking believe how worth it was.
How long was it?

2386
02:10:23.901 --> 02:10:26.910
It was to get HD for the underwater stuff.
Just blew my brands.

2387
02:10:27.170 --> 02:10:31.610
Ever watched that Earth series,
gorgeous planet earth.
Oh man,

2388
02:10:31.611 --> 02:10:35.990
fucking the breaching the great whites in South Africa.
Oh my Lord.

2389
02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:38.540
Great White.
Scare the fuck out of me,
man.

2390
02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:41.410
They've been spotting them out here at Malibu to really recently.

2391
02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:46.370
It spotted them from helicopters and people flying over.
They see,
they look down,

2392
02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:50.180
they see just big 1820 foot sharks.
That's no joke.
I was in,

2393
02:10:50.210 --> 02:10:53.810
I was in South Africa.
Check this out.
I'm so,
I love sharks.

2394
02:10:53.811 --> 02:10:56.900
I want to be a marine biologist for Longterm Merriam.
Sorry

2395
02:10:58.610 --> 02:11:02.600
if I find a hot enough,
great wine.
We went,

2396
02:11:02.601 --> 02:11:07.370
my brother and I went to this place called Fish Hook Hoek and my brother wanted

2397
02:11:07.371 --> 02:11:10.190
to surf and so we landed there.
It was really choppy.
The traffic was terrible.

2398
02:11:10.191 --> 02:11:12.200
We got there close to five o'clock.
The guys like,
guys,

2399
02:11:12.201 --> 02:11:15.170
we're about to shut up shop,
but if you really want to go out there,

2400
02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:18.020
it's pretty shitty conditions,
but I'll give you a board and give you a discount.

2401
02:11:18.021 --> 02:11:20.210
And I was like,
ah,
Tom,
I don't want to surf for 20 minutes.

2402
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:22.430
He really wanted to be argued.

2403
02:11:22.431 --> 02:11:26.300
And then eventually just went for a cup of coffee about,
uh,
20 minutes later,

2404
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:31.330
a guide down the beach got bitten in half in neck deep water by a 16 foot great

2405
02:11:32.211 --> 02:11:35.480
white shark.
What's even crazier is one of my,
uh,

2406
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:40.280
readers was the first guy to,
he tweeted it out,
he basically said,

2407
02:11:40.281 --> 02:11:43.430
holy fucking shit.
Just so like I get bitten in half by great white shark.

2408
02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:44.840
So you look down at your Twitter,

2409
02:11:44.841 --> 02:11:48.080
you see that and you realize that could have been,
you could have been me easily.

2410
02:11:48.081 --> 02:11:50.450
And found out later that the shark spotters at that beach,

2411
02:11:50.451 --> 02:11:53.810
they have guys with binoculars.
They'd spotted eight great whites at that beach.

2412
02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:58.210
Wow.
And,
and then people just go right back up.
They're like,
okay,
clear,
great.

2413
02:11:58.211 --> 02:12:01.960
And they go back out to surf and I fuck is wrong with you people.
I know.

2414
02:12:01.961 --> 02:12:04.430
Well that's good.
Is Surfing,
is it that good?
It is good.

2415
02:12:04.431 --> 02:12:07.820
But as far as I'm concerned,
not that good.
I mean in the sense that it's,

2416
02:12:07.821 --> 02:12:11.180
it's world class surfing,
but his world is surfing in any respect.

2417
02:12:11.181 --> 02:12:13.980
Worth better.
Yeah.

2418
02:12:14.210 --> 02:12:17.180
And it's only cold water though,
right?

2419
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:20.960
They can go there usually in temperature,
colder waters.

2420
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:23.870
Like in Brazil they surf a lot but they don't have to worry about sharks.

2421
02:12:23.871 --> 02:12:24.980
Right and well it depends on where you are.

2422
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:29.870
This place called hissy fit and Brazil where I went to visit at one point and

2423
02:12:29.871 --> 02:12:32.480
they have signs there that are fantastic,

2424
02:12:32.481 --> 02:12:36.620
but they used to have a meet candidate and not meet Ken and what was it?
Yeah,

2425
02:12:36.621 --> 02:12:40.460
like canneries right at this one delta where it opens up into the ocean.

2426
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:44.360
And so these bull sharks and he's like entire communities of bull sharks have

2427
02:12:44.361 --> 02:12:48.140
devolved there and they're very aggressive sharks and the signs on the beach,

2428
02:12:48.141 --> 02:12:50.990
if you see them in the u s usually it's like morning sharks.

2429
02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:55.120
Sharks have been spotted at this area.
Use Caution and talk to your lifeguard,

2430
02:12:55.130 --> 02:12:57.680
whatever.
And the signs in Brazil where like don't go in the water,

2431
02:12:57.681 --> 02:12:59.240
you'll get fucking attack basically.

2432
02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:04.390
And people still surf there and it's like Guy with one arm still surfing.

2433
02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:05.900
He's like,
well we're in their backyard.
And I'm like,

2434
02:13:05.901 --> 02:13:10.850
and maybe you should pick a different sport,
their backyard PA sharks.
To me,

2435
02:13:10.851 --> 02:13:14.370
I've always been one of those things where if they didn't exist and you had him

2436
02:13:14.371 --> 02:13:17.900
in a movie,
everybody would be fucking horrified of these things,

2437
02:13:18.050 --> 02:13:22.100
but because of the fact that they're real,
just like Komodo dragons are,

2438
02:13:22.101 --> 02:13:25.070
crocodiles are killer whales,
we just sleep on these things.

2439
02:13:25.071 --> 02:13:29.450
We don't realize how incredibly fascinating and horrifying they really,
oh yeah.

2440
02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:32.340
Well that's why I was telling you that fucking line attack video.

2441
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:35.000
<v 4>Shoot the shit I need because I just,
I think to myself,</v>

2442
02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:36.570
somebody was asking me at one point,
they're like,

2443
02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:39.960
you think you could kill this animal or that animal?
Like,
no,
like Badger,

2444
02:13:39.961 --> 02:13:41.670
that thing would fuck me.
I'm not going to kill a badger.

2445
02:13:41.671 --> 02:13:45.540
You crazy like do I don't have claws.
Like what do you think I'm going to do?

2446
02:13:45.541 --> 02:13:48.600
Let's have a weapon.
Like I kicked the fuck out of a badger.

2447
02:13:48.630 --> 02:13:51.690
I'll tell you that right now and you can give me some skilled steel toed boots

2448
02:13:51.691 --> 02:13:55.200
and a strong a Kevin or a pair of pants.
I'll fuck a badger up.

2449
02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:59.340
I'll stomp that little bitch.
If you have chain,
go after a lot of things.

2450
02:13:59.690 --> 02:14:03.420
If I had a good baseball bat and a steel tip,
boots a fuck up,

2451
02:14:03.421 --> 02:14:06.840
a Badger Lodo Dragon.
When you take a Komodo dragon on,
no,
you're fucked.

2452
02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:07.590
You're doomed.

2453
02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:09.810
There's nothing you can do because they're close enough to bite you.

2454
02:14:09.811 --> 02:14:11.640
That's your ass.
There's so fast.

2455
02:14:11.690 --> 02:14:15.760
It's so fast and they have botulism and they're fucking saliva.
Catch deer.

2456
02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:19.200
There's so fast.
It's hard.
It's hard to believe.
And when they bite things,

2457
02:14:19.201 --> 02:14:21.300
all they do is bite them and then follow them.

2458
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:26.390
They wait for the poison in their saliva to eventually just toxify their whole

2459
02:14:26.551 --> 02:14:30.000
body,
their body just,
it's just,
it's like there's their own soul.

2460
02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:35.670
The nasty bacteria in their mouth just fucks animals.
As soon as they bite them,

2461
02:14:35.671 --> 02:14:37.170
they,
they're like,
take a water buffalo.

2462
02:14:37.171 --> 02:14:41.310
They bite them and they follow him for 24 hours and then slowly he just buckles

2463
02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:45.990
and then they just eat his asshole while he's alive cause dig in and pull chunks

2464
02:14:45.991 --> 02:14:50.030
of amount.
Komodo dragons are terrifying.
Or do they live Komodo islands?

2465
02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:55.230
I've only one island in Indonesia.
There's a nutty animal man.

2466
02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:58.620
You know,
it's uh,
you see that crocodile,
they just caught in the Philippines.

2467
02:14:58.650 --> 02:15:00.540
Yeah,
I did.
Holy Shit.
And they're like,

2468
02:15:00.541 --> 02:15:04.020
this is going to be the star of our new zoo because it's the silk impoverished

2469
02:15:04.021 --> 02:15:05.440
Filipino feelings.
Yeah.

2470
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:08.610
I'd say normally set up a bunch of traps for this thing and it broke all their

2471
02:15:08.611 --> 02:15:10.830
traps and it killed a fisherman,
a local fishermen.

2472
02:15:11.070 --> 02:15:15.900
That thing is 21 feet long.
God dammit.

2473
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:19.530
How crazy these things,
crocodiles,
perfect example.

2474
02:15:19.531 --> 02:15:21.620
If they weren't real and then you know,

2475
02:15:21.630 --> 02:15:24.660
and there was stories of this thing that you know,

2476
02:15:24.661 --> 02:15:28.860
it can hold its breath for hours and water buffalo and he'd be like,

2477
02:15:28.861 --> 02:15:32.820
get the fuck out here.
That's how big that is.
It's looking at this room.

2478
02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.180
It's like from that,
that's insane.
Bigger than this room.
Yeah.
It's bigger than,

2479
02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:42.120
it's not a,
and it's not like a slender animal.
I mean the back is like this.

2480
02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:47.160
It's like up to naval height and they are all wrapped this fucking thing up.

2481
02:15:47.161 --> 02:15:51.930
All these little Lilliputians took this Gulliver travel fucking animal down and

2482
02:15:51.931 --> 02:15:54.360
tied it up and ropes and they were parading it around the town.

2483
02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:59.220
It's crazy to see,
man.
It's fucking monster.
Have you ever seen Hogzilla?

2484
02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:02.740
Yes.
Yes.
Shit.
If you ever seen it Brian.

2485
02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:04.440
It sounds familiar but I don't know.

2486
02:16:04.441 --> 02:16:07.950
Well in Georgia and a lot of farm the size of a Volkswagen beetle,

2487
02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:11.410
it's fucking cute.
It's a pig.
It's a super,
well,
it's,

2488
02:16:11.411 --> 02:16:14.280
it's a cross between a wild boar and uh,

2489
02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:18.150
a feral hog and pigs of,
a lot of people don't realize this,

2490
02:16:18.450 --> 02:16:22.360
but pigs are one of the strangest animals known to be in,

2491
02:16:22.361 --> 02:16:27.090
in captivity because when they get out,
they have a physiological change.

2492
02:16:27.091 --> 02:16:30.460
When they go into the wild,
as soon as you're not feeding them anymore,

2493
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:33.520
<v 0>they changed their appearance,
their tusks grow,</v>

2494
02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:37.450
their snout elongates and their hair gets shaggy and thick and it starts

2495
02:16:37.451 --> 02:16:41.260
happening three weeks after they come free.
Yeah.
That's like a whereabouts.

2496
02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:42.550
It is like a werewolf.

2497
02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:46.810
When you have that pig that's in your style and he's got white hair and he's all

2498
02:16:46.811 --> 02:16:50.710
cute and pink and he comes over and dozens against you and you could pat him on

2499
02:16:50.711 --> 02:16:54.250
the head and in Nice piggy,
piggy.
When that pig goes out into the woods,

2500
02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:58.270
his nose stretches out,
his hair gets furry and its fangs grow.

2501
02:16:58.300 --> 02:17:02.050
That's fucking terrible.
It could be a grown pig,
it can be a fully grown pig,

2502
02:17:02.051 --> 02:17:05.050
but once it gets out into the wild,
there's a physiological change.

2503
02:17:05.051 --> 02:17:08.800
When they become feral.
It's very interesting.
They're domesticated versions.

2504
02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:14.020
They have a change of,
uh,
there were actual appearance,
biology changes.

2505
02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:15.580
It's pretty trippy,
man.

2506
02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:19.510
<v 5>You know that.
A random side note,
but a auxiliary,</v>

2507
02:17:19.570 --> 02:17:22.940
and I'm putting it up right now.
Have you?
We didn't explain what it is.

2508
02:17:23.410 --> 02:17:27.980
It's showed it.
Yeah,
it's amazing.
Shot the,
have you ever read born to run?

2509
02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:29.360
No.
Really good book.

2510
02:17:29.361 --> 02:17:33.320
But it talks about of the evolution of mankind and there are a lot of theories,

2511
02:17:33.321 --> 02:17:34.220
but they,
they,

2512
02:17:34.850 --> 02:17:38.780
one of the theories is that part of the reason we evolved and were able to kill

2513
02:17:38.781 --> 02:17:42.040
animals that provided more protein,
which led to a larger brain,
et Cetera,

2514
02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:46.400
is one is a bigger one than that is one where the guy standing with a rifle is

2515
02:17:46.401 --> 02:17:51.020
that we could run on two legs while keeping our heads steady.

2516
02:17:51.021 --> 02:17:52.990
And it's because of this,

2517
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.610
like I think it's a nuchal ligament at the base of the skull,

2518
02:17:55.611 --> 02:17:58.490
which is unique to humans.
And if you look at a pig for example,

2519
02:17:58.491 --> 02:18:00.710
when it runs a ted,
Bob's all over the place,

2520
02:18:00.711 --> 02:18:05.711
like a bobble head and then that they know hominids or Homo sapiens develop that

2521
02:18:06.591 --> 02:18:08.780
nuchal ligament that allowed them to like endurance,

2522
02:18:08.781 --> 02:18:12.410
run after animals and kill and secure more protein,

2523
02:18:13.430 --> 02:18:16.540
pretty well supported or Ron is a great book,
highly recommend it.

2524
02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:19.780
<v 0>It's fascinating to me when they try to go back in time,</v>

2525
02:18:19.781 --> 02:18:24.530
like they'd recently found some,
uh,
pro hominid skeletons that were one point

2526
02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:31.490
like the,
the,
the,
the whole,
uh,
origin of the species into question.

2527
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:35.240
It's fascinating to me when they just go back in time and discover these things,

2528
02:18:35.241 --> 02:18:38.830
like top of those little hobbit people that they've recently found like that

2529
02:18:38.930 --> 02:18:42.140
existed as recently as like 15,
20,000 years ago.

2530
02:18:42.141 --> 02:18:46.190
There's a little tiny three foot tall hobbit,
like people,
I love this stuff.

2531
02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:50.330
I love when they don't know and then all of a sudden some new thing comes up and

2532
02:18:50.331 --> 02:18:54.430
then go,
oh,
whoa.
There,
I guess there were using tools a million years ago.
Yeah.

2533
02:18:54.690 --> 02:18:58.190
Like fuck.
And I like that.
Oh,
I guess they were domesticating livestock.

2534
02:18:58.191 --> 02:19:00.350
Here's the thing.
They figured out recently in Saudi Arabia,

2535
02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:05.530
they've found clear evidence of the domestication of horses 6,000 years early

2536
02:19:06.391 --> 02:19:10.580
and they previously thought people were doing it.
So now they're like,
holy fuck.

2537
02:19:10.610 --> 02:19:15.310
Like,
you know,
you've heard of disco Beckley tappy have you heard of this?
No.

2538
02:19:15.350 --> 02:19:19.360
Well,
it's,
this is a site.
It's a site in Turkey.
Oh,
I have heard of that.
Yeah.

2539
02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:22.850
Yeah.
I don't know the details,
but I recognize the archeological discoveries,

2540
02:19:22.851 --> 02:19:26.000
1520 foot high pillars of,
of,
of a,

2541
02:19:26.001 --> 02:19:27.920
of stone been carved

2542
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:32.360
<v 4>along with animals that aren't even living on this continent.</v>

2543
02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:35.540
So they're like,
what the fuck,
man,
these animals aren't even from here.

2544
02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:38.500
How the hell are these guys?
Yeah.
Why are these on these things?
What,

2545
02:19:38.501 --> 02:19:43.370
what is this 12,000 year old complex structure that we find and there's still an

2546
02:19:43.371 --> 02:19:46.880
earthing and they discovered it in the 90s and they'd been slit,
like a farmer,

2547
02:19:46.881 --> 02:19:49.910
like stumbled upon this thing and then started digging.
It was like,

2548
02:19:49.911 --> 02:19:50.661
what the fuck is this?

2549
02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:54.710
And then he realizes that giant stone pillar and this whole community had been

2550
02:19:54.770 --> 02:19:56.600
on purpose.
Someone had buried it.

2551
02:19:57.330 --> 02:20:00.560
It's almost like they made a little time capsule and they covered it.

2552
02:20:00.561 --> 02:20:04.390
They're pretty positive that it was a manmade act of,

2553
02:20:04.391 --> 02:20:06.010
of covering it and that they,

2554
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:10.100
someone covered it thousands and thousands of years ago and they just luckily

2555
02:20:10.101 --> 02:20:11.300
stumbled upon it.

2556
02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:15.650
So while it's amazing the stuff that blows my mind too was thinking of the

2557
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:17.450
actual mechanics,

2558
02:20:17.451 --> 02:20:22.400
like the mechanical engineering that someone would have to use to put up these

2559
02:20:22.401 --> 02:20:26.860
pillars or like Stonehenge or things like that.
It's like how the fuck?
Well,

2560
02:20:26.861 --> 02:20:30.230
even how about stone management used?
We don't understand who made Stonehenge,

2561
02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:34.130
but we don't know who made Egypt.
We know these are,
these are the people.

2562
02:20:34.131 --> 02:20:37.910
This is the writing.
How'd they get that obelisk up there?
What the fuck ban?

2563
02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:40.040
We know those people did it.
It's written.

2564
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:42.680
It has all of their language from the top to the bottom.

2565
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:45.320
It's all written in there.
Hieroglyphs so what the fuck,
man?

2566
02:20:45.321 --> 02:20:48.110
How did you do that while things enormous.

2567
02:20:48.111 --> 02:20:50.390
Some of those perfectly cut obelisks.

2568
02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:54.380
Those are almost as fascinating to me is the pyramid because the pyramid,
yeah,

2569
02:20:54.381 --> 02:20:57.740
the stones are all big,
but you know,
did you push it in place?

2570
02:20:57.741 --> 02:21:00.920
It's all a matter of how did you play?
It was just one stone.
I'd be like,

2571
02:21:00.921 --> 02:21:03.500
that's not that big of a deal.
And so you moved one stone.

2572
02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:06.470
It's the fact that he moved 2 million,
300,000 of that makes me,

2573
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:10.880
it makes you think that's amazing,
but the obelisks just one,
just one of them.

2574
02:21:10.881 --> 02:21:12.560
You're like,
what the fuck?
How did you do that?

2575
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:16.430
How the fuck did you make that giant stone thing with all the carving,

2576
02:21:16.431 --> 02:21:21.140
50 fucking feet tall men at a one piece of stone,
Jesus Christ.

2577
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:26.210
Some of those amazing structures of Pharaohs that are like 2030 feet high and

2578
02:21:26.211 --> 02:21:31.070
you're looking at them,
you're like,
who the hell what the fuck?
5,000 years ago,

2579
02:21:31.071 --> 02:21:34.750
6,000 years ago they were doing this.
The ones that blew my mind too,

2580
02:21:34.751 --> 02:21:38.840
or the aqua ducts that were made in Roman times.
It's still work

2581
02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:44.120
as nuts.
Human Ingenuity,
man.
Do you subscribe to the idea,

2582
02:21:44.121 --> 02:21:47.990
and this is a reoccurring subject on this podcast that humanity has gone through

2583
02:21:47.991 --> 02:21:48.870
cycles of,

2584
02:21:48.871 --> 02:21:53.150
of like really high levels of understanding and knowledge and then cataclysmic

2585
02:21:53.151 --> 02:21:56.750
disaster or human based disaster.
Oh,
for sure.
You think so?
Oh yeah.
I mean,

2586
02:21:56.751 --> 02:21:58.790
I think if you look at the Roman empire and you look at the,

2587
02:21:58.791 --> 02:22:03.410
the growth and decline of the US empire,
it's parallel after parallel,

2588
02:22:03.411 --> 02:22:08.411
after parallel distributing military is one of the first symptoms of like

2589
02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:14.480
proceeding the decline.
I think point for point.
You can look at these,

2590
02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:19.280
these meteoric rises and then catastrophic,
uh,
false.
And it's just like a pulse.

2591
02:22:19.310 --> 02:22:21.170
It's like a breathing in and breathing out.

2592
02:22:21.450 --> 02:22:26.070
It is a complicated cycle and it's almost inevitable.
I mean I've,

2593
02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:29.870
<v 0>but is it always because of,
you know,
obviously,
right,</v>

2594
02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:31.550
right now in the stage we're at with,
you know,

2595
02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:34.280
we talk about military talk about depletion of the resources,

2596
02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:38.870
the polluting the planet.
This is almost all active things that we can control.

2597
02:22:38.930 --> 02:22:42.170
But what about giant things that happened shifting of the polarized caps,

2598
02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:47.570
asteroid impact,
things along those lines that very likely have had,

2599
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:48.531
we believe,

2600
02:22:48.531 --> 02:22:53.531
at least I think they think five mass extinctions in the history of the planet.

2601
02:22:54.260 --> 02:22:56.690
And who knows how many little baby ones along the way.

2602
02:22:56.691 --> 02:23:00.500
Like that one that you drive to Nevada and you see that mile wide crater,

2603
02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:03.320
that's like nothing.
Oh,
it's only a mile.
You know,

2604
02:23:03.321 --> 02:23:06.080
it was probably only like 15 feet long,
but meanwhile,

2605
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:10.310
everything from miles around near that thing was dead instantly,
you know?
I mean,

2606
02:23:10.311 --> 02:23:13.700
how many of those hit all over the place and we were just not aware of because

2607
02:23:13.701 --> 02:23:17.840
it was 10,000 years ago and now it's covered in jungle wherever the impact was.

2608
02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:21.050
<v 2>So yeah.
You know,
I mean if we're having trouble tracking the,</v>

2609
02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:25.070
the evolution of our own species,
yeah,
yeah.
The amount of,

2610
02:23:25.700 --> 02:23:30.530
I think the limits of our knowledge of this planner are so incredibly vast,

2611
02:23:30.531 --> 02:23:34.490
you know,
to think that I,
I think there are also very natural cycles.

2612
02:23:34.491 --> 02:23:36.380
If you look at just population growth,
for example,

2613
02:23:36.381 --> 02:23:40.430
you look at elderly economies and how that affects their rise and decline in

2614
02:23:40.431 --> 02:23:44.570
Japan,
uh,
negative growth rates,
places like in certain countries in Europe,

2615
02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:50.150
uh,
you can just predict this stuff like in a 10,
20 years out.
And,

2616
02:23:50.180 --> 02:23:51.013
uh,

2617
02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:55.820
but I think that things grow and then they die.

2618
02:23:55.970 --> 02:23:58.490
That's just the cycle.
And you can apply that to people.

2619
02:23:58.491 --> 02:24:01.190
You could apply it to just about any life form.

2620
02:24:01.191 --> 02:24:05.750
You can also apply it to a companies.
You can apply it to countries.

2621
02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:07.620
<v 0>If you had to extrapolate,
okay,</v>

2622
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:12.300
what we know now is that we had a bunch of disenfranchise Europeans and various

2623
02:24:12.301 --> 02:24:13.440
people from all over the world.

2624
02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:17.400
They found this spot that just 10,000 years ago it had been covered with a mile

2625
02:24:17.401 --> 02:24:20.790
high sheet of ice.
You know,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the climate shifts.

2626
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:24.900
All of a sudden North America becomes viable property.
Everybody moves here.

2627
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:28.350
We established this new sort of a civilization.
The,

2628
02:24:28.351 --> 02:24:33.351
the what we believe is the most advanced or the percolating at the highest

2629
02:24:33.841 --> 02:24:34.890
levels.
You know,

2630
02:24:34.891 --> 02:24:39.891
when it comes to a military and money and economy and you know,

2631
02:24:40.201 --> 02:24:43.560
and creativity.
This one pile called the United States.

2632
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:47.280
If you had to extrapolate and look at the trends and look at what's next,

2633
02:24:47.310 --> 02:24:48.240
what do you think could be nice?

2634
02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:54.250
Cause I mean this is a place that was created just a few lifetimes ago.

2635
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:57.700
Really the 17 hundreds in the,
in the course of human history.

2636
02:24:57.910 --> 02:25:00.700
It's a very small amount of time.
The course of the history of the world,

2637
02:25:00.701 --> 02:25:03.910
it's merely a blink of an eye.
It's nothing.
But in that time,

2638
02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:08.800
this new type of civilization,
supposedly new type of really bullshit at the end.

2639
02:25:09.010 --> 02:25:11.260
I mean it becomes just as corrupt as all the other ones before,

2640
02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:15.640
but the idea of it,
this was the first,
this was the first in history like this.

2641
02:25:15.850 --> 02:25:19.330
You know that people like,
fuck where you're at,
getting a boat.
Come on over here.

2642
02:25:19.331 --> 02:25:20.320
We got a new spot.

2643
02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:23.800
We're just going to get away from those douchebags and we're going to try our

2644
02:25:23.801 --> 02:25:26.680
own thing out.
Is it possible that that could happen again?

2645
02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:31.800
Is it possible that you know some other spot opens up and people decide to do

2646
02:25:32.261 --> 02:25:34.390
this one more time?
I mean,
I can't imagine it,

2647
02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:39.630
but I do imagine it sometimes when when Bush won the second term in 2004 I'd

2648
02:25:39.631 --> 02:25:42.900
fucking seriously thought about moving to Canada.
I really dead.
I was like this,

2649
02:25:42.910 --> 02:25:44.290
this place is going to get blown up.

2650
02:25:44.291 --> 02:25:48.490
This crazy assholes invading all of these countries when on dubious evidence and

2651
02:25:48.491 --> 02:25:51.760
it turns out they lied about a bunch of different shit and weapons of mass

2652
02:25:51.761 --> 02:25:53.770
destruction from the moment they got in.

2653
02:25:53.771 --> 02:25:57.550
There was an idea to go over there and this was just what they could find a fit

2654
02:25:57.551 --> 02:26:02.140
their agenda and they shove all the facts and pseudo facts into one situation

2655
02:26:02.141 --> 02:26:04.750
just so they can force this on people.
I was like,
we're going to get blown up.

2656
02:26:04.751 --> 02:26:06.670
I don't want to get blown up.
I'm gonna fucking go to Canada.

2657
02:26:06.671 --> 02:26:07.810
Were nobody fucks with anybody.

2658
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:11.140
<v 2>Yeah.
I think that a lot of people,
for example,</v>

2659
02:26:11.141 --> 02:26:12.850
are concerned about China and India.

2660
02:26:12.851 --> 02:26:16.540
So it's sort of like China versus the US and that doesn't scare me.

2661
02:26:16.541 --> 02:26:19.330
I'm actually very bearish on China.

2662
02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:21.640
But I think the what,

2663
02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:26.760
what is not obvious to most people is that at the highest levels of government,

2664
02:26:26.831 --> 02:26:27.850
private enterprise,

2665
02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:33.360
you have this military industrial industrial complex that spans across these

2666
02:26:33.881 --> 02:26:36.610
countries.
And uh,
that's the stuff that really scares me.

2667
02:26:36.611 --> 02:26:40.390
And having centralized food production that scares me.

2668
02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.670
<v 0>What does it scare me about China is China's not trying to conquer the world</v>

2669
02:26:43.671 --> 02:26:45.740
you're trying to do business,
you know?
Yeah.

2670
02:26:45.741 --> 02:26:48.050
I think they're doing some fucked up things to some of their towns.

2671
02:26:48.051 --> 02:26:52.680
As far as pollution.
China has some of the worst standards of still,
I mean,

2672
02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:53.780
it's horrible ceremony.

2673
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:58.160
I've seen there's a video online of one city in China that you live there and

2674
02:26:58.161 --> 02:27:01.640
it's like through smoking three packs of cigarettes a day.
It's incredible.

2675
02:27:01.641 --> 02:27:05.150
They had cameras,
I believe it was one of those vice guide to TVS.

2676
02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:09.260
I think it was a vbs.tv doc.
And they went there and they were filming the,
the,

2677
02:27:09.290 --> 02:27:12.290
the air and you're looking up,
you're like,
oh my God,
this is impossible.

2678
02:27:12.291 --> 02:27:15.540
These people are breathing coal.
They're just breathing in colon the air.

2679
02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:19.310
But China's not trying to conquer the world.
They're just trying to make money.

2680
02:27:19.430 --> 02:27:20.570
You know,
they're trying to

2681
02:27:21.050 --> 02:27:24.440
<v 2>be very well positioned if they do want to conquer the world because what</v>

2682
02:27:24.441 --> 02:27:27.970
they've been doing.
I mean,
I was living in Argentina for a bit and then I was uh,

2683
02:27:28.270 --> 02:27:32.120
uh,
in Africa,
uh,
Kenya for the first time.
And they're buying,

2684
02:27:32.121 --> 02:27:36.380
they're very smart about acquiring resources and pipelines for petroleum and

2685
02:27:36.381 --> 02:27:41.240
also buying,
uh,
mine's four productions of production of things like copper.

2686
02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:45.530
They've been absolutely brilliant.
Um,
you go to places like Argentina,

2687
02:27:45.531 --> 02:27:45.950
which is the,

2688
02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:48.770
I think it's the eighth largest country in the world and that because of the

2689
02:27:48.771 --> 02:27:51.950
range from tropics,
like equals who falls in Brazil,

2690
02:27:51.951 --> 02:27:55.490
which borders Argentina all the way down to Antarctica.
They're very rich,

2691
02:27:55.491 --> 02:27:59.330
natural resources and you go there and in all the major cities you have like the

2692
02:27:59.331 --> 02:28:02.060
Chinese trade pro us nowhere to be found.

2693
02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:05.570
Then you go to Kenya and you look around like everything being built Chinese.

2694
02:28:05.571 --> 02:28:10.340
And it's,
uh,
it had been very smart about it.
And I think that that also,

2695
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:12.280
maybe we're digressing a little bit,
but that's okay.

2696
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:17.780
Is there is a benefit at times two very clear hierarchy.
And,

2697
02:28:17.810 --> 02:28:22.220
uh,
and having that top down type of,
I think that

2698
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:28.640
<v 4>democracy does have weaknesses and one of them is oftentimes speed.</v>

2699
02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:32.900
So in an accelerating world,
Mussington democracy is a bad thing.

2700
02:28:32.901 --> 02:28:35.030
I think it's the,
you know,
one of the better systems we have,

2701
02:28:35.031 --> 02:28:38.610
but it's very hard to compete with a,
with a single vision.
Yeah.

2702
02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:43.100
With a sort of unified top down capitalists,

2703
02:28:43.101 --> 02:28:46.250
dictatorship.
I mean like they want to change something great like five guys,

2704
02:28:46.430 --> 02:28:49.820
snap their fingers and make it happen.
It doesn't have to go through the house,

2705
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:51.090
doesn't then have to go through the Senate.

2706
02:28:51.091 --> 02:28:53.900
It doesn't have to sit around and have these lobbyists fuck with it and so forth

2707
02:28:53.901 --> 02:28:55.910
and so on.
And I think there are pros and cons,

2708
02:28:55.911 --> 02:28:58.010
but there's certainly a lot faster.
You,

2709
02:28:58.011 --> 02:29:00.380
the system that we have in place obviously is a fucking mess.

2710
02:29:00.381 --> 02:29:02.240
I just don't know how anybody would ever replace it.

2711
02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:03.530
And we had a guy here the other day,

2712
02:29:03.531 --> 02:29:08.531
Pinchbeck also believed that society is going to collapse 100% he believes that.

2713
02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:11.330
What does it look like when that happened?
That's what I said.
First of all,

2714
02:29:11.331 --> 02:29:14.120
I said,
how do you,
how can you say anything's going to happen?

2715
02:29:14.121 --> 02:29:17.660
100% that's one of the most silly things you could ever say because how do you

2716
02:29:17.661 --> 02:29:19.730
know that you're fucking head's not going to explode right there while we're

2717
02:29:19.731 --> 02:29:22.160
talking.
You can have an aneurysm.
Nobody knows they're coming,
you know,

2718
02:29:22.161 --> 02:29:24.800
they just happen.
How do you know that we're not going to get hit by a meteor?

2719
02:29:24.801 --> 02:29:28.960
How do we know that a comment's not going to fucking push earth off its axis too

2720
02:29:28.970 --> 02:29:31.820
far from the sun?
We all fucking freeze to death like shit.

2721
02:29:31.821 --> 02:29:34.310
Like this happens in the solar system.
You know,
it happens all the time.

2722
02:29:34.370 --> 02:29:36.290
All the time.
Planets hit other planets.

2723
02:29:36.291 --> 02:29:38.640
Galaxies collide with other galaxies and the fuck.

2724
02:29:38.641 --> 02:29:42.290
Can you tell him he societies 100% gonna collapse.
I mean that seems just,

2725
02:29:42.530 --> 02:29:46.310
that seems like really silly.
I don't think that's even close to the case.

2726
02:29:46.311 --> 02:29:47.930
I don't think society has to collapse.

2727
02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:51.470
I just think it's not going to stay this way.
I think that's pretty obvious.

2728
02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:53.810
It's changing.
It's moving.
It's not going to stay this way.

2729
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:57.890
People are obviously fed up with the financial system that we have in place

2730
02:29:57.891 --> 02:30:01.550
right now,
but what are they doing about it?
What can be done?

2731
02:30:01.551 --> 02:30:05.450
What's the substitution they suggest?
Yeah,
I,
it's,

2732
02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:10.560
there's another book that was recommended to me by a guy named Matt Mullen way

2733
02:30:10.561 --> 02:30:13.730
could develop,
he was one of the lead developers.
It was his name again.

2734
02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:17.990
Matt Mullenweg.
Matt Mullenweg.
Yeah,
a really smart guy.

2735
02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:21.320
And he introduced me to the Black Swan by Nassim Taleb,

2736
02:30:21.350 --> 02:30:26.350
which is really about rare events and how poor humans are at predicting or even

2737
02:30:26.541 --> 02:30:28.700
planning for rare events.
It's a great book though.

2738
02:30:28.701 --> 02:30:32.560
It's like a guide to critical thinking.
It's awesome.
But uh,

2739
02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:35.780
so the analogy that he uses in that book is,
you know,
thanks.

2740
02:30:35.810 --> 02:30:39.080
Just because the thanksgiving Turkey hasn't been killed for 200 days doesn't

2741
02:30:39.081 --> 02:30:42.830
mean it's not going to get killed.
Whereas we always do this financial markets,

2742
02:30:42.831 --> 02:30:44.450
relationships,
whatever it might be,
it would be like,
well,

2743
02:30:44.451 --> 02:30:48.320
it hasn't happened so far,
so it can't happen.
I to,
I call it the ant hill effect.

2744
02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:50.120
This is my,
my analogy.

2745
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:53.120
I say when you see an ant hill is sitting out in the field and ant hill might've

2746
02:30:53.121 --> 02:30:54.290
been there for a year,

2747
02:30:54.620 --> 02:30:59.180
those ants might've been patiently constructing this giant mound and there's a

2748
02:30:59.181 --> 02:31:00.140
million ants in.

2749
02:31:00.141 --> 02:31:03.530
They're going to work every single day and every day that they've been alive,

2750
02:31:03.531 --> 02:31:04.640
that ant hills been there.

2751
02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:08.150
But one day there's a little fat kid in the field and he sees that ant hill and

2752
02:31:08.151 --> 02:31:11.900
he stomps the fucking shit out of it and not a single aunt ever sees him comment

2753
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:14.990
and he's just sitting there hitting it with sticks.
He poured gasoline on it,

2754
02:31:14.991 --> 02:31:18.710
he lights it on fire,
he shits on it.
He pisses on it.
And why?

2755
02:31:18.730 --> 02:31:20.070
Because he could cause he wanted to.

2756
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.430
<v 0>And that could have happened any day.
That's the universe.</v>

2757
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:26.430
The universe is a fat kid stomping and shitting on your handheld.

2758
02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:32.850
I mean really,
that's what it is,
right?

2759
02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:36.570
It all can happen at any moment.
Yellowstone is my number one freak out.

2760
02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.680
You know the super volcano,
you don't know.
No son.

2761
02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:46.140
The Caldera volcano that is 300 kilometers wide it Dave,

2762
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:49.550
Dave is.
It's yellow stone itself.
It's in Yellowstone.

2763
02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:53.880
They did not know that Yellowstone was a giant volcano,

2764
02:31:53.881 --> 02:31:54.900
a super volcano,

2765
02:31:54.901 --> 02:31:59.130
one of the ones that they call it an extinction event because it'll kill almost

2766
02:31:59.131 --> 02:32:02.730
everything on the continent every six to 800,000 years.
Wow.

2767
02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:06.990
The last time it happened was 600,000 years ago.
Oops.
So we're literally do,

2768
02:32:07.050 --> 02:32:10.230
and they have thousands of earthquakes in Yellowstone every year.

2769
02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:13.890
Literally thousands of earthquakes.
And what Yellowstone is,

2770
02:32:13.891 --> 02:32:17.670
is a gigantic super volcano when it called Dara volcano is,

2771
02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:20.250
it's a volcano that builds up and when it explodes,

2772
02:32:20.251 --> 02:32:25.251
it's so violent that it literally blows the top off and just becomes a flat

2773
02:32:25.321 --> 02:32:28.950
crater.
Like there's nothing,
just the entire volcano explodes.

2774
02:32:28.951 --> 02:32:33.360
The whole thing shoots up into the fucking sky and everyone dies.
You just,

2775
02:32:33.361 --> 02:32:36.750
it just fucks everything up.
And they realize that this happens is,
like I said,

2776
02:32:36.751 --> 02:32:41.730
every supposedly six to 800,000 years is a major eruption that just fucking

2777
02:32:41.731 --> 02:32:45.200
blows up and kills everything.
My banking on retirement 40 years,
you know,

2778
02:32:45.210 --> 02:32:46.620
it's not a good idea.
So you just never know.

2779
02:32:46.621 --> 02:32:48.960
One called there is going to fucking hate you.
In closing,

2780
02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:51.850
what advice would you give people if you know what,

2781
02:32:51.851 --> 02:32:54.320
what is the best advice that you can give someone to,

2782
02:32:54.470 --> 02:32:57.540
to live a fun and productive life?

2783
02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:01.050
<v 2>I actually do another recommendation.</v>

2784
02:33:01.051 --> 02:33:05.520
I would say you need to train yourself to recognize what's in your control out

2785
02:33:05.521 --> 02:33:09.690
of your control and then not emotionally over respond to things outside of your

2786
02:33:09.691 --> 02:33:11.940
control.
The best guide to that that I've ever found,

2787
02:33:11.950 --> 02:33:15.990
his letters from a stoic written by Seneca,
it's written 2000 years ago.

2788
02:33:15.991 --> 02:33:17.130
It's a series of letters,

2789
02:33:17.131 --> 02:33:21.660
short letters from Seneca was the most successful playwright investment banker,

2790
02:33:21.661 --> 02:33:25.470
advisor to the emperor as well as a philosopher of his day.

2791
02:33:25.900 --> 02:33:30.180
And it could just as easily apply today.
So I would say that would be,

2792
02:33:30.181 --> 02:33:31.890
it's a short book.
That would be my recommendation.

2793
02:33:32.210 --> 02:33:33.070
<v 0>Well,
my,
uh,</v>

2794
02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:38.260
favorite things are reading inspirational books and blog entries and listening

2795
02:33:39.141 --> 02:33:42.800
to books on taste by people who have done what you've done,

2796
02:33:42.801 --> 02:33:47.540
spent a lot of time breaking things down and there's so much insight that people

2797
02:33:47.541 --> 02:33:51.490
can get from your books from four hour workweek and the four hour body and the,

2798
02:33:51.491 --> 02:33:54.700
the videos that you put online.
I think you're doing an awesome thing man.
And,

2799
02:33:54.701 --> 02:33:57.560
and anybody who does things along these lines,
you're,

2800
02:33:57.561 --> 02:34:00.360
you're putting out all this information and you're,

2801
02:34:00.370 --> 02:34:05.180
you're affecting the way people think and process information and it's awesome,

2802
02:34:05.181 --> 02:34:07.910
man.
I think it's a great thing.
And uh,
thanks for being on,
man.

2803
02:34:07.911 --> 02:34:10.400
It was really cool.
Really loved talking to you.
I'd love to have you on again.

2804
02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:11.330
Yeah,

2805
02:34:11.331 --> 02:34:15.110

2808
02:34:22.390 --> 02:34:25.360
And the upcoming dates that we've got going on,

2809
02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:29.350
I'm going to be in New Orleans at September 16th.

2810
02:34:29.351 --> 02:34:33.820
It's almost sold out Denver,

2811
02:34:33.821 --> 02:34:37.120

That's almost sold out too.
That's at the paramount theater.

2812
02:34:37.121 --> 02:34:40.420
That's a big place.
And that's what Joey Diaz and Ari should fear.

2813
02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:44.650
And then we're going to do a Washington DC,
