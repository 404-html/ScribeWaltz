<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I waiting a good day.</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't find it.</v>

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Shoot when I don't have my own ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>skates.</v>

7
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 2>So I have to rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ice Skates is for the same reason why I</v>

8
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 2>couldn't for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can rent.</v>

9
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Those are fucking shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's not even just that my feet are</v>

10
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 2>too wide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I had a regular size 11,</v>

11
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.340
<v Speaker 2>my feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have someone in my background fucked a</v>

12
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>monkey when it was big fucking big foot</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time ago.</v>

13
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Like when you shouldn't be able to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys anymore.</v>

14
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Someone just went back in for one more</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot,</v>

15
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 2>fucked a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guaranteed.</v>

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 2>It was like the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like last call evolution last car and</v>

17
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 2>one of my ancestors just snuck back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and got one more nut off.</v>

18
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my feet are just too wide so I get</v>

19
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 2>in those things.</v>

20
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm just in agony and I just never</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned how.</v>

21
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not gonna I'm not interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough for me to go out and buy ice</v>

22
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 2>skates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know it felt like this is it.</v>

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just something I have to conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I would have to learn how to ice</v>

24
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 2>skate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was much more exciting as a youth.</v>

25
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking roller.</v>

26
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Not Roller blading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking ice skating to green day shit</v>

27
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

28
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They play loud music and you spin around</v>

29
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 2>the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

30
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I guess hockey would be the reason to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

31
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Like if you wanted to learn how to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>hockey,</v>

32
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 2>you pretend you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing hockey moves and like</v>

33
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 2>you're on the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snowing.</v>

34
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 2>When you stop and you throw the snow of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know the right.</v>

35
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a cool move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were the hockey skates.</v>

37
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 2>You definitely don't wear the figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>skating ones.</v>

38
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 2>No chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

39
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

40
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the spikes in the front,</v>

41
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 2>so you could do the triple toe Lutz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want anybody to know what you</v>

42
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 2>don't want anybody seeing your spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

43
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to.</v>

44
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 2>When you go straight you have to lift it</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit and you're going to fall on</v>

45
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 2>your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hockey is a little curvature,</v>

46
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 2>like a running shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just allows you to maneuver,</v>

47
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 2>to dice so it allows you to maneuver</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

48
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't allow you to do tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't do.</v>

49
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't do a stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then triple toe alerts or Lego Scott</v>

50
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton flip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are they doing flips and when they do</v>

51
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 2>those spins on the ice they do on them</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like special skates?</v>

52
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Is that what the deal is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

53
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Brian Channel</v>

54
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>and I've noticed with archery my ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when I will have me shoot the Arrow</v>

55
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and the exact same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm still off the fucking</v>

56
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:33.530
<v Speaker 1>target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:34.161
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say no,</v>

58
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:34.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

59
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you were right or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the brain works.</v>

60
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Like it felt right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep doing it.</v>

61
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

62
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.610
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the feedback from the</v>

63
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:44.391
<v Speaker 1>universe like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

64
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:46.460
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take that approach to bud fucking</v>

65
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:51.461
<v Speaker 1>ever hurt somebody or hurt somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stops screaming.</v>

66
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

68
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>But think of it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I certainly am in my life,</v>

69
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.410
<v Speaker 1>have erred by choosing my instinct over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feedback I'm getting from the</v>

70
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:06.971
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>this is like that book that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced me to,</v>

72
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>which I war of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

73
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the book of five rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

74
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the real one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one that talks about how uh,</v>

75
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you should just learn anything like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get good at anything.</v>

76
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting good at it because if you</v>

77
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>understand how to get good at this one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

78
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>you can extrapolate from that how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at almost anything.</v>

79
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>There's these recurring patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

80
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And so with archery it's really cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to find these.</v>

81
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to keep all these variables the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same no matter what your environment,</v>

82
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>if you can learn to keep these variables</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

83
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>If you're on a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distance in wind,</v>

84
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can learn how to hold these</v>

85
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>variables the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the anchor point,</v>

86
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>the way your arm holds the bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you pull the Arrow back,</v>

87
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>the way you release the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these pieces in there.</v>

88
00:03:55.541 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>And if you can keep all of those the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same or close to the same with</v>

89
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>adjustments based on whatever your</v>
<v Speaker 1>target app is to be,</v>

90
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to improve in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate accuracy.</v>

91
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>If you keep changing your variable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep moving your arm up or down</v>

92
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>or like releasing in a different way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

93
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>If any of these things are always</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing,</v>

94
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you won't be as accurate over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from that you can grab that and look</v>

95
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>at your life and realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit man,</v>

96
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been readjusting all these</v>

97
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:31.441
<v Speaker 1>stupid variables over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again without just for at least a month</v>

98
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>attempting some rhythmic pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some similar thing,</v>

99
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you start doing that,</v>

100
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:43.411
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to improve in a lot of,</v>

101
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>in everything in general.</v>

102
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's arguments to anthropology that</v>

103
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 2>actually they were lots of societies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had a lot more leisure time than we</v>

104
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.770
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering societies and spending four to</v>

106
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>five hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote working hunting,</v>

107
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 2>gathering and had lots of time for</v>
<v Speaker 2>ceremonies and all kinds of other</v>

108
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on where you are in the world</v>

109
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 2>and how harsh the conditions were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

110
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 2>sort of the original leisure society</v>
<v Speaker 2>May,</v>

112
00:05:09.471 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 2>it may have predated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predated agriculture,</v>

113
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>something they had no iphones and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a blessing,</v>

114
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for five hours of hunting and</v>

115
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>gathering is exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 2>and you really don't have enough time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop a car.</v>

117
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no cars.</v>

118
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After you figured that out,</v>

119
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 2>after you've done your hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering,</v>

120
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 2>then it's about cooking and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also there's no days off because you</v>

121
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 2>don't have any refrigeration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

122
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Depending on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on your climate.</v>

123
00:05:34.141 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Speaker 2>And I mean they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could try things and do certain</v>

124
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but clearly,</v>

125
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 2>clearly not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a frigidaire around the corner.</v>

126
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what you're talking about</v>

127
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 2>about whether it's cities or just modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

128
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>that</v>
<v Speaker 2>high tech,</v>

129
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 2>high speed world that most of us live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

130
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 2>where many of us don't feel like we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>much free time and we're running around</v>

131
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 2>and doing all these things in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually</v>

132
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>when I talk to people who become hunters</v>
<v Speaker 2>as adults,</v>

133
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.260
<v Speaker 2>by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of why they did it.</v>

134
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to reconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of why they garden is part of</v>

136
00:06:12.211 --> 00:06:14.490
<v Speaker 2>why they raise chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of why they do all sorts of</v>

137
00:06:14.491 --> 00:06:18.120
<v Speaker 2>other things that you understand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>value to.</v>

138
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.870
<v Speaker 2>They want to get back in touch with</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

139
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Not only the hands on skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just the world they inhabit.</v>

140
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the domesticated concretized</v>

141
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Concretize</v>

142
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.390
<v Speaker 2>the pavement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:41.391
<v Speaker 2>beyond the pavement into nature and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a little garden patch in</v>

144
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:46.200
<v Speaker 2>your backyard or you hunting around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Missouri breaks,</v>

145
00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:51.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sense of wanting to reconnect</v>

146
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:53.160
<v Speaker 2>so that all these practices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

147
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.420
<v Speaker 2>gardening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising chickens in part are like an</v>

148
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.283
<v Speaker 2>antidote</v>

149
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.140
<v Speaker 3>to modern life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you want to.</v>

150
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.540
<v Speaker 3>You want me to tell you a bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary roots of religion,</v>

151
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.690
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you would study religion as an</v>

152
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 3>evolutionist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

153
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.543
<v Speaker 3>You Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

154
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.940
<v Speaker 3>So one argument is based on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an adaptive argument,</v>

155
00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:15.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is if religion exists,</v>

156
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.250
<v Speaker 3>does it confer an adaptive advantage to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

157
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.190
<v Speaker 3>And so there was some work done by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good friend of mine,</v>

158
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 3>David Sloan Wilson and evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>biologist where he argues using the</v>

159
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.390
<v Speaker 3>groups selectionists argument that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups that are religious out survive</v>

160
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 3>groups that are not by virtue of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>being more communal,</v>

161
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>more cohesive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more abandoned.</v>

162
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.060
<v Speaker 3>So that argument is an adaptive argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>for why religion exists.</v>

163
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.110
<v Speaker 3>There is another argument by other</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionists that is based on an</v>

164
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.210
<v Speaker 3>exaltation arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard that term?</v>

165
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

166
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.980
<v Speaker 3>So that's a byproduct of evolution.</v>

167
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.890
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that evolved not because</v>

168
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it confers an adaptive advantage,</v>

169
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:58.270
<v Speaker 3>but rather it's piggybacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

170
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 3>the fact that your skeletal system is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the color that it is,</v>

171
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 3>that itself is not adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a byproduct of other evolutionary</v>

172
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:07.360
<v Speaker 3>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from that perspective,</v>

173
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 3>religion piggybacks on computational</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems in our brains that evolved for</v>

174
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:14.200
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You follow me,</v>

175
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.970
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coalitional thinking,</v>

176
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.970
<v Speaker 3>the idea of viewing the world as US</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus them,</v>

177
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.140
<v Speaker 3>blue team versus team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is an innate part of our psychology</v>

178
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now religion piggybacks on that,</v>

179
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes that computational system that</v>

180
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:31.660
<v Speaker 3>already exists in us and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it puts it on steroids,</v>

181
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:33.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think about the Abrahamic</v>

182
00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:33.844
<v Speaker 3>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

183
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Every one of them has us versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are the Jews,</v>

184
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:39.460
<v Speaker 3>the gentiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the believers,</v>

185
00:08:39.461 --> 00:08:40.450
<v Speaker 3>the preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

186
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 3>And so at agency detection detecting</v>
<v Speaker 3>agency and things is something that is</v>

187
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:47.020
<v Speaker 3>innate to us.</v>

188
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Religion plays on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The agent becomes God,</v>

189
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.890
<v Speaker 3>and so that's an argument that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>proposed by Pascal where he's basically</v>

190
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:57.710
<v Speaker 3>saying that religion not specifically</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve because itself,</v>

191
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 3>it is adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it piggybacks on other things that</v>

192
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 3>have evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a third way to study a religion</v>

193
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.870
<v Speaker 3>is to just do a content analysis of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

194
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 3>the narratives within religions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a great study done by a</v>

195
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:16.491
<v Speaker 3>Darwinian historian where she looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the old testament how many women are</v>

196
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 3>ascribed to a different male and the in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Old Testament as a function of a</v>

197
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 3>status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the higher the status of the male,</v>

198
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.180
<v Speaker 3>the more sexual partners you had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what you would predict</v>

199
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 3>from an evolutionary perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High status to men confers reproductive</v>

200
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are different ways that</v>

201
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 3>evolution is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are several other ways that</v>

202
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 3>can study religion from an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
