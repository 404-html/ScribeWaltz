<v Speaker 2>bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking again.</v>

4
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Ice Skating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>85.</v>

5
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a good day.</v>

6
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't find it.</v>

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Shoot when I don't have my own ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>caves,</v>

8
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 2>so I have to rent ice skates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for the same reason why I couldn't</v>

9
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 2>a no go or years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can rent.</v>

10
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Those are fucking shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just that my feet are too</v>

11
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 2>wide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I had a regular size 11 my feet,</v>

12
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:29.091
<v Speaker 2>I have someone in my background fucked a</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey when it was big fucking big foot</v>

13
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 2>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you shouldn't be able to fuck</v>

14
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 2>monkeys anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone just went back in for one more</v>

15
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 2>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked a monkey guaranteed.</v>

16
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 2>It was like the last like last call</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution last car and one of my</v>

17
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 2>ancestors just snuck back in and got one</v>
<v Speaker 2>more nut off.</v>

18
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my feet are just too wide,</v>

19
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 2>so I get in those things.</v>

20
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm just in agony and it just never</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned how,</v>

21
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not interesting enough for me</v>

22
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 2>to go out and buy ice skates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

23
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 2>it feels like this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just something I have to conquer</v>

24
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 2>than it would have to learn how to ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>skate as much more satting as a youth.</v>

25
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking roller.</v>

26
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Not Roller blading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking ice skating to green day shit</v>

27
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

28
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They play loud music and you spin around</v>

29
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 2>the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess hockey would be the reason to do</v>

31
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you wanted to learn how to play</v>

32
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 2>hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say you pretend you're,</v>

33
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 2>you're doing hockey moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 2>like you're on the ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snowing when you stop and you just throw</v>

35
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 2>the snow at people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the show.</v>

36
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.431
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

37
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 2>that's a cool move.</v>

38
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

39
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you were the hockey skates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely don't wear the figure</v>

40
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 2>skating ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

41
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 2>No chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

42
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

43
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the spikes in the front,</v>

44
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 2>so you could do the trip will tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch.</v>

45
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't want anybody to let you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want anybody seeing your</v>

46
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 2>spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna.</v>

47
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 2>When you go straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to lift it a little bit and</v>

48
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fall on your face to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hockey is a little curvature.</v>

49
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Or like a running shoe just allows you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maneuver to dies.</v>

50
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 2>So it allows you to maneuver better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't allow you to do tricks.</v>

51
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do a stop and then triple til</v>

52
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 2>lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let go Scott Hamilton flip.</v>

53
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 2>So are they doing flips and when they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>those spins on the ice,</v>

54
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 2>they doing them with like special</v>
<v Speaker 2>skates?</v>

55
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Is that what the deal is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sure.</v>

56
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Brian Boitano.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

57
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And I've noticed with archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ego,</v>

58
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.820
<v Speaker 1>even when I will have me shoot the on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact same way,</v>

59
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm still off the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>target,</v>

60
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you say,</v>

61
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:34.271
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

62
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were right through Arrow was wrong.</v>

63
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>That's how the brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it fell right.</v>

64
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

65
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to,</v>

66
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>even though the feedback from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is like,</v>

67
00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:44.884
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

68
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.750
<v Speaker 1>don't take that approach to bud fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

69
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hurt somebody or hurt somebody.</v>

70
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Stop screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it.</v>

71
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.090
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

73
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>But think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

74
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So I certainly am in my life have erred</v>
<v Speaker 1>by choosing my instinct over the</v>

75
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>feedback I'm getting from the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>this is like that book that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced me to,</v>

77
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>which I war of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the book of five rings.</v>

78
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real ones and the one that talks</v>

79
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>about how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should just learn anything like get</v>

80
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>good at anything.</v>

81
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting good at.</v>

82
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Because if you understand how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at this one thing,</v>

83
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>you can extrapolate from that how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at almost anything.</v>

84
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>There's these recurring patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

85
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And so with archery it's really cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to find these,</v>

86
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep all these variables the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same no matter what your environment,</v>

87
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>if you can learn to keep these variables</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same if you're on a hill,</v>

88
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>the distance when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

89
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>if you can learn how to hold these</v>
<v Speaker 1>variables the same,</v>

90
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>which is the anchor point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way your arm holds the bow,</v>

91
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.120
<v Speaker 1>the way you pull the Arrow back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you release the arrow.</v>

92
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>There's all these pieces in there and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can keep all of those the same or</v>

93
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>close to the same with adjustments based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on whatever your target app is to be,</v>

94
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to improve in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate accuracy.</v>

95
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>If you keep changing your variable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep moving your arm up or down</v>

96
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>or like releasing in a different way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

97
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>if any of these things are always</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing,</v>

98
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you won't be as accurate over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from that you can grab that and look</v>

99
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>at your life and realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit man,</v>

100
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been readjusting all these</v>

101
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:31.411
<v Speaker 1>stupid variables over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again without just for at least a month</v>

102
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>attempting some rhythmic patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some similar thing,</v>

103
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you start doing that,</v>

104
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to,</v>

105
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve and a lot of an in everything in</v>

106
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:46.654
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

107
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's arguments in anthropology that</v>

108
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 2>actually there were lots of societies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had a lot more leisure time than we</v>

109
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.740
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 2>the hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering societies and spend,</v>

111
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four to five hours a day,</v>

112
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.550
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote working hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering.</v>

113
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 2>And had lots of time for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 2>ceremonies and all kinds of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

115
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.330
<v Speaker 2>It depends on where you are in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how harsh to conditions were,</v>

116
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

117
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the original leisure society</v>

118
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.740
<v Speaker 2>May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may have predated a,</v>

119
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 2>did agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly they had no i-phones and</v>

120
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that was a blessing,</v>

121
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But four or five hours of hunting and</v>

122
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:19.380
<v Speaker 2>gathering is exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 2>and you really don't have enough time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop a car.</v>

124
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.253
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no cars.</v>

125
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After you figured that out,</v>

126
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 2>after you've gotten done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hunting and gathering,</v>

127
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 2>then it's about cooking and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also there's no days off because you</v>

128
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 2>don't have any refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

129
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Depending on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 2>depending on your climate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

131
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 2>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could try things and do certain</v>

132
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but clearly,</v>

133
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:39.740
<v Speaker 2>clearly not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a frigidaire.</v>

134
00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

135
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>But you know what you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>about whether it's cities or just modern</v>

136
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

137
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 2>high tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high speed world that most of us live</v>

138
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where many of us don't feel like we have</v>

139
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>much free time and we're running around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing all these things in cities.</v>

140
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

141
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 2>when I talked to people who become</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters as adults</v>

142
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.290
<v Speaker 2>by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of why they did it.</v>

143
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.820
<v Speaker 2>They want it to reconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.230
<v Speaker 2>It's part of why they garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of why they raised chickens.</v>

145
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.100
<v Speaker 2>It's part of why they do all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things that you understand and,</v>

146
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.630
<v Speaker 2>and value to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to get back in touch with</v>

147
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.780
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only the hands on skills but just</v>

148
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.030
<v Speaker 2>the world they inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

149
00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:32.031
<v Speaker 2>beyond the domesticated concretized city</v>
<v Speaker 2>conquered types,</v>

150
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.390
<v Speaker 2>the pavement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:41.391
<v Speaker 2>beyond the payment into nature and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a little garden patch in</v>

153
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:46.200
<v Speaker 2>your backyard or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting around the Missouri breaks,</v>

154
00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:51.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sense of wanting to reconnect</v>

155
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:53.190
<v Speaker 2>so that all of these practices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

156
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.420
<v Speaker 2>gardening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising chickens in part are like an</v>

157
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.283
<v Speaker 2>antidote,</v>

158
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.150
<v Speaker 3>modern life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you want to,</v>

159
00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:04.540
<v Speaker 3>you want me to tell you a bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary roots of religion,</v>

160
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 3>how you would study religion as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionist?</v>

161
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.153
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Ready?</v>

162
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one argument is based on,</v>

163
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.150
<v Speaker 3>it's an adaptive argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

164
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.770
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is if religion exists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it confer an adaptive advantage to</v>

165
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.740
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there is some work done by a good</v>

166
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:21.670
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave Wilson,</v>

167
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Wilson and evolutionary biologists who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

168
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:28.780
<v Speaker 3>he argues using a groups selectionists</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument that that groups that are</v>

169
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:33.400
<v Speaker 3>religious out survive groups that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not by virtue of them being more</v>

170
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:35.050
<v Speaker 3>communal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more cohesive,</v>

171
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.920
<v Speaker 3>more abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that argument is an adaptive argument</v>

172
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:42.460
<v Speaker 3>for why religion exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is another argument by other</v>

173
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:45.370
<v Speaker 3>evolutionists that is based on an</v>
<v Speaker 3>exaltation argument.</v>

174
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard that term?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

175
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

176
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.980
<v Speaker 3>So that's a byproduct of evolution.</v>

177
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that evolved,</v>

178
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 3>not because itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it confers an adaptive advantage,</v>

179
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:58.270
<v Speaker 3>but rather it's piggy backing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

180
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Speaker 3>the fact that your skeletal system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it the color that it is,</v>

181
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 3>that itself is not adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a byproduct of other evolutionary</v>

182
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:07.390
<v Speaker 3>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from that perspective,</v>

183
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 3>religion piggy backs on computational</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems in our brains that evolved for</v>

184
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 3>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if all what I mean.</v>

185
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.350
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coalitional thinking the idea of viewing</v>

186
00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:20.350
<v Speaker 3>the world as us versus them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the team versus red team,</v>

187
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.770
<v Speaker 3>that is an innate part of our psychology</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

188
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.560
<v Speaker 3>Now religion piggybacks on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

189
00:08:26.561 --> 00:08:30.250
<v Speaker 3>It takes that computational system that</v>
<v Speaker 3>already exists in us and it,</v>

190
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.780
<v Speaker 3>it puts it on steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

191
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 3>So you thinking about the Abrahamic</v>
<v Speaker 3>religions,</v>

192
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every one of them has us versus them.</v>

193
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.380
<v Speaker 3>They are the Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gentiles,</v>

194
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.120
<v Speaker 3>the believers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kuffar,</v>

195
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:40.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

196
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

197
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>agency detection detecting agency and</v>

198
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:47.020
<v Speaker 3>things is something that is innate to</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

199
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Religion plays on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The agent becomes God.</v>

200
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.030
<v Speaker 3>And s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's an argument that was proposed</v>

201
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 3>by Pascal boy where he's basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that religion did not</v>

202
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 3>specifically evolve because itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is adaptive,</v>

203
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 3>but it's piggy backs on other things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have evolved.</v>

204
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:06.470
<v Speaker 3>And then a third way to study religion</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to just do a content analysis of the,</v>

205
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.390
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the narratives within religion.</v>

206
00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 3>So there's a great study done by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darwinian historian where she looked at</v>

207
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:18.681
<v Speaker 3>in the old testament how many women are</v>
<v Speaker 3>ascribed to a different male and the old</v>

208
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 3>and the Old Testament as a function of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>status.</v>

209
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 3>So the higher the status of the male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more sexual partners he had,</v>

210
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what you would predict</v>
<v Speaker 3>from an evolutionary perspective.</v>

211
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 3>High status to men confers reproductive</v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

212
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.920
<v Speaker 3>So there are different ways that</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution is,</v>

213
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 3>and there are several other ways that</v>
<v Speaker 3>can study religion from an evolutionary</v>

214
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
