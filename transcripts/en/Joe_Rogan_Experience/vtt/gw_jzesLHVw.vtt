2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.920

<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that's a fat guy.</v>

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>It feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would definitely say stocky.</v>

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say you're fat either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say you're a fat guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're wearing layers right now.</v>

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.480

<v Speaker 1>You're weighing in so you're trying to</v>

7
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>dehydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of came in late to the game.</v>

9
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 1>He sandbagged me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This butterfly since August and</v>

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do a weight loss challenge to 40</v>

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>to 56 at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

13
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a little bit of a Bert Ism</v>

14
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bert.</v>

15
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know his birth prone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to exaggerate slightly.</v>

16
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>It's called hyperbole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was 2:56 on Thanksgiving after a full</v>

17
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.920
<v Speaker 1>binge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't his walk.</v>

18
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a New York binge where I drank</v>

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>everyday on opiod radio drink every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single night and then came back and he</v>

20
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>weighed himself and then I like.</v>

21
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I was a full binge already said to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

22
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>there's nowhere to 44.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got on because that's what bonds was</v>

23
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>on November 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where my special and showtime</v>

24
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>came out and that's what we weighed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>

25
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>It was the day I show you the next day</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the world podcast.</v>

26
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:08.191
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you think?</v>

27
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't eighth though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

28
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was robust.</v>

29
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>You were pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was big.</v>

30
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>That a gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now why?</v>

31
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>What made you guys start this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually that's already made the</v>

32
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking about the origin of</v>

33
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:26.630
<v Speaker 1>bird is fat because you get the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>dicks.</v>

34
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag your mom's house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example.</v>

35
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 2>The other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you did like them,</v>

36
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 2>that's where I was at your mom's house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wonder where this hate filled</v>

37
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>fucking podcast comes from a is where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from</v>

38
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 2>watching a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember a few years ago the head</v>

39
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 3>of the International Monetary Fund,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dominique Strauss Kahn was the scandal.</v>

40
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

41
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

42
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 3>He was accused of raping the eventually</v>
<v Speaker 3>cleared and inspired a movie that I</v>

43
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 3>think was on hbo or showtime and we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching it and they did it like loosely</v>

44
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 3>or mostly based on that story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't a biopic and the guy that</v>

45
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:18.851
<v Speaker 3>played dsk was Gerard Depardieu and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a scene where they have him get</v>

46
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 3>arrested and do the perp walk and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do the strip search like at rikers</v>

47
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 3>island and he had this totally bloated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>distended,</v>

48
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 3>like big boobs body and we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks like burt,</v>

49
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.530
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but bigger,</v>

50
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 3>like way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then we talked about it on our</v>

51
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:40.520
<v Speaker 3>podcast and then people started to</v>
<v Speaker 3>photoshop burt onto.</v>

52
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I did not get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually taking it as compliments</v>

53
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 1>because I know he's very talented actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

54
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.651
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

55
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:49.390
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

56
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:51.520
<v Speaker 1>this is all blindsided me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is happening in their little</v>

57
00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 1>fucking world where they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time I started to</v>

58
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Vlog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when I did my blog,</v>

59
00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I and I knew that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things was popular.</v>

60
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Blogs was weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was car care,</v>

61
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>like watching my weight loss and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing weight,</v>

62
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but I was always weighing in in a speedo</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was very self deprecating.</v>

63
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to make it funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two are watching at this at the</v>

64
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>exact same time and making fun of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat I am.</v>

65
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm oblivious to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm oblivious to all of this.</v>

66
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And then one day Doug Benson and I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a fight.</v>

67
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone knows what I'm talking</v>

68
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.701
<v Speaker 1>about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.550
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>on his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>There was a live podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very uncomfortable and it was</v>

72
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I spoke to.</v>

73
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I called Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went right to the bar after it.</v>

74
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking worked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

75
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.730

<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

80
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go for what?</v>

81
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

82
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:46.504
<v Speaker 1>what are you calling yourself?</v>

83
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doug and I had a blow out.</v>

84
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

85
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:53.824
<v Speaker 1>nevermind.</v>

<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you sorry about?</v>

87
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

88
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>have you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

89
00:03:58.931 --> 00:03:59.764
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

90
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about what you're upset</v>

91
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:03.550

96
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I have to be very clear and honest about</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this emotion because there are</v>

140
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I put up a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Fox and like 10 people that are</v>

141
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>popular online retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's really cool about the little</v>

142
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>sidebar from this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but real,</v>

143
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>what's really cool about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think you'll get a kick out of</v>

144
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you guys heard me tell that story for</v>

145
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>years ago on this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think half the people everyone likes</v>

146
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People thought it was a lie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I bet it is true.</v>

149
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>The reason it went viral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is that people in my class</v>

150
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>tagged in the comment section.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

211
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do morning tv and they go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what do you want us to lead you with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always like,</v>

217
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.940

<v Speaker 1>because most of the times they go like,</v>

218
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that,</v>

219
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to get racy.</v>

220
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And The lady just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

221
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just in the middle.</v>

222
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:27.281
<v Speaker 1>And she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

223
00:09:27.281 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I got to ask you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

224
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

225
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>why is Burke Chrysler so fat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said it wrong.</v>

226
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom doesn't make a joke out of it.</v>

227
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:35.281
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of problems.</v>

229
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.440

<v Speaker 1>why he's so fat.</v>

231
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.060

<v Speaker 1>What I didn't realize,</v>

232
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I thought that like 100 people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet it to him.</v>

257
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.340

<v Speaker 1>I'll take this on the chin.</v>

258
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 1>But that's when we started to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition though.</v>

265
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:54.430
<v Speaker 1>We don't know where he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

266
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 1>he had this podcast and amazing podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Henry rollins.</v>

267
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Henry Rollins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once a year gets on a plane,</v>

268
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 1>he talks to his travel agent and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

269
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 1>where can we go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

270
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 1>have you been to Burma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

271
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he flies to like Burma and knows no</v>

272
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:15.441
<v Speaker 1>one brings a laptop and a notebook and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some underwear and just fucking wanders</v>

273
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:16.644
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

274
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.780
<v Speaker 1>He gets a hotel room and he just goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the street and just goes there</v>

275
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at night he writes,</v>

276
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not oppressed.</v>

277
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I've traveled the fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

278
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beaches were beaches,</v>

279
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>fucking hotel rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bedrooms hammered everywhere you go.</v>

280
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.690
<v Speaker 1>But I also have an insulary fuzzy Ivan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insightful fucking eye.</v>

281
00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust me after,</v>

282
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.010
<v Speaker 1>after a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

283
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is getting old.</v>

284
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Is there a four seasons around here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't.</v>

285
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it gets a thrill of Henry</v>
<v Speaker 1>valance legitimately enjoys it.</v>

286
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to that podcast that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

287
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing podcast because he just</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about the people that he's met and</v>

288
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 1>all the experiences that he's had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Henry rollins a little deeper than</v>

289
00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a guy that like,</v>

290
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to a bar and meet a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people and hang out and have a good</v>

291
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like sitting there going,</v>

292
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is their,</v>

293
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 1>their spice here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems very dominant.</v>

294
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not that guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ice cube way something put it back.</v>

295
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.950
<v Speaker 1>He's just got to suck on an ice cube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

296
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but the only thing I've been doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get these fucking wanes over.</v>

297
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to that.</v>

298
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>What kind of timeline are we talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that this all started?</v>

299
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 1>So after the Ra podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was November seventh,</v>

300
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing basically that's this year</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

301
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically two months.</v>

302
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.960
<v Speaker 1>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

303
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.040
<v Speaker 1>it's basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

304
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 1>when did you start losing weight though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You started losing weight before that?</v>

305
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.340
<v Speaker 1>August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>August.</v>

306
00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made you decide?</v>

307
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it was that we had been</v>

308
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:42.960
<v Speaker 1>doing all the fat talk like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did the fat talk start with my</v>

309
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>assistant started definitely in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer.</v>

310
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I remember listening to your podcasts or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had to be early then it had to be</v>

311
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:49.380
<v Speaker 1>like may or June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

312
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.110
<v Speaker 1>it was easily may Miss Syracuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Because I remember in July in Alabama</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was jogging and I was listening to</v>

314
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

315
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 1>push fucking destroy me and I could not</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop laughing because it was,</v>

316
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it was me talking on phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys taking everything away.</v>

317
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.810
<v Speaker 1>The funniest thing that I have seen from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this so far is that a lot of English as</v>

318
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:15.130
<v Speaker 1>a second language teachers around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country have sent in videos where</v>

319
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:17.140
<v Speaker 1>they're like in India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

320
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they a lot like an alarming amount</v>

321
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 1>of English to second language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put a camera in the room and as</v>

322
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 1>they're teaching the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they teach them to say Burt Chrysler is</v>

323
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:27.964
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

324
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 1>We have tons of these videos where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are like.</v>

325
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And also like one lady was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draws like it's just a fat guy on a</v>

326
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>chalkboard and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is burt and the kids go,</v>

327
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.870
<v Speaker 1>this is burt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she's like,</v>

328
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 1>he eats too much and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eats too much.</v>

329
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 1>They go through the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

330
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 1>he's got a teammate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this fucking Solo.</v>

331
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

332
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.520
<v Speaker 1>My wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife got involved.</v>

<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

334

<v Speaker 1>Oh Hey.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because her last name's it.</v>

338
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And when we first met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always done that.</v>

339
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm never good with Christina's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tina's and Christians and I'll just call</v>

343
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Literally my favorite couple of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was ever going to be like a,</v>

344

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

346
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.830

<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would have had as much</v>

347

<v Speaker 1>fun doing this with anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

348

410
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.780
<v Speaker 1>no joke,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Except for yesterday I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had for dinner the night before when</v>

415
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.870
<v Speaker 1>we were weighing in tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what he had for dinner?</v>

<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pulled pork,</v>

417
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Collard Greens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and black eyed peas.</v>

418
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a tradition that every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every New Year's Eve we showed her the,</v>

419
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.830
<v Speaker 1>the Black Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Collard Greens are for money.</v>

420
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I've done it every year and I've made</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money every single year that I've</v>

421
00:17:32.411 --> 00:17:33.660
<v Speaker 1>eaten it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to stop it.</v>

422
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Here's the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

423
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Technically I know going into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should lose this challenge because I</v>

424
00:17:41.411 --> 00:17:45.010
<v Speaker 1>knew I was bigger and I knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could,</v>

425
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.010
<v Speaker 1>if he wanted to be disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he would,</v>

426
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was betting that he wouldn't be</v>

427
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:51.440
<v Speaker 1>disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the bet.</v>

428
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.210
<v Speaker 1>What you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were bigger when it first started.</v>

429
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 1>When I first started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that like physiologically to</v>

430
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.710
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

431
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have said a little bit more of</v>

432
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:01.300
<v Speaker 1>a disadvantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

433
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying joe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is when he started fat shaming me,</v>

434
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:08.751
<v Speaker 1>he was fatter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something about that term.</v>

435
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.670
<v Speaker 1>You said that that term you think is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good term.</v>

436
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just said that,</v>

437
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.950
<v Speaker 1>that personally for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat shaming like worked well.</v>

438
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like that like when somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

439
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.680
<v Speaker 1>it's more like just being honest.</v>

440
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like not in denial when somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes like,</v>

441
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.030
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to lose some weight.</v>

442
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fat shaming.</v>

443
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:29.251
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

444
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:30.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just someone being honest.</v>

445
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bullshit term.</v>

446
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I really do that fat shaming me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only it only works if you're fat,</v>

447
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 1>you're fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should lose weight.</v>

448
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:39.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a weird.</v>

450
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I have a weird push and pull with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was a period where I</v>

451
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 1>didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like I,</v>

452
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I empathize with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say amy,</v>

453
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:48.880
<v Speaker 1>because she's the one that gets fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaming most.</v>

583
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.320
<v Speaker 1>you started in August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

584
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 1>What were you at your heaviest to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 seven.</v>

585
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

586
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were closing in on three.</v>

587
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were to 67.</v>

588
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you feel?</v>

589
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

590
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that like I woke up and they</v>

591
00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:45.620
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

592
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was,</v>

593
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still.</v>

594
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at my heaviest,</v>

595
00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I would still lift weights a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times a week.</v>

596
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I still would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would still do squats,</v>

597
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.200
<v Speaker 1>still do power cleans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was just eating recklessly,</v>

598
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 1>like whatever I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at his house,</v>

599
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I went to dinner at his house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and Leanne,</v>

600
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 1>is it their old house?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

601
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 1>it was right after they had the baby and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom cooked us each a steak,</v>

602
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 1>like a full rib eye and then we each got</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nine shrimps and then we each got a</v>

603
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 1>slab of potatoes and then we got a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>stack of Greens and we didn't need it</v>

604
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:17.990
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Tom ate at all and he was like,</v>

605
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 1>you didn't like yours?</v>

606
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.700
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

607
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:22.150
<v Speaker 1>it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a meal for like three people like</v>

608
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.993
<v Speaker 1>that everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how you get to 60 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just felt like,</v>

610
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then honestly like clothes too,</v>

611
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.390
<v Speaker 1>it's so something you don't think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be like,</v>

612
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 1>oh I want to get this shirt and you put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on,</v>

613
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a bigger shirt.</v>

614
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:37.940
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't make bigger than that.</v>

615
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

616
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:40.670
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to gap.</v>

617
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you guys have forties?</v>

618
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.190
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't make forties.</v>

619
00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

620
00:25:44.521 --> 00:25:46.280
<v Speaker 1>so I've got to shop at a different store</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

621
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is something I think that has</v>

622
00:25:49.401 --> 00:25:50.720
<v Speaker 1>been in the base of every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

623
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I also did a showtime special shirtless</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this entire fat shaming campaign,</v>

624
00:25:55.461 --> 00:25:59.220
<v Speaker 1>which did not help what you do every</v>
<v Speaker 1>show shirtless part of the NIH.</v>

625
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Not to like to deflect or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason I started doing a</v>

626
00:26:02.781 --> 00:26:05.990
<v Speaker 1>shortlist as I didn't look good in</v>
<v Speaker 1>collared shirts and like I couldn't wear</v>

627
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:08.960
<v Speaker 1>a tee shirt and so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kinda stayed to rip my shirt off</v>

628
00:26:08.961 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 1>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a little fat.</v>

629
00:26:10.521 --> 00:26:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like 2:50 to 60 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just thought it was funny and I</v>

630
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 1>just leave it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't give a fuck.</v>

631
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:18.110
<v Speaker 1>And then when I like let this weekend I</v>
<v Speaker 1>took my shirt off and I'm not,</v>

632
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not skinny by any stretch of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

633
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:22.970
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not to 60 anymore to 50 and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not get,</v>

634
00:26:22.971 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 1>just was flat lined and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

635
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.790
<v Speaker 1>looks like the shorts going back on for</v>
<v Speaker 1>now on the machinist is wearing shirts,</v>

636
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.790
<v Speaker 1>the machinist is going to wear a shirt</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine is the new bird.</v>

637
00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.210
<v Speaker 1>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to 67 and on our challenge day I</v>

638
00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 1>would say I was 2:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

639
00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:38.930
<v Speaker 1>So wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you had already dropped like 20</v>

640
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

641
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.660
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you start at on our challenge</v>

642
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:42.291
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I set out,</v>

643
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five thinking that it wouldn't turn into</v>

644
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:47.820
<v Speaker 1>a base set to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said 2:40 the machinist,</v>

645
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.060
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on our,</v>

646
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.130
<v Speaker 1>when I got home on the day after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got hold of me you go.</v>

647
00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I was actually to 50 to 50 the day when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started and I was 56 when I started</v>

648
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 1>the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the I started that I was Thanksgiving to</v>

649
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:06.651
<v Speaker 1>56 and that that's the probably the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest I weighed in ever that I saw</v>

650
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 1>myself on a scale to 56.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the goal weight was around like</v>

651
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:13.800
<v Speaker 1>two slash 22 slash 27 slash 27 meant</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

652
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deal was this,</v>

653
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 1>whoever is the lowest weight when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>texted me the winner.</v>

654
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.140
<v Speaker 1>But if we're both 2:27 or under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>

655
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:26.010
<v Speaker 1>the burden of paying for things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to go to Ari.</v>

656
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go,</v>

657
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 1>whoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

658
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does he pay for both trips?</v>

659
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:32.041
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

660
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:32.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

661
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.300
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

662
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 1>we pick one trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pick one trip but already pays for</v>

663
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 1>the tickets to the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

664
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do you choose what trip?</v>

665
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Because if you win you're going to super</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

666
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to the eye to.</v>

667
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Oddly enough I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Europe when Tom's talking about</v>

668
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 1>that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd go to that game in a heartbeat.</v>

669
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I would explain that if you win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I won,</v>

670
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I wanted him to take me to A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barcelona is playing a Paris nature main</v>

671
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.610
<v Speaker 1>round of 16 European cub game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

672
00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>so we would go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would go to Paris.</v>

673
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.430
<v Speaker 1>And you told me initially that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go to the superbowl.</v>

674
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.170
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

675
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go to Paris jokes.</v>

676
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in London filming or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

677
00:28:07.441 --> 00:28:08.690
<v Speaker 1>just taking the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

678
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.840
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make a lot of money.</v>

679
00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:10.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

680
00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.110
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

681
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.470
<v Speaker 1>so Ari will pay for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>

682
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:25.200
<v Speaker 1>he'll fly you guys to already be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just need the ticket.</v>

683
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

684
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.660
<v Speaker 1>You should make the flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

685
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.400
<v Speaker 1>You need to meet us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

686
00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's off the grid.</v>

687
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Is he going to come meet us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

688
00:28:33.481 --> 00:28:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't even know how to get in touch</v>

689
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:36.144
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

690
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.440
<v Speaker 1>He probably doesn't have a phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

691
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.440
<v Speaker 1>It was based on our BMI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we gave him our original BMI</v>

692
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 1>versus our height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

693
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.490
<v Speaker 1>we were obese and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you can't get into just simply</v>

694
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 1>overweight and it's simply overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The threshold is 2:27.</v>

695
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.940
<v Speaker 1>So if we got under 2:27,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of us,</v>

696
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.880
<v Speaker 1>but if one of us today does not get</v>
<v Speaker 1>under to 27,</v>

697
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.740
<v Speaker 1>then that person has to pay for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>

698
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:56.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

699
00:28:56.521 --> 00:29:01.420
<v Speaker 1>That body mass index because you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body fat or you tied to wait and</v>

700
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 1>it's super outdated and they actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>updated.</v>

701
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:08.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a newer version called the smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bmi which took into account also the</v>

702
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.130
<v Speaker 1>fact that more people are just even</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

703
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you're obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you you're obese.</v>

704
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm overweight by the BMI BMI somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my background.</v>

705
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Some fucked a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

706
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone my great grandpa's Day,</v>

707
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 1>someone fucked a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something happened.</v>

708
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 1>And so that became the bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we could get into just being</v>

709
00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:31.500
<v Speaker 1>overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think personally looking at him</v>

710
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 1>and looking and feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing me,</v>

711
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I did not weigh into that because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

712
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

713
00:29:35.881 --> 00:29:37.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>then I worked out pretty hard last night</v>

716
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 1>and this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to go on the scale</v>

717
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want to come in</v>

718

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

852
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:27.880
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't changed my lifestyle at all</v>

853
00:35:27.881 --> 00:35:29.530
<v Speaker 1>technically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've changed the way I eat.</v>

854
00:35:29.531 --> 00:35:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I eat so fucking clean right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally,</v>

855
00:35:31.871 --> 00:35:34.630
<v Speaker 1>except for last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only had lean proteins and greens</v>

856
00:35:34.631 --> 00:35:36.940
<v Speaker 1>for every meal I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Truck in.</v>

857
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>You're the</v>

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.940
<v Speaker 4>whole comp checks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

859
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.470
<v Speaker 4>hulk loads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hope I call outcome.</v>

860
00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.570
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do those shakes like once a day and</v>

861
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm under a thousand calories.</v>

862
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:49.070
<v Speaker 4>My wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's upsetting her?</v>

863
00:35:49.071 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we transition this into a healthy</v>

864
00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:52.580
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

865
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.810
<v Speaker 4>which is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think once you get c's right.</v>

866
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like I can't continue this.</v>

867
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.220
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had to push back a cardiologist</v>

868
00:35:59.221 --> 00:35:59.731
<v Speaker 4>appointment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

869
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:01.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't want them to see me like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll,</v>

870
00:36:01.611 --> 00:36:03.700
<v Speaker 4>I'll wait until I get healthy again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

871
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.690
<v Speaker 4>this is not entirely healthy to just</v>
<v Speaker 4>drain yourself and dehydrate yourself</v>

872
00:36:09.691 --> 00:36:13.500
<v Speaker 4>like chicken so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like a dog that just got back</v>

873
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:15.220
<v Speaker 4>from the park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's crazy is it.</v>

874
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I understand I watched Chris Cyborg</v>
<v Speaker 4>breaking like weight loss thing.</v>

875
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

876
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.960
<v Speaker 4>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I watched it and I thought if I can</v>

877
00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 4>have half that intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole time I watched at the</v>

878
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:28.510
<v Speaker 4>beginning the weight loss.</v>

879
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:30.360
<v Speaker 4>I said if I gonna have half her</v>
<v Speaker 4>intensity in that moment.</v>

880
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:30.991
<v Speaker 4>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

881
00:36:30.991 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 4>what did she do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude,</v>

882
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 4>she's crying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all made.</v>

883
00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:34.771
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

884
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

885
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 4>And share bodies apparently really</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up from it.</v>

886
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:40.240
<v Speaker 4>She just got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she is pissed hot for um,</v>

887
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

888
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 4>it's really difficult to say exactly</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on because what she took</v>

889
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:50.301
<v Speaker 4>was something called spironolactone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is illegal in Usada.</v>

890
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to take it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but her doctor,</v>

891
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 4>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>told her she could take it out of</v>

892
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:58.530
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She passed on a bunch of title fights</v>

893
00:36:58.531 --> 00:37:03.330
<v Speaker 4>though the UFC was concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they tested her and apparently people</v>

894
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:08.200
<v Speaker 4>take that it's a diuretic and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what she was saying was that share of</v>

895
00:37:08.201 --> 00:37:11.010
<v Speaker 4>bodies all fucked up and hanging onto</v>
<v Speaker 4>water now.</v>

896
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.760
<v Speaker 4>And then she's taking this just to try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to leverage those herself out because</v>

897
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 4>draining herself down to 1:40 was so bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>for her that her whole system all fucked</v>

898
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:19.770
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

899
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 4>The controversy is though that that same</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs also taken by people who are women</v>

900
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:29.190
<v Speaker 4>who do steroids to mimic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to minimize the effects of testosterone.</v>

901
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.140
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we don't really know.</v>

902
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's their word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows,</v>

903
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.790
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's amazing when you watch what you</v>

904
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:37.740
<v Speaker 4>watch when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're focusing on getting in</v>

905
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:38.820
<v Speaker 4>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving.</v>

906
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I watched this guy rich froning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know who that goes to?</v>

907
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 4>Crossfit champ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

908
00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:44.740
<v Speaker 4>He is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a savage.</v>

909
00:37:44.741 --> 00:37:47.880
<v Speaker 4>She has a borderline sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the way he focuses on workout,</v>

910
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 4>working out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like he's almost dead inside.</v>

911
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.320
<v Speaker 4>There's no enjoyment to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like an obsession.</v>

912
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.950
<v Speaker 4>So I started looking at it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like don't like don't enjoy jogging,</v>

913
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:58.350
<v Speaker 4>just make an obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my thing was I get on the treadmill</v>

914
00:37:58.351 --> 00:38:00.690
<v Speaker 4>and go just one more mile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just do one more mile.</v>

915
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.490
<v Speaker 4>You do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone would do one more mile like</v>

916
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.140
<v Speaker 4>tea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this morning I was like,</v>

917
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.240
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe one maybe if you're on this mile</v>

918
00:38:06.241 --> 00:38:08.400
<v Speaker 4>at a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that'll make the difference today.</v>

919
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.230
<v Speaker 4>And I just would get obsessive about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that brain.</v>

920
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.630
<v Speaker 4>What's five?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So little things in my body.</v>

921
00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:19.800
<v Speaker 4>If I touch that fucking explode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just kidding tonight.</v>

922
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When my daughters for a little exercise,</v>

923
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:24.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to look at.</v>

924
00:38:24.161 --> 00:38:24.731
<v Speaker 4>It is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look,</v>

925
00:38:24.731 --> 00:38:27.660
<v Speaker 4>I was burning calories now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

926
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.000
<v Speaker 4>how are we going to do this in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow?</v>

927
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:31.910
<v Speaker 4>Because you guys are real close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

928
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 4>So you are to 19 to 21.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're only talking about a couple of</v>

929
00:38:37.061 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those couple of pounds.</v>

930
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:43.240
<v Speaker 4>What if one of you loses more than that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tomorrow.</v>

931
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 4>But like what if Bert gets down to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>

932
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six tomorrow or something ridiculous.</v>

933
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do we do?</v>

934
00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.210
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Average out the to wait.</v>

935
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Well we average out the two weights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's whoever loses the most overall</v>

936
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 4>or is it because otherwise we're just</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have a draw or a victory?</v>

937
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>

938
00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 4>if you want again tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy,</v>

939
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you want it today.</v>

940
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 4>But if burt wins tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what if he wins tomorrow by the</v>

941
00:39:11.111 --> 00:39:15.730
<v Speaker 4>exact same amount?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking about total weight loss or just</v>

942
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:18.190
<v Speaker 4>whoever's lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just saying that like what if</v>

943
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow we come in and you weigh two</v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds less than me?</v>

944
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:24.071
<v Speaker 4>Tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

945
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 4>but then like we each one one day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you were to 21 year or two?</v>

946
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:28.040
<v Speaker 4>19.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

947
00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.710
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're really only dealing with two</v>

948
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

949
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 4>that's so negligible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>

950
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:33.970
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's uh,</v>

951
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:34.750
<v Speaker 4>a few of these.</v>

952
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can,</v>

953
00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 4>you can suck that out of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can be done.</v>

954
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.640
<v Speaker 4>So the question is how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

955
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:45.490
<v Speaker 4>like what if tomorrow Bert winds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he only winds by half pound,</v>

956
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When does 10?</v>

957
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 4>So I have to win by three pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what I'm trying to.</v>

958
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.250
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to figure out like how can</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might as well shave my beard right</v>

959
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:57.280
<v Speaker 4>now can get the regrow it started</v>
<v Speaker 4>already.</v>

960
00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.170
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets kind of dangerous because you</v>

<v Speaker 1>then get back on and then I'll run</v>

987
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:09.800
<v Speaker 1>around like two miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then go fuck around with the girls,</v>

<v Speaker 1>get on.</v>

989
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.620

<v Speaker 1>I break it up.</v>

990
00:41:12.621 --> 00:41:14.990
<v Speaker 1>So like right now I got eight miles on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the treadmill.</v>

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you walked in running a mix.</v>

994
00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.630
<v Speaker 1>What I'd like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite thing to do is I walk a</v>

995
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.330
<v Speaker 1>hundred yards on the treadmill and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I run 300 yards,</v>

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 1>so like a a run at seven point five over</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 over half</v>

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.860
<v Speaker 4>of the lap around the circle so that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other day.</v>

998
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 4>When you post that video and is five</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Like yesterday I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ran three miles first thing in the</v>

1002
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:49.280
<v Speaker 4>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then went to the rams game,</v>

1003
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.980
<v Speaker 4>put on pulled pork on the green,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big green egg,</v>

1004
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.780
<v Speaker 4>went to the rams game a cooked it 300</v>
<v Speaker 4>degrees perfectly for five hours.</v>

1005
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.010
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eric Rosen.</v>

1006
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 4>When you put it on the big green egg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you keep the temperature stable</v>

1007
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:02.640
<v Speaker 4>for that long?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You regulate it with the pipe,</v>

1008
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.230
<v Speaker 4>the pipe up top and the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you just put Philip charcoals and</v>

1009
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:09.430
<v Speaker 4>once you get it to like 2:25,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've got it regulated,</v>

1010
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to go much higher because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not getting much air in and then</v>

1011
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:14.150
<v Speaker 4>slowly the charcoals a burn and then it</v>
<v Speaker 4>just cooks.</v>

1012
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 4>You don't open it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just cooks and if you open it all the</v>

1013
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:18.920
<v Speaker 4>way it's going to get way high gets when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were like 700 degrees.</v>

1014
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:20.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got one of those.</v>

1015
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.280
<v Speaker 4>I have a commodity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's basically the same thing.</v>

1016
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever tried it with one of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>pellet grills though?</v>

1017
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I remembered his name.</v>

1018
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:29.830
<v Speaker 4>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brett.</v>

1019
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Brett.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brett.</v>

1020
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.370
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love my green mountain grill.</v>

1021
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.820
<v Speaker 4>I just a new pellet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that thing is fucking better than</v>

1022
00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:36.260
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put it in there and you're like</v>

1023
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.630
<v Speaker 4>2:25,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five hours.</v>

1024
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.460
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1025
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 4>it stays at that temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of grill is it?</v>

1026
00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 4>It's a pellet grill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they do is they take,</v>

1027
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.030
<v Speaker 4>you know when you go to flex my home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my voice.</v>

1028
00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Did you know if you go to a lumber yard</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they cut up,</v>

1029
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 4>saw a hardwood sawdust from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardwood,</v>

1030
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 4>they take that stuff and they compress</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and the natural sugars in the wood</v>

1031
00:42:57.501 --> 00:43:02.360
<v Speaker 4>allows them to compress it down to what</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like it looks like a serial or</v>

1032
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 4>kitty litter or something like little</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny like cylinders,</v>

1033
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.870
<v Speaker 4>little small cylinders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they take that and you pour it into</v>

1034
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 4>this hopper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's this like large bin and then</v>

1035
00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 4>there's a worm drive at the bottom that</v>
<v Speaker 4>slowly turns this stuff into a heating</v>

1036
00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:21.140
<v Speaker 4>element and the heating element is</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside the chamber of this big steel box</v>

1037
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.340
<v Speaker 4>and the heating element.</v>

1038
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.360
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see it there.</v>

1039
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Those are the pellets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those are hard wood pallets.</v>

1040
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:27.620
<v Speaker 4>There's no gluing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has no nothing.</v>

1041
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:32.621
<v Speaker 4>It's just the natural sugars from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wood and when you use the machine,</v>

1042

<v Speaker 4>It's like made out of cast iron is real.</v>

1051
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 4>Fucking heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yoder makes these amazing smokers and</v>

1052
00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:08.441
<v Speaker 4>mine has a direct heating option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We you take out that big diffusion plate</v>

1053
00:44:08.721 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 4>and you put in these grill grates and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>has direct fire that goes right</v>

1054
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:15.800
<v Speaker 4>underneath the grill grates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see your stakes on it and I cook elk</v>

1055
00:44:15.801 --> 00:44:18.350
<v Speaker 4>on it all the time to the best.</v>

1056
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.830
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you get that smoky flavor to it too</v>

1057
00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 4>because it's cooking with fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's wood and fire.</v>

1058
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:28.340
<v Speaker 4>So it's got a beautiful flavor to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>food if you don't want us.</v>

1059
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 4>What I do sometimes my daughters don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like smoked food is all wrapped some</v>

1060
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 4>ribs</v>

1061
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.650
<v Speaker 5>up in tin foil and put them in there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they still cook like an oven.</v>

1062
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 5>An oven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still cooks at 2:25.</v>

1063
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 5>And then you smoke to other racks.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's like you're cooking with an oven,</v>

1066
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:47.010
<v Speaker 5>but it's all fire instead of gas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heat or whatever the hell.</v>

1067
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 5>Electric heat.</v>

00:53:07.781 --> 00:53:10.120
<v Speaker 7>little flattened up and tom's a little</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1243
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.750
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the difference in height is maybe a</v>

1244
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:23.501
<v Speaker 7>half an inch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe a half.</v>

1245
00:53:23.501 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 7>An inch bar might be a inch tall.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm 61.</v>

1248
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:29.880
<v Speaker 4>He's six months old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom's probably six and a half.</v>

1249
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're both under obese,</v>

1250
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:33.144
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You lose</v>

1251
00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.620
<v Speaker 7>BMI calculator and figure that out.</v>

1252
00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll go into a BMI calculator.</v>

1253
00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.930
<v Speaker 4>So we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question to you since since</v>

1254
00:53:41.931 --> 00:53:46.520
<v Speaker 4>Thomson one today by two pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're saying tomorrow,</v>

1255
00:53:46.521 --> 00:53:50.780
<v Speaker 4>Bert has to win by more than two pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If burt wants to win overall,</v>

1256
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.010
<v Speaker 4>does that sound correct to you?</v>

1257
00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.600
<v Speaker 7>Suddenly waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The final cut?</v>

1258
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1259
00:54:02.821 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 4>because Tom one by two pounds today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Tom has won victory under his belt.</v>

1260
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.440
<v Speaker 4>If burt wins by two pounds tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a.</v>

1261
00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.350
<v Speaker 4>it's a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he would have to win by more than two</v>

1262
00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 4>pounds because that's the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>victory that Tom got today.</v>

1263
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:21.090
<v Speaker 7>I think they brought sweat a bunch and</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is why we did multiple days because</v>

1264
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.370
<v Speaker 7>tomorrow's Day would be for a little</v>
<v Speaker 7>more,</v>

1265
00:54:24.371 --> 00:54:27.760
<v Speaker 7>but we couldn't do a draw,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I would say yeah.</v>

1266
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.180
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we.</v>

1267
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:35.180
<v Speaker 4>We added their weight up six foot one</v>
<v Speaker 4>and 2:21 for burt in the body mass.</v>

1268
00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:38.650
<v Speaker 4>The overall body mass index is 29 point</v>
<v Speaker 4>two two.</v>

1269
00:54:38.651 --> 00:54:41.500
<v Speaker 4>He's overweight only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's overweight only that's not obese.</v>

1270
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:43.690
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What about six?</v>

1271

<v Speaker 4>put me or a five.</v>

1277
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Eight rather</v>
<v Speaker 4>a</v>

1278
00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:11.680
<v Speaker 4>Tommy did know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obese.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm obese.</v>

1280
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Five eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous,</v>

1281
00:55:18.201 --> 00:55:19.430
<v Speaker 4>but that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If five,</v>

1282
00:55:19.431 --> 00:55:20.240
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>200.</v>

1283
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm obese and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's got the lower BMI?</v>

1284
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:25.910
<v Speaker 4>I got a six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.010
<v Speaker 4>So what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that's how it should</v>

1286
00:55:28.011 --> 00:55:28.760
<v Speaker 4>be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That Tom,</v>

1287
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.160
<v Speaker 4>that bird has to win by more than two</v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds tomorrow?</v>

1288
00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Does that seem fair?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio?</v>

1289
00:55:32.561 --> 00:55:34.400
<v Speaker 4>And maybe let's see who's got the lower</v>
<v Speaker 4>BMI</v>

1290
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:37.720
<v Speaker 7>should be the final way because they</v>
<v Speaker 7>couldn't have</v>

1291
00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:42.360
<v Speaker 7>any water today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They couldn't do that two days in a row.</v>

1292
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't because they're going to</v>

1293
00:55:45.121 --> 00:55:47.040
<v Speaker 4>rehydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They definitely could do it two days in</v>

1294
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:50.550
<v Speaker 4>a row.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's got the lower BMI by one?</v>

1295
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.290
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's.</v>

1296
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:57.480
<v Speaker 4>I think there was a blind way in today</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it wouldn't be fair if you base it</v>

1297
00:55:57.481 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Speaker 4>on what burt already knows because Bert</v>

<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got his money and nothing.</v>

00:57:36.211 --> 00:57:39.660
<v Speaker 1>We have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't spend money on shit.</v>

1334
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I told art and always making fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>

1335
00:57:42.431 --> 00:57:46.080
<v Speaker 1>He's selling out everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his shows on its third season.</v>

1336
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:48.990
<v Speaker 1>He's killing it everywhere and I go get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice car.</v>

1337
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Get yourself like a little bmw and</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity or something.</v>

1338
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Listen to his podcast with me and run is</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

1339
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Why can understand the concept of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking mortgage lending that before the</v>

1340
00:57:58.561 --> 00:58:01.830
<v Speaker 1>podcast even started that he was getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry that you have a mortgage,</v>

1341
00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:05.400
<v Speaker 1>like why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the whole premise was we</v>

1342
00:58:05.401 --> 00:58:07.830
<v Speaker 1>borrowed money against our house to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>renovation,</v>

1343
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.170
<v Speaker 1>which is make make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1344
00:58:10.171 --> 00:58:11.100
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your health is worse.</v>

1345
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:13.680
<v Speaker 1>House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his house is worth more than you start.</v>

1346
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:15.900
<v Speaker 1>You paid for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you borrow against that.</v>

1347
00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Take out $200,000 and you renovate it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you make your house worth more,</v>

1348
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.090
<v Speaker 1>but your mortgage is still very small</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering that you've only borrowed a</v>

1349
00:58:24.091 --> 00:58:25.590
<v Speaker 1>minimal amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1350
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Or he couldn't wrap his head around</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1351
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not your money.</v>

1352
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He yells,</v>

1353
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.600
<v Speaker 1>he gets mad and yell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the other guy do.</v>

1354
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:33.830
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

1355
00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:36.950
<v Speaker 6>going to end up trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if he does have to pay for this,</v>

1356
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.230
<v Speaker 6>pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for like in the cheapest way possible.</v>

1357
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:44.030
<v Speaker 6>It will be like last stand is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's known me forever and I've never</v>

1358
00:58:44.031 --> 00:58:45.830
<v Speaker 6>worried about money like I've always</v>
<v Speaker 6>just said,</v>

1359
00:58:45.831 --> 00:58:47.750
<v Speaker 6>just spend it and live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't.</v>

1360
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.790
<v Speaker 6>You're not here forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just have a good time.</v>

1361
00:58:49.791 --> 00:58:52.130
<v Speaker 6>Don't go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't buy a bunch of Shit you can't</v>

1362
00:58:52.131 --> 00:58:54.020
<v Speaker 6>afford,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but definitely don't think about it.</v>

1363
00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:57.650
<v Speaker 6>The best thing about money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the number one thing about money,</v>

1364
00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.290

<v Speaker 6>you make money,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Meaning that your bills are paid.</v>

1366
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:09.010

<v Speaker 6>development deal when I was 25,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He just couldn't wrap his head around it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we tried to make it very simple.</v>

1387
01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.020
<v Speaker 5>Pretend you have a backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I want to say I'd like to borrow</v>

1388
01:00:04.021 --> 01:00:06.150
<v Speaker 5>against that backpack and put stuff in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your backpack.</v>

1389
01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.530
<v Speaker 5>Your backpack is more valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1390
01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand backpacks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he,</v>

1391
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:11.010
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't even have a watch.</v>

1392
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just to look at his phone or ask</v>

1393
01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 6>somebody if he wants to know what time</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>

1394
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:19.880
<v Speaker 6>And his phone was made in the twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stupid fucking flip phone.</v>

1395
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:22.950
<v Speaker 6>He barely knows what time it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>

1396
01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like he's eating shoes while he's</v>

1397
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:31.100
<v Speaker 6>talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he's got a mouthful of like an</v>

1398
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:35.920
<v Speaker 6>undigestible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Makes a living talking more or he's a</v>

1399
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.230
<v Speaker 6>professional orator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1400
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 6>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He tried to get out of this.</v>

1401
01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:44.270
<v Speaker 6>I want to breather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you merged with their heart,</v>

<v Speaker 6>their lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their lawyer.</v>

<v Speaker 6>he said he was six one.</v>

1404
01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:54.970
<v Speaker 5>How about the fact that we both lost a</v>
<v Speaker 5>considerable amount of weight?</v>

1405
01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.010
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's thinking about his money going</v>

1406
01:00:57.011 --> 01:00:58.680
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch what?</v>

1407
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.320

1409
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.140
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's making a suit and some shoes.</v>

1410
01:01:08.141 --> 01:01:12.490
<v Speaker 5>Does it Taylor?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's such a silly boy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like.</v>

1413
01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:20.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much would it cost to fly you to</v>

1414
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:21.940
<v Speaker 5>Paris and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1415

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1416
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:24.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>How are you going to that?</v>

1418
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like 25 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're overweight and we can't fly.</v>

1419
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.220
<v Speaker 5>Coach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Twenty five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm obese.</v>

1422
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.680
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they,</v>

1423
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.670
<v Speaker 3>they the skills wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look up,</v>

1424
01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:39.880
<v Speaker 3>look up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scale up.</v>

1426
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that?</v>

1427
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that they developed a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit later.</v>

1428
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:49.140
<v Speaker 3>That's supposed to be a little more</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1429
01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:52.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive in terms of knowing that</v>

1430
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:58.250
<v Speaker 3>hitting 200 and more is more along the</v>
<v Speaker 3>norm for a lot of grown.</v>

1431
01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you would read,</v>

1432
01:02:00.211 --> 01:02:02.460
<v Speaker 3>you won't register the same way you did</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that BMI.</v>

1433
01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:03.720
<v Speaker 3>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1434
01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:04.950
<v Speaker 3>It was developed later,</v>

1435
01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.300
<v Speaker 5>so they must be the real way to do it as</v>
<v Speaker 5>a check.</v>

1436
01:02:07.301 --> 01:02:08.920
<v Speaker 5>Actual body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:12.970

1440
01:02:16.241 --> 01:02:18.610
<v Speaker 5>water and you sit in a tank water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how you really are supposed to</v>

1441
01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the Shit and then it tells you</v>

1442
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 5>like</v>

1443
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>how many calories you burn in a day or</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many shoe need to burn.</v>

1444

<v Speaker 1>I don't think about taking my shirt off.</v>

1501
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:35.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1502
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:40.170
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things not automatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you that it happened organically</v>

1503
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.230
<v Speaker 1>and then it was one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1504
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.010
<v Speaker 1>when I did my special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to my buddy cowhead,</v>

1505
01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:47.520
<v Speaker 1>my counselor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was just like,</v>

1506
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.860
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do with your shirt</v>
<v Speaker 1>on run.</v>

1507
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really thought about it.</v>

1508
01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:51.720
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1509
01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.450
<v Speaker 1>the thing I like about watching you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up is it doesn't seem like it's</v>

1510
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.291
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1511
01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>your first special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were dressed up and I get really</v>

01:04:58.291 --> 01:05:00.240
<v Speaker 1>fucked up in my head about what to wear</v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>

1513

<v Speaker 5>then when I stopped taking in all sugar</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1863
01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I have a rash inside my beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I lose my beard,</v>

1864
01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get to see what a</v>

1865
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese children's hands</v>

1866
01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:31.550
<v Speaker 4>look like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that picture.</v>

1867
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:33.280
<v Speaker 4>That's a ridiculous picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at you.</v>

1868
01:18:33.281 --> 01:18:36.500
<v Speaker 4>You look like you're a little cute</v>
<v Speaker 4>little blue eyed baby.</v>

1869
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:38.810
<v Speaker 1>When we were walking through the forest</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Vietnam,</v>

1870
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:43.100
<v Speaker 1>we walked on this village and these kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>had never seen a dude with a beard</v>

1871
01:18:43.101 --> 01:18:46.400
<v Speaker 1>before because in Vietnam it'll grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>beards and they'd never been out of the</v>

1872
01:18:46.401 --> 01:18:48.740
<v Speaker 1>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we walked in and I came in with a</v>

1873
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:51.380
<v Speaker 1>beard and they fucking lost their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought I was a werewolf.</v>

1874
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.450
<v Speaker 1>A million fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1875
01:18:53.451 --> 01:18:55.040
<v Speaker 1>They lost her shit and they ran in</v>
<v Speaker 1>hothead.</v>

1876
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I've never had that reaction with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always really good with kids.</v>

1877
01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong?</v>

1878
01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And Tt was our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our fixer.</v>

1879
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:03.680
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your beard scares them.</v>

1880
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:05.600
<v Speaker 1>They think you're a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1881
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell them I'm okay.</v>

1882
01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:10.310
<v Speaker 1>So we brought a guitar over and we sat</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these kids and they wouldn't stop</v>

1883
01:19:10.311 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 1>looking at my beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go into my bag and I had had</v>

1884
01:19:13.311 --> 01:19:14.600
<v Speaker 1>skittles and m and m's with me.</v>

1885
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 1>So I pulled out skittles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd never had fucking skittles and</v>

1886
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:19.340
<v Speaker 1>give him skittles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate's light up.</v>

1887
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the kids is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says in Vietnamese can play in your</v>

1888
01:19:22.821 --> 01:19:23.980
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

1889
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:26.000
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then all the kids started playing in</v>

1890
01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 1>my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One kid had this funky hand and I was</v>

1891
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:29.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1892
01:19:29.991 --> 01:19:32.480
<v Speaker 1>this isn't going to go good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he gets in my head on,</v>

1893
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.210
<v Speaker 1>as soon as he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel everything get hot on my side.</v>

1894
01:19:35.211 --> 01:19:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1895
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was on his hand,</v>

1896
01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking disgusting.</v>

1897
01:19:41.121 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Like he had never washed his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1898
01:19:44.271 --> 01:19:46.670
<v Speaker 1>and so I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had this like thing that I've been</v>

1977
01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 5>that's going to be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The weird part about this way and shit</v>

1978
01:22:22.381 --> 01:22:25.980
<v Speaker 5>is it's kind of fucked with my head a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit like in that I can</v>

1979
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.570
<v Speaker 5>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying I understand,</v>

1980
01:22:27.571 --> 01:22:30.840
<v Speaker 5>but I understand what like anorexics the</v>
<v Speaker 5>control part of it,</v>

1981
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1982

<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1983
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.800
<v Speaker 5>I think I get the control part where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1984
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm not eating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you feel you're in control.</v>

1985
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:39.840
<v Speaker 5>You're like eating an apple and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh I shouldn't have had that.</v>

1986
01:22:39.841 --> 01:22:40.770
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1987
01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.430
<v Speaker 5>well maybe I should throw that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I understand that part because I</v>

1988
01:22:44.431 --> 01:22:47.970
<v Speaker 5>bet tomorrow that first piece of pizza</v>
<v Speaker 5>is going to be very hard for me to eat</v>

1989
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:52.740
<v Speaker 5>because I haven't had anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had a lot of anxiety over this.</v>

1990
01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:57.210
<v Speaker 5>Over what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had dreams last night that Bernie Shaw</v>

1991
01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:58.860
<v Speaker 5>was running me through fucking training</v>
<v Speaker 5>camp.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the shit out of him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I beat him with my hands,</v>

1997
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:14.880
<v Speaker 3>but then I slammed his head against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>floor or what caused the anger?</v>

1998
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 3>He said something about he's like nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>jacket at a diner and I go,</v>

2001
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:26.800
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as he said that I jumped</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the thing and I like elbowed him in</v>

2002
01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:30.040

<v Speaker 3>then it just cut to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my dream it just cut to me walking</v>

2044
01:25:21.061 --> 01:25:23.540

2048
01:25:29.561 --> 01:25:31.630
<v Speaker 3>you get in the zone and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>zoned in on it.</v>

2049
01:25:31.631 --> 01:25:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably,</v>

2050
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:37.660

<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

2051
01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Really thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no bullshit over the course of 20</v>

2052
01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:42.940
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2057
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Smoked and then done Jujitsu many times</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everybody does it.</v>

2058
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of these dudes would meet</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 10th planet.</v>

2059
01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.420
<v Speaker 3>We'd meet in the parking lot and get lit</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and then go in there and wrote it.</v>

2060
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:59.230
<v Speaker 3>How high?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>High.</v>

2062

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2064
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2065
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.220
<v Speaker 6>like you can't learn anything on high</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're highlight that you don't</v>

2066
01:26:07.221 --> 01:26:08.310
<v Speaker 6>learn shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just do,</v>

2067
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're super creative.</v>

2068
01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:11.010
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like uh,</v>

2069
01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.830
<v Speaker 6>it's not good at someone's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 6>teach you something,</v>

2070
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:15.740
<v Speaker 6>but what it is good for is if you</v>
<v Speaker 6>already know things,</v>

2071
01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.860
<v Speaker 6>you already know things and you just get</v>
<v Speaker 6>loose and zoned out and then he could</v>

2072
01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:20.840
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you feel the moves better.</v>

2073
01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:22.640
<v Speaker 6>You feel like the attacks better.</v>

2074
01:26:23.170 --> 01:26:24.440
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you've probably already talked</v>

2075
01:26:24.441 --> 01:26:26.750
<v Speaker 5>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I haven't heard you talk about it</v>

2076
01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:29.030
<v Speaker 5>real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about the Ronda Rousey thing?</v>

2077
01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.030
<v Speaker 6>Crazy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not good.</v>

2078
01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:34.330
<v Speaker 6>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2079
01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:37.200
<v Speaker 6>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could see the panic.</v>

2080
01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:40.950
<v Speaker 6>He could see the anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could see the difference in the</v>

2081
01:26:40.951 --> 01:26:45.540
<v Speaker 6>skill level striking wise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I just think the whole,</v>

2082
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.600
<v Speaker 6>there was a lot wrong with her camp.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot wrong with her preparation of lot</v>

2083
01:26:50.731 --> 01:26:55.110
<v Speaker 6>wrong with her mindset and a lot wrong</v>
<v Speaker 6>with our skillset in comparison to that</v>

2084
01:26:55.111 --> 01:26:58.170
<v Speaker 6>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Amanda Nunez is a fucking monster.</v>

2085
01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:01.260
<v Speaker 6>She's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I knew that like a long time ago,</v>

2086
01:27:01.261 --> 01:27:03.180
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought she was the biggest threat to</v>

2087
01:27:03.181 --> 01:27:05.280
<v Speaker 6>Rhonda before Rhonda got knocked out by</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holly.</v>

2088
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.290
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think Amanda Nunez is the biggest</v>

2089
01:27:07.291 --> 01:27:11.550
<v Speaker 6>threat because every fight start</v>
<v Speaker 6>standing and holly is a very good</v>

2090
01:27:11.551 --> 01:27:15.150
<v Speaker 6>striker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the real danger for holly I always</v>

2091
01:27:15.151 --> 01:27:18.450
<v Speaker 6>thought was her kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what she knocked out with a head</v>

2092
01:27:18.451 --> 01:27:21.190
<v Speaker 6>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But like it kicks her harder to lay your</v>

2093
01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:25.140
<v Speaker 6>head kicks heartland that a punch when</v>
<v Speaker 6>in exchanges Rhonda would get punched,</v>

2094
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:27.240
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'd seen her get punched by Meesha</v>

2095
01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:28.170
<v Speaker 6>and other people had punched her.</v>

2096
01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:30.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if fucking Amanda Nunez punches her,</v>

2097
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.610
<v Speaker 6>she's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's gonna get fucked up.</v>

2098
01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:36.360
<v Speaker 6>And that's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was way worse because she was</v>

2099
01:27:36.361 --> 01:27:40.680
<v Speaker 6>still recovering psychologically from</v>
<v Speaker 6>that Holly Holm fight.</v>

2100
01:27:40.681 --> 01:27:43.890
<v Speaker 6>And then also physiologically when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>get head kicked,</v>

2101
01:27:43.930 --> 01:27:46.500
<v Speaker 6>we were talking about on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast yesterday,</v>

2102
01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:49.980
<v Speaker 6>there's some people that get head kicked</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they are never the same again.</v>

2103
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:51.990
<v Speaker 6>Like never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You never know.</v>

2104
01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.780
<v Speaker 6>Some people get a head injury and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're okay.</v>

2105
01:27:54.781 --> 01:27:57.210
<v Speaker 6>A few months later,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people get a head injury and</v>

2106
01:27:57.211 --> 01:28:02.211
<v Speaker 6>they're never the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The same person who you were goes away.</v>

2107
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:04.530
<v Speaker 6>A person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any head injury,</v>

2108
01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.550

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2109
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:07.260
<v Speaker 6>and I know someone from minute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was in an accident.</v>

2110
01:28:07.290 --> 01:28:10.410
<v Speaker 6>Nothing to do with fighting head trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never the same.</v>

2111
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:10.831
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2112
01:28:10.831 --> 01:28:14.550
<v Speaker 6>that's the Sam kinison story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sam kinison was one person and then he</v>

2113
01:28:14.551 --> 01:28:19.410
<v Speaker 6>got hit by a truck I think when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 6>little kid and was never the same again.</v>

2114
01:28:19.411 --> 01:28:21.900
<v Speaker 6>And then also he was just reckless</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking wild man.</v>

2115
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.510
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this calm collected kid.</v>

2116
01:28:24.511 --> 01:28:29.130
<v Speaker 6>Normal kid kinda shy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gets hit by a fucking truck and then all</v>

2117
01:28:29.131 --> 01:28:31.290
<v Speaker 6>of a sudden he's just wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't give a fuck.</v>

2118
01:28:31.291 --> 01:28:33.150

2119
01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:33.901
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2120
01:28:33.901 --> 01:28:35.970

2121
01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.000

<v Speaker 5>Thrown on my head in college and a fight</v>

2122
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:44.600
<v Speaker 5>and knocked unconscious and then was out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it and wandering around the campus</v>

2123
01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.150
<v Speaker 5>last didn't know who I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't know where it was.</v>

2124
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:50.820
<v Speaker 5>Nobody brought you to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This girl did this girl did.</v>

2125
01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.950
<v Speaker 5>Scott found me on campus and I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>confused.</v>

2126
01:28:52.951 --> 01:28:54.810
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then she,</v>

2127
01:28:54.811 --> 01:28:56.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was if I was in the middle of the day</v>

2128
01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:01.460
<v Speaker 5>while I was in a fraternity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had written a song about a.</v>

2129
01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.450
<v Speaker 5>and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had sung before and I guess he had</v>

2130
01:29:03.451 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 5>been upset before and told me that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just didn't understand it.</v>

2131
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 5>So that's a problem with me is sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cast the big wake and I don't get that</v>

2132
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm upsetting people that everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 5>having a good time and they feel like</v>

2133
01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm making fun of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not,</v>

2136
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:17.700
<v Speaker 5>And he came up to me in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day and he was,</v>

2137
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:20.670
<v Speaker 5>I was Solomon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were really good friends and he was,</v>

2138
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 5>he was big and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stay the fuck away from me.</v>

2139
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:27.030
<v Speaker 5>And I thought he was kidding around and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went up to him and he was like,</v>

2140
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking serious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

2141

2145
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:45.390
<v Speaker 5>and I woke up and he was holding my</v>
<v Speaker 5>tongue so I swallowed my tongue.</v>

2146
01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:49.170
<v Speaker 5>He was holding my tongue out of my mouth</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was crying and he was like,</v>

2147
01:29:49.171 --> 01:29:50.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so sorry.</v>

2148
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:51.600
<v Speaker 5>And I didn't know what happened.</v>

2149
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.370
<v Speaker 5>And I just walked around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started walking around campus.</v>

2150
01:29:53.670 --> 01:29:58.080
<v Speaker 5>This girl found me a in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 5>like and then drove me.</v>

2151
01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:00.460
<v Speaker 5>She drove me to the hospital and I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the hospital.</v>

2152
01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:01.710
<v Speaker 5>I was so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know anything.</v>

2153
01:30:01.711 --> 01:30:04.740
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know who the president was and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind of started like coming,</v>

2154
01:30:04.741 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 5>figuring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2155
01:30:05.851 --> 01:30:08.940
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then my girlfriend and my best</v>

2156
01:30:08.941 --> 01:30:10.980
<v Speaker 5>friend came out and got me and took me</v>
<v Speaker 5>home.</v>

2157
01:30:10.981 --> 01:30:12.540
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for like a week I'd go like,</v>

2158
01:30:12.541 --> 01:30:15.660
<v Speaker 5>I remember one time I went to go get the</v>
<v Speaker 5>mail with my dog and I forgot where our</v>

2159
01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:17.430
<v Speaker 5>apartment was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2160
01:30:17.431 --> 01:30:19.920
<v Speaker 5>where the fuck is our apartment mate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the guy again?</v>

2161
01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:23.010
<v Speaker 5>And he graduated that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was older than me.</v>

2162
01:30:23.011 --> 01:30:25.710
<v Speaker 5>He graduated that year and he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oddly enough,</v>

2163
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:28.200
<v Speaker 5>he came back and he tried to apologize</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You can go fuck yourself.</v>

2166
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.880

<v Speaker 5>Bieber in my dream and I downloaded two</v>

2167

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:30.780
<v Speaker 3>When I watch boxing or MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like the recap afterwards is when</v>

2187
01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:35.380
<v Speaker 3>you see it obviously different in slow</v>
<v Speaker 3>mo or afterwards,</v>

2188
01:31:35.381 --> 01:31:39.280
<v Speaker 3>but when you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that knockout blow has been landed</v>

2189
01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:44.800
<v Speaker 3>and fighters so zone zoned in on what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing that he'll get in to more,</v>

2190
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:45.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2191
01:31:45.721 --> 01:31:47.220
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's already like,</v>

2192
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.810
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's over and then you'll see like</v>

2193
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:51.400
<v Speaker 3>another hit and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

2194
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:54.010
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the lights were already off and you</v>

2195
01:31:54.011 --> 01:31:58.450
<v Speaker 3>see the whole head to go and then like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>second one is bouncing off the campus</v>

2196
01:31:58.451 --> 01:31:59.770
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God.</v>

2197
01:31:59.950 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2198
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.220
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ref even when,</v>

2199
01:32:01.221 --> 01:32:03.310
<v Speaker 1>if he's good jumps in and stops it,</v>

2200
01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:04.090
<v Speaker 6>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2201
01:32:04.090 --> 01:32:06.120
<v Speaker 6>that's way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's happened already.</v>

2202
01:32:06.150 --> 01:32:09.720
<v Speaker 6>There was a bad one this past weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm Mike pyle fought this guy,</v>

2203
01:32:09.721 --> 01:32:11.470
<v Speaker 6>Alex Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

2204
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:14.460
<v Speaker 6>he got hit with a right hand and</v>
<v Speaker 6>dropped.</v>

2205
01:32:14.461 --> 01:32:16.890
<v Speaker 6>You got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then as one unconscious,</v>

2206
01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:21.620
<v Speaker 6>his head bounced off the canvas and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>head bounces are the scariest ones.</v>

2207
01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.780
<v Speaker 6>God goes out and then as he's fallen on</v>
<v Speaker 6>his head,</v>

2208
01:32:24.781 --> 01:32:29.781
<v Speaker 6>just a bang and when he got up he was</v>
<v Speaker 6>out for a bit and then he woke up,</v>

2209
01:32:30.151 --> 01:32:33.120
<v Speaker 6>he did not know what happened and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>tried to tell him he got knocked out and</v>

2210
01:32:33.121 --> 01:32:33.954
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no way,</v>

2211
01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.060
<v Speaker 6>and then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no fuck.</v>

2212
01:32:36.090 --> 01:32:38.090
<v Speaker 6>But then he kept saying what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>

2213
01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:39.240
<v Speaker 6>you got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2214
01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:40.850
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>

2215
01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:43.410
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's real comment.</v>

2216
01:32:43.411 --> 01:32:46.020
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that many times when people</v>
<v Speaker 6>get knocked out.</v>

2217
01:32:46.021 --> 01:32:48.770
<v Speaker 6>Can you believe bingos recovery?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How is she doing now?</v>

2218
01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:50.070
<v Speaker 6>Doing Great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She is.</v>

2219
01:32:50.071 --> 01:32:52.140
<v Speaker 6>She's back at the fun house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is She?</v>

2220
01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:53.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When</v>

2221
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:54.070
<v Speaker 1>she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They released her.</v>

2222
01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2223
01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.320
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't an easy path.</v>

2224
01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.240
<v Speaker 1>You haven't talked to doug about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally anonymous,</v>

2225
01:32:58.241 --> 01:33:00.850
<v Speaker 1>but you got to explain the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bingo for her.</v>

2226
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm not speaking out of school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is stuff all dog is shared,</v>

2227
01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.850
<v Speaker 1>but Bingo was having her 40th birthday</v>
<v Speaker 1>party I think,</v>

2228
01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:09.280
<v Speaker 1>and so we're sisters came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her parents were coming out,</v>

2229
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 1>everyone was coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She started partying pretty hard.</v>

2230
01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I think she did too much coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a seizure,</v>

2231
01:33:13.730 --> 01:33:17.680
<v Speaker 1>which has happened before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she fell off a step and hit her head</v>

2232
01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:23.040
<v Speaker 1>and apparently she was bleeding out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>every orifice of her face and you know,</v>

2233
01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:25.690
<v Speaker 1>all they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2234
01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Doug's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's a joke there,</v>

2235
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2236
01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I was in the car with big J and doug</v>
<v Speaker 1>called and was like,</v>

2237
01:33:32.481 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Doug Stan hope.</v>

2238
01:33:33.731 --> 01:33:34.720
<v Speaker 1>And Jay's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2239
01:33:34.721 --> 01:33:35.750
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doug's like,</v>

2240
01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I think Bingo is going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably not going to make it to the</v>

2241
01:33:39.101 --> 01:33:41.380
<v Speaker 1>end of the world podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we were like,</v>

2242
01:33:41.381 --> 01:33:42.214
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2243
01:33:42.610 --> 01:33:45.400
<v Speaker 6>you could tell he was kind of out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>sorts at the pod.</v>

2244
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:47.140
<v Speaker 6>He was just off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

2245
01:33:47.190 --> 01:33:49.030
<v Speaker 6>it felt uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He kept leaving,</v>

2246
01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:52.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he was going to say who is,</v>

2247
01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:53.980
<v Speaker 6>he was a really audit out by the whole</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2248
01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2249
01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.880
<v Speaker 1>he was really worked up and then I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to him.</v>

2250
01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2251
01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every now and then I'll talk to doug</v>

2252
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.840
<v Speaker 1>late night when we were both drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2253
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.270
<v Speaker 1>we talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked for like an hour,</v>

2254
01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:06.700
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes and he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2255
01:34:06.730 --> 01:34:07.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to,</v>

2256
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:09.130
<v Speaker 1>this isn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't how it's going to go.</v>

2257
01:34:09.131 --> 01:34:10.420
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden one day they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2258
01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.030
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she started responding and then they're</v>

2259
01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:13.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2260
01:34:13.991 --> 01:34:15.340
<v Speaker 1>she's talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2261
01:34:15.341 --> 01:34:16.900
<v Speaker 1>she's playing the guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2262
01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 1>she's doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a swallow test and</v>

2263
01:34:19.391 --> 01:34:21.370
<v Speaker 1>if we can get the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try to get her trait</v>

2264
01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:23.470
<v Speaker 1>because that was her problem is her</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocal chords were all fucked up.</v>

2265
01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.330
<v Speaker 1>And then they got her tray and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2266
01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.390
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a trick.</v>

2267
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:29.920
<v Speaker 1>A trick is where the tracheotomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they put a hole in your throat so</v>

2268
01:34:29.921 --> 01:34:33.400
<v Speaker 1>that she doesn't have to use her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her throat to breathe.</v>

2269
01:34:33.490 --> 01:34:35.560
<v Speaker 1>You can just breathe right from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>lungs to the air.</v>

2270
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.960
<v Speaker 1>And so then they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2271
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:39.910
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be some real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real rehabilitation.</v>

2272
01:34:39.911 --> 01:34:43.210
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take awhile to get her</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to where she was the day of her</v>

2273
01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:46.090
<v Speaker 1>birthday party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything seems to be tracking</v>

2274
01:34:46.091 --> 01:34:47.530
<v Speaker 1>really nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean so much.</v>

2275
01:34:47.531 --> 01:34:51.220
<v Speaker 1>So Doug is doug at the date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a week before Bingo.</v>

2456
01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.110

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2457
01:41:44.111 --> 01:41:45.730
<v Speaker 4>before him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying that you're just the</v>

2458
01:41:45.731 --> 01:41:47.380
<v Speaker 4>gunslinger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like what you're going to do?</v>

2459
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:49.620
<v Speaker 4>I can already predict tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2460
01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Tommy's going to come in at 2:17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2:15?</v>

2461
01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:55.780
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy's going to be about 2:15.</v>

2462
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.240
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is Tom's.</v>

2463
01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.060
<v Speaker 4>Tom has hit his threshold weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still eating chicken.</v>

2464
01:42:01.061 --> 01:42:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm not eating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2465
01:42:02.170 --> 01:42:04.300
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably drank seven pounds of water.</v>

2466
01:42:04.301 --> 01:42:07.270
<v Speaker 4>And you got to understand that like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a hold on to more water.</v>

2467
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:10.090
<v Speaker 4>You either one of you guys fucked with</v>
<v Speaker 4>distilled water.</v>

2468
01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:11.890
<v Speaker 4>That's all I'd been drinking.</v>

2469
01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:18.490
<v Speaker 4>You can't drink too much of that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will deplete your body of minerals</v>

2470
01:42:18.491 --> 01:42:19.324
<v Speaker 4>and electrolytes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2471
01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:21.040
<v Speaker 4>Why I didn't look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>

2472
01:42:21.041 --> 01:42:25.810
<v Speaker 4>All I know is that I can run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can probably run 20 miles between now</v>

2473
01:42:25.811 --> 01:42:27.400
<v Speaker 4>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all I need.</v>

2474
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is you.</v>

2475
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when are you going to do it?</v>

2476
01:42:33.850 --> 01:42:35.380

<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2477
01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:39.040
<v Speaker 4>Because you literally have to do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>before the wind.</v>

2478
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:40.600
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna be able to drink</v>

2479
01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:43.270

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:07.680
<v Speaker 4>I use heart long string DNA Strand Dna</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strand Dna was that movie that I saw.</v>

2491
01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.320
<v Speaker 4>You think you just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just do the run then you'll,</v>

2492
01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:13.300
<v Speaker 4>you'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to eat anything either.</v>

<v Speaker 6>so three months and then six months.</v>

2530
01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:47.620
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's the thing.</v>

2531
01:44:47.650 --> 01:44:50.020
<v Speaker 6>This is the right way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you and I talked about this.</v>

2532
01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:55.410
<v Speaker 6>The right way to do this is you have a</v>
<v Speaker 6>way in every 12 weeks or every,</v>

2533
01:44:56.081 --> 01:44:58.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every month for 12 months,</v>

2534
01:44:58.510 --> 01:45:02.650
<v Speaker 6>every four weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and at the end of the year you tally up</v>

2535
01:45:02.651 --> 01:45:04.600
<v Speaker 6>a score,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a race to 12,</v>

2536
01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:09.100
<v Speaker 6>like see who wins each month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the only way to,</v>

2537
01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.270
<v Speaker 6>to really do it would be like you would</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to actually lose body weight.</v>

2538
01:45:13.271 --> 01:45:16.900
<v Speaker 6>You couldn't just dehydrate yourself</v>
<v Speaker 6>every month and go under because if one</v>

2539
01:45:16.901 --> 01:45:18.970
<v Speaker 6>of you keeps going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like say if you guys had to do it,</v>

2540
01:45:18.971 --> 01:45:21.640
<v Speaker 6>like if I was in on the challenge and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you guys have to do it against me,</v>

2541
01:45:21.641 --> 01:45:25.930
<v Speaker 6>I'm 19 pounds lighter than the heaviest</v>
<v Speaker 6>or other than the lightest guy right</v>

2542
01:45:25.931 --> 01:45:26.260
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

2543
01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:29.290
<v Speaker 6>So I would already have an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if I just started losing more and</v>

2544
01:45:29.291 --> 01:45:31.450
<v Speaker 6>more weight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would have to lose body weight in</v>

2545
01:45:31.451 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 6>order to be in the race.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't just lose 19 pounds of body</v>

2546
01:45:34.551 --> 01:45:36.310
<v Speaker 6>weight every month like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't be able to do it.</v>

2547
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:41.550
<v Speaker 6>So if you started today and then every</v>
<v Speaker 6>month you guys had a way in challenge,</v>

2548
01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.920
<v Speaker 6>the number would drop every month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's two,</v>

2549
01:45:44.921 --> 01:45:46.250
<v Speaker 6>19 now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>next month.</v>

2550
01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:46.901
<v Speaker 6>Probably like two.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2551
01:45:46.901 --> 01:45:49.490
<v Speaker 6>seven next month it would be like to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2552
01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:54.010
<v Speaker 6>a tool one and then you would keep going</v>
<v Speaker 6>and going and going until you guys were</v>

2553
01:45:54.011 --> 01:45:56.320
<v Speaker 6>skinny as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You guys will be like bodybuilders by</v>

2554
01:45:56.321 --> 01:45:57.154
<v Speaker 6>the end of the year?</v>

2555
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:58.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>

2556
01:45:58.141 --> 01:45:59.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2557
01:45:59.250 --> 01:46:01.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying I'm sure I'd probably</v>
<v Speaker 5>love being what?</v>

2558
01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:02.970
<v Speaker 5>80 six really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2559
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:04.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

2560
01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:05.940
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't about to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say sure,</v>

2561
01:46:05.941 --> 01:46:09.510
<v Speaker 5>I'd love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But personally I think to fifteens a</v>

2562
01:46:09.511 --> 01:46:11.970
<v Speaker 5>really great weight for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it's still overweight,</v>

2563
01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:14.160
<v Speaker 5>but like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't want to be overweight.</v>

2564
01:46:14.161 --> 01:46:15.540
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be overweight,</v>

2565
01:46:15.541 --> 01:46:19.530
<v Speaker 5>but I also don't want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to look like this.</v>

2566
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:22.050
<v Speaker 5>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I'd love to be fucking yoked,</v>

2567
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:25.890
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if I have the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like crossfit.</v>

2568
01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:27.570
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing crossfit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see it,</v>

2569
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:32.400
<v Speaker 5>and I had to stop because I was afraid I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was building up too much mass because</v>

2570
01:46:32.401 --> 01:46:33.780
<v Speaker 5>you're putting on too much weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2571
01:46:33.781 --> 01:46:35.100
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a weight loss challenge.</v>

2572
01:46:35.101 --> 01:46:37.230
<v Speaker 5>Any weight that comes in and muscle I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want.</v>

2573
01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:39.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to run my actually can</v>
<v Speaker 5>ask about the same thing.</v>

2574
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:40.980
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

2575
01:46:40.981 --> 01:46:42.230
<v Speaker 5>I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2576
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:46.620
<v Speaker 5>done weightlifting at my heaviest and</v>
<v Speaker 5>like six,</v>

2577
01:46:46.621 --> 01:46:47.920
<v Speaker 5>eight weeks ago I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2578
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.900
<v Speaker 5>I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't done.</v>

2579
01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 5>It feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

2580
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.670
<v Speaker 4>actually feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel somewhat like different that I</v>

2581
01:46:53.671 --> 01:46:55.290
<v Speaker 4>haven't touched weights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2582
01:46:55.291 --> 01:46:58.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean it makes a big difference and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the only way to keep the weight off</v>

2583
01:46:58.531 --> 01:47:00.530
<v Speaker 4>while you're doing that you'd have to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>like lightweight,</v>

2584
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:02.820
<v Speaker 4>low reps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're still a weight high reps,</v>

2585
01:47:02.821 --> 01:47:03.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2586
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:03.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Light,</v>

2587
01:47:03.730 --> 01:47:05.390
<v Speaker 4>lightweight high reps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2588
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:07.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought about that and I know some</v>

2589
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:08.970
<v Speaker 4>people are going to tell them like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you should have done.</v>

2590
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.910
<v Speaker 4>You would allow us more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I kind of just pick the fuck anyone</v>

2591
01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:15.750
<v Speaker 4>with any insights or weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a pedestrian like I hate when they</v>

2592
01:47:15.751 --> 01:47:17.310
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

2593
01:47:17.311 --> 01:47:18.900
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not eating a lot of calories,</v>

2594
01:47:18.901 --> 01:47:20.670
<v Speaker 4>your body is going to backfire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start storing fat.</v>

2595
01:47:20.671 --> 01:47:22.890
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell that to the kids in Ethiopia.</v>

2596
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't eat your fucking lose.</v>

2597
01:47:24.961 --> 01:47:26.940
<v Speaker 4>Fucking wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how that fucking works.</v>

2598
01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:29.400
<v Speaker 4>If you burn more calories than you take</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2599
01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:33.330
<v Speaker 4>your body has a certain reaction and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how that fucking works.</v>

2600
01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:36.810
<v Speaker 4>He's done in a scientific route that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's put his body into a state of</v>

2601
01:47:36.811 --> 01:47:39.760
<v Speaker 4>ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's cut out all the sugar and the carbs</v>

2602
01:47:39.761 --> 01:47:42.870
<v Speaker 4>and now his body's burning fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I might've done that too,</v>

2603
01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:45.460
<v Speaker 4>except for the vodka sodas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2604
01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.190
<v Speaker 4>they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll stop you from really getting</v>

2605
01:47:47.191 --> 01:47:50.190
<v Speaker 4>into ketosis of the alcohol will do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have one of those sticks.</v>

2606
01:47:50.191 --> 01:47:52.210
<v Speaker 4>You can piss on a stick sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2607
01:47:52.410 --> 01:47:54.240
<v Speaker 4>This stuff is key.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jenny.</v>

2608
01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:57.030
<v Speaker 4>This is exogenous ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take this stuff,</v>

2609
01:47:57.031 --> 01:48:01.320
<v Speaker 4>it puts you into like you could drink a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Dr Pepper and then you take this</v>

2610
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:04.050
<v Speaker 4>stuff and it'll put you into a state</v>
<v Speaker 4>where your body is burning fat,</v>

2611
01:48:04.051 --> 01:48:05.520
<v Speaker 4>not carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

2612
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.380
<v Speaker 4>You're telling me if I put that in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>vodka soda,</v>

2613
01:48:07.410 --> 01:48:09.250
<v Speaker 4>it was just immediately burning that</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar telling.</v>

2614
01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.700
<v Speaker 4>If you take a vodka soda and then take</v>
<v Speaker 4>this afterwards,</v>

2615
01:48:11.701 --> 01:48:13.830
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't mix the two of them together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's smart,</v>

2616
01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.190
<v Speaker 4>but drink this afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're back on track.</v>

2617
01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:18.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>mindset.</v>

2630
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:59.460
<v Speaker 4>Your mindset is</v>

<v Speaker 4>but unsustainable.</v>

2642
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Everything he's doing is totally</v>
<v Speaker 4>sustainable.</v>

2643
01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:27.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm curious to see what it would be</v>

2644
01:49:27.541 --> 01:49:29.640
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My body had 2000 calories a day,</v>

2645
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:32.330
<v Speaker 4>but what all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that,</v>

2646
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 4>but you like when you get down to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain weight,</v>

2647
01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:37.680
<v Speaker 4>you don't want that because then your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body's gonna start eating it's muscle.</v>

2648
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:39.960
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens when your body gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a certain stages.</v>

2649
01:49:39.961 --> 01:49:41.700
<v Speaker 4>We have to understand about losing</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight.</v>

2650
01:49:41.970 --> 01:49:44.730
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your body doesn't have the amount of</v>

2651
01:49:44.731 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 4>protein that it needs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start consuming your own muscle.</v>

2652
01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 4>I've</v>

2653
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.930
<v Speaker 5>been eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been eating proteins and greens.</v>

2654
01:49:49.931 --> 01:49:50.690
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

2655
01:49:50.690 --> 01:49:51.790
<v Speaker 5>No carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no breads,</v>

2656
01:49:51.791 --> 01:49:54.430
<v Speaker 5>no pastas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beans is the only carb I've had.</v>

2657
01:49:54.431 --> 01:49:57.550
<v Speaker 5>I've only had that twice in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can up that a little bit.</v>

2658
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:59.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you think about like,</v>

2659
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:00.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2660
01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:02.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm only going to take in 2000 calories</v>
<v Speaker 5>a day.</v>

2661
01:50:02.471 --> 01:50:03.970
<v Speaker 5>I want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will lose weight,</v>

2662
01:50:03.971 --> 01:50:07.030
<v Speaker 5>but you also lose strength.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You feel exhausted.</v>

2663
01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.610
<v Speaker 5>Your body starts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had that dinner last night,</v>

2664
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:12.490
<v Speaker 5>that big dinner last night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when I go on the treadmill I felt</v>

2665
01:50:12.491 --> 01:50:17.170
<v Speaker 5>fucking phenomenal like I got on there</v>
<v Speaker 5>and literally it was like 10 miles or</v>

2666
01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.510
<v Speaker 5>seven miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No rush of energy,</v>

2667
01:50:19.511 --> 01:50:20.920
<v Speaker 5>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything from that.</v>

2668
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:22.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that might have fucked you.</v>

2669
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:24.850
<v Speaker 5>You might've been two pounds lighter if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't do that.</v>

2670
01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.550
<v Speaker 5>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might do it to the impulse.</v>

2671
01:50:27.650 --> 01:50:29.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I noticed that that was my bed,</v>

2672
01:50:29.701 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 5>so I was betting on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2673
01:50:31.610 --> 01:50:35.470
<v Speaker 5>that's the bet was he was saying that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are just going to wait until the</v>

2674
01:50:35.471 --> 01:50:40.471
<v Speaker 5>last minute and go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what Graham and I said</v>

2675
01:50:40.571 --> 01:50:42.760
<v Speaker 5>that by the way a month ago I knew that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were going to do,</v>

2676
01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:45.490
<v Speaker 5>but if you're disciplined wasn't on</v>
<v Speaker 5>point and he still would have.</v>

2677
01:50:45.491 --> 01:50:46.330
<v Speaker 5>Got You.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

2678
01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:48.460
<v Speaker 5>We got down to two of these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

2679
01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.980
<v Speaker 5>two little bottles of water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is pretty amazing.</v>

2680
01:50:50.981 --> 01:50:53.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to win tomorrow.</v>

2681
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:58.270
<v Speaker 5>If to win,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be two and a half pounds or</v>

2682
01:50:58.271 --> 01:50:59.440
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Less than me.</v>

2683
01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you might be able to lose even more,</v>

2684
01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:05.500
<v Speaker 5>like if you go fucking crazy today and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd go Bert Kreischer.</v>

2685
01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.960
<v Speaker 5>So the thing is you guys have narrowed</v>
<v Speaker 5>it down,</v>

2686
01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:11.650
<v Speaker 5>this victory is down to 24 hours or less</v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

2687
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:15.460
<v Speaker 5>But if you go fucking crazy and go full</v>
<v Speaker 5>bird all day today,</v>

2688
01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:18.910
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's almost like you can't catch it.</v>

2689
01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:20.620
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't have that gene.</v>

2690
01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:24.220
<v Speaker 5>But what is that long Strand Dna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mickey Mantle genes.</v>

2691
01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:27.690
<v Speaker 5>Nonsense gene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

2692
01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:31.030
<v Speaker 5>this is just discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the thing like,</v>

2693
01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.900
<v Speaker 5>like I've thought about this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that makes this contest</v>

2694
01:51:34.901 --> 01:51:38.650
<v Speaker 5>interesting is also the reason we like</v>
<v Speaker 5>each other because he is very even</v>

2695
01:51:38.651 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 5>keeled and I am fucking all over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>map.</v>

2696
01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 5>I have a combination of the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both of you guys,</v>

2697
01:51:43.991 --> 01:51:45.030
<v Speaker 5>but you definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have,</v>

2698
01:51:45.090 --> 01:51:47.590
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have the same brain I have about</v>

2699
01:51:47.591 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 5>like the way you shoot bows and arrows</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>

2700
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:51.160
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just do that for three hours until</v>

2701
01:51:51.161 --> 01:51:54.170
<v Speaker 5>I need maybe need shoulder surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know like,</v>

2702
01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:54.930
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2703
01:51:54.930 --> 01:51:56.860
<v Speaker 5>or the way you shoot pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're very,</v>

2704
01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.690
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get obsessed with things,</v>

2705
01:51:58.691 --> 01:51:59.870
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why I can't fuck with drawing</v>

2706
01:51:59.871 --> 01:52:01.060
<v Speaker 5>anymore because I get obsessed with it.</v>

2707
01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.610
<v Speaker 5>I get like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tom.</v>

2708
01:52:02.611 --> 01:52:05.680
<v Speaker 5>So even killed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the perfect example of our</v>

2709
01:52:05.681 --> 01:52:09.550
<v Speaker 5>relationship is that first day we were</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Hawaii and I shaved your tits.</v>

2710
01:52:09.630 --> 01:52:13.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it is the funniest Joe.</v>

2711
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:17.590
<v Speaker 5>It is the funniest fucking thing I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever been a part of my life.</v>

2712
01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.790
<v Speaker 5>And he goes to Hawaii and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's out there.</v>

2713
01:52:21.791 --> 01:52:22.301
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

2714
01:52:22.301 --> 01:52:23.200
<v Speaker 5>you know Tom's hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2715
01:52:23.230 --> 01:52:25.000
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't I shave your back for you?</v>

2716
01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:26.410
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think?</v>

2717
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:27.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I started.</v>

2718
01:52:28.330 --> 01:52:31.630
<v Speaker 5>I started to put the volume on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just,</v>

2719
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:32.441
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't put the volume.</v>

2720
01:52:32.441 --> 01:52:36.910
<v Speaker 5>You can hear music on it and friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Charlie and Laurel stand by and support</v>

2721
01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:41.970
<v Speaker 5>and your shaving Tom's back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm shaving his back and then at some</v>

2722
01:52:42.101 --> 01:52:45.620
<v Speaker 5>point in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can just skip ahead at some</v>

2723
01:52:45.621 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 5>point in this,</v>

2724
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I realized that Tom's tit hair connects</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his underarm hair and I go,</v>

2725
01:52:50.001 --> 01:52:51.830
<v Speaker 1>hey buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wanting to hear a pause right there.</v>

2726
01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I realized I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

2727
01:52:55.131 --> 01:52:57.080
<v Speaker 1>let me hollow that out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2728
01:52:57.081 --> 01:52:59.900
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'll do is I'll trim out</v>
<v Speaker 1>contour,</v>

2729
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:03.170
<v Speaker 1>contour it and make your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it so your tid has defined hair and</v>

2730
01:53:03.171 --> 01:53:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you're under on has defined here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not connected like a</v>

2731
01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:07.730
<v Speaker 1>werewolf and then I'll seize her out</v>
<v Speaker 1>your breasts,</v>

2732
01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:10.370
<v Speaker 1>like I'll do a seasonal comin down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>align it up so it looks like you're</v>

2733
01:53:10.371 --> 01:53:14.690
<v Speaker 1>defined and he sold it like real serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

2734
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:20.360
<v Speaker 1>you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom's ernest face staring at me as I do</v>

2735
01:53:20.361 --> 01:53:23.270
<v Speaker 1>this and I'm close to it and I'm looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at him and I'm trimming it.</v>

2736
01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And then as I pulled back I still see</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom's earnest face going,</v>

2737
01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:27.493
<v Speaker 1>does it look good?</v>

2738
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:34.330
<v Speaker 2>And all I see it looks like his tits are</v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing sunglasses and then I realized</v>

2739
01:53:34.721 --> 01:53:35.070
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

2740
01:53:35.070 --> 01:53:38.550
<v Speaker 1>first of like seven days in Hawaii and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got to look like this the whole</v>

2741
01:53:38.551 --> 01:53:40.890
<v Speaker 1>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never seen him laugh.</v>

2742
01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was having a stroke.</v>

2743
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:53.290
<v Speaker 2>You have less body hair back then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2744
01:53:53.291 --> 01:53:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I know you've gained body hair as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got older.</v>

2745
01:53:55.661 --> 01:53:58.900
<v Speaker 2>That's even weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year is this?</v>

2746
01:53:59.070 --> 01:53:59.903
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2747
01:54:01.810 --> 01:54:03.580
<v Speaker 2>gain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much body hair in eight years.</v>

2748
01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird</v>

2749
01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:15.190
<v Speaker 2>looking serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Is looking all serious.</v>

2750
01:54:15.191 --> 01:54:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Thomas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you gonna?</v>

2751
01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Watch me watch it looks terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it makes her look bigger.</v>

2752
01:54:28.391 --> 01:54:33.391
<v Speaker 2>You shaved my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaved under it.</v>

2753
01:54:43.811 --> 01:54:47.680
<v Speaker 2>But you left the hair above it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you have like breastplates.</v>

2754
01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the I've,</v>

2755
01:54:51.130 --> 01:54:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I've never laughed that hard in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole trip is probably me.</v>

2756
01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Tom and push and Leanne became friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I knew we could be</v>

2757
01:54:58.441 --> 01:54:59.180
<v Speaker 1>friends</v>

2758
01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:02.240
<v Speaker 3>is because then our wives became good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2759
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:04.070
<v Speaker 3>that is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you did.</v>

2760
01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.120
<v Speaker 2>That one looks normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Tom,</v>

2761
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 3>what year did you come to la?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2762
01:55:13.851 --> 01:55:16.640
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in six years you put on all that</v>

2763
01:55:16.641 --> 01:55:17.474
<v Speaker 3>weight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2764
01:55:18.610 --> 01:55:20.720
<v Speaker 3>but I also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2765
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:24.830
<v Speaker 3>that's how I graduated high school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>went into college like that.</v>

2766
01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Weight and then I lost all that weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you do that?</v>

2767
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:29.600
<v Speaker 3>Diet and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2768
01:55:29.650 --> 01:55:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what made you abandon it?</v>

2769
01:55:31.810 --> 01:55:32.601
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was slow.</v>

2770
01:55:32.601 --> 01:55:36.740
<v Speaker 3>It was a slow crawl like I got here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was working the night</v>

2771
01:55:36.741 --> 01:55:41.210
<v Speaker 3>shift at a post production place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like all the sudden,</v>

2772
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean it wasn't all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

2773
01:55:42.741 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late night food,</v>

2774
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:45.870
<v Speaker 3>late night food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really weird hours,</v>

2775
01:55:45.871 --> 01:55:49.550
<v Speaker 3>like staying up until four or 5:00 AM</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the graveyard shift and then going</v>

2776
01:55:49.551 --> 01:55:51.840
<v Speaker 3>to bed and all of a sudden you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm up to 25.</v>

2777
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was two.</v>

2778
01:55:53.251 --> 01:55:54.084
<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2779
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:56.310
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you put on 20 pounds over the</v>

2780
01:55:56.311 --> 01:55:58.230
<v Speaker 3>course of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2781
01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:02.250
<v Speaker 3>a couple of shows in production and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not even thinking about it.</v>

2782
01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:07.370
<v Speaker 3>And then at that point to 25 rolls into</v>
<v Speaker 3>2:30 real easy,</v>

2783
01:56:07.650 --> 01:56:08.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2784
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:09.840
<v Speaker 3>it's a slow thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it took,</v>

2785
01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I would say I got here in 2002 by 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 2:25.</v>

2786
01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.660
<v Speaker 4>Now you don't seem to be looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same way he's looking at.</v>

2787
01:56:20.690 --> 01:56:22.940
<v Speaker 4>He's looking at it like this is like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>race.</v>

2788
01:56:23.210 --> 01:56:26.750
<v Speaker 4>You hit the finish line and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>gorge and then the fucking is over.</v>

2789
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:29.960
<v Speaker 4>You seem to be like adjusting your life.</v>

2790
01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I definitely want to have a new</v>

2791
01:56:34.410 --> 01:56:36.530
<v Speaker 3>ceiling of what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2792
01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.760
<v Speaker 3>an acceptable wait and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2793
01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:42.030
<v Speaker 3>I definitely feel like this is a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>livable way.</v>

2794
01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:44.250
<v Speaker 3>What I've been doing like for the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>few months.</v>

2795
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean this last week is a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazier obviously,</v>

2796
01:56:46.711 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 3>but the last few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last month has been,</v>

2797
01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.780
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't been that difficult</v>

2798
01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:53.660
<v Speaker 4>to what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how much weight have you been</v>

2799
01:56:53.661 --> 01:56:55.520
<v Speaker 4>losing a month?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you been noticing?</v>

2800
01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this has been about 10 pounds.</v>

2801
01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Twelve pounds a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>

2802
01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:04.550
<v Speaker 3>But it's doable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's doable and it's not.</v>

2803
01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:07.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not killing myself suffering to do</v>

2804
01:57:07.341 --> 01:57:10.700
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm just on top of the eating and I</v>

2805
01:57:10.701 --> 01:57:11.480
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2806
01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:13.370
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing cardio about six days a</v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

2807
01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Now if you get to a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you,</v>

2808
01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:18.140
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like are you going to like,</v>

2809
01:57:18.190 --> 01:57:19.360
<v Speaker 4>eat more?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

2810
01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.490
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the weight where you go,</v>

2811
01:57:21.491 --> 01:57:22.960
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to lose any more weight.</v>

2812
01:57:22.961 --> 01:57:25.900
<v Speaker 4>I think is less about the number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though we get so obsessed with the</v>

2813
01:57:25.901 --> 01:57:26.650
<v Speaker 4>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2814
01:57:26.650 --> 01:57:28.450
<v Speaker 4>and like the way you feel about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2815
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.141
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2816
01:57:29.141 --> 01:57:31.810
<v Speaker 4>like it especially if you start lifting</v>
<v Speaker 4>weights again and you put on a little</v>

2817
01:57:31.811 --> 01:57:33.730
<v Speaker 4>bit weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body fats lower.</v>

2818
01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:34.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2819
01:57:34.150 --> 01:57:36.280
<v Speaker 3>So I mean like I'm trying not to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with the number,</v>

2820
01:57:36.281 --> 01:57:40.420
<v Speaker 3>but I know like I would want to lose if</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about the number,</v>

2821
01:57:41.050 --> 01:57:44.350
<v Speaker 3>like 15 to 20 more pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is really.</v>

2822
01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:45.513
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

2823
01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I like to lose six pounds more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to,</v>

2824
01:57:48.031 --> 01:57:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get to 15 and then maintain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat healthy and eat clean.</v>

2825
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:52.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also,</v>

2826
01:57:52.351 --> 01:57:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't lie about this and say</v>

2827
01:57:55.690 --> 01:57:57.840
<v Speaker 1>this is a lifestyle like the people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest loser.</v>

2828
01:57:58.020 --> 01:57:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

2829
01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:01.590

<v Speaker 1>I love hot wings.</v>

2830
01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:04.640

<v Speaker 1>feeling of like,</v>

2831
01:58:05.190 --> 01:58:08.130
<v Speaker 1>like I remember I told you a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago that my weight loss program was to</v>

2832
01:58:08.131 --> 01:58:13.131
<v Speaker 1>stop eating appetizers like advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when I make it rain appetizers.</v>

2833
01:58:14.311 --> 01:58:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I love that feeling and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I miss blimpie sandwiches,</v>

2834
01:58:18.511 --> 01:58:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I Miss Pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My girls have been eaten pizza and I'm</v>

2835
01:58:20.641 --> 01:58:22.530
<v Speaker 1>eating cauliflower pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I like.</v>

2836
01:58:22.590 --> 01:58:24.220
<v Speaker 1>But what's cauliflower pizza?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2837
01:58:24.221 --> 01:58:26.340
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take a 12 ounces of cauliflower,</v>

2838
01:58:26.341 --> 01:58:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you steam it in the microwave for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>four minutes.</v>

2839
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.360
<v Speaker 1>You dry it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put one egg in there,</v>

2840
01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:35.040
<v Speaker 1>a third cup of Mozzarella that I'm like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fourth cup of Parmesan and you put it</v>

2841
01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:36.870
<v Speaker 1>into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your crust and then you put it in</v>

2842
01:58:36.871 --> 01:58:38.060
<v Speaker 1>the oven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2843
01:58:38.670 --> 01:58:40.880
<v Speaker 1>every slice is very low calories because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cauliflower.</v>

2844
01:58:40.890 --> 01:58:42.310
<v Speaker 1>All really eating is like a portion</v>

2845
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:44.800
<v Speaker 5>of an egg and some Mozzarella.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really fucking good.</v>

<v Speaker 5>bring it in tomorrow and we can try it.</v>

2848

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll try that.</v>

2849
01:58:49.650 --> 01:58:51.370

<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

<v Speaker 5>food wise,</v>

2852
01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:59.440

<v Speaker 5>shift in the way you live the shift</v>

2853

<v Speaker 5>wife because we're having waffles going</v>

2855

2868
01:59:34.450 --> 01:59:37.450
<v Speaker 5>but they don't get the best results.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best results are gone through</v>

2872
01:59:46.091 --> 01:59:48.490
<v Speaker 5>I was just fucking around with Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

2873
01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:50.050
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they call it the end.</v>

2874
01:59:50.051 --> 01:59:50.620
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

2876
01:59:53.501 --> 01:59:55.060
<v Speaker 5>back the fuck off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>loss thing.</v>

2879
01:59:58.691 --> 02:00:01.920
<v Speaker 5>Like we've got a TV show we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make like Atlanta,</v>

2880
02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:02.231
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2881
02:00:02.231 --> 02:00:04.960
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand burt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he will never work on this TV show.</v>

2882
02:00:04.961 --> 02:00:07.090
<v Speaker 5>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't respect the fact that this</v>

2883
02:00:07.091 --> 02:00:09.390
<v Speaker 5>is what he's focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what I was doing was I was,</v>

2884
02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:10.540
<v Speaker 5>I was setting up accounts.</v>

2885
02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:12.640
<v Speaker 5>It didn't work out right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was setting up accounts at</v>

2886
02:00:12.641 --> 02:00:17.470
<v Speaker 5>different food places so they could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fans could send Tom Food and I was</v>

2887
02:00:17.471 --> 02:00:19.030
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasted a whole day,</v>

2888
02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:20.950
<v Speaker 5>and then I sent him these cookies that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were amazing.</v>

2889
02:00:20.951 --> 02:00:23.260
<v Speaker 5>I sent him to my daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They loved him and I said,</v>

2890
02:00:23.261 --> 02:00:25.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm from the rock to tom and tom didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>even eat them.</v>

2891
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:27.360
<v Speaker 5>He just gave him the fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 5>working on his brand new,</v>

2892
02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:32.170
<v Speaker 5>a $3,000,000 house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're good cookies.</v>

2893
02:00:32.171 --> 02:00:37.171
<v Speaker 5>I want to try them when I get done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're already thinking about wings and</v>

2894
02:00:37.211 --> 02:00:40.570
<v Speaker 5>cookies and pizza and this and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm already thinking about.</v>

2895
02:00:40.810 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm also thinking about the long Strand</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dna,</v>

2896
02:00:43.331 --> 02:00:46.210
<v Speaker 5>mickey mantle jeans I could find.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody</v>

2897
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:49.360
<v Speaker 5>got that mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

2898
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:51.460
<v Speaker 5>I just can't lose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm different.</v>

2899
02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Everybody wants to think they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

2900
02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:55.270
<v Speaker 5>but everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody does.</v>

2901
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:57.970
<v Speaker 5>Including the people that you think</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're different from,</v>

2902
02:00:58.150 --> 02:00:59.380
<v Speaker 5>they think they're different.</v>

2903
02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody thinks they're different.</v>

2904
02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:03.640
<v Speaker 5>That's what gets people knocked the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2905
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:05.650
<v Speaker 5>That's Hashtag [inaudible] the return.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2906
02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:06.920
<v Speaker 5>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2907
02:01:06.970 --> 02:01:09.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm not real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like Ronda Rousey's idea was that</v>

2908
02:01:09.431 --> 02:01:11.230
<v Speaker 5>she's different than everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2909
02:01:11.290 --> 02:01:13.450
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the best in the world that people</v>

2910
02:01:13.451 --> 02:01:16.780
<v Speaker 5>love to have that and sometimes you win</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you really do feel like you are</v>

2911
02:01:16.781 --> 02:01:20.290
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reality is you are a skeleton</v>

2912
02:01:20.291 --> 02:01:24.880
<v Speaker 5>and some fucking cells and you're run by</v>
<v Speaker 5>a central nervous system and your brain</v>

2913
02:01:24.881 --> 02:01:29.020
<v Speaker 5>has a whole bunch of defense mechanisms</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are designed to protect you from</v>

2914
02:01:29.021 --> 02:01:32.470
<v Speaker 5>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of those is that it decides I'm</v>

2915
02:01:32.471 --> 02:01:36.100
<v Speaker 5>different in these motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you fucking agree with them just</v>

2916
02:01:36.101 --> 02:01:37.900
<v Speaker 5>because you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know it's true.</v>

2917
02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:39.650
<v Speaker 5>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that's how you think</v>

2918
02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:42.170
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real.</v>

2919
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:44.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that he was really like,</v>

2920
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:47.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to run 28 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people,</v>

2921
02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.210
<v Speaker 3>how many people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially beautiful girls,</v>

2922
02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.560
<v Speaker 3>how many beautiful girls just think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking special because we were</v>

2923
02:01:53.730 --> 02:01:55.820
<v Speaker 3>talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about that today,</v>

2924
02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:57.590
<v Speaker 3>about the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2925
02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:03.040
<v Speaker 3>the horror and the danger of daddy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>that especially that kind of,</v>

2926
02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:07.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push the princess ideal on their girls</v>

2927
02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:12.710
<v Speaker 3>and that make them think that they're so</v>
<v Speaker 3>special and then that girl kind of seeks</v>

2928
02:02:12.711 --> 02:02:14.090
<v Speaker 3>that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2929
02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.350
<v Speaker 3>and he leaves that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what are the type of guy that</v>

2930
02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:21.260
<v Speaker 3>does go for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually if he's romantically is</v>

2931
02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:23.880
<v Speaker 3>basically a paternal figure to that girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

2932
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:26.510
<v Speaker 3>if he's going to still see her as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>princess,</v>

2933
02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:28.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>princesses are weird.</v>

2934
02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:31.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing that everybody wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a princess.</v>

2935
02:02:31.130 --> 02:02:32.350
<v Speaker 3>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see,</v>

2936
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:34.070
<v Speaker 3>you start to see that it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

2937
02:02:34.071 --> 02:02:37.190
<v Speaker 3>I remember being in high school and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing girls who are like,</v>

2938
02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm the most special and you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I better respect that I'm the most</v>

2939
02:02:41.511 --> 02:02:42.260
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2940
02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:43.580
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone will,</v>

2941
02:02:43.610 --> 02:02:44.770
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to find that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2942
02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:48.470
<v Speaker 3>And that'll be your second daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am more important than anything in</v>

2943
02:02:48.471 --> 02:02:49.200
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2944
02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To carve out time for me.</v>

2945
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:53.990
<v Speaker 3>You've had that speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2946
02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The carve out time for me speech.</v>

2947
02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I ran into a chick one time that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd had relations with.</v>

2948
02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:04.530
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not even discuss it off the air.</v>

2949
02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.560
<v Speaker 3>I've had too many bad situations in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life where someone thinks they're</v>

2950
02:03:09.561 --> 02:03:10.490
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2951
02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:11.690
<v Speaker 3>It gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets.</v>

2952
02:03:12.230 --> 02:03:16.370
<v Speaker 3>It gets at a certain point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to blame yourself for getting</v>

2953
02:03:16.371 --> 02:03:17.540
<v Speaker 3>involved with those people though.</v>

2954
02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Let's let's work this backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think Cameron Hanes,</v>

2955
02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:24.320
<v Speaker 3>the ability that he can run those ultra</v>
<v Speaker 3>marathons,</v>

2956
02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:26.510
<v Speaker 3>that's special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be able to.</v>

2957
02:03:26.511 --> 02:03:28.100
<v Speaker 3>If you meet that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something.</v>

2958
02:03:28.610 --> 02:03:30.430
<v Speaker 3>He would be the last person to call</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2959
02:03:30.431 --> 02:03:31.410
<v Speaker 3>So special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

2960
02:03:31.450 --> 02:03:33.980
<v Speaker 3>But he's all discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could agree that him,</v>

2961
02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:38.690
<v Speaker 3>a guy like him or like conor Mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me give me a cameron hanes speech.</v>

2962
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Cameron Hanes was about 180 plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2963
02:03:41.511 --> 02:03:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Like lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that jazz.</v>

2964
02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And he wanted to run the 200 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what he did was he got down to 165</v>

2965
02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:53.570
<v Speaker 3>and the way he did it was burning 3000</v>
<v Speaker 3>calories,</v>

2966
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:57.170
<v Speaker 3>eating 2000 calories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he never stopped working out,</v>

2967
02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:00.620
<v Speaker 3>he was running like a fucking maniac and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he led his body eat itself.</v>

2968
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:02.870
<v Speaker 3>So he just got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just shrunk.</v>

2969
02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:06.440
<v Speaker 3>I got watched it happen and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden you'll just different like he</v>

2970
02:04:06.441 --> 02:04:08.930
<v Speaker 3>looks very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very skinny but still a little.</v>

2971
02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:11.210
<v Speaker 3>He's getting more [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs a little thicker now,</v>

2972
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:15.230
<v Speaker 3>put on a little bit more weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when he was a running the 205 miles</v>

2973
02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:20.260
<v Speaker 3>when he ran that a big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>78 fucking hours run ran 200,</v>

2974
02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:21.620
<v Speaker 3>five miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do that.</v>

2975
02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a discipline thing.</v>

2976
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:25.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference between that long</v>
<v Speaker 3>strands.</v>

2977
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:33.260
<v Speaker 3>People that think they're special and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like him,</v>

2978
02:04:33.261 --> 02:04:36.230
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't think he's special at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks the only thing about him that</v>

2979
02:04:36.231 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 3>separates him from everybody else's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he works</v>

2980
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:38.910
<v Speaker 6>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

2981
02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:43.190
<v Speaker 6>But how does one do a hundred mile?</v>

02:08:22.291 --> 02:08:24.590
<v Speaker 5>that's where it started at the brewery</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it ended at the brewery.</v>

3075
02:08:24.591 --> 02:08:26.890
<v Speaker 5>It was a big circle to the brewery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did everybody else drink too?</v>

02:08:31.630 --> 02:08:33.580
<v Speaker 5>Well you were probably fueled up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's.</v>

3080
02:08:33.610 --> 02:08:36.550
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of calories in beer and is</v>
<v Speaker 5>also carbohydrates,</v>

3081
02:08:36.551 --> 02:08:40.410
<v Speaker 5>so all the barley and all that jazz</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting when they shoot the gun,</v>

3082
02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:43.030
<v Speaker 5>fuel race tells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't people do that?</v>

3083
02:08:43.770 --> 02:08:47.560
<v Speaker 5>Runner known people after running.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't they like to drink beer for</v>

3084
02:08:47.561 --> 02:08:50.380
<v Speaker 5>recovery?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely don't think so.</v>

3085
02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:54.610
<v Speaker 5>They used to do it drinking beer for</v>
<v Speaker 5>recovery.</v>

3086
02:08:54.611 --> 02:08:56.650
<v Speaker 5>Post workout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to do it in the,</v>

3087
02:08:56.651 --> 02:08:58.180
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Tour de France,</v>

3088
02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:01.060
<v Speaker 5>in the Tour de France.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would stop and drink big heavy</v>

3089
02:09:01.061 --> 02:09:04.750
<v Speaker 5>beers and I would imagine there's like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of calories in that,</v>

3090
02:09:04.751 --> 02:09:05.680
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of calories.</v>

3091
02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:08.890
<v Speaker 5>I think it would make you crash a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>bit though.</v>

3092
02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:11.770
<v Speaker 5>Like drain you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely feel like working out when</v>

3093
02:09:11.771 --> 02:09:13.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3094
02:09:13.090 --> 02:09:14.560
<v Speaker 5>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done it.</v>

3095
02:09:14.590 --> 02:09:16.250
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell us about coke working out.</v>

3096
02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:17.900
<v Speaker 5>I forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That good.</v>

3097
02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:21.610
<v Speaker 5>Here we go to health benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here are a few reasons.</v>

3098
02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:25.480
<v Speaker 5>So after your run the health benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 5>beer,</v>

3099
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:27.620
<v Speaker 5>make that a little larger please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I can get that.</v>

3100
02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:31.180
<v Speaker 5>Although most runners agree that beer is</v>
<v Speaker 5>not exactly a health food.</v>

3101
02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:34.150
<v Speaker 5>There is good news for those of us who</v>
<v Speaker 5>like to imbibe.</v>

3102
02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:38.320
<v Speaker 5>Downing a few cold ones as you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>heading out the door for a run is</v>

3103
02:09:38.321 --> 02:09:42.370
<v Speaker 5>obviously not the best choice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but beer in moderation can be perfectly</v>

3104
02:09:42.371 --> 02:09:45.760
<v Speaker 5>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Option for after a run or on non</v>

3105
02:09:45.761 --> 02:09:47.560
<v Speaker 5>training days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you go,</v>

3106
02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:49.420
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>

3107
02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:51.190
<v Speaker 5>One of my favorite things doing is on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the road,</v>

3108
02:09:51.191 --> 02:09:53.800
<v Speaker 5>especially when I was working on travel</v>
<v Speaker 5>channel is going right back to the hotel</v>

3109
02:09:53.801 --> 02:09:55.480
<v Speaker 5>after dinner and after drinking and</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting into the,</v>

3110
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:58.650
<v Speaker 5>into the gym and working out really a</v>
<v Speaker 5>legit.</v>

3111
02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:00.280
<v Speaker 5>I love getting on the treadmill with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>glass.</v>

3112
02:10:00.281 --> 02:10:04.150
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to you about this drunk</v>
<v Speaker 5>feels like to you.</v>

3113
02:10:04.330 --> 02:10:06.820
<v Speaker 5>I said I feel very different than what</v>
<v Speaker 5>it feels like everyone else.</v>

3114
02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:09.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I had a conversation over the oddly</v>

3115
02:10:09.851 --> 02:10:12.480
<v Speaker 5>enough of the 10 year old yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 5>about being hung over.</v>

3116
02:10:12.850 --> 02:10:15.310
<v Speaker 5>So I guess let me tell you how it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

3117
02:10:15.730 --> 02:10:17.320
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't you feel sick?</v>

3118
02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:18.820
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the other problem I have is I</v>

3119
02:10:18.821 --> 02:10:21.070
<v Speaker 5>don't really feel sick when I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After I drank,</v>

3120
02:10:21.071 --> 02:10:23.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't get hung over good drunk by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

3121
02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:24.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3122
02:10:24.101 --> 02:10:26.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's the other problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>is no one can ever tell him drunk.</v>

3123
02:10:26.690 --> 02:10:28.350
<v Speaker 5>I remember one time when we were in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hawaii,</v>

3124
02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:33.360
<v Speaker 5>actually I remember specifically that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>had been drinking for like 15</v>

3125
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>hours and it was so many beers and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3126
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:43.940
<v Speaker 1>and then liquor and then beers and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our room and I was like,</v>

3127
02:10:43.941 --> 02:10:45.610
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how are you not,</v>

3128
02:10:45.650 --> 02:10:46.520
<v Speaker 1>you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3129
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3130
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:49.940
<v Speaker 1>but you've looked fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

3131
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely not,</v>

3132
02:10:51.650 --> 02:10:54.650
<v Speaker 1>not even close to find right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he,</v>

3133
02:10:54.710 --> 02:10:57.060
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't tell me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not know.</v>

3134
02:10:57.210 --> 02:10:59.980
<v Speaker 1>My wife always says I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot tell when you've been drinking,</v>

3135
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:03.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3136
02:11:03.590 --> 02:11:05.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of,</v>

3137
02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:05.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3138
02:11:05.790 --> 02:11:08.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pump of what I am.</v>

3139
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I think people think one thing I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often do you drink booze days?</v>

3140
02:11:13.401 --> 02:11:14.660
<v Speaker 1>A week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not right now.</v>

3141
02:11:14.661 --> 02:11:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

3142
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:18.010
<v Speaker 1>but you say vodka sodas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3143
02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:19.190
<v Speaker 1>but people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I,</v>

3144
02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 1>if I go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to on stage one time affiliate,</v>

3145
02:11:21.591 --> 02:11:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel well and I just bought a</v>
<v Speaker 1>soda water on stage and everyone was</v>

3146
02:11:24.471 --> 02:11:25.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill it.</v>

3147
02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing in it.</v>

3148
02:11:26.690 --> 02:11:27.740
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh really?</v>

3149
02:11:28.190 --> 02:11:28.671
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3150
02:11:28.671 --> 02:11:29.061
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3151
02:11:29.061 --> 02:11:30.290
<v Speaker 1>we thought you were hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3152
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just struggling.</v>

3153
02:11:31.170 --> 02:11:33.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't like going on stage drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

3154
02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't like being drunk on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3155
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I like standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I got into.</v>

3156
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:40.610
<v Speaker 1>But it's also a part of my personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everything is a joke.</v>

3157
02:11:40.611 --> 02:11:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I want people to be entertained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this whole weight loss thing.</v>

3158
02:11:42.831 --> 02:11:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Supposed to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people to get a kick out of it.</v>

3159
02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could definitely have stopped drinking</v>

3160
02:11:47.931 --> 02:11:49.910
<v Speaker 1>and been a bore and just been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3161
02:11:49.911 --> 02:11:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I think I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could definitely take him.</v>

3162
02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:54.140
<v Speaker 1>But I like the fun of juice going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

3163
02:11:54.141 --> 02:11:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how many days a week do you think</v>

3164
02:11:57.411 --> 02:11:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you drink are definitely three.</v>

3165
02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:02.960
<v Speaker 1>That just it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you drove up saying definitely three.</v>

3166
02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:06.020
<v Speaker 1>So you drink less than you don't drink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3167
02:12:06.021 --> 02:12:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I probably drink more than I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

3168
02:12:07.511 --> 02:12:08.700
<v Speaker 1>That's not three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3169
02:12:09.370 --> 02:12:12.620
<v Speaker 1>This feels like an intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The just curious.</v>

3170
02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when we were the closest of</v>

3171
02:12:16.491 --> 02:12:18.400
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember he's</v>

3172
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:24.170
<v Speaker 1>were a good father and loved seeing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Playing with your children.</v>

3173
02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:26.153
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

3174
02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:29.920
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3175
02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>attract New Year's Eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted to,</v>

3176
02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I only had two drinks and I spent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night in a hotel.</v>

3177
02:12:34.491 --> 02:12:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to drive home because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought the roads would be crazy.</v>

3178
02:12:37.210 --> 02:12:39.530
<v Speaker 1>So I received.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't drink yesterday at the rams game.</v>

3179
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Didn't drink today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink tomorrow and then I get on a</v>

3180
02:12:42.921 --> 02:12:44.870
<v Speaker 1>plane to New Jersey on the stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>factory.</v>

3181
02:12:44.871 --> 02:12:49.871
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe maybe I'll drink five of the</v>

3182
02:12:50.781 --> 02:12:52.730
<v Speaker 1>seven nights or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven,</v>

3183
02:12:52.731 --> 02:12:53.564
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

3184
02:12:54.010 --> 02:12:56.780
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's an unusual day because you're</v>

3185
02:12:56.810 --> 02:12:59.870
<v Speaker 1>cutting back in order to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm home with the girls,</v>

3186
02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason for me to drink like</v>

3187
02:13:02.130 --> 02:13:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a good night's sleep.</v>

3188
02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I like waking up and being active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like going ice skating with them.</v>

3189
02:13:07.761 --> 02:13:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3190
02:13:09.561 --> 02:13:11.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times people come on my podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

3191
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a shot with the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3192
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll never not let them have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course,</v>

3193
02:13:17.150 --> 02:13:21.350
<v Speaker 1>and I count that as a drinking day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll have one shot but that wouldn't</v>

3194
02:13:21.351 --> 02:13:22.184
<v Speaker 1>affect me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't.</v>

3195
02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm to know and I'm different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like how often do you think that.</v>

3196
02:13:26.590 --> 02:13:28.280
<v Speaker 1>No different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No different thing.</v>

3197
02:13:28.281 --> 02:13:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm different than everybody.</v>

3198
02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't everyone thinks they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

3199
02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't.</v>

3200
02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:34.550
<v Speaker 4>You don't know by the way.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So there you go.</v>

<v Speaker 4>tell us,</v>

3209
02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:52.890
<v Speaker 4>Everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does Rogan do it?</v>

3210
02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:54.990
<v Speaker 4>And I just got these different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are different than me.</v>

3211
02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:59.100
<v Speaker 4>I do it to keep from going crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's my mental problem is that have</v>

3212
02:13:59.101 --> 02:14:01.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't have things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not happy.</v>

3213
02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just figured out a long time ago in</v>

3214
02:14:04.921 --> 02:14:06.330
<v Speaker 4>order to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me to be happy,</v>

3215
02:14:06.690 --> 02:14:11.690
<v Speaker 4>I have to be exhausted in busy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to be burnt out from working out,</v>

3216
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:16.710
<v Speaker 4>like not burnt out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have to even myself out and I have</v>

3217
02:14:16.711 --> 02:14:17.850
<v Speaker 4>to have puzzles.</v>

3218
02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.830
<v Speaker 4>I've done things to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing.</v>

3219
02:14:19.831 --> 02:14:22.830
<v Speaker 4>I think being busy makes definitely me</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel better.</v>

3220
02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.980
<v Speaker 4>You feel like you're getting the worst</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling is I'm feeling like a lazy bitch</v>

3221
02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:31.380
<v Speaker 4>ain't doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your level two honestly though.</v>

3222
02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:33.750
<v Speaker 4>And he's right among.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got It is.</v>

3223
02:14:33.751 --> 02:14:38.070

<v Speaker 4>do like three,</v>

3227
02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I've seen you repeat</v>

3228
02:14:50.730 --> 02:14:53.220
<v Speaker 4>anything at the store in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>past month.</v>

3229
02:14:53.221 --> 02:14:57.270
<v Speaker 4>I've been there like it's off the charts</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I just did a special,</v>

3230
02:14:57.570 --> 02:14:59.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once I released a special.</v>

3231
02:14:59.190 --> 02:14:59.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>

3232
02:14:59.701 --> 02:15:02.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm still doing the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to chip away at new stuff and</v>

3233
02:15:02.821 --> 02:15:05.460
<v Speaker 4>people get mad at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm still in the new stuff.</v>

3234
02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm working on new stuff.</v>

3235
02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:09.830
<v Speaker 4>I've seen the brand new stuff every</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking time you aren't.</v>

3236
02:15:09.831 --> 02:15:10.664
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3237
02:15:12.810 --> 02:15:14.250
<v Speaker 4>got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really like discipline.</v>

3238
02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:15.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

3239
02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:18.510
<v Speaker 4>I wrote the other way too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you have to write like that.</v>

3240
02:15:18.511 --> 02:15:20.850
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't tell people what to do</v>

3241
02:15:20.851 --> 02:15:22.560
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of people don't like to</v>
<v Speaker 4>write this way,</v>

3242
02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.940
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like this sitting out in</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of a fucking computer with nothing</v>

3243
02:15:26.941 --> 02:15:31.800
<v Speaker 4>but writing in my mind it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it enhances my ability to write on stage</v>

3244
02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:37.010
<v Speaker 4>and it gives me tools that I can use to</v>
<v Speaker 4>ad Lib and do it the other way as well.</v>

3245
02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:39.390
<v Speaker 4>I think that's true because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that people say,</v>

3246
02:15:39.391 --> 02:15:40.310
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I write on stage.</v>

3247
02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:41.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

3248
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:42.930
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody does.</v>

3249
02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.380
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people write on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think you should right in front of</v>

3250
02:15:46.381 --> 02:15:49.260
<v Speaker 4>a fucking notebook to have a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>

3251
02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:50.550
<v Speaker 4>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

3252
02:15:50.970 --> 02:15:51.600
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean like,</v>

3253
02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:54.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't inspire me creatively to sit.</v>

3254
02:15:54.490 --> 02:15:57.120
<v Speaker 4>It's because you got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a discipline.</v>

3255
02:15:57.180 --> 02:15:57.830
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done it.</v>

3256
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:59.190
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've definitely done it.</v>

3257
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:02.230
<v Speaker 4>It just does like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm being dead serious,</v>

3258
02:16:02.231 --> 02:16:04.890
<v Speaker 4>if I take a walk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my brain will start working and that's</v>

3259
02:16:04.891 --> 02:16:07.650
<v Speaker 4>fine too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as you dedicate specific time to</v>

3260
02:16:07.651 --> 02:16:09.630
<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if it's just like a walking thing</v>

3261
02:16:09.631 --> 02:16:12.500
<v Speaker 4>and then you talk into a microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to me is it's,</v>

3262
02:16:12.530 --> 02:16:13.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can call it writing.</v>

3263
02:16:13.590 --> 02:16:15.270
<v Speaker 4>Like if I'm sitting in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>computer,</v>

3264
02:16:15.271 --> 02:16:19.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm writing in air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're walking and you talk to</v>

3265
02:16:19.441 --> 02:16:21.240
<v Speaker 4>your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have an idea and you record it.</v>

3266
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:24.720
<v Speaker 4>That's writing to just creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do that,</v>

3267
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:28.680
<v Speaker 4>but you have to have my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my thinking is the more time you spend</v>

3268
02:16:28.681 --> 02:16:32.320
<v Speaker 4>forcing yourself to like right now is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the desperate times because my</v>

3269
02:16:32.321 --> 02:16:35.470
<v Speaker 4>specialist just released and I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3270
02:16:35.530 --> 02:16:37.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did new years and I'm doing these big</v>

3271
02:16:37.751 --> 02:16:42.190
<v Speaker 4>shows and I'm doing an hour and I got a</v>
<v Speaker 4>new fucking shit and some of it is</v>

3272
02:16:42.550 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 4>unlike colt legs.</v>

3273
02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:48.280
<v Speaker 4>Some of my new materials look</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some of it's alive,</v>

3274
02:16:48.310 --> 02:16:51.580
<v Speaker 4>some of it's killing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of it's like new stuff that's doing</v>

3275
02:16:51.581 --> 02:16:54.390
<v Speaker 4>really well and other stuff is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time I do it was like,</v>

3276
02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:57.160
<v Speaker 4>is it going to work tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I going to find a new way to do it,</v>

3277
02:16:57.460 --> 02:16:59.530
<v Speaker 4>am I going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes out of nowhere I'm</v>

3278
02:16:59.531 --> 02:17:01.450
<v Speaker 4>just taking a chance and I'm going the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong way.</v>

3279
02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I take a chance and I start talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

3280
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.820
<v Speaker 4>I'll do the punchline first or I'll do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this part.</v>

3281
02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:07.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3282
02:17:07.450 --> 02:17:09.850
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the strongest part of it leading into</v>

3283
02:17:09.851 --> 02:17:11.710
<v Speaker 4>the weakest part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for no reason,</v>

3284
02:17:11.711 --> 02:17:14.100
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just take this crazy chance to try it</v>

3285
02:17:14.110 --> 02:17:16.340
<v Speaker 4>and I know while I'm doing it I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah,</v>

3286
02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:19.210
<v Speaker 4>going can dig yourself out of this hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's what gets you through it.</v>

3287
02:17:19.450 --> 02:17:20.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that gets you through it</v>

3288
02:17:20.741 --> 02:17:24.400
<v Speaker 4>as like a lot of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've just got to keep hammering sets</v>

3289
02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:26.860
<v Speaker 4>and then every mistake you make from</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3290
02:17:26.861 --> 02:17:31.861
<v Speaker 4>you applied to the next set and then six</v>
<v Speaker 4>months down the line you have a real</v>

3291
02:17:32.021 --> 02:17:33.630
<v Speaker 4>hour that you could put in a special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No wait,</v>

3292
02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:36.070
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about that real quickly</v>
<v Speaker 4>because a,</v>

3293
02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:37.413
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3294
02:17:37.450 --> 02:17:39.220
<v Speaker 4>I think you got to be on stage and be</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>

3295
02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:40.780
<v Speaker 4>Like that's why I love weekends,</v>

3298

<v Speaker 4>off these big ass places.</v>

3301

<v Speaker 4>Now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do clubs,</v>

3302
02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:53.320
<v Speaker 4>I want to do more clubs.</v>

3303

<v Speaker 4>to turn around an hour or for</v>

3312

<v Speaker 4>production?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
