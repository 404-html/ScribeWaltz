105
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 4>He says it only trains you to be a machine on the outside but also trains you to</v>

106
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 4>be a machine on the inside.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

151
00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:26.271
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

152
00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:28.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm so tired of you telling me your opinion.</v>

153
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.140
<v Speaker 4>It's all the same to also,</v>

154
00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:32.930
<v Speaker 4>what annoys me is when someone goes fucking moron.</v>

155
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.950
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>

156
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.430
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

157
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.760
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

158
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 4>That's what you did.</v>

159
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.801
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

160
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.021
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

161
00:04:36.021 --> 00:04:36.201
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

162
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:38.420
<v Speaker 4>you put like that's not doing anything by going,</v>

163
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.190
<v Speaker 4>hey Trump shuck my dick.</v>

164
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.211
<v Speaker 4>All right dude.</v>

165
00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:41.871
<v Speaker 4>Well you got them.</v>

166
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 4>Here's my take on that.</v>

167
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.151
<v Speaker 4>If it's that,</v>

168
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:44.960
<v Speaker 4>if it's fucking moron,</v>

169
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.130
<v Speaker 4>you're not even supposed to listen.</v>

170
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.660
<v Speaker 4>That's supposed to not even go in.</v>

171
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.200
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

172
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.920
<v Speaker 4>Cause there's not a,</v>

173
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.660
<v Speaker 4>this is not effective communication.</v>

174
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:51.950
<v Speaker 4>So if you engage that guy,</v>

175
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.990
<v Speaker 4>don't just completely waste your time.</v>

176
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.910
<v Speaker 4>Even if you get upset at you,</v>

177
00:04:55.911 --> 00:04:56.930
<v Speaker 4>completely waste your time.</v>

178
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 4>I wipe it away,</v>

179
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.760
<v Speaker 4>but I see it and I'm like,</v>

180
00:04:58.761 --> 00:04:58.851
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

181
00:04:58.851 --> 00:04:59.211
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

182
00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:02.480
<v Speaker 4>This is the one that gets me as Nazi fucking Nazi Nazi.</v>

183
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.081
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

184
00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:05.090
<v Speaker 4>he's a Nazi and you're a Nazi fascist.</v>

185
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 4>They throw these words around.</v>

186
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.420
<v Speaker 4>They really don't even know what the fuck they're saying.</v>

187
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 4>Like if you really think that everybody who looks likes Trump is a Nazi,</v>

188
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.680
<v Speaker 4>you're missing.</v>

189
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.250
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

190
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.080
<v Speaker 4>You're missing a giant point.</v>

191
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.351
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

192
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking up everything.</v>

193
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.990
<v Speaker 4>You're ruining this conversation.</v>

194
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.720
<v Speaker 4>You're right about a lot of the shitty does wrong here,</v>

195
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:22.670
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as you say he's a Nazi right,</v>

196
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.870
<v Speaker 4>and that there's Nazi,</v>

197
00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:24.531
<v Speaker 4>everyone's a Nazi.</v>

198
00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:27.530
<v Speaker 4>Well then when real Nazis come around have been to have a better name.</v>

199
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

200
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

201
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.410
<v Speaker 4>You can't really cook called Nazis.</v>

202
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.590
<v Speaker 4>He can't fucking take the word Nazi and applied to shit.</v>

203
00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Speaker 4>That's not Nazis.</v>

204
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:35.300
<v Speaker 4>That's dangerous.</v>

205
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.960
<v Speaker 4>Like people say like cost someone a murderer.</v>

206
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.070
<v Speaker 4>Why'd you call him a murderer?</v>

207
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Because he yelled and insult at that man.</v>

208
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.620
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

209
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.520
<v Speaker 4>That's not a murderer.</v>

210
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.940
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

211
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.870
<v Speaker 4>But you can't do that.</v>

212
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with calling someone a Nazi.</v>

213
00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:47.564
<v Speaker 4>That's not a Nazi.</v>

214
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.740
<v Speaker 4>He might be a moron.</v>

215
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.210
<v Speaker 4>He might be a fool.</v>

216
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.840
<v Speaker 4>He might be into Trump just because he's a dumb guy and he likes the fact</v>

217
00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:55.070
<v Speaker 4>there's a white guy in office.</v>

218
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.600
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't mean he's a Nazi.</v>

219
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 4>But it's also like the biggest problem that I have is like you're,</v>

220
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 4>it's still illegal to be an asshole.</v>

221
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not illegal to be a dick.</v>

222
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.941
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

223
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 4>If someone's,</v>

224
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 4>if someone says something you don't like where it's not against the law.</v>

225
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

226
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.463
<v Speaker 4>my number one</v>

227
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 5>concern with all this stuff is that I think it's happening so fast and so many</v>

228
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 5>things are taking place in so many different realms when it comes to innovation</v>

229
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 5>that this stuff will just catch up to us before we even recognize it's happened.</v>

230
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 5>And it will be too late for sure.</v>

231
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean even just forget every single,</v>

232
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 5>let's even just the whole,</v>

233
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

234
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.050
<v Speaker 5>atomic bomb see,</v>

235
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 5>should allow for the last ever since we started from the 1940s to today,</v>

236
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.910
<v Speaker 5>there have been some seriously close calls.</v>

237
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 5>There was a,</v>

238
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

239
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.880
<v Speaker 5>did you remember to one that was wanting to 1980s,</v>

240
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 5>I think right before the end of the Cold War where there was,</v>

241
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:43.131
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

242
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:43.964
<v Speaker 5>Russia,</v>

243
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

244
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 5>the guy goes to his boring job where they are supposed to look for missiles from</v>

245
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 5>the United States and nothing ever happened day after day after day.</v>

246
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 5>And at one day there's a bleep on the radar and you're like,</v>

247
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 5>oh shit.</v>

248
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.791
<v Speaker 5>And he's the guy,</v>

249
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.570
<v Speaker 5>he's jaw but to clearly superior.</v>

250
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.551
<v Speaker 5>And then if he does,</v>

251
00:06:58.551 --> 00:06:59.230
<v Speaker 5>the outs are,</v>

252
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 5>they are going to press the button it and he's like,</v>

253
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:01.611
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

254
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:01.731
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

255
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:01.791
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

256
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

257
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

258
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 5>let's come down.</v>

259
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 5>Maybe this is wrong.</v>

260
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.841
<v Speaker 5>I made a concern,</v>

261
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:06.621
<v Speaker 5>not that stupid.</v>

262
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 5>They will not send one atomic bomb before they do it.</v>

263
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:09.651
<v Speaker 5>They send a bunch.</v>

264
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 5>So these must be a mistake.</v>

265
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.530
<v Speaker 5>Let's hold it,</v>

266
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 5>relax three minutes later.</v>

267
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 5>And other beliefs and other belief and other,</v>

268
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

269
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>

270
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 5>they're setting to get a bunch of atomic bombs.</v>

271
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 5>These is the real deal.</v>

272
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.271
<v Speaker 5>And the guy,</v>

273
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 5>Steele doesn't do what he's supposed to.</v>

274
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 5>He's feels like if I make this call,</v>

275
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 5>nuclear war starts,</v>

276
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.530
<v Speaker 5>I need to be [inaudible] was in percent convenes.</v>

277
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 5>The evidence in front of them is pretty solid,</v>

278
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 5>but I still don't feel it.</v>

279
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 5>And then five minutes later all the beliefs go off.</v>

280
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:39.850
<v Speaker 5>It was a mistake on the radar and it was like some random bleep and uh,</v>

281
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 5>the guy probably drank a bottle of vodka straight because he was like,</v>

282
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.960
<v Speaker 5>do you know the almost caused world war three?</v>

283
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.803
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

284
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

285
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 5>most off ours,</v>

286
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.590
<v Speaker 5>all their lives now to some Russian dude in the 1980s,</v>

287
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 5>who decided not to do what he was supposed to.</v>

288
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 5>And then because of the stupid mistake,</v>

289
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 5>stupid bug in the radar,</v>

290
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.310
<v Speaker 5>that's a pretty open ended</v>

291
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.281
<v Speaker 4>description,</v>

292
00:08:05.281 --> 00:08:05.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

293
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:05.791
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

294
00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:07.170
<v Speaker 4>it's so open ended.</v>

295
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.830
<v Speaker 4>There were so many like weird performance art things that would happen.</v>

296
00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:10.951
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

297
00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:11.191
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

298
00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:12.660
<v Speaker 4>we had performance art class.</v>

299
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:17.040
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy that like taped his genitals to the side and put on lipstick in</v>

300
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:22.041
<v Speaker 4>a mirror and that was his performance art piece or the girl that night and we</v>

301
00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 4>would all sit there and watch it.</v>

302
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Did you see his genitals?</v>

303
00:08:27.061 --> 00:08:29.940
<v Speaker 4>Did he go naked and pull it aside or how did he do that?</v>

304
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.470
<v Speaker 4>That's a really good question.</v>

305
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 4>And I like how your mind just went there.</v>

306
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:33.841
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

307
00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:34.950
<v Speaker 4>what actually happened?</v>

308
00:08:34.951 --> 00:08:36.300
<v Speaker 4>I think I blocked it out</v>

309
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.520
<v Speaker 4>because I think you could probably get away with doing that under the guise of</v>

310
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.140
<v Speaker 4>it being something you're doing,</v>

311
00:08:43.141 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

312
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 4>in a class somewhere.</v>

313
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.891
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

314
00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:47.760
<v Speaker 4>You get away with us.</v>

315
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:50.460
<v Speaker 4>So pervy I think I was focused on his beautiful lips.</v>

316
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.590
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to be polite and not look down there.</v>

317
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 4>Another woman was obese and her was,</v>

318
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 4>she had preset up.</v>

319
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 4>We weren't it where she was doing the performance,</v>

320
00:08:59.410 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

321
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 4>butter pats in like dominoes,</v>

322
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

323
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

324
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 4>a few thousand of them in a line and she was obese and she crawled on the</v>

325
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:08.334
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

326
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 4>She didn't actually eat them,</v>

327
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 4>but it was something that's weird.</v>

328
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 4>My mind kind of drops off.</v>

329
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 4>I remember specific parts of it,</v>

330
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 4>but I don't,</v>

331
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.710
<v Speaker 4>I think she just was collecting the butter pieces and crawling and that was her</v>

332
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:20.161
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>

333
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 4>These another guy,</v>

334
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.633
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

335
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

336
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

337
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.761
<v Speaker 4>this was,</v>

338
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 4>I went to Detroit and then finished in San Francisco.</v>

339
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 4>And San Francisco is known for being a real performance art history.</v>

340
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.763
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the,</v>

341
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

342
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 4>the most famous performance artist.</v>

343
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows where that was.</v>

344
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.990
<v Speaker 4>The scene was in San Francisco.</v>

345
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:37.330
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

346
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.163
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

347
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 4>it was two story really beautiful campus overlooking,</v>

348
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 4>you could see a Lombard street on one side.</v>

349
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 4>You could see the water on the other side.</v>

350
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

351
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.240
<v Speaker 4>another guy's piece was to jump from the second story to a tree just like that.</v>

352
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 4>He may or may not have made the jump and that was his art,</v>

353
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 4>his art pieces of jumping from a window to a tree.</v>

354
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

355
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

356
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 4>I know this other guy,</v>

357
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.340
<v Speaker 4>the room where we had our class,</v>

358
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 4>he had a bread machine.</v>

359
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:08.491
<v Speaker 4>This was back,</v>

360
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:08.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

361
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:12.310
<v Speaker 4>bread machines where new technology at a breadmaker,</v>

362
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.081
<v Speaker 4>you know those machines,</v>

363
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 4>you can make it.</v>

364
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 4>I guess it just does the dough,</v>

365
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:15.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

366
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.820
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe it bakes it.</v>

367
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 4>I think it just needs the dough.</v>

368
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 4>And then you bake it,</v>

369
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 4>or I don't know if you bake it in the machine or no,</v>

370
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:22.040
<v Speaker 4>you bake it in the machine.</v>

371
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:22.861
<v Speaker 4>It's all coming back to me.</v>

372
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 4>He bakes it in the machine.</v>

373
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 4>We come into the classroom as he's baking it,</v>

374
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 4>there's always like a reveal and these pieces,</v>

375
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:28.981
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

376
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 4>So we come in,</v>

377
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 4>he's taken plaster from the wall and put it in the bread.</v>

378
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 4>He's Fed us the bread.</v>

379
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.550
<v Speaker 4>Half of us get it,</v>

380
00:10:38.551 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 4>half of us don't.</v>

381
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 4>And there's plaster and the bread.</v>

382
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Why do you put plaster and his bread?</v>

383
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 4>It was something about communism.</v>

384
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 4>Some good the bread,</v>

385
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.133
<v Speaker 4>some don't.</v>

386
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 4>But even if you get the bread,</v>

387
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.690
<v Speaker 4>there's plaster.</v>

388
00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 4>And so in your face,</v>

389
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

390
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
