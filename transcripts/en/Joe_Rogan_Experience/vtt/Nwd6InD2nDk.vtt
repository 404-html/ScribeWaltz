00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Well good already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even see a countdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

3
00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:07.660
<v Speaker 1>you're so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.501
<v Speaker 1>thanks for doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark.</v>

5
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

6
00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:11.770
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed your tweets.</v>

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I've checked out your website and mark's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daily Apple and,</v>

8
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your,</v>

9
00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:17.974
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different rules for the primal </v>

10
00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:20.584
<v Speaker 1>blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found this really fascinating </v>

11
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>it seems really straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like,</v>

13
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.873
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this makes like eat lots of </v>

14
00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:30.304
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insects and plants move around a lot at </v>

15
00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>a slow pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift heavy,</v>

16
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:34.504
<v Speaker 1>things run really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you've done essentially is </v>

17
00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 1>created a guideline for optimizing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and your body.</v>

18
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to be healthy from a </v>

20
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.270
<v Speaker 1>really early age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 12 or 13 and a read a lot of books.</v>

21
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do the right thing.</v>

22
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to figure out the,</v>

23
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.720
<v Speaker 1>the hacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>before they were called hacks and got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where I was,</v>

25
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a lot of running because </v>

26
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.090
<v Speaker 1>aerobics was supposedly going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you live longer.</v>

27
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.923
<v Speaker 1>I was eating complex carbohydrates and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of them in order to fuel the </v>

28
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:08.974
<v Speaker 1>aerobics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became a pretty good a endurance </v>

29
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I fell apart,</v>

30
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.303
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result of the training and the </v>

31
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.863
<v Speaker 1>result it turns out of the Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Diet was very proinflammatory as </v>

32
00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>we say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started doing research into,</v>

33
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ways in which I could re access this</v>

34
00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:29.080
<v Speaker 1>health that I was seeking from the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

35
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not fall apart and not be decrepit </v>

36
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>and beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 1>and this became my mantra is how can I </v>
<v Speaker 1>be strong,</v>

38
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:37.414
<v Speaker 1>lean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fit and healthy with the least </v>

39
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>amount of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

40
00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>

41
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 1>calorie counting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>portion control,</v>

42
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.123
<v Speaker 1>and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where it led me was down this path </v>

43
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 1>of looking at human evolution and how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to where we are today,</v>

44
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:52.654
<v Speaker 1>how we derived this genetic recipe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have that wants us to be strong </v>

45
00:01:57.671 --> 00:01:58.504
<v Speaker 1>and fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combining the research only in the last </v>

46
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:03.610
<v Speaker 1>10 or 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.503
<v Speaker 1>with the modern genome [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequencing the genome and figuring out </v>

48
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the actual mechanism of how lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors and foods and sun exposure and</v>

49
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 1>sleep turn genes on or off.</v>

50
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can turn on genes that make us </v>

51
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.663
<v Speaker 1>a strong and build muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can turn on genes that burn fat </v>

52
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>more efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then say glucose.</v>

53
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could turn off genes that caused us</v>

54
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>to be moody and depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn off,</v>

55
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might predispose us to,</v>

56
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get cancer.</v>

57
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>And when I arrived at was sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple set of guidelines.</v>

58
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:35.104
<v Speaker 1>He's 10 primal blueprint laws that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically emulate a human nature and </v>

59
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:44.560
<v Speaker 1>human behavior for the first two and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half million years of our existence.</v>

60
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.663
<v Speaker 1>So the genome was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was forged in this crucible of eat </v>

61
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 1>plants and animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>avoid poisonous things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move around a lot.</v>

63
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 1>At a low level activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sprint once in a while,</v>

64
00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:57.784
<v Speaker 1>lift heavy things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every human that ever lived up until </v>

65
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years ago did that every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

66
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:04.624
<v Speaker 1>And that's how those genes got passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>along to the next generation to become </v>

67
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:09.064
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

68
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.023
<v Speaker 1>Where we've screwed up is in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly the last couple of hundred </v>

69
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.313
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but starting 10,000 years ago with a </v>

70
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.833
<v Speaker 1>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went from being a hunter gatherers </v>

71
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.043
<v Speaker 1>and moving around a lot to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>sedentary and sitting in one place and </v>

72
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating processed foods.</v>

73
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>not terry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not disposing of our waste.</v>

75
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.951
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of,</v>

76
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:30.784
<v Speaker 1>lots of little things that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspired to make us a smaller and </v>

77
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.734
<v Speaker 1>weaker and more susceptible to disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were involved in triathletes and </v>

78
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>endurance activities which kind of break</v>
<v Speaker 1>down your body.</v>

79
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the big issues that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people have with,</v>

80
00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that kind of training.</v>

81
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just constant and brutal and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>catabolic.</v>

82
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.091
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

83
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:51.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great pursuit.</v>

85
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't take back my years as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance athlete.</v>

86
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:56.494
<v Speaker 1>I was a marathoner in the 70s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it was a triathlete in the </v>

87
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 1>early days of triathlon and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>all throughout the 80s.</v>

89
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>But the training was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's devastating.</v>

90
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>It really does tear you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

91
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.923
<v Speaker 1>the assumption was at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time that you had to put more </v>

92
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>miles in than anyone else to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>

93
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:14.970
<v Speaker 1>You had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dial everything down.</v>

95
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>You had to work harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to suffer more.</v>

96
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>It had to struggle more to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatness or to,</v>

97
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>or to win races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

98
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>what we've discovered in the last five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years is that it doesn't have to be that</v>

99
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>

100
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:32.390
<v Speaker 1>That it's only the last five years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

101
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>we're talking 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2011.</v>

102
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

103
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this,</v>

104
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new paradigm is based on science.</v>

105
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It's been brewing for 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't the,</v>

106
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>the findings weren't palatable to most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the athletes who are training.</v>

107
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>They certainly weren't palatable.</v>

108
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>The coaches who'd had been invested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>training a certain way,</v>

109
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>putting it a lot of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating lots of carbohydrates,</v>

110
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.860
<v Speaker 1>managing glycogen throughout an event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>which meant not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate loading the night before a </v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

113
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.424
<v Speaker 1>but seeing how many gel packs you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>slam down in an hour to keep the sugar </v>

114
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>burn throughput going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

115
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>and that's certainly what my generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of athletes,</v>

116
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up depending on.</v>

117
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we all trained that way and it,</v>

118
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and it was sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

119
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.193
<v Speaker 1>it was counterintuitive to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could learn how to burn fat as much </v>

120
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:23.314
<v Speaker 1>more efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could possibly go faster by </v>

121
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:26.554
<v Speaker 1>going slower under certain circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could spend time in the gym </v>

122
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>doing heavyweights and have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself in a,</v>

123
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in better endurance.</v>

124
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.233
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these later sort of developments that </v>

125
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>come out of the laboratory and come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the clinical studies,</v>

126
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were sort of interesting to the </v>

127
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>people who are reading them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knew how to read the studies,</v>

128
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't make it into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream a training mechanism.</v>

129
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
<v Speaker 1>What was the science based on where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people had used carbo loading carb</v>

130
00:05:57.731 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>loading</v>

131
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 2>and using all those gel packs and eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of pastas and stuff.</v>

132
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did that come from?</v>

133
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the,</v>

134
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind that?</v>

135
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

136
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.810
<v Speaker 1>that came from studies that they go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the 30s and forties,</v>

137
00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:11.644
<v Speaker 1>but it was basically this notion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the body needs to burn glucose to go </v>

138
00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:19.120
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

139
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.103
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was assumed that you couldn't burn </v>

140
00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:26.020
<v Speaker 1>fat at a high rate of throughput.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you couldn't burn fat,</v>

141
00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:27.940
<v Speaker 1>then the only thing he could do was </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage your glycogen.</v>

142
00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:31.990
<v Speaker 1>There's muscles can store four or 500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>grams of glycogen Max,</v>

143
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.290
<v Speaker 1>which is only enough to run 20 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

144
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

145
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.210
<v Speaker 1>if you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

146
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you had to learn how to manage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>glycogen so he didn't deplete it in a,</v>

147
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.180
<v Speaker 1>in a marathon for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd hit the wall at 20 miles.</v>

148
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.220
<v Speaker 1>So how'd you get through the wall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

149
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>you start to learn how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

150
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:50.584
<v Speaker 1>gatorade became out of the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gatorade was the great first real </v>

151
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.580
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing substance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes used.</v>

152
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.580
<v Speaker 1>You could drink this sugary drink that </v>
<v Speaker 1>had salt in it in a race and um,</v>

153
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.860
<v Speaker 1>and then stave off that wall a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>more miles.</v>

154
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.800
<v Speaker 1>So for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for decades,</v>

155
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.663
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science revolved around a </v>

156
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.880
<v Speaker 1>continually try to continuing to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to manage glycogen.</v>

157
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.640
<v Speaker 1>So Tim noakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Tim noakes out of South Africa</v>

158
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.833
<v Speaker 1>was the go to guy in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called the Lore of </v>

159
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a 900 page tome.</v>

160
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the,</v>

161
00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:26.494
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source that everyone's cited for </v>

162
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.133
<v Speaker 1>decades when it came to carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>intake and glycogen management and all </v>

163
00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:37.390
<v Speaker 1>of the things that had to do with fuel </v>
<v Speaker 1>partitioning during an endurance event.</v>

164
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And about five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked at the research partly because</v>

165
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:47.170
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd been a runner himself.</v>

166
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.213
<v Speaker 1>He'd been employing this same strategy </v>
<v Speaker 1>of carbohydrate intake and carbohydrate </v>

167
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 1>management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

168
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but he was a type two diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd become,</v>

169
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.190
<v Speaker 1>he had become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite his training,</v>

170
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.080
<v Speaker 1>a type two diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

171
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I think his uncle and his father had </v>
<v Speaker 1>died as type two diabetics.</v>

172
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:04.444
<v Speaker 1>he got the fear of God put it in him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started to re evaluate the research </v>

174
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:09.400
<v Speaker 1>and he literally had an epiphany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

175
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:10.234
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

176
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.373
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy that's been promoting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of training for decades and now I </v>

177
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:17.980
<v Speaker 1>have to completely change my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

178
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 1>my opinion on it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I told you was wrong.</v>

179
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.233
<v Speaker 1>And the body is developed and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to be a great fat burning </v>

180
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:27.844
<v Speaker 1>machine and not rely so much on </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate and not rely so much on </v>

181
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:32.170
<v Speaker 1>glycogen or glucose.</v>

182
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.643
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy is taking so much shit for </v>

183
00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:37.444
<v Speaker 1>it in South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like trying to run him out of the </v>

184
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a trial going on right now.</v>

185
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a professor Tim noakes.</v>

186
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:48.880
<v Speaker 1>And in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the epitome of a heroic science,</v>

187
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.470
<v Speaker 1>a man of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

188
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.393
<v Speaker 1>he's gone down a path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's dedicated his life to being the </v>

189
00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:55.670
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>

190
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>he looks at the research and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

191
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I messed up.</v>

192
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 1>This is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

193
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling you the wrong thing </v>

194
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:03.114
<v Speaker 1>and I'm willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to basically fall on my sword and tell </v>

195
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>you that because it's this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation is the truth.</v>

196
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it's supposed to be,</v>

197
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

198
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:13.884
<v Speaker 1>that's what science is supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not supposed to be relying on this </v>

199
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>bad information just because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught it to people.</v>

200
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find the new data,</v>

201
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>the new data doesn't correspond with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>old data.</v>

202
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:25.900
<v Speaker 1>You have to let everybody know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sound that it's like,</v>

203
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like Unicorn farts.</v>

204
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>

205
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>science is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is kind of dirty and,</v>

206
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:34.014
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and messy and there are no black and </v>

207
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 1>whites in science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no absolutes.</v>

208
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>There no is no right or wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just theories and opinions going</v>

209
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:41.874
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a scientist who's had an </v>

210
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 1>investment in your life's work being one</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

211
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.503
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to defend that position </v>

212
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.473
<v Speaker 1>even sometimes in the face of new new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that that really becomes a </v>

213
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>huge issue when they deny information </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it's bad for their ego.</v>

214
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 1>And just because it's bad for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>career and they can just,</v>

215
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:00.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can,</v>

216
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure have just kept his mouth shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just coasted and everything would've</v>

217
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.813
<v Speaker 1>been fine.</v>

218
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.743
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

219
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>well it would have been fine for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

220
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 1>the coroner had been rounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

221
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>enough other scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

222
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had started to look at this and I,</v>

223
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

224
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he cited me as one of his influences in,</v>

225
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:22.350
<v Speaker 1>in helping to turn that corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's a guy,</v>

226
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.260
<v Speaker 1>he was reading my blog posts and sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

227
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>

228
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:27.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

229
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.883
<v Speaker 1>a new perspective cast upon his </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and was willing to look at </v>

230
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:32.184
<v Speaker 1>some of the research that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rob Wolf and a number of other </v>

231
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Speaker 1>bloggers in the new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the emerging Paleo sphere.</v>

232
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are,</v>

233
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're born to,</v>

234
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>to excel at burning fat and we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to depend on sugar.</v>

235
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:47.370
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less sugar we burn in a lifetime,</v>

236
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:52.371
<v Speaker 1>it probably the better off we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the longest time when people were</v>

237
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 1>doing all this carbo loading and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

238
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:55.914
<v Speaker 1>I'm just following the old methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were creating extra inflammation </v>

239
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 1>because of this food.</v>

240
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

241
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

242
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates,</v>

243
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>pasta and bread and such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cause inflammation.</v>

244
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:11.424
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sugar is proinflammatory if you have </v>

245
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.360
<v Speaker 1>high blood sugar levels that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

246
00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say that to people,</v>

247
00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:20.210
<v Speaker 1>like explain to me what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by inflammation mean?</v>

248
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Like joint inflammation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

249
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good question.</v>

250
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.970
<v Speaker 1>So inflammation is a process in the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's designed to deal with an insult.</v>

251
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.000
<v Speaker 1>So he twisted ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

252
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 1>and inflammatory process begins the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

253
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 1>the ankle swells up because a water </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulates there.</v>

254
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>The cells are being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 1>partly protected by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>

256
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white blood cells rush to it to try and </v>

257
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>assess the damage and fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repair some of the damage.</v>

258
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.813
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a a long process where the </v>

259
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 1>temperature of the localized temperature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the areas raised.</v>

260
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this is contemplated to deal with</v>

261
00:11:56.411 --> 00:12:01.411
<v Speaker 1>a short term insult that hopefully over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time it repairs.</v>

262
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many cases it repairs even stronger </v>

263
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>than it was before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

264
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:06.214
<v Speaker 1>you break a bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that where it broke his </v>

265
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

266
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 1>or a callous is an example of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

267
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:16.801
<v Speaker 1>a stronger skin from having been </v>
<v Speaker 1>irritated but the same.</v>

268
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.183
<v Speaker 1>And we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same sort of process happens if you </v>

269
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>get a bacterial insult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a microbial insult,</v>

270
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get infected with somebody and </v>

271
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 1>something and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe by somebody and you get,</v>

272
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

273
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 1>and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reaction to that infection.</v>

274
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it may happen in the bloodstream if,</v>

275
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.703
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the bacteria goes into the </v>

276
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a,</v>

277
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.953
<v Speaker 1>there's a response to that which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an inflammation and </v>

278
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.810
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

279
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.510
<v Speaker 1>now if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

280
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this happens as a result of,</v>

281
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.700
<v Speaker 1>of genes within cells being turned on or</v>
<v Speaker 1>off based on signals they get from their</v>

282
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:54.604
<v Speaker 1>immediate environment.</v>

283
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:55.623
<v Speaker 1>So genes don't work in a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something has to turn the gene on or </v>

284
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something has to give the reason,</v>

285
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 1>the gene reason to build a protein or </v>
<v Speaker 1>have whatever action.</v>

286
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you've got,</v>

287
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

288
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>so now let's go back to the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy.</v>

289
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 1>You've got certain foods that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat that cause the body to,</v>

290
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to initiate an inflammatory us,</v>

291
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>what we call a systemic inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

292
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

293
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.473
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe emulate something that would've </v>

294
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>happened in an infection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's caused by an over abundance</v>

295
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:27.004
<v Speaker 1>of a maaco sits omega six fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're literally turning on genes </v>

296
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 1>that are causing a systemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

297
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time,</v>

298
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:34.711
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

299
00:13:34.711 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 1>in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a big deal,</v>

300
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:37.920
<v Speaker 1>one meal here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

301
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

302
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

303
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary insult,</v>

304
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 1>not a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but over time,</v>

305
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 1>if your diet is such that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuously,</v>

306
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.383
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presenting these sorts of foods that </v>

307
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 1>would prompt inflammatory genes to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

308
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.693
<v Speaker 1>you get what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is known as an inflammatory </v>

309
00:13:56.111 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

310
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

311
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 1>sugar has that response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A refined grains can have that response.</v>

312
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes even whole grains because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

313
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's portions of the grain that we </v>

314
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 1>say are natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually,</v>

315
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

316
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's slightly toxic to the body.</v>

317
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.773
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the industrial seed oils that are </v>

318
00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>pervasive in our diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>

319
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:18.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corn oil,</v>

320
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.560
<v Speaker 1>soybean oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>canola oil.</v>

321
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.950
<v Speaker 1>All of these can have the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing a systemic inflammation,</v>

322
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>that systemic inflammatory response in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>

323
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

324
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of times you'll see like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see it,</v>

325
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you look at the biggest loser and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

326
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude lost 25 pounds the first week.</v>

327
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>That's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

328
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:41.860
<v Speaker 1>How do you burn off that much fat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't burn off that much fat.</v>

329
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:42.694
<v Speaker 1>They lose that much water because by re,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by eliminating the proinflammatory </v>

330
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.850
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inflammation,</v>

331
00:14:48.851 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>the systemic inflammation that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing them to carry literally 30 or 40</v>

332
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:52.844
<v Speaker 1>or 50 pounds of excess water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that causes of inflammation goes away </v>

333
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:57.200
<v Speaker 1>and the water goes away.</v>

334
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.333
<v Speaker 1>The swelling goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could look at the cause of heart </v>

335
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:04.394
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heart disease isn't caused by </v>

336
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:06.134
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol or saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the proximate cause of heart </v>

337
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 1>disease as we know it today is systemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

338
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:16.250
<v Speaker 1>It's an inflammatory response in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

339
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the blood vessels.</v>

340
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say someone looks puffy.</v>

341
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people who drink a lot of alcohol,</v>

342
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 1>they start looking puffy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's lit.</v>

343
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.520
<v Speaker 1>That's actually literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

344
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.830
<v Speaker 1>they're inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get water.</v>

345
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:28.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

346
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:31.070
<v Speaker 1>they're retaining water as a result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an inflammatory response.</v>

347
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 1>The body is having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

348
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we went to that from training,</v>

349
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

350
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we get down that road,</v>

351
00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:40.904
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of eliminating these proinflammatory </v>

352
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

353
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.270
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll tell you where it went.</v>

354
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I had arthritis in my feet at the age of</v>
<v Speaker 1>27,</v>

355
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.543
<v Speaker 1>28.</v>

356
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.653
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to smile this hard running and </v>

357
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 1>biking and from the Diet because I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this systemic inflammation,</v>

358
00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.663
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this diet that was promoting an </v>

359
00:16:01.491 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory response throughout my </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

360
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:06.590
<v Speaker 1>not just in the ankle that I might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>just twisted or whatever.</v>

361
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.001
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

362
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:09.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

363
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I had arthritis in my hands when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>even into my,</v>

364
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.953
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even after I cleaned most of my diet up </v>

365
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.293
<v Speaker 1>into my forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had arthritis in my hands or my </v>

366
00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Speaker 1>fingers that I thought was just a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>artifact of getting old.</v>

367
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing that I eliminated </v>
<v Speaker 1>from my diet was grains,</v>

368
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.890
<v Speaker 1>which I found were causing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a huge cause of issue for me.</v>

369
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 1>When I got rid of grains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arthritis in my fingers went away.</v>

370
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 1>All grains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprouted grains as well at zeal bread.</v>

371
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

372
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

373
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

374
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for purposes of this conversation,</v>

375
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 1>let's say all grains and then we'll talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what that means over time.</v>

376
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.850
<v Speaker 1>But I'm getting rid of all grains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

377
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.463
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had irritable bowel syndrome most of </v>

378
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:57.140
<v Speaker 1>my life that I thought was because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a type a stress ladened individual.</v>

379
00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't handle it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

380
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 1>and that literally that ibs had run my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

381
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that went away.</v>

382
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.030
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

383
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.733
<v Speaker 1>the upper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upper respiratory tract infections I </v>

384
00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 1>would get several times a year went </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

385
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.923
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had lingering sinus infections after </v>

386
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd have an upper respiratory tract </v>
<v Speaker 1>infections that those one way and I,</v>

387
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.063
<v Speaker 1>all these things I'd assumed were just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal artifact of being human and </v>

388
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:24.764
<v Speaker 1>getting older and part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't everybody suffer these </v>

389
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:28.790
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went away.</v>

390
00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 1>And that was a real epiphany for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize it.</v>

391
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.160
<v Speaker 1>If I had made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

392
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically a researcher and if I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>done all the research and still defended</v>

393
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:43.370
<v Speaker 1>my right to eat grains in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face of the research I was doing,</v>

394
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 1>how many tens of millions of people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

395
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>might be effected by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

396
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:50.760
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want this to an anti grain </v>
<v Speaker 1>crusade today,</v>

397
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:51.594
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

398
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of suggesting that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to us in a,</v>

399
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.160
<v Speaker 1>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

400
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.063
<v Speaker 1>certainly a lot of the root cause of </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness or the beginning etiology of </v>

401
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:04.030
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

402
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 1>has deep roots in what we eat or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes more importantly,</v>

403
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:08.814
<v Speaker 1>what we don't eat.</v>

404
00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.710
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is really fascinating,</v>

405
00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:12.544
<v Speaker 2>is turning genes on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for most people like me who don't </v>

406
00:18:18.281 --> 00:18:21.250
<v Speaker 2>have background in medical science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't necessarily understand genes,</v>

407
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.570
<v Speaker 2>the idea of genes being turned on or off</v>
<v Speaker 2>by lifestyle,</v>

408
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:28.690
<v Speaker 2>by a dietary choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

409
00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.100
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't make any sense to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

410
00:18:30.101 --> 00:18:30.510
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

411
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

412
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.890
<v Speaker 2>you got your genes so you don't got your</v>
<v Speaker 2>jeans.</v>

413
00:18:32.891 --> 00:18:33.724
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave the got red hair or you got big </v>

414
00:18:35.351 --> 00:18:37.990
<v Speaker 2>feet and that's genetic and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

415
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.033
<v Speaker 1>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

416
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.053
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a huge assumption that the </v>

417
00:18:41.291 --> 00:18:42.940
<v Speaker 1>genes are finished when we're born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

418
00:18:42.941 --> 00:18:43.774
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we just grow and we have our </v>

419
00:18:44.861 --> 00:18:46.060
<v Speaker 1>eyes and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

420
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.240
<v Speaker 1>we're doomed to be 50 pounds overweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>because our parents are,</v>

421
00:18:49.241 --> 00:18:51.340
<v Speaker 1>or we're doomed to get breast cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because her mother did.</v>

422
00:18:51.341 --> 00:18:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

423
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.280
<v Speaker 1>genes are at work every second of every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

424
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding,</v>

425
00:18:58.661 --> 00:18:59.950
<v Speaker 1>renewing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerating,</v>

426
00:18:59.951 --> 00:19:02.920
<v Speaker 1>recreating us based on the signals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get.</v>

427
00:19:02.921 --> 00:19:07.120
<v Speaker 1>So jeans are these little switches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that cause the production of proteins</v>

428
00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:08.860
<v Speaker 1>that actually run our body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a proteins.</v>

429
00:19:08.861 --> 00:19:09.694
<v Speaker 1>They make a that run our body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's muscle protein being built </v>

430
00:19:12.791 --> 00:19:15.190
<v Speaker 1>or whether its enzymes to cause certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions to take place.</v>

431
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the jeans,</v>

432
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.093
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are basically not doing anything until </v>

433
00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:22.990
<v Speaker 1>they get a signal from the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

434
00:19:22.991 --> 00:19:24.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see the environment,</v>

435
00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.653
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might start from what we perceive as </v>

436
00:19:28.151 --> 00:19:28.984
<v Speaker 1>the outside environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually it's a biochemical </v>

437
00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:32.440
<v Speaker 1>signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

438
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.393
<v Speaker 1>or some sensation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some transmission of information that </v>

439
00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:38.044
<v Speaker 1>gets through the cell to the genes </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and causes a gene to turn on </v>

440
00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.110
<v Speaker 1>the switch to turn on the protein to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>built.</v>

441
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And that manifests itself in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gene is assigned to do.</v>

442
00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.193
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the beauty of the primal blueprint </v>

443
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.283
<v Speaker 1>and the lifestyle that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting for 10 or 15 years is this </v>

444
00:19:56.831 --> 00:20:01.060
<v Speaker 1>notion that we can discover these hidden</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic switches that we all have.</v>

445
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And we can make choices in our lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that direct us in a,</v>

446
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.013
<v Speaker 1>in a direction of health versus down </v>
<v Speaker 1>this slippery slope of illness and </v>

447
00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:11.770
<v Speaker 1>disease and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and falling apart.</v>

448
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

449
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not right or wrong.</v>

450
00:20:16.301 --> 00:20:17.890
<v Speaker 1>They're not good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not black or white.</v>

451
00:20:17.891 --> 00:20:18.724
<v Speaker 1>They're just choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not going to criticize you for </v>

452
00:20:20.711 --> 00:20:21.544
<v Speaker 1>making whatever choices you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My job as a blogger and certainly a </v>

453
00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:25.983
<v Speaker 1>running mark's daily apple and writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the books that I write is to offer you </v>

454
00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.100
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

455
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated choices that you might elect to</v>

456
00:20:34.091 --> 00:20:37.240
<v Speaker 1>undertake based on what you tell me your</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals are.</v>

457
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.891
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

459
00:20:38.891 --> 00:20:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to lose weight and I'm want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get stronger and I want to,</v>

460
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

461
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe participate in a five k we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at a number of different,</v>

462
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.243
<v Speaker 1>whether their dietary and I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the better because all of the </v>

463
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:52.684
<v Speaker 1>strategy will have some impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's certain foods you can eat </v>

464
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 1>that will cause you to become better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning fat,</v>

465
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and will cause you to burn two to build </v>

466
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:01.654
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

467
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 1>more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

468
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:04.803
<v Speaker 1>there's an amount of sleep that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>get that will reduce the amount of </v>

469
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 1>cortisol that you secrete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cortisol is an adrenal hormone,</v>

470
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we secreted in response to stress.</v>

471
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Cortisol tends to make us carry a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of extra weight,</v>

472
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.740
<v Speaker 1>some of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I can reduce,</v>

473
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 1>if I can increase my sleep and improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>my sleep patterns,</v>

474
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reduce cortisol,</v>

475
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.840
<v Speaker 1>it all has effect an effect back at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene level,</v>

476
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

477
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:27.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

478
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 1>to get me closer to where I want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>

479
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.940
<v Speaker 1>How much do you sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

480
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 1>probably nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight and a half to nine hours a night.</v>

481
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

482
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.080
<v Speaker 1>They say wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a lot or that's,</v>

483
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:39.923
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.021
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:41.854
<v Speaker 1>I have friends who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who brag about getting 10 and make no </v>

486
00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>apologies for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

487
00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost more,</v>

488
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 1>more importantly is the consistency of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

489
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:53.830
<v Speaker 1>So I don't like to stay up late because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I wake up early,</v>

490
00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I wake up the same time every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I stay up late,</v>

491
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:57.640
<v Speaker 1>you wake up six 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you one of those,</v>

492
00:21:57.641 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 1>get out of the house and go run around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

493
00:21:59.381 --> 00:21:59.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

494
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm a no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

495
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I sort of Mosey on down to the coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot,</v>

496
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.810
<v Speaker 1>make a pot of coffee and read the paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

497
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.653
<v Speaker 1>I ease into the day and I typically hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gym around nine 30 or or go paddle </v>

498
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is I'm going to do for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

499
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it first thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

500
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I want to be kind of refresh for it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready for it.</v>

501
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then we can talk about sun exposure </v>

502
00:22:20.921 --> 00:22:21.671
<v Speaker 1>and we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

503
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:22.504
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people are Vitamin d deficient </v>

504
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.303
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been that way because </v>

505
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:29.260
<v Speaker 1>conventional wisdom has suggested that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they stay out of the sun,</v>

506
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that the sun is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That any amount of sun exposure is,</v>

507
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to cause you to get or </v>

508
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:37.180
<v Speaker 1>predispose you to getting cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

509
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.163
<v Speaker 1>what we say in the Paleo community is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably more people who have </v>

510
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:41.344
<v Speaker 1>gotten cancer from having avoided the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sun than ever got cancer from too much </v>

511
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I say that is because sun</v>

512
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:51.190
<v Speaker 1>exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uvb light is what?</v>

513
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:52.024
<v Speaker 1>That's the stimulus that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol in the skin to convert to </v>

514
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:56.314
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And vitamin D is one of the most </v>

515
00:22:57.131 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 1>important vitamins that she actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be a hormone.</v>

516
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at one of the,</v>

517
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:04.540
<v Speaker 1>one of the implications is that vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>D is,</v>

518
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>is strongly involved in cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevention.</v>

519
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So the more vitamin D you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more,</v>

520
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.173
<v Speaker 1>the less risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lower risk you have for most </v>

521
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:12.304
<v Speaker 1>cancers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the issue with people sun damage </v>

522
00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:15.630
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is no,</v>

523
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.440
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go out and get sun burned,</v>

524
00:23:17.441 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and I've never advocated that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

525
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 1>but there's a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending a little,</v>

526
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.163
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of time in the sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>unprotected and going in and putting on </v>

527
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:27.274
<v Speaker 1>a shirt or even if you want to stay out </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting on some sunscreen at that point </v>

528
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.160
<v Speaker 1>versus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

529
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.030
<v Speaker 1>just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbing baby oil and us and a,</v>

530
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:35.831
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iodine.</v>

531
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:40.030
<v Speaker 1>We used to put back in New England and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was very little sons.</v>

532
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:42.460
<v Speaker 1>They had to get a cram for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suntan.</v>

533
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I had dine.</v>

534
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

535
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:46.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did baby oil.</v>

536
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Baby oil with iodine was even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a,</v>

537
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.240
<v Speaker 1>it turbocharge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

538
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.253
<v Speaker 1>it was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like the buttered coffee of </v>

539
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Suntan Lotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that stuff is.</v>

540
00:23:56.261 --> 00:23:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the mechanism behind iodine?</v>

541
00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Like how does that show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>

542
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was the,</v>

543
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.810
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the old wives' tale.</v>

544
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.683
<v Speaker 1>Conventional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

545
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was worst burn I ever got.</v>

546
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

547
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:09.344
<v Speaker 1>it was a winter break or spring break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Williams college in Western </v>

548
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:13.634
<v Speaker 1>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We drove from Williamstown to Fort </v>

549
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Lauderdale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight through,</v>

550
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.573
<v Speaker 1>straight through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

551
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.490
<v Speaker 1>in a BMW 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't great little car,</v>

552
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 1>great car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four of us smell like a goat farm by the</v>

553
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:27.460
<v Speaker 1>time he got down there and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

554
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.710
<v Speaker 1>fell asleep on the beach at nine o'clock</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and then just burned to a</v>

555
00:24:31.711 --> 00:24:35.330
<v Speaker 1>crawl from zero sun exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:37.230
<v Speaker 1>all winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

557
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 1>all the way down to Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way down the beach barbecue.</v>

558
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.880
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

559
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't sound like it's </v>

560
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:44.690
<v Speaker 1>recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

561
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now just just to clarify a inflammatory </v>

562
00:24:50.601 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're eating grains,</v>

563
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're reading a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pastas and things along those lines,</v>

564
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is happening that's causing</v>
<v Speaker 1>an inflammatory response?</v>

565
00:25:00.531 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Your body's processing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gains.</v>

566
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And so pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bread,</v>

567
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of cereals,</v>

568
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.590
<v Speaker 1>especially the processed cereals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugars,</v>

569
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

570
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.350
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those grains turn into sugar.</v>

571
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:13.184
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turned to glucose like really </v>

572
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they hit your,</v>

573
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.210
<v Speaker 1>your gut and the body doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>know which glucose,</v>

574
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:21.044
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't know the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it doesn't know the difference </v>

575
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 1>in a bowl of skittles producing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose and a loaf of bread,</v>

576
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just glucose to the body.</v>

577
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So if you raise that level high enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

578
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.270
<v Speaker 1>you will have some issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

579
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:33.104
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you introduce high fructose corn </v>

580
00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:35.721
<v Speaker 1>Syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

581
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:36.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

582
00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:37.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

583
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

584
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 1>frankenfood created in the 70s to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to provide sweetness at a lower cost,</v>

585
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically coming from corn,</v>

586
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you've,</v>

587
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.690
<v Speaker 1>you're introducing yet another variable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another agent,</v>

588
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 1>because a fruit toast in and of itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

589
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 1>is a somewhat inflammatory.</v>

590
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.390
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

591
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

592
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 1>the glucose portion of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about here.</v>

593
00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:03.350
<v Speaker 1>But then some of the grains have what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>call these anti nutrients in them,</v>

594
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.223
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may cause issues with some people </v>

595
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.273
<v Speaker 1>in their gut may open the gut wall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it to literally leak fecal matter </v>

596
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 1>into the bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

597
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you've heard of leaky gut </v>

598
00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:16.140
<v Speaker 1>syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

599
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a reason why a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

600
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:19.923
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have autoimmune diseases or at the very </v>

601
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 1>least a systemic inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

602
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's caused by your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing too much glucose.</v>

603
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not caused by your body processing </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much glucose as it is.</v>

604
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a side effect of it.</v>

605
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

606
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not the glucose it's </v>

607
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:42.371
<v Speaker 1>causing that in that case is now we </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved on from sugar and glucose being a,</v>

608
00:26:42.861 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 1>a cause of inflammation to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

609
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:47.603
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain elements in Ho let's say whole </v>

610
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:54.471
<v Speaker 1>grains that turn on certain genes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause certain responses,</v>

611
00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:55.554
<v Speaker 1>one of which may be in some people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>open the junction between the cells </v>

612
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:03.150
<v Speaker 1>lining the gut and allow undigested food</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>

613
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.043
<v Speaker 1>shall we say.</v>

614
00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

615
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.173
<v Speaker 1>to enter the bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the body sees those undigested food </v>

616
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:12.120
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the gut is only supposed to really</v>

617
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 1>allow in a free fatty acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple sugars.</v>

618
00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

619
00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

620
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

621
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.740
<v Speaker 1>amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single peptides die,</v>

622
00:27:21.741 --> 00:27:22.574
<v Speaker 1>peptides may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get a large undigested food </v>

623
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:26.700
<v Speaker 1>particle in the bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the body goes,</v>

624
00:27:26.701 --> 00:27:27.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

625
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.343
<v Speaker 1>that looks like a bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We better go get that thing and set up </v>

626
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:31.614
<v Speaker 1>an or an immune response to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get an initial form of </v>

627
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:36.840
<v Speaker 1>inflammation where the body's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

628
00:27:36.841 --> 00:27:37.674
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some foreign matter in the </v>

629
00:27:38.641 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't recognize it.</v>

630
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.220
<v Speaker 1>We're going to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of bad enough in it,</v>

631
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.650
<v Speaker 1>in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

632
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

633
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 1>if that continues long enough for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

634
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.220
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

635
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.690
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory response that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that immune response,</v>

636
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 1>now it goes to look for similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules and it might see,</v>

637
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

638
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.510
<v Speaker 1>a Beta cell and the pancreas and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

639
00:28:05.511 --> 00:28:06.344
<v Speaker 1>that looks just like that other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just set up a response for let's go </v>

640
00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:11.250
<v Speaker 1>kill this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it might do it with,</v>

641
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

642
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.633
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

643
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 1>in cells and the joint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chondracytes in the joint.</v>

644
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And you may get rheumatoid arthritis as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a result of it.</v>

645
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 1>That's an autoimmune response to body </v>
<v Speaker 1>set up,</v>

646
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.070
<v Speaker 1>setting up an immune response to itself.</v>

647
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.520
<v Speaker 3>So when you hear people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten sensitivity and you know,</v>

648
00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.470
<v Speaker 3>people are trying to go gluten free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that a lot of,</v>

649
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:32.723
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the body responding to an excess of </v>

650
00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 3>this glucose in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

651
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 3>excess of focus in the two different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

652
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:43.530
<v Speaker 3>So the glucose is one thing that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar is,</v>

653
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 3>is what it is that from breaking down </v>
<v Speaker 3>breads and Pastas or,</v>

654
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:50.610
<v Speaker 3>or candy or cakes or pies or um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

655
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snickers,</v>

656
00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:53.790
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our soft drinks,</v>

657
00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:55.770
<v Speaker 3>which is a huge issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

658
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.410
<v Speaker 3>cause softdrinks or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a large part of the problem.</v>

659
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 3>But gluten is a different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an entirely different mechanism.</v>

660
00:29:01.561 --> 00:29:03.210
<v Speaker 3>Now we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

661
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 3>a protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a protein.</v>

662
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:07.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a plant protein is folded so </v>
<v Speaker 3>densely that there,</v>

663
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Speaker 3>the theory is that humans haven't had </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

664
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Most humans haven't had enough time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>adapt to,</v>

665
00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.523
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the digestion of that type of a </v>

666
00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:18.360
<v Speaker 3>molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a result,</v>

667
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

668
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.230
<v Speaker 3>it causes problems within the lining of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gut.</v>

669
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.183
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I was getting at was the p </v>

670
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 3>people always talk about having gluten </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity,</v>

671
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.533
<v Speaker 3>but really what you're saying is that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of what people are having issues </v>

672
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:36.190
<v Speaker 3>with is these simple carbohydrates is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like breads and pastas against,</v>

673
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry to be,</v>

674
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.290
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like two parts to this equation,</v>

675
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

676
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.600
<v Speaker 1>either part is kind of bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

677
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 1>and together they're kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>

678
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on the,</v>

679
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 1>on the glucose side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just unfortunate.</v>

680
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Gluten and glucose have the first glu </v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not related.</v>

681
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:56.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on the Gluco side,</v>

682
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:57.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

683
00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing you want to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because the,</v>

684
00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:00.514
<v Speaker 1>one of the other things that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't have an inflammatory </v>

685
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:03.940
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it raises insulin.</v>

686
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:04.803
<v Speaker 1>Insulin is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a storage hormone that tends to take </v>

687
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:08.014
<v Speaker 1>every calorie you ate at the last meal </v>
<v Speaker 1>in excessive what you needed and store </v>

688
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it as fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

689
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:15.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're a skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

690
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 1>east African marathoner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to burn it off.</v>

691
00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:18.994
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a typical American eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple hundred extra calories a day in </v>

692
00:30:22.481 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the form of this sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to store it as body fat.</v>

693
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.523
<v Speaker 1>And if you haven't built a mechanism to </v>
<v Speaker 1>burn off the body fat that causes </v>

694
00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 1>problems over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that increases your risk for cancel,</v>

695
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:32.704
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that increases your risk for heart </v>

696
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:33.874
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That increases your risk for type two </v>

697
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have gluten sensitivity,</v>

698
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:41.590
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that when I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I decided to go gluten free,</v>

699
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I kind of quit it after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did it for about six months.</v>

700
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 1>My face got thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lost body fat.</v>

701
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I had more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt better.</v>

702
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I attributed it.</v>

703
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I tried.</v>

704
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have a gluten </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

705
00:30:55.301 --> 00:30:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I just attributed to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating all that pasta and breads and all</v>

706
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.420
<v Speaker 1>those things was just giving me all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra sugar,</v>

707
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 1>eliminating that from my diet made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference and that,</v>

708
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:04.744
<v Speaker 1>so that is the sort of the first line of</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense for a lot of people who want to </v>

709
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:08.440
<v Speaker 1>lose weight.</v>

710
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just just by getting rid of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those foods,</v>

711
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and I want to say limiting yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

712
00:31:14.531 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 1>including meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

713
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:17.470
<v Speaker 1>fowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>

714
00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 1>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeds,</v>

715
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.620
<v Speaker 1>all the vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of fruit,</v>

716
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 1>healthy fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oils and nuts.</v>

717
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:28.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty nice plate of food that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can offer yourself up.</v>

719
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you get rid of the,</v>

720
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carbohydrates,</v>

721
00:31:31.871 --> 00:31:32.704
<v Speaker 1>the simple carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're well on your way to re reducing </v>

722
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:37.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the excess body weight,</v>

723
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.930
<v Speaker 1>which includes the excess retain water </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fullness and the face and all the</v>

724
00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.773
<v Speaker 1>things that we talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you give those up and you find </v>

725
00:31:44.321 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your joints work better or that you</v>

726
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:48.034
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

727
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.010
<v Speaker 1>you know that your immune system works </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

728
00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't get sick as often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what a lot of people notice.</v>

729
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Now we probably are looking at the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you might have some,</v>

730
00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.563
<v Speaker 1>some level of sensitivity to gluten and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten sensitivity exists on a spectrum </v>

731
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:05.500
<v Speaker 1>of no problem at all to I'll die if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>

732
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 1>And you could be anywhere in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere on that spectrum.</v>

733
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean this again sort of the operative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mantra here,</v>

734
00:32:13.121 --> 00:32:14.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no right or wrong,</v>

735
00:32:14.081 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 1>no black or white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

736
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Speaker 1>no good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just choices.</v>

737
00:32:16.931 --> 00:32:21.010
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a person who really wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dig deep and kind of make those,</v>

738
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.540
<v Speaker 1>those changes that are going to get you </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to your goal quicker,</v>

739
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:27.490
<v Speaker 1>that might be a choice that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>look into.</v>

740
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.713
<v Speaker 1>So there's no right or wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a spectrum in terms of </v>

741
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:33.430
<v Speaker 1>tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your tolerance might be much better than</v>

742
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:36.400
<v Speaker 1>mine and some people just really </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have it in the Diet at all.</v>

743
00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:37.234
<v Speaker 1>Whether some people can have a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>good amount of it and really not have </v>

744
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:40.110
<v Speaker 1>too many issues.</v>

745
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We say what,</v>

746
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:41.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can I get away with?</v>

747
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of an interesting concept in</v>

748
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 3>and of itself because people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans,</v>

749
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tend to see what we can get away </v>

750
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

751
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 3>you might save saves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

752
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.230
<v Speaker 3>this is really good for me and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

753
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 3>or this is really bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to do it again.</v>

754
00:32:55.971 --> 00:32:58.670
<v Speaker 3>But if I don't die from it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no consequences,</v>

755
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.210
<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to take it right up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the edge and sometimes a little bit past</v>

756
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 3>the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are a lot of people who can get</v>

757
00:33:04.401 --> 00:33:07.340
<v Speaker 3>away with eating a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates than others,</v>

758
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:11.630
<v Speaker 3>even though they don't train hard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not gained that much weight.</v>

759
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of people who can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>away with,</v>

760
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:15.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with consuming,</v>

761
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:16.551
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

762
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Omega six oils and not get into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>proinflammatory state as readily or as,</v>

763
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 3>or as quickly.</v>

764
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.360
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

765
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Ronald Reagan said,</v>

766
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:24.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man's got to know his limitations or it </v>

767
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:26.840
<v Speaker 3>was that dirty Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the both.</v>

768
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 3>But I think it was dirty Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

769
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Reagan restated it later on,</v>

770
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:33.440
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

771
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:35.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this article yesterday and</v>

772
00:33:35.501 --> 00:33:38.570
<v Speaker 3>I talked about this yesterday in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast about this woman who,</v>

773
00:33:38.571 --> 00:33:39.404
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wrote this article about she's in </v>

774
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:41.264
<v Speaker 3>her seventies and how her whole life </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have been shaming her for being </v>

775
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 3>fat and she was sort of like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>promote fat acceptance.</v>

776
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:50.750
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

777
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I see articles like that,</v>

778
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 3>there's two reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One reaction as,</v>

779
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:57.350
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a human being.</v>

780
00:33:57.351 --> 00:33:58.510
<v Speaker 3>I look at her and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

781
00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.353
<v Speaker 3>this poor lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what a fucking shitty roll the </v>

782
00:34:02.421 --> 00:34:03.254
<v Speaker 3>dice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's gotten life and she's been </v>

783
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 3>overweight her whole life feeling fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>and gross and she's trying to get people</v>

784
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 3>to lay off her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave me alone.</v>

785
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:10.543
<v Speaker 3>And she sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very biased account and not </v>

786
00:34:13.041 --> 00:34:13.874
<v Speaker 3>science or exercise physiology based </v>
<v Speaker 3>where she sort of describing all the </v>

787
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:21.920
<v Speaker 3>various times in her life where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have said she's unhealthy.</v>

788
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.280
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile she's been very active and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she like lists all the different things.</v>

789
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 3>She did tree climbing and hiking and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this different stuff.</v>

790
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:28.334
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which obviously to a guy like you or </v>

791
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:35.981
<v Speaker 3>someone like me who knows a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive athletics and like the uh,</v>

792
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.810
<v Speaker 3>the amount of calories she's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>burning out versus putting in,</v>

793
00:34:38.811 --> 00:34:40.940
<v Speaker 3>it's probably skewed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably fucked up.</v>

794
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.180
<v Speaker 3>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't really discuss the actual,</v>

795
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:45.803
<v Speaker 3>what she was actually eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was talking about very bland foods </v>

796
00:34:49.431 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 3>and a thousand cars a day the doctors </v>
<v Speaker 3>are trying to put her on,</v>

797
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:53.570
<v Speaker 3>which is the wrong approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

798
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really,</v>

799
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.100
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I see things like that,</v>

800
00:34:58.101 --> 00:35:03.101
<v Speaker 3>I don't see a woman who's like 70 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>old who's coming to accept the fact that</v>

801
00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:05.690
<v Speaker 3>she's overweight and it's no big deal.</v>

802
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:06.411
<v Speaker 3>And who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

803
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:07.940
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

804
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:09.043
<v Speaker 3>ideas about body image that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on skinny supermodels that are </v>

805
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:14.530
<v Speaker 3>actually anorexic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

806
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.373
<v Speaker 3>I usually just leave me alone and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>plump and I'm healthy and everything's </v>

807
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>

808
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at that and I say,</v>

809
00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:24.920
<v Speaker 3>this poor lady has been given a bad set </v>
<v Speaker 3>of directives.</v>

810
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.010
<v Speaker 3>She's been getting given bad information</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as her diet.</v>

811
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.370
<v Speaker 3>And you don't have to be fat like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

812
00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:35.030
<v Speaker 3>you can eat healthy foods and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

813
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 3>and live a healthy life and your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>would lose a lot of weight</v>

814
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 1>just eating healthy foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely true.</v>

815
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that brings us back to this,</v>

816
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of,</v>

817
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:48.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good or bad and,</v>

818
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:51.810
<v Speaker 1>and judgment because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people self judge,</v>

819
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 1>people judge other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

820
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I have to be very careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

821
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.650
<v Speaker 1>when I look at people not to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>

822
00:35:58.651 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my tendency is to,</v>

823
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:01.740
<v Speaker 1>is to say to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

824
00:36:01.741 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

825
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I could fix that person or I could help </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>

826
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:06.360
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people resist that.</v>

827
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't do it.</v>

828
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it to myself because it's,</v>

829
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.140
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty clear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

830
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to want to change.</v>

831
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

832
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.310
<v Speaker 1>we talked about what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:18.370
<v Speaker 1>what can I get away with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

834
00:36:18.371 --> 00:36:21.720
<v Speaker 1>if I can get away with being fat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people still reasonably like me,</v>

835
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:22.554
<v Speaker 1>then I don't have to do the work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore not motivated to do what it's </v>

836
00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 1>going to take to get to that point.</v>

837
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

838
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:29.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

839
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a slippery slope with,</v>

840
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.680
<v Speaker 1>with talking with people about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.520
<v Speaker 1>like what's the ideal body composition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

842
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.383
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

843
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 1>the ideal body composition is where your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body says back to you,</v>

844
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.691
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

845
00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I love what you've done with the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is phenomenal.</v>

846
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've lost 50 pounds,</v>

847
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 1>not you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

848
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:49.770
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get sick as often.</v>

849
00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:51.720
<v Speaker 1>You've got all the energy you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you maintain it.</v>

850
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a lot of,</v>

851
00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:53.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 1>dieting or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You eat pretty much,</v>

853
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you know you're supposed to eat,</v>

854
00:36:57.181 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 1>but you're never hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your ideal body composition,</v>

855
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't look like the cover of</v>

856
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:04.080
<v Speaker 1>muscle and fitness or shape magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so be it.</v>

857
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

858
00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:07.044
<v Speaker 1>I can get you to that point for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people where you are on the cover of </v>

859
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 1>shape magazine or muscle and fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to cost and it's going to</v>

860
00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:15.900
<v Speaker 1>cost not in money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to cost and sacrifice and</v>

861
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:18.630
<v Speaker 1>discipline and pain and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hating life.</v>

862
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:19.321
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

863
00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:23.640
<v Speaker 1>the science can get us there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it worth the life?</v>

864
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:25.363
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main thing we do at the primal </v>

865
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:28.470
<v Speaker 1>blueprint is we try to live an awesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

866
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:29.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in fact,</v>

867
00:37:29.521 --> 00:37:31.380
<v Speaker 1>my tagline is primal blueprint live </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

868
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Living awesome means enjoying as much of</v>
<v Speaker 1>every moment,</v>

869
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.920
<v Speaker 1>every day as you can extract and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest amount of pleasure,</v>

870
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.010
<v Speaker 1>whether it's movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's with friends,</v>

871
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:43.070
<v Speaker 1>whether it's food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

872
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.510
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the least amount of pain,</v>

873
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but in a way that's sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it not only benefits you right now and </v>

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't get sick,</v>

878
00:37:56.131 --> 00:37:59.450
<v Speaker 1>you won't tap into your 401k to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a $200,000,</v>

879
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

880
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.930
<v Speaker 1>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

881
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.353
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about how can I enjoy life right </v>

882
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:07.464
<v Speaker 1>now today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now back to the overweight person who's </v>

883
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.670
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get to that point.</v>

884
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.870
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of,</v>

885
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight people are quite happy I </v>

886
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:16.560
<v Speaker 1>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

887
00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:19.230
<v Speaker 1>but I see a lot of others who are maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding it and going,</v>

888
00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:20.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

889
00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the jolly,</v>

890
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat person.</v>

891
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.880
<v Speaker 1>But inside I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

892
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the sad,</v>

893
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:26.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever the sad clown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

894
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.260
<v Speaker 1>you got to deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

895
00:38:28.261 --> 00:38:28.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>

896
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:31.700
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of this stuff comes from the,</v>

897
00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.773
<v Speaker 1>the changes you make in your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of easy things that we </v>

898
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.590
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

899
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I can write anybody a program that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll love that,</v>

900
00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 1>that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

901
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>

902
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have a buttered coffee for </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast.</v>

903
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:47.980
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a two eggs and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of Bacon.</v>

904
00:38:47.981 --> 00:38:50.080
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a salad with some salmon on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for lunch,</v>

905
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:50.914
<v Speaker 1>we'll have whatever and they'll never be</v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry and you'll start to burn fat and </v>

906
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:54.670
<v Speaker 1>life will be wonderful.</v>

907
00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.233
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes they'll get to a plateau </v>

908
00:38:58.361 --> 00:38:59.530
<v Speaker 1>and they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened mark?</v>

909
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I did everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

910
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went from,</v>

911
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 1>you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went from two 25 to one 75.</v>

912
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have some work to do,</v>

913
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:08.134
<v Speaker 1>but for right now you're at your ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>body composition because in terms of </v>

914
00:39:11.321 --> 00:39:12.490
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>

915
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a survival mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

916
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we get to this,</v>

917
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of,</v>

918
00:39:17.081 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

919
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 1>secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

920
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about life and what we're,</v>

921
00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 1>what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're after.</v>

922
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.260
<v Speaker 1>The human body is a vessel designed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry two strands of RNA DNA into the,</v>

923
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:32.914
<v Speaker 1>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a bizarre permutation of </v>

924
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:36.820
<v Speaker 1>several hundred million years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

925
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:37.654
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is the body is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is designed to survive long enough to </v>

926
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:44.000
<v Speaker 1>procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

927
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.913
<v Speaker 1>that's the reality of human and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution and the fact that we live </v>

928
00:39:47.381 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 1>longer and we enjoy life.</v>

929
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 1>This is all wonderful in icing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cake.</v>

930
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:51.214
<v Speaker 1>But from the body's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideal body composition is that </v>

931
00:39:53.771 --> 00:39:55.990
<v Speaker 1>composition at which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get sick,</v>

932
00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:56.890
<v Speaker 1>you move around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

933
00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

934
00:39:59.160 --> 00:39:59.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

935
00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can meet a mate,</v>

936
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have all the energy you want.</v>

937
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.220
<v Speaker 1>You're not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>

938
00:40:05.221 --> 00:40:06.054
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a woman and that's one 75 for </v>

939
00:40:07.481 --> 00:40:08.340
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

940
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fabulous.</v>

941
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I embrace this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel good at,</v>

942
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

943
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.233
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get dropped the next 25 </v>

944
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:15.071
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

945
00:40:15.071 --> 00:40:15.904
<v Speaker 1>now we got to look at refiguring that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the diet out and adding some sprints in </v>

946
00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:22.050
<v Speaker 1>there and doing some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some little tweaks in there and we'll,</v>

947
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get down there,</v>

948
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.400
<v Speaker 1>but it requires number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

949
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.213
<v Speaker 1>I identifying an appreciation for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done so far to get to where you </v>

950
00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:33.754
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

951
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:34.723
<v Speaker 1>A number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires acknowledging any past </v>

952
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.690
<v Speaker 1>insults in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

953
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:41.603
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of stuff going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind and the brain that wants to </v>

954
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:47.620
<v Speaker 1>keep people a protected with armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

955
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:48.570
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

956
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:49.930
<v Speaker 1>sexual abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

957
00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:50.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

958
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.120
<v Speaker 1>verbal abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

959
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.093
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

960
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario that happened in childhood.</v>

961
00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:55.894
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people carrying a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of emotional baggage around with them </v>

962
00:40:59.861 --> 00:41:02.890
<v Speaker 1>that in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you dealt with it,</v>

963
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an inappropriate manner that might </v>

964
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:07.060
<v Speaker 1>free you up to lose a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

965
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.260
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen this happen.</v>

966
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.273
<v Speaker 2>So when you're saying armor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you mean in terms of like emotional </v>

967
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:16.240
<v Speaker 2>armor or is it the body fat that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep on top of them?</v>

968
00:41:16.241 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Is it almost like a distraction or is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>the food that distracts them?</v>

969
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.393
<v Speaker 2>The overconsuming of food to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nullify the effects of the abuse or </v>

970
00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:28.260
<v Speaker 2>whatever trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be any of those,</v>

971
00:41:28.261 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 2>any of those and all those.</v>

972
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

973
00:41:31.251 --> 00:41:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I see it fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

974
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.560
<v Speaker 1>where people will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

975
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.840
<v Speaker 1>do everything right and then hit a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plateau and wonder what I need to get to</v>

976
00:41:38.841 --> 00:41:39.850
<v Speaker 1>the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you got to,</v>

977
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.990
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you need to really do the deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

978
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:42.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

979
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:43.724
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to explain to someone when they </v>

980
00:41:44.371 --> 00:41:46.580
<v Speaker 2>try to gain weight when people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying,</v>

981
00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to put some muscle on.</v>

982
00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.053
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to explain to people that like </v>

983
00:41:50.191 --> 00:41:53.580
<v Speaker 2>that that is not an easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And matter of fact,</v>

984
00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.443
<v Speaker 2>your body doesn't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body has a limited amount of </v>

985
00:41:57.031 --> 00:42:01.170
<v Speaker 2>resources and it does not want to spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources created on this extra muscle.</v>

986
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.330
<v Speaker 2>And in order to do that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

987
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people say,</v>

988
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.673
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing all this lift and I'm </v>

989
00:42:06.991 --> 00:42:07.824
<v Speaker 2>not getting any weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you probably lifting not enough </v>

990
00:42:09.871 --> 00:42:12.600
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not putting in enough intensity.</v>

991
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:14.640
<v Speaker 2>You're not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not eating enough.</v>

992
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean in order you have to get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body to say,</v>

993
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.580
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has hall wants to do dead four days</v>

994
00:42:20.581 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 2>a week now or squats or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

995
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:23.834
<v Speaker 2>he's doing all this heavy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to adjust accordingly because </v>

996
00:42:27.721 --> 00:42:28.554
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment in which we're existing </v>

997
00:42:30.151 --> 00:42:34.620
<v Speaker 2>in obviously changed and now we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to need a lot more muscle.</v>

998
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.633
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

999
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:36.703
<v Speaker 1>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the human body is to </v>

1000
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:39.374
<v Speaker 1>preserve itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pass the genetic material along to </v>

1001
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 1>the next generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that preservation is,</v>

1002
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to waste precious resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>building something that I won't need,</v>

1003
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1004
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1005
00:42:48.681 --> 00:42:49.514
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that manifests itself is if you </v>

1006
00:42:51.141 --> 00:42:52.780
<v Speaker 1>don't lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any muscle.</v>

1007
00:42:52.781 --> 00:42:55.910
<v Speaker 1>So you have this lack of muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this lack of,</v>

1008
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.810
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>

1009
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of muscle mass.</v>

1010
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1011
00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1012
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.650
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm skinny.</v>

1013
00:43:03.651 --> 00:43:04.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1014
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:05.174
<v Speaker 1>you could be skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could be what we call skinny </v>

1015
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no muscle.</v>

1016
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 1>You got a little bit of excess fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're memory,</v>

1017
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.870
<v Speaker 1>more prone to getting type two diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But almost more importantly,</v>

1018
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:13.940
<v Speaker 1>if you don't train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you get older,</v>

1019
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 1>it becomes more and more important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain muscle mass.</v>

1020
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't die of old age.</v>

1021
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 1>They die of organ failure because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1022
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:23.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something wasn't keeping up with the </v>

1023
00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:26.294
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the concept of dying of old age is </v>

1024
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:30.440
<v Speaker 1>kind of ridiculous when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1025
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 1>So the typical old age scenario is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a 75,</v>

1026
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 1>85 year old man or woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't done anything active for years.</v>

1027
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.020
<v Speaker 1>So there's no muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1028
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.150
<v Speaker 1>and because there's no muscle mass and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't done anything active,</v>

1029
00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:45.890
<v Speaker 1>the bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no bone density.</v>

1030
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 1>So the bones go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1031
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

1032
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.273
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to build a structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this clown isn't going to the </v>

1033
00:43:51.861 --> 00:43:54.380
<v Speaker 1>gym and doing anything to require it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to,</v>

1034
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save resources,</v>

1035
00:43:56.331 --> 00:44:00.110
<v Speaker 1>not build bone density.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The muscles are not building bone mass.</v>

1036
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Now the heart's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is easy.</v>

1037
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I can pump blood all day at at 5% of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>volume or maybe 15% of my volume.</v>

1038
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.610
<v Speaker 1>The lungs go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1039
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:08.331
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1040
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:11.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no requirement for excess oxygen.</v>

1041
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:11.923
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this clown's just sitting around in a </v>

1042
00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 1>chair all day or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching tv or doing minimal activity.</v>

1043
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.313
<v Speaker 1>So the lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of ceased to function at full </v>

1044
00:44:21.111 --> 00:44:22.730
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same with the liver,</v>

1045
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:24.460
<v Speaker 1>same with the kidneys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as,</v>

1046
00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:29.461
<v Speaker 1>as you go down this path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then one night you get up to take a leak</v>

1047
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:30.794
<v Speaker 1>and you trip over the cat and you fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you break your hip cause of bone </v>

1048
00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:34.524
<v Speaker 1>density sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you wind up in the hospital and </v>

1049
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:42.081
<v Speaker 1>you get pneumonia and you die because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lungs can't expel the sputum for the</v>

1050
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 1>pneumonia and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the heart can't keep up.</v>

1051
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 1>So you maybe you die of congestive heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

1052
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:47.304
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very typical scenario for a </v>

1053
00:44:49.141 --> 00:44:49.974
<v Speaker 1>lot of people and it all goes back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a need for the body to want to </v>

1054
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 1>change that.</v>

1055
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:56.903
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1056
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

1057

<v Speaker 1>how dare you say that there you say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1061
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:07.853
<v Speaker 1>in a mediocre Vince Vaughn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're the one I'm talking about </v>

1062

<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1079
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to help me do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishes.</v>

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I want you to want to help me do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishes.</v>

1081
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

1082
00:45:37.921 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so get a new chick.</v>

1083
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 1>The so the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>

1084
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.310
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that was an arcane movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>

1085
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:45.144
<v Speaker 1>but the boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to give the body the body needs </v>

1086
00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:50.970
<v Speaker 1>to want to change and you do that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>using your,</v>

1087
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:56.270
<v Speaker 1>your brain to elect to go to the gym and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift weights or to embark on a,</v>

1088
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.173
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more rigorous and strenuous regimen </v>

1089
00:46:01.081 --> 00:46:03.060
<v Speaker 1>than you had previously encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1090
00:46:03.061 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 1>changing patterns is very difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1091
00:46:05.281 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why New Year's resolutions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always such a joke because everybody,</v>

1092
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people that stick to those</v>

1093
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:15.330
<v Speaker 1>things that they prescribed on January </v>
<v Speaker 1>1st like this is it.</v>

1094
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:16.164
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to January 1st from here on </v>

1095
00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:19.224
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all salads and salmon and running </v>

1096
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:25.971
<v Speaker 1>up hills and then come February 13th for</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky fucking over.</v>

1097
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.290
<v Speaker 1>So over your right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the same thing.</v>

1098
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.480
<v Speaker 1>So sustainability is a huge part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1099
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:31.343
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any program like that and that </v>

1100
00:46:32.131 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 1>changing patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we like about the primal</v>

1101
00:46:34.531 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 1>blueprint is that the foods are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable.</v>

1102
00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So I mean literally and figuratively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Diet,</v>

1103
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.730
<v Speaker 1>the eating strategy is a sustainable </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>

1104
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Rule number one is you never let </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself go hungry.</v>

1105
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:45.383
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of eating a Bagel in the middle </v>

1106
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:47.581
<v Speaker 1>of the afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:48.414
<v Speaker 1>you eat a spoonful of coconut butter or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's got fat in it that </v>

1108
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:55.050
<v Speaker 1>satisfies and you scoop coconut butter </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a snack.</v>

1109
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Coconut butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just butter.</v>

1110
00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:58.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the peanut butter.</v>

1111
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just take a scoop of that.</v>

1112
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not coconut people just checked out.</v>

1113
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.620
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking guy's,</v>

1114
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we talk about the same thing?</v>

1115
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Coconut butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like peanut butter.</v>

1116
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the meat of a coconut.</v>

1117
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's in an almond joy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to fucking cook.</v>

1118
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want a candy bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a god Damn Colantoni man.</v>

1119
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:18.223
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to suspend disbelief a </v>

1120
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:19.914
<v Speaker 1>little bit here and a humor me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go buy a jar of coconut butter and try </v>

1121
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:24.594
<v Speaker 1>it instead of a cookie or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you participate in any sort of </v>

1122
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:30.580
<v Speaker 1>intermittent fasting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

1123
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>

1124
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is again about seeing what we can </v>

1125
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 1>get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm pretty lucky that I can,</v>

1126
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I can get away eating what I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have,</v>

1127
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it compressed eating window.</v>

1128
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 1>So you could argue that I intermittently</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast every day.</v>

1129
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.793
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat from 1231 o'clock to 7:00 PM and </v>

1130
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:51.940
<v Speaker 1>then I don't eat again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't eat it all in the morning?</v>

1131
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1132
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:54.790
<v Speaker 1>there's no concept of the word breakfast</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

1133
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I have a cup of coffee and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll go to the gym fasted,</v>

1134
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.863
<v Speaker 1>I'll do whatever workout I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a heavy weight workout or </v>

1135
00:48:01.961 --> 00:48:02.680
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1136
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 1>it could be a leg day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

1137
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1138
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 1>intervals on a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a two hour paddle faster.</v>

1139
00:48:08.381 --> 00:48:09.214
<v Speaker 1>You find that when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have less energy than if you </v>

1140
00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:12.754
<v Speaker 1>have like some fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference here is I'm really good </v>

1141
00:48:15.371 --> 00:48:16.204
<v Speaker 1>at burning fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I derive my energy from stored body </v>

1142
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:19.624
<v Speaker 1>fat better than a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because I'm genetically gifted in </v>

1143
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:24.664
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because that's how I've lived my </v>

1144
00:48:25.211 --> 00:48:26.044
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I've orchestrated my eating </v>

1145
00:48:26.591 --> 00:48:30.490
<v Speaker 1>strategy over the past 15 or 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I become,</v>

1146
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all the energy I need.</v>

1147
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:33.064
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to tap into the stored </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose in the form of glycogen in my </v>

1148
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 1>liver or in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1149
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:38.680
<v Speaker 1>in my muscles.</v>

1150
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.710
<v Speaker 1>So you essentially have you follow a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ketogenic Diet?</v>

1151
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not ketogenic.</v>

1152
00:48:43.271 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a high fat,</v>

1153
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 1>moderate protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderate carb diet.</v>

1154
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:48.783
<v Speaker 1>But I have enough carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have maybe a hundred to 130 grams of </v>

1155
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:53.010
<v Speaker 1>carbs a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1156
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.070
<v Speaker 1>which would be in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1157
00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.400
<v Speaker 1>in no one's estimation would that be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic?</v>

1158
00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:58.803
<v Speaker 1>But I'm good at burning fat because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent enough time in that sort of low </v>

1159
00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:02.194
<v Speaker 1>carb area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've built the metabolic machinery to </v>

1160
00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:06.130
<v Speaker 1>burn fats really effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd probably,</v>

1161
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to suggest that I have a </v>

1162
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:13.591
<v Speaker 1>lot more mitochondria in my muscle cells</v>
<v Speaker 1>then than other people do because of the</v>

1163
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.470
<v Speaker 1>restricting the carbs and restricting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sugars and forcing my body to become</v>

1164
00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:19.330
<v Speaker 1>good at burning fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

1165
00:49:19.331 --> 00:49:21.490
<v Speaker 1>So how does that pertain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby?</v>

1166
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.533
<v Speaker 1>Please tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does it promote more </v>

1167
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:25.630
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1168
00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 1>when it's called mitochondrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>biogenesis,</v>

1169
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:30.940
<v Speaker 1>so when you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're born,</v>

1170
00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:31.774
<v Speaker 1>you're born again with this recipe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants you to become really good at </v>

1171
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:36.970
<v Speaker 1>burning fat and it very quickly you </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the script.</v>

1172
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.833
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parents feed you grool and oatmeal </v>

1173
00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:44.020
<v Speaker 1>and why back and toast and whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1174
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:47.830
<v Speaker 1>and pureed vegetables and you become </v>
<v Speaker 1>very dependent on,</v>

1175
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.290
<v Speaker 1>on carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the body says,</v>

1176
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to burn fat because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting fed carbohydrate all the time.</v>

1177
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.310
<v Speaker 1>And a couple of responses are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1178
00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I got to get rid of this excess glucose </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1179
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't,</v>

1180
00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:02.253
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's toxic body shouldn't have more </v>

1181
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:04.630
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1182
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.910
<v Speaker 1>90 to 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1183
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.033
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood sugar count should stay </v>

1184
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 1>between say 85 and 70 and a hundred Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1185
00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:14.520
<v Speaker 1>what does the number of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1186
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milliliters per desk deciliter?</v>

1187
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.513
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the exact number is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all over the place with </v>

1188
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:25.810
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol and blood sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that there's the entire</v>

1189
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 1>amount of sugar in your bloodstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now is probably the tablespoon,</v>

1190
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five grams of sugar.</v>

1191
00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not copious amounts.</v>

1192
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:36.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it rises above that,</v>

1193
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.650
<v Speaker 1>you start to get into problems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar can interact with,</v>

1194
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:40.783
<v Speaker 1>with protein molecules and cause a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions that lead to a clogging of </v>

1195
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:46.340
<v Speaker 1>arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a destructive,</v>

1196
00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 1>a destruction of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nerve tissue.</v>

1197
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 1>That's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diabetic damage comes from.</v>

1198
00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Just excessive amounts of sugar that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bloodstream.</v>

1199
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.453
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the body wants to kind of keep that </v>

1200
00:50:58.071 --> 00:50:59.630
<v Speaker 1>level low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1201
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 1>and if you continuously feed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate a all day long,</v>

1202
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're not burning it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not running 20 miles a week,</v>

1203
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a tendency for the body to store</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1204
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 1>store the excess as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as body fat,</v>

1205
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over time.</v>

1206
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.450
<v Speaker 1>For some people that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For others who can get away with it,</v>

1207
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.890
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much a problem.</v>

1208
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.473
<v Speaker 1>So we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of us are at grow up depending on </v>

1209
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.373
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this carbohydrate as a main source of </v>

1210
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:26.174
<v Speaker 1>fuel.</v>

1211
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1212
00:51:28.221 --> 00:51:29.054
<v Speaker 1>you eat a carbohydrate meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high carbohydrate meal causes a surge </v>

1213
00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:32.294
<v Speaker 1>of insulin because the insulin is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the glucose out of the </v>

1214
00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:36.530
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream and store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause again,</v>

1215
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:38.780
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous to have too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1216
00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:39.643
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the insulin surge is so great </v>

1217
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:42.043
<v Speaker 1>that it drops the blood sugar and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get hungry again a couple of hours </v>

1218
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:44.893
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's these swings </v>

1219
00:51:45.831 --> 00:51:46.664
<v Speaker 1>throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are a sh what we call a sugar </v>

1220
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:50.360
<v Speaker 1>burner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1221
00:51:50.361 --> 00:51:54.200
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try and look at a way,</v>

1222
00:51:54.201 --> 00:51:56.000
<v Speaker 1>a different way to configure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

1223
00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1224
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.063
<v Speaker 1>sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you restrict sugar and restrict </v>

1225
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:03.020
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

1226
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:05.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be draconian about it,</v>

1227
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:08.150
<v Speaker 1>but you start to create the need for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body to,</v>

1228
00:52:08.151 --> 00:52:10.160
<v Speaker 1>to start to burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's stored body fat.</v>

1229
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.001
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1230
00:52:11.001 --> 00:52:11.910
<v Speaker 1>the body goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I've,</v>

1231
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:12.943
<v Speaker 1>I've got to save,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw my glucose from my brain because at </v>

1232
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:18.860
<v Speaker 1>the brain runs on glucose and ketones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to,</v>

1233
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to,</v>

1234
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to learn how to burn fat more </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiently.</v>

1235
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.833
<v Speaker 1>And in order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to build more mitochondria cause </v>

1236
00:52:26.361 --> 00:52:27.194
<v Speaker 1>that's where the fat burns inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria and explain to people what </v>

1237
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:30.584
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Mitochondria are the powerhouses of </v>

1238
00:52:32.661 --> 00:52:34.100
<v Speaker 1>the cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every cell has,</v>

1239
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.310
<v Speaker 1>most cells have mitochondria in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

1240
00:52:37.311 --> 00:52:42.311
<v Speaker 1>Cells have lots of Mitochondria that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating ATP,</v>

1241
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:45.040
<v Speaker 1>which is the energy currency of the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses to move to,</v>

1242
00:52:45.041 --> 00:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to exist.</v>

1243
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.590
<v Speaker 1>What does ATP sound for a and </v>
<v Speaker 1>triphosphate?</v>

1244
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.633
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to get a biochem lesson </v>

1245
00:52:50.881 --> 00:52:51.714
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

1246
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.910
<v Speaker 1>But ATP is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is this currency of the body and it</v>

1247
00:52:55.911 --> 00:52:57.860
<v Speaker 1>can be recycled using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1248
00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:00.470
<v Speaker 1>certain different pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glycolytic pathway,</v>

1249
00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:02.130
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't require oxygen.</v>

1250
00:53:02.131 --> 00:53:02.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1251
00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:06.980
<v Speaker 1>and one of the pathways is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is using oxygen in the Mitochondria.</v>

1252
00:53:06.981 --> 00:53:11.981
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very important place to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only build more mitochondria,</v>

1253
00:53:12.381 --> 00:53:15.620
<v Speaker 1>but improve the efficiency of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria and how that happens.</v>

1254
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:16.483
<v Speaker 1>And this is the elegance of this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it certain signals that you give the </v>

1255
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:20.384
<v Speaker 1>body by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by cutting back on the amount of </v>

1256
00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.053
<v Speaker 1>exogenous carbohydrate you take in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>signals go directly to the cells that </v>

1257
00:53:26.821 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to make more Mitochondria.</v>

1258
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 1>And then unique to every other organelle</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the body.</v>

1259
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria have their own DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1260
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:37.763
<v Speaker 1>no other organelle within a cell has it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Mitochondria had their own DNA and </v>

1261
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.060
<v Speaker 1>the DNA and the Mitochondria go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1262
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 1>we better be more efficient at what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1263
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So you upregulate the mitochondrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>biogenesis,</v>

1264
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 1>the creation of more Mitochondria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you upregulate the efficiency of the</v>

1265
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria all done at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene.</v>

1266
00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:57.780
<v Speaker 1>All done through a signal that you gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>by in this case,</v>

1267
00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:58.763
<v Speaker 1>restricting carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it could be increasing the amount </v>

1268
00:54:00.781 --> 00:54:01.614
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1269
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:02.520
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1270
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low level aerobic activity you do </v>

1271
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:06.120
<v Speaker 1>theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be both.</v>

1272
00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And that we talk about that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my new book,</v>

1273
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:09.953
<v Speaker 1>primal endurance.</v>

1274
00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Read your new book and I want you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mark down what he just said,</v>

1275
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.550
<v Speaker 2>like the time on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What time is it here?</v>

1276
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1277
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:20.720
<v Speaker 2>an hour and 10 minutes in or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1278
00:54:20.721 --> 00:54:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Three minutes and 53.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1279
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1280
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.960
<v Speaker 2>that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard that before.</v>

1281
00:54:26.961 --> 00:54:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that your body can change</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of Mitochondria.</v>

1282
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1283
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:33.913
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just from restricting </v>

1284
00:54:37.071 --> 00:54:37.860
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates.</v>

1285
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1286
00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:39.174
<v Speaker 1>it's from a comp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of things you can do it </v>

1287
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 1>a certain forms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1288
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.490
<v Speaker 1>of weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do like what,</v>

1289
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:45.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1290
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.080
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do,</v>

1291
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained a maximum power output stuff.</v>

1292
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a dead lift.</v>

1293
00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:53.550
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to dead lift Max of </v>
<v Speaker 1>500,</v>

1294
00:54:53.551 --> 00:54:55.380
<v Speaker 1>which are dead lift Max jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there.</v>

1295
00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a little heavier than that.</v>

1296
00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kinda Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1297
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.420
<v Speaker 1>so you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1298
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you'd do a workout in the gym where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do 80% of your,</v>

1299
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.820
<v Speaker 1>of your Max,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a se to 400 pounds,</v>

1300
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:09.713
<v Speaker 1>and you might do it four or five times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then rest a few minutes and then do </v>

1301
00:55:13.261 --> 00:55:14.094
<v Speaker 1>it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five times and rest a few </v>

1302
00:55:14.821 --> 00:55:15.654
<v Speaker 1>minutes and do it again and do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing three sets of 10 of </v>

1303
00:55:18.781 --> 00:55:19.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is you're going to do.</v>

1304
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1305
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.253
<v Speaker 1>you load this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you load deeper and deeper into the </v>

1306
00:55:24.271 --> 00:55:26.020
<v Speaker 1>fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1307
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.400
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that the workout's over </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1308
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:31.630
<v Speaker 1>when you can only do one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1309
00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:32.461
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1310
00:55:32.461 --> 00:55:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you can only do one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even try to get the next one.</v>

1311
00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:36.000
<v Speaker 1>The workout's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's,</v>

1312
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that winds up being 15 sets by the</v>

1313
00:55:38.311 --> 00:55:39.144
<v Speaker 1>time you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've maximally overloaded so much </v>

1314
00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:44.130
<v Speaker 1>at a high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not 100% Max because that's,</v>

1315
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.930
<v Speaker 1>now we're talking about danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger,</v>

1316
00:55:45.931 --> 00:55:47.580
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1317
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:51.290
<v Speaker 1>you can do 80% Max and three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one example of,</v>

1318
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.313
<v Speaker 1>of how we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that'll prompt those muscle </v>

1319
00:55:54.661 --> 00:55:56.520
<v Speaker 1>tissues to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to build more Mitochondria.</v>

1320
00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Because if you probably heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1321
00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 1>a truly effective weight session causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to burn fat throughout the day.</v>

1322
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.123
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the best ways to get lean.</v>

1324
00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:11.700
<v Speaker 2>And it's one thing that people sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't aware of.</v>

1325
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Most people when they want to get lean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think about cardio.</v>

1326
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.770
<v Speaker 2>They start doing a lot of extra cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know</v>

1327
00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it's weightlifting that really makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean.</v>

1328
00:56:17.831 --> 00:56:18.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1329
00:56:18.261 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1330
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.240
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting and spreads nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>

1331
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.230
<v Speaker 1>nothing cuts you up like sprint hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1332
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hills really do it.</v>

1333
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1334
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 2>when you were talking about increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>mitochondria,</v>

1335
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:30.184
<v Speaker 2>like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of an increase are we talking </v>

1336
00:56:31.781 --> 00:56:32.614
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>

1337
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Double.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Double.</v>

1338
00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1339
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:37.880
<v Speaker 1>up to up to double.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1340
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1341
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:42.040
<v Speaker 2>And what are the other effects of having</v>
<v Speaker 2>double the amount of Mitochondria?</v>

1342
00:56:42.041 --> 00:56:43.410
<v Speaker 2>What are the other positive benefits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1343
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.761
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1344
00:56:44.761 --> 00:56:45.594
<v Speaker 1>more energy throughout the day because </v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're so good at burning fat and </v>

1345
00:56:48.931 --> 00:56:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you have all this machinery to burn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

1346
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1347
00:56:53.281 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1348
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:56.550
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry less often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1349
00:56:56.551 --> 00:56:58.280
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting when we look back at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1350
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.980
<v Speaker 1>how hunger runs our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1351
00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:05.250
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the carbohydrate sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning paradigm,</v>

1352
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the most important meal of the day.</v>

1353
00:57:08.221 --> 00:57:12.810
<v Speaker 1>It might be a bagels and toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Special K.</v>

1354
00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1355
00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Special K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1356
00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:15.690
<v Speaker 1>a glass of juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget,</v>

1357
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.190
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1358
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I have that instant sugar water hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 50 grams of sugar before you,</v>

1359
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:20.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you head out the door and you're </v>

1360
00:57:20.941 --> 00:57:22.900
<v Speaker 1>not even supposed to have 150 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar in a day.</v>

1361
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1362
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.320
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people said what I'm saying,</v>

1363
00:57:25.321 --> 00:57:26.154
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying you're not supposed to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than I like one 50 is a max amount </v>

1364
00:57:28.981 --> 00:57:30.900
<v Speaker 1>of total carbohydrates that I have in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1365
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So sugar is as a minor minor subset of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1366
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

1367
00:57:36.211 --> 00:57:36.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1368
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you get to work and 10 30 rolls around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's time for a break.</v>

1369
00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Don't break room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't at somebody brought donuts today,</v>

1370
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.930
<v Speaker 1>shelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1371
00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.670
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1372
00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 1>where are we going for lunch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1373
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Skoda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1374
00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 1>get a pizza or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1375
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:53.070
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another break in the afternoon,</v>

1376
00:57:53.071 --> 00:57:53.904
<v Speaker 1>they get home and you have dinner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have some ice cream or </v>

1377
00:57:56.761 --> 00:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>something watching tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next thing you know,</v>

1378
00:57:59.161 --> 00:57:59.851
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1379
00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:04.500
<v Speaker 1>you've taken in six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>700 grams of carbs in that day.</v>

1380
00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're good at burning fat,</v>

1381
00:58:06.511 --> 00:58:07.830
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up in the morning,</v>

1382
00:58:07.831 --> 00:58:08.720
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1383
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1384
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I need to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1385
00:58:11.161 --> 00:58:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1386
00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:14.460
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things we talk about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the panel blueprint,</v>

1387
00:58:14.461 --> 00:58:15.300
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not hungry,</v>

1388
00:58:15.301 --> 00:58:16.290
<v Speaker 1>then don't eat.</v>

1389
00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:20.130
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the signals your body's giving</v>

1390
00:58:20.131 --> 00:58:22.620
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can get away with not eating,</v>

1391
00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:25.740
<v Speaker 1>and when I say don't eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear.</v>

1392
00:58:25.741 --> 00:58:28.560
<v Speaker 1>It's important that we have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not hungry.</v>

1393
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:29.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

1394
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.720
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Eh,</v>

1395
00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move on.</v>

1396
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:34.351
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

1397
00:58:34.351 --> 00:58:35.184
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thought experiment a while back and I </v>

1398
00:58:36.571 --> 00:58:37.404
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1399
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.020
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting cause when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in college,</v>

1400
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:41.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of my college buddies know me </v>

1401
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:45.960
<v Speaker 1>as Arnold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know me as mark.</v>

1402
00:58:45.961 --> 00:58:48.480
<v Speaker 1>They call me arnold because when we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>in college,</v>

1403
00:58:48.481 --> 00:58:49.314
<v Speaker 1>there was a TV show called green acres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a pig on the show called </v>

1404
00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Ziff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could eat more than anybody in,</v>

1405
00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.130
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the college I went to,</v>

1406
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.180
<v Speaker 1>including the football team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people would call me Arnold Ziff.</v>

1407
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And so I became Ahrens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arnie Arnold for most of my life.</v>

1408
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.753
<v Speaker 1>It's just because the amount of food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because the amount of food I could </v>

1409
00:59:08.371 --> 00:59:09.450
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1410
00:59:09.451 --> 00:59:11.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have a contests or is this,</v>

1411
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.553
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're going to eat that </v>

1412
00:59:14.131 --> 00:59:14.964
<v Speaker 1>dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to eat those,</v>

1413
00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:16.790
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna eat that steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have that.</v>

1414
00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.053
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was running a hundred miles a </v>

1415
00:59:18.961 --> 00:59:19.794
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a skinny shit have weighed 30 </v>

1416
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 1>pounds less than I weigh now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

1417
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:25.550
<v Speaker 1>the throughput was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was where it was.</v>

1418
00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 1>And because I had a leaky gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot of it just went right out</v>

1419
00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 1>the button out the button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1420
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1421
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the thought experiment was that my whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>life I sort of was guilty of this.</v>

1422
00:59:39.531 --> 00:59:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Like how much food can I eat and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>gain weight and not be uncomfortable.</v>

1423
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:45.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1424
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:46.640
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of people look that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1425
00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1426
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:50.120
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go eat lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much food can I eat and a,</v>

1427
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:53.840
<v Speaker 1>and not gain weight or how much of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cake or that pie can or whatever.</v>

1428
00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:55.760
<v Speaker 1>People I think tend to this is this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1429
00:59:55.761 --> 00:59:58.080
<v Speaker 1>what can I get away with part of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1430
00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 1>what if you shifted that around and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1431
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.573
<v Speaker 1>what's the least amount of food I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat and maintain muscle mass and </v>

1432
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:05.114
<v Speaker 1>maintain energy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not get sick and most importantly </v>

1433
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:09.763
<v Speaker 1>not be hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you find if you do this experiments </v>

1434
01:00:11.871 --> 01:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you become good at burning fat,</v>

1435
01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.770
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your appetite.</v>

1436
01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:16.693
<v Speaker 1>So self regulates and so mitigates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find yourself pushing a plate of </v>

1437
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:22.394
<v Speaker 1>food away after a couple of bites or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being hungry or eating just the right </v>

1438
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>amount of food to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1439
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.100
<v Speaker 1>to get you through the day.</v>

1440
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>What do you keep your body fat out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1441
01:00:31.191 --> 01:00:33.710
<v Speaker 1>so I'm 62 now and build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1442
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my people would look at me and </v>

1443
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:37.221
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1444
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>you must be six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7%.</v>

1445
01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably nine,</v>

1446
01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe nine and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10%.</v>

1447
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:42.763
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people lie about their body </v>

1448
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1449
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:45.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear these stories of the wide </v>

1450
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>receiver that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1452
01:00:49.001 --> 01:00:50.060

<v Speaker 1>that's not even possible.</v>

1453
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1454
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1455
01:00:52.201 --> 01:00:53.870
<v Speaker 1>and even with the bodybuilders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that,</v>

1456
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>that get down that that lien are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to death,</v>

1457
01:00:59.360 --> 01:00:59.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1458
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:00.704
<v Speaker 1>that's dieting down that the day before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the contest to get there and they </v>

1459

<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pack it right on afterwards.</v>

1460
01:01:05.121 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1461
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:06.951
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1462
01:01:06.951 --> 01:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>so the body fat thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1463
01:01:08.271 --> 01:01:09.104
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've stayed at this same V v visible I </v>

1464
01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1465
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>body fat level</v>

1466
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:15.883
<v Speaker 3>since I was in my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a result of a lot of </v>

1467
01:01:19.881 --> 01:01:22.040
<v Speaker 3>strenuous exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of long distance running,</v>

1468
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:22.650
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1469
01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:23.483
<v Speaker 3>the different things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>participate in as well as this body </v>

1470
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:27.853
<v Speaker 3>burning fat primarily because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about if you've been in this </v>

1471
01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.773
<v Speaker 3>same body fat percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of your life do you haven't </v>

1472
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:40.440
<v Speaker 3>adjusted what usually happens now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now forties when you adjusted your,</v>

1473
01:01:40.441 --> 01:01:42.590
<v Speaker 3>you're done in my forties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1474
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.100
<v Speaker 3>so what happens now is I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't run at all.</v>

1475
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I was a career runner for the first part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my life and uh,</v>

1476
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:52.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't run a mile.</v>

1477
01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I have not run a mile in like 13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do now for exercise?</v>

1478
01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.550
<v Speaker 1>So I lift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1479
01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.820
<v Speaker 1>twice a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do an upper body sort of full,</v>

1480
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.040
<v Speaker 1>full routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't separate,</v>

1481
01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:05.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chest and Tris and back and buys and all</v>

1482
01:02:05.561 --> 01:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do a full routine.</v>

1483
01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:07.893
<v Speaker 1>That's a smart way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's separating stuff kind of </v>

1484
01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>malarkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1485
01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:11.794
<v Speaker 1>it's at separating stuff as if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a job and it's good for a body </v>

1486
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>building to go to the gym every day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do two hours and whatever.</v>

1487

1509
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:11.814
<v Speaker 1>field or a soccer field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two teams trying to advance the Frisbee </v>

1510
01:03:13.861 --> 01:03:16.620
<v Speaker 1>down the field by making completed </v>
<v Speaker 1>passes to their teammates.</v>

1511
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:18.300
<v Speaker 1>When you're a pastor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1512
01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.193
<v Speaker 1>you can't run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody else on your team is </v>

1513
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:21.420
<v Speaker 1>trying to get open.</v>

1514
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Speaker 1>So they're running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get away from their defenders.</v>

1515
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 1>You complete a pass and eventually if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you complete a pass over the,</v>

1516
01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.600
<v Speaker 1>the end zone or the goal line at a point</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

1517
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.230
<v Speaker 1>but if at any point in time Jamie just </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts them on the board here.</v>

1518
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there he goes guys.</v>

1519
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check that out.</v>

1520
01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:37.340
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Watch,</v>

1521
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.000
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1522
01:03:39.001 --> 01:03:39.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1523
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you know any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at any point in time,</v>

1524
01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 1>well they need some black people on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>report because first of all,</v>

1525
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a white guy was running slow.</v>

1526
01:03:45.391 --> 01:03:49.320
<v Speaker 1>She definitely got to that anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty,</v>

1527
01:03:49.321 --> 01:03:50.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty athletic game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

1528
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

1529
01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not black.</v>

1530
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.430
<v Speaker 1>There is a good layout right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1531
01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a good catch actually.</v>

1532
01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.334
<v Speaker 1>No and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have those every week that we </v>

1533
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>played a bunch of those.</v>

1534
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very fast paced game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

1535
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:08.460
<v Speaker 1>if you lose the Frisbee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's turned over by your teammate,</v>

1536
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.280
<v Speaker 1>either drop it or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes the other teams,</v>

1537
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:14.220
<v Speaker 1>a frisbee going in the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction and now you've got to get back</v>

1538
01:04:14.221 --> 01:04:17.100
<v Speaker 1>on defense and defend the same guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was defending you in most cases.</v>

1539
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.593
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you throw the Frisbee and the </v>

1540
01:04:20.191 --> 01:04:22.530
<v Speaker 1>other guy doesn't catch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the other team gets it.</v>

1541
01:04:22.531 --> 01:04:23.364
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it got to try and do the same </v>

1542
01:04:23.971 --> 01:04:24.804
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1543
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And so you're sprinting a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

1544
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1545
01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:30.960
<v Speaker 1>soccer players come out and basketball </v>
<v Speaker 1>players come out and they go,</v>

1546
01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:31.471
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1547
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't walk on Monday after that </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1548
01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.650
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just ridiculous.</v>

1549
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.740
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running except ultimate thing except you</v>

1550
01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:39.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight to ten second bursts.</v>

1551
01:04:39.061 --> 01:04:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And how that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that plays out for me is,</v>

1552
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1553
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.983
<v Speaker 1>some of the recent research is you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing intervals like the old </v>

1554
01:04:46.321 --> 01:04:47.154
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do 60 seconds or a minute and a half </v>

1555
01:04:48.571 --> 01:04:49.404
<v Speaker 1>interval as a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I used to go to the track and do 16 </v>

1556
01:04:53.401 --> 01:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>times one half mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1557
01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at race pace.</v>

1558
01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>So now we're doing all out sprints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 seconds,</v>

1559
01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:02.010
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 20 seconds,</v>

1560
01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>but your Max,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max Max the whole way.</v>

1561
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1562
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:04.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1563
01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:08.490
<v Speaker 1>sufficient enough rest and come back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it again and do it six,</v>

1564
01:05:08.491 --> 01:05:09.324
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

1565
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:09.871
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

1566
01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:10.704
<v Speaker 1>seven times and you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That workout is over and you have </v>

1567
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.873
<v Speaker 1>accrued the benefits probably at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater rate than would have had you </v>

1568
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>done</v>

1569
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.770
<v Speaker 3>the old method of training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was to do,</v>

1570
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:21.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1571
01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:22.534
<v Speaker 3>repeat quarters or 200 or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that a lot of what the </v>

1572
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:26.134
<v Speaker 3>old methods were doing was just as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as people getting through with mental </v>

1573
01:05:29.081 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 3>toughness and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting some benefit of it,</v>

1574
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Speaker 3>but you're also kind of breaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself down too much?</v>

1575
01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of endurance athletics is,</v>

1576
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:43.060
<v Speaker 3>is pain management and overtraining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:48.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like half the races that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was most prepared for.</v>

1578
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:49.683
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sucked in because I was overtrained I </v>

1579
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:51.874
<v Speaker 3>left everything on the training field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big problem with fighters as </v>

1580
01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:57.010
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With UFC fighters.</v>

1581
01:05:57.011 --> 01:05:57.844
<v Speaker 3>It's a gigantic issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure out what is the </v>

1582
01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:03.420
<v Speaker 3>right amount of work you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:04.443
<v Speaker 3>And especially with fighters because in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mixed martial arts or dealing with </v>

1584
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.033
<v Speaker 3>different disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have your grappling every striking </v>

1585
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:12.820
<v Speaker 3>give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting them all together.</v>

1586
01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.330
<v Speaker 3>You have submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have takedowns,</v>

1587
01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:15.183
<v Speaker 3>you have a bunch of different things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to train as well as </v>

1588
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.810
<v Speaker 3>rigorous strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs.</v>

1589
01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:23.350
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of debate as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>what should you put,</v>

1590
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.393
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most time and effort into and some of </v>

1591
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:27.940
<v Speaker 3>the more successful people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really an interesting,</v>

1592
01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:29.043
<v Speaker 3>have been going away from skill training</v>
<v Speaker 3>during camps when they prepare for a </v>

1593
01:06:32.921 --> 01:06:33.754
<v Speaker 3>fight and going almost exclusively to </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning programs with </v>

1594
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:37.534
<v Speaker 3>very minimal skill training where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning program takes </v>

1595
01:06:39.851 --> 01:06:43.330
<v Speaker 3>precedent over everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I find very fascinating.</v>

1596
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:45.760
<v Speaker 3>The idea behind that being you already </v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to fight.</v>

1597
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 3>So what they're going to do is get your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body to a place where it can function at</v>

1598
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:49.594
<v Speaker 3>the highest work rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a big factor in that is maintaining </v>

1599
01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.053
<v Speaker 3>a healthy heart rate and make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making sure that you don't overtrain </v>

1600
01:06:58.151 --> 01:06:59.950
<v Speaker 3>making sure that you have enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>recovery time,</v>

1601
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.113
<v Speaker 3>100% agree.</v>

1602
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1603
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.550
<v Speaker 3>we say that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1604
01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:05.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>training triathletes and runners here.</v>

1605
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:08.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of time you spend on the bike</v>

1606
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.000
<v Speaker 3>after you've been doing it for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of years,</v>

1607
01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:10.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to ride.</v>

1608
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.823
<v Speaker 3>So let's train the component.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's break the race down into its </v>

1609
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:15.580
<v Speaker 3>component parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1610
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:16.414
<v Speaker 3>how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you sustain your power over </v>

1611
01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:20.284
<v Speaker 3>the next three hills to where your </v>
<v Speaker 3>output on the third hill is essentially </v>

1612
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:24.244
<v Speaker 3>the same as it was in the first hill </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus in the old days where you are </v>

1613
01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:27.364
<v Speaker 3>100% going over the first hill and at </v>
<v Speaker 3>90% over the second hill in 77% going </v>

1614
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:34.810
<v Speaker 3>over the third hill because you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hadn't trained that part of your,</v>

1615
01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:36.310
<v Speaker 3>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1616
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.233
<v Speaker 3>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your regimen that one of the things </v>

1617
01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:41.164
<v Speaker 3>we say to endurance athletes is how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>races have you finished where you were </v>

1618
01:07:43.301 --> 01:07:46.390
<v Speaker 3>out of breath and maybe you had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprint,</v>

1619
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.253
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1620
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.790
<v Speaker 3>because you were neck and neck with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1621
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:49.624
<v Speaker 3>But most endurance athletes don't finish</v>
<v Speaker 3>a marathon out of breath because long </v>

1622
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:56.570
<v Speaker 3>ago their form fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1623
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.513
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their muscle tissue started to break </v>

1624
01:07:58.901 --> 01:08:01.420
<v Speaker 3>down because they hadn't trained for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustained power.</v>

1625
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.300
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1626
01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.680
<v Speaker 3>the aerobic part of it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel we could do this all day long.</v>

1627
01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 3>You're just going slow because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

1628
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:07.923
<v Speaker 3>you didn't train appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's some strength training </v>

1629
01:08:11.711 --> 01:08:14.620
<v Speaker 3>components like even to something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon running.</v>

1630
01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>So now we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're saying that the next,</v>

1632
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:19.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next breakthroughs in in marathon </v>

1633
01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>running will come from somebody who has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has trained Quito genically and,</v>

1634
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>and we didn't talk about that yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1635
01:08:27.711 --> 01:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>has restricted carbs to the extent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1636
01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyclical.</v>

1637
01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know how to access ketones,</v>

1638
01:08:33.891 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>which are a byproduct of fat metabolism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can use the ketones in place of</v>

1639
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>glucose or glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1640
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:43.760
<v Speaker 1>they can use the ketones to fuel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain to,</v>

1641
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:44.623
<v Speaker 1>to will them to continue the pace </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done the work in the gym where </v>

1642
01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:49.244
<v Speaker 1>they can maintain a sustained power </v>
<v Speaker 1>output over 26 miles and not have it </v>

1643
01:08:52.581 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 1>fall apart and not have formed breakdown</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 miles into the race.</v>

1644
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1645
01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.273
<v Speaker 1>and if you put all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different component parts </v>

1646
01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you and do it with a,</v>

1647
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.770
<v Speaker 1>with an elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world class athlete,</v>

1648
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you look at,</v>

1649
01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.100
<v Speaker 1>at the next level of records being </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken,</v>

1650
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:11.870
<v Speaker 1>the problem is it's so antithetical to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we trained for the last 40 years</v>

1651
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.910
<v Speaker 1>that you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1652
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:15.150
<v Speaker 1>an elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1653
01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 1>professional runner who's already had </v>
<v Speaker 1>some amount of success.</v>

1654
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:19.813
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1655
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to shift everything around.</v>

1656
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:24.530
<v Speaker 1>It's going to cost you the next 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>months to adapt,</v>

1657
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:26.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's a good chance that you'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1658
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:27.850
<v Speaker 1>The guy's gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1659
01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hard for his.</v>

1660
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so hard.</v>

1661
01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to,</v>

1662
01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.760
<v Speaker 1>to give up something and give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's working right.</v>

1663
01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1664
01:09:36.341 --> 01:09:37.220
<v Speaker 1>to get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1665
01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:38.493
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back to something you said </v>

1666
01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.460
<v Speaker 1>while you were just explaining that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

1667
01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.350
<v Speaker 1>you get someone to train ketogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1668
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you,</v>

1669
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.160
<v Speaker 1>there are periods of time when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>restricting carbs so much that you're,</v>

1670
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.203
<v Speaker 1>you're creating a more ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are this byproduct of fat </v>

1671
01:09:56.091 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 1>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've already become good at what we</v>

1672
01:09:57.921 --> 01:09:59.810
<v Speaker 1>call your become fat adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we say,</v>

1673
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.003
<v Speaker 1>you become good at burning fat and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're building further metabolic </v>

1674
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:03.710
<v Speaker 1>machinery.</v>

1675
01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:06.770
<v Speaker 1>That access is ketones better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now ketones,</v>

1676
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:10.700
<v Speaker 1>which we we refer to as the fourth fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have proteins,</v>

1677
01:10:10.701 --> 01:10:11.451
<v Speaker 1>fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates,</v>

1678
01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:13.190
<v Speaker 1>ketones are the fourth fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>

1679
01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:15.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we evolve to use ketones very </v>

1680
01:10:16.761 --> 01:10:17.690
<v Speaker 1>efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

1681
01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.130
<v Speaker 1>there were times throughout millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of human evolution where it wasn't</v>

1682
01:10:22.131 --> 01:10:22.964
<v Speaker 1>like you skip lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you skipped last week eating </v>

1683
01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:26.204
<v Speaker 1>right and you had to maintain muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass and maintain a thought capability </v>

1684
01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>and maintain speed and health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1685
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:34.783
<v Speaker 1>despite not eating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to do that was to </v>

1686
01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:37.304
<v Speaker 1>access was to access the stored body fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd stored from overeating or </v>

1687
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:45.290
<v Speaker 1>eating slightly more than you needed be </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the last time there was actually food</v>

1688
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:48.860
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we're all wired to overeat.</v>

1689
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:52.310
<v Speaker 1>And this ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1690
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:55.940
<v Speaker 1>to use the byproduct of the fabric </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism to fuel the brain.</v>

1691
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>So ketones actually the brain loves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run on ketones.</v>

1692
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.433
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens in </v>

1693
01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:04.100
<v Speaker 1>particularly in endurance contest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suspect that happens in mma fights</v>

1694
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:06.470
<v Speaker 1>toward the end of the fight is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1695
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:07.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1696
01:11:07.151 --> 01:11:09.350
<v Speaker 1>you feel gassed and you run out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you starting to,</v>

1697
01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.510
<v Speaker 1>to run low on glycogen and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to,</v>

1698
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really feel like the wheels are </v>

1699
01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:15.900
<v Speaker 1>coming off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More often than not,</v>

1700
01:11:15.901 --> 01:11:19.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a brain just is a lack of glucose </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the brain.</v>

1701
01:11:19.051 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>The brain isn't being powered enough and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain goes a timeout.</v>

1702
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:23.904
<v Speaker 1>We gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta,</v>

1703
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.800
<v Speaker 1>we gotta pull over the side of the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>and take a nap.</v>

1704
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:26.873
<v Speaker 1>So it'll make you mentally exhausted </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your body's running on glycogen </v>

1705
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>and glucose rather than exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1706
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:33.504
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you run out of glycogen and </v>

1707
01:11:35.601 --> 01:11:38.850
<v Speaker 1>glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old theory was,</v>

1708
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:39.833
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you hit the wall in any </v>

1709
01:11:41.011 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>of these events are you bonk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they say,</v>

1710
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.863
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because you've depleted glycogen so </v>

1711
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:46.800
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

1712
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.380
<v Speaker 1>The muscles can't function anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1713
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:50.214
<v Speaker 1>the research now shows that you'd never </v>
<v Speaker 1>really deplete the glycogen in the </v>

1714
01:11:53.011 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go from 500 or 600 grams total in</v>

1715
01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never get lower than one 50.</v>

1716
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:01.140
<v Speaker 1>So there's always some glycogen laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on?</v>

1717
01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the brain and its lack of access to</v>

1718
01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:07.410
<v Speaker 1>glucose that is shutting you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Tim noakes,</v>

1719
01:12:07.411 --> 01:12:08.244
<v Speaker 1>the guy we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor Tim noakes at the beginning </v>

1720
01:12:09.931 --> 01:12:10.920
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the show here,</v>

1721
01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he coined a phrase that the central </v>

1722
01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:14.520
<v Speaker 1>governor theory of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

1723
01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:17.760
<v Speaker 1>the reason a lot of people hit the wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't because you're out of glycogen.</v>

1724
01:12:17.761 --> 01:12:21.300
<v Speaker 1>But it's because the brain as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>override mechanism says,</v>

1725
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.390
<v Speaker 1>in order to prevent further damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to stop.</v>

1726
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

1727
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:26.843
<v Speaker 1>it manifests itself as a system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a sensation of tiredness and </v>

1728
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.473
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1729
01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could find a way to bypass that,</v>

1730
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1731
01:12:36.391 --> 01:12:39.390
<v Speaker 1>and keep the brain going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because remember,</v>

1732
01:12:39.391 --> 01:12:41.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the brain running on glucose,</v>

1733
01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:44.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that once it runs out of that fuel says,</v>

1734
01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sensing there's no fuel,</v>

1735
01:12:46.591 --> 01:12:49.440
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to pull over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what ketones do.</v>

1736
01:12:49.441 --> 01:12:53.640
<v Speaker 1>So when you become good at accessing </v>
<v Speaker 1>stored body fat in producing ketones,</v>

1737
01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:55.140
<v Speaker 1>and you've built the metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>machinery,</v>

1738
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.300
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use those ketones,</v>

1739
01:12:58.170 --> 01:12:59.003
<v Speaker 1>and we know from history and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics and from modern science that </v>

1740
01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.320
<v Speaker 1>that the brain runs really well on </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones.</v>

1741
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Now you founded a substitute fuel for </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose,</v>

1742
01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:11.640
<v Speaker 1>so you can run out of glucose and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ketones will keep the brain,</v>

1743
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:13.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revving and uh,</v>

1744
01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:17.220
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and guiding you at the same pace again,</v>

1745
01:13:17.221 --> 01:13:20.580
<v Speaker 1>provided you've done the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work in the gym to maintain the,</v>

1746
01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:22.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the form and the power.</v>

1747
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.851
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1748
01:13:23.851 --> 01:13:25.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1749
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.650
<v Speaker 1>this is all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say kind of theoretical now</v>

1750
01:13:28.651 --> 01:13:30.930
<v Speaker 1>because the real world records haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been broken yet.</v>

1751
01:13:30.931 --> 01:13:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Some are being broken in the ultra </v>
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>

1752
01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:33.204
<v Speaker 1>the hundred mile run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of guys doing </v>

1753
01:13:35.881 --> 01:13:38.850
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic and low carb training who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking records like crazy.</v>

1754
01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:40.203
<v Speaker 1>I'm Zack bitter is a guy who in the in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lab has shown that he could derive </v>

1755
01:13:43.591 --> 01:13:48.591
<v Speaker 1>96% of his total energy running seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute miles from fat.</v>

1756
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:52.403
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

1757
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:55.830
<v Speaker 1>it's seven minute miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like race pace for,</v>

1758
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I saying,</v>

1759
01:13:57.001 --> 01:13:57.834
<v Speaker 1>race based sprint pace for most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that fast for a marathoner or </v>

1760
01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:04.590
<v Speaker 1>even an elite runner and elite runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

1761
01:14:04.591 --> 01:14:08.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a substantial patient for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a guy running a hundred miles a,</v>

1762
01:14:08.851 --> 01:14:09.684
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty good clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to derive 95 to 96% of all energy </v>

1763
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:15.363
<v Speaker 1>from your stored body fat or from </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerates Fathi or eating and just a </v>

1764
01:14:18.491 --> 01:14:21.880
<v Speaker 1>tiny bit required from glycogen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose.</v>

1765
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:23.283
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think 30 or 40 years ago we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would've said not only was that </v>

1766
01:14:26.021 --> 01:14:26.854
<v Speaker 1>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like twice as it twice times </v>

1767
01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:29.224
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

1768
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefit of that for athletes has got</v>

1769
01:14:31.941 --> 01:14:32.774
<v Speaker 2>to be incredible in terms of motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of enthusiasm towards the end </v>

1770
01:14:36.411 --> 01:14:37.244
<v Speaker 2>of the race or an end of a fight or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines where your </v>

1771
01:14:39.951 --> 01:14:40.784
<v Speaker 2>body would run out of the glycogen into </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose and instead you have fat to </v>

1772
01:14:44.211 --> 01:14:45.440
<v Speaker 2>burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>

1773
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:49.280
<v Speaker 2>your mind doesn't drop off as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind doesn't hit that wall.</v>

1774
01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be she,</v>

1775
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.393
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that alone should be motivation for </v>

1776
01:14:53.451 --> 01:14:55.280
<v Speaker 2>people to at least attempt to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1777
01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1778
01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.380
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to highly glycolytic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1779
01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:01.660
<v Speaker 1>experiences like mma and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1780
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.610
<v Speaker 1>you can't derive a us a substantial part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your energy from fat that's still has</v>

1781
01:15:06.611 --> 01:15:07.960
<v Speaker 1>to come from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from glycogen.</v>

1782
01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:08.711
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1783
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:09.570
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1784
01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:10.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a point at which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1785
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:12.910
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your throughput of oxygen,</v>

1786
01:15:12.911 --> 01:15:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance athletes,</v>

1787
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.280
<v Speaker 1>they're measuring their output over two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1788
01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.380
<v Speaker 1>seven hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1789
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:21.790
<v Speaker 1>now you're talking five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

1790
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:22.690
<v Speaker 1>five minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1791
01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:24.920
<v Speaker 1>now you've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1792
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to that same output is </v>

1793
01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:29.810
<v Speaker 1>concentrated now and you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1794
01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.600
<v Speaker 1>at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a fairly high rate.</v>

1795
01:15:31.601 --> 01:15:32.231
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1796
01:15:32.231 --> 01:15:33.064
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see them,</v>

1797
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:34.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're jumping around and dancing </v>

1798
01:15:34.841 --> 01:15:36.790
<v Speaker 1>around and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving back and forth.</v>

1799
01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:37.624
<v Speaker 1>So there's recovery periods in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still have to have that hundred </v>

1800
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:41.583
<v Speaker 1>percent intense glycolytic output.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're in a hold and trying to </v>

1801
01:15:44.231 --> 01:15:45.490
<v Speaker 1>escape or when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1802
01:15:45.491 --> 01:15:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to defend her and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come in for a barrage,</v>

1803
01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to be at 100% of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of output,</v>

1804
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's brief periods of time.</v>

1805
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:57.630
<v Speaker 1>So conceivably you could train in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym to access that part of,</v>

1806
01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:03.220
<v Speaker 1>of your body that Burns fats that Burns </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones.</v>

1807
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:04.241
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1808
01:16:04.241 --> 01:16:06.310
<v Speaker 1>almost the most important part would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>making weight.</v>

1809
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1810
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:09.550
<v Speaker 1>if you're look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in mma,</v>

1811
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:12.190
<v Speaker 1>it's about power to weight ratios to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain extent.</v>

1812
01:16:12.191 --> 01:16:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of obviously skill,</v>

1813
01:16:13.541 --> 01:16:14.920
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a power to weight ratio.</v>

1814
01:16:14.921 --> 01:16:15.970
<v Speaker 1>If I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm,</v>

1815
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>142 pounds,</v>

1816
01:16:18.131 --> 01:16:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the weight with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>divisions are,</v>

1817
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:22.810
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm carrying around,</v>

1818
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:27.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm at one 65 and I have to cut down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>one 42 to get to my division.</v>

1819
01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lose power.</v>

1820
01:16:29.231 --> 01:16:31.480
<v Speaker 1>But if I maintain that power and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

1821
01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I never even get up to one 65 anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not gaining fat because I've</v>

1822
01:16:35.621 --> 01:16:38.350
<v Speaker 1>learned how to burn fat and I could stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective and functional at,</v>

1823
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.273
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the weight that I'm at that has </v>

1824
01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:41.740
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1825
01:16:41.741 --> 01:16:43.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's a power to weight ratio </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

1826
01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.150
<v Speaker 2>You would have to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hybrid diet then yes.</v>

1827
01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:48.720
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in something like mma.</v>

1828
01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so,</v>

1829
01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:50.483
<v Speaker 1>so once you've built the metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>machinery to burn fat and to burn </v>

1830
01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.260
<v Speaker 1>ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't go away when you start eating</v>

1831
01:16:55.261 --> 01:16:56.190
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>

1832
01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.310
<v Speaker 1>you can do what we call this cyclical </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach where you spend,</v>

1833
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:00.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1834
01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.213
<v Speaker 1>in the early phases of your training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become really good at burning fat </v>

1835
01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:04.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do stuff that's,</v>

1836
01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.453
<v Speaker 1>that's contemplated to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make you the best possible fat </v>

1837
01:17:07.921 --> 01:17:09.650
<v Speaker 1>burner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can pay a,</v>

1838
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 1>then you might introduce some </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates,</v>

1839
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:13.363
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day before a really hard glycolytic </v>

1840
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1841
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:18.343
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't turn off your fat burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even really negatively </v>

1842
01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>impact your ability to handle ketones if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it for six weeks.</v>

1843
01:17:25.191 --> 01:17:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And you do nothing but cars for six </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>

1844
01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:27.434
<v Speaker 1>then it all shifts back again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Upregulation and downregulation of of </v>

1845
01:17:30.741 --> 01:17:34.160
<v Speaker 1>enzymes based on gene input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gene expression.</v>

1846
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:37.700
<v Speaker 1>But if you built the metabolic machinery</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you keep coming back to it,</v>

1847
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.370
<v Speaker 1>then you can craft a strategy where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1848
01:17:40.371 --> 01:17:41.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow we're just going to do,</v>

1849
01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% glycolytic stuff.</v>

1850
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:47.480
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be be prepared to puke all </v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon or whatever.</v>

1851
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.070
<v Speaker 1>You have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1852
01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:49.933
<v Speaker 1>150 grams of carbs and the sweet potato </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for dinner that night you topped </v>

1853
01:17:52.941 --> 01:17:55.310
<v Speaker 1>off your glycogen stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still good at burning fat.</v>

1854
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.480
<v Speaker 1>You have all the glycogen that you even </v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly have loaded if you'd just</v>

1855
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:02.660
<v Speaker 1>been a carbohydrate based athlete ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>

1856
01:18:03.230 --> 01:18:04.063
<v Speaker 1>You just pick the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the times when you're going to up the </v>

1857
01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:06.854
<v Speaker 1>ante with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with ex extra carb intake and you make </v>

1858
01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:10.250
<v Speaker 1>sure it's not sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1859
01:18:10.251 --> 01:18:11.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good,</v>

1860
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1861
01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:13.683
<v Speaker 1>a starchy carb in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a sweet potato or you </v>

1862
01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:17.690
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yam or something like that.</v>

1863
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 1>So how do you regulate the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugars that are in your body?</v>

1864
01:18:21.891 --> 01:18:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you limit the amount of fruit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat?</v>

1865
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how do I,</v>

1866
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:30.170
<v Speaker 1>can you eat as much fruit as you like or</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that not a good idea?</v>

1867
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1868
01:18:31.761 --> 01:18:32.630
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1869
01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 1>most fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some amount of fruit is good.</v>

1870
01:18:35.691 --> 01:18:38.180
<v Speaker 1>But I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what cracks me up is number of people to</v>

1871
01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:40.550
<v Speaker 1>say I'm on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a very healthy diet.</v>

1872
01:18:40.551 --> 01:18:41.384
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1873
01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:42.853
<v Speaker 1>12 servings of fruit a day and I go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamba juice and I get a big fruit </v>

1874
01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:46.550
<v Speaker 1>smoothie and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1875
01:18:46.551 --> 01:18:48.710
<v Speaker 1>you're taking it more sugar than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1876
01:18:48.711 --> 01:18:50.690
<v Speaker 1>the guy is drinking two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six packs of coke.</v>

1877
01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:54.500
<v Speaker 1>So even sugar that comes from fruit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily healthy.</v>

1878
01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>

1879
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:59.720
<v Speaker 1>all these things exist on a spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1880
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I might have blueberries every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I love blueberries.</v>

1881
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Grew up in Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1882
01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:06.650
<v Speaker 1>picking them wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I love blueberries,</v>

1883
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:09.170
<v Speaker 1>but they're low in sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're Tart,</v>

1884
01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:12.590
<v Speaker 1>they've got antioxidants in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't overdo them,</v>

1885
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.650
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will limit yourself to like a cop or</v>

1886
01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:16.280
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1887
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't even limit at look at for 99 a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pack for organic blueberries.</v>

1888
01:19:22.101 --> 01:19:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I limit myself based on budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on right on any other metric.</v>

1889
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:27.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many servings of fruit will you </v>

1890
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:30.080
<v Speaker 1>allow yourself in a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1891
01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:34.610
<v Speaker 1>just because I don't feel the need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat fruit.</v>

1892
01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

1893
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a craving for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1894
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:41.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe made a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe two servings is the most elliot in</v>

1895
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:42.374
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some days.</v>

1896
01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.000
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1897
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.560
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1898
01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1899
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:47.803
<v Speaker 1>some of the citrus fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these things can be way over </v>

1900
01:19:49.341 --> 01:19:53.570
<v Speaker 1>done pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not necessarily saying don't eat</v>

1901
01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:56.570
<v Speaker 1>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying don't consider fruit the</v>

1902
01:19:56.571 --> 01:19:59.390
<v Speaker 1>healthiest possible alternative to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1903
01:19:59.391 --> 01:20:00.224
<v Speaker 1>bread and pasta and then replace all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the calories you've got from bread and </v>

1904
01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 1>pasta and cereal and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't replace that with fruit,</v>

1905
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.883
<v Speaker 1>but figure out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like vegetables for the most part are </v>

1906
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.120
<v Speaker 1>the ideal source of carbohydrates in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

1907
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:14.880
<v Speaker 1>They're locked in his fibers matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1908
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:15.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1909
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.943
<v Speaker 1>they're basically low glycemic index,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they kind of drip into the </v>

1910
01:20:19.951 --> 01:20:22.140
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a reasonable pace.</v>

1911
01:20:22.141 --> 01:20:27.141
<v Speaker 1>Don't cause a huge surge in glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So celery with coconut butter would be a</v>

1912
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:31.110
<v Speaker 1>much healthier alternative than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>banana.</v>

1913
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:32.910
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1914
01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:35.930
<v Speaker 1>not that healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Healthier is the wrong term.</v>

1915
01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 1>And we were making choices here based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to accomplish.</v>

1916
01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:39.960
<v Speaker 1>No good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no right or wrong,</v>

1917
01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:40.771
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a,</v>

1918
01:20:40.771 --> 01:20:41.604
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1919
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a perfect world,</v>

1920
01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:46.260
<v Speaker 1>celebrate the coconut butter is a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

1921
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:49.050
<v Speaker 1>And a banana at the right time is maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>a better choice,</v>

1922
01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:51.300
<v Speaker 1>like postworkout bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good choice.</v>

1923
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on who you are.</v>

1924
01:20:52.441 --> 01:20:56.250
<v Speaker 1>If I fast after the workout too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's kind of interesting.</v>

1925
01:20:56.850 --> 01:20:57.683
<v Speaker 1>There's so much of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these little nuanced science bits </v>

1926
01:21:02.071 --> 01:21:02.790
<v Speaker 1>that you pick up.</v>

1927
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:03.623
<v Speaker 1>And I've been in the supplement business</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 30 years designing supplements for </v>

1928
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:08.244
<v Speaker 1>other companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the supplements I made a </v>

1929
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:11.060
<v Speaker 1>bunch of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1930
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.920
<v Speaker 1>for a very large company today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1931
01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:15.413
<v Speaker 1>was a post workout drink and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved it and everybody thought it was </v>

1932
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:20.400
<v Speaker 1>the greatest thing they'd ever tasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was in,</v>

1933
01:21:20.401 --> 01:21:21.810
<v Speaker 1>it had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1934
01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:22.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1935
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:26.730
<v Speaker 1>had it had carbohydrates and it had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>

1936
01:21:26.731 --> 01:21:28.290
<v Speaker 1>It had some creatine and it was great </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

1937
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.903
<v Speaker 1>But the purpose of the drink was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover from the hard workout you did </v>

1938
01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:35.603
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could do the bitch again </v>

1939
01:21:37.411 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not how I train anymore.</v>

1940
01:21:40.381 --> 01:21:44.610
<v Speaker 1>So I don't do two hard days in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for that particular purpose,</v>

1941
01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:47.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to train hard every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to replace glycogen,</v>

1942
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:50.820
<v Speaker 1>then that's a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a choice.</v>

1943
01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 1>If he say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1944
01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:53.910
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do some hard glycolytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>work today,</v>

1945
01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:55.350
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

1946
01:21:55.351 --> 01:21:57.180
<v Speaker 1>going to do some hard glycolytic work </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>

1947
01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.630
<v Speaker 1>then then let's have a post workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high carb,</v>

1948
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.340
<v Speaker 1>relatively high carb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1949
01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:07.580
<v Speaker 1>supplement because there's this window </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which the body manufacturers glycogen</v>

1950
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 1>refills glycogen stores at a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate,</v>

1951
01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:12.503
<v Speaker 1>just workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole reason for the </v>

1952
01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:14.763
<v Speaker 1>postworkout meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people like to drink </v>

1953
01:22:17.191 --> 01:22:18.570
<v Speaker 1>chocolate milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1954
01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you are,</v>

1955
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:22.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1956
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:24.000
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're going to go,</v>

1957
01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from day to day,</v>

1958
01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.540
<v Speaker 1>then that's probably a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1959
01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:31.350
<v Speaker 1>another strategy would be to go really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard today.</v>

1960
01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Do a deep leg day and then fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1961
01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:34.074
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you fast is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>replenish the glycogen but you preserve </v>

1962
01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:39.084
<v Speaker 1>the pulse of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of growth hormone and testosterone that </v>

1963
01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:41.784
<v Speaker 1>happens as a result of the leg day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we you would otherwise blunt by </v>

1964
01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:47.460
<v Speaker 1>taking in a sugary drink.</v>

1965
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1966
01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.430
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

1967
01:22:50.770 --> 01:22:51.603
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1968
01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.450
<v Speaker 1>it's complex and yet it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The science is pretty cool.</v>

1969
01:22:54.451 --> 01:22:56.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1970
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:58.400
<v Speaker 1>insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1971
01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 1>has an effect on growth hormone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone actually lowers it.</v>

1972
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.370
<v Speaker 1>So if you are eating a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a,</v>

1973
01:23:05.371 --> 01:23:06.204
<v Speaker 1>a post workout meal that's high in carbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to refill the glycogen </v>

1974
01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:11.710
<v Speaker 1>stores so that you can do it again </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

1975
01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the postworkout meal will cause a </v>

1976
01:23:15.851 --> 01:23:19.570
<v Speaker 1>rise in insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will blunt the glycogen,</v>

1977
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:20.463
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the growth hormone and testosterone </v>

1978
01:23:21.341 --> 01:23:26.341
<v Speaker 1>pulse that you got from that workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you'll have glycogen stores slightly</v>

1979
01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.290
<v Speaker 1>more ready for the hard work out again </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

1980
01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Now what are you trying to accomplish </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

1981
01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:35.500
<v Speaker 1>What what I'm saying is I'd rather just </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the workout really hard,</v>

1982
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:39.610
<v Speaker 1>get all of the benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the growth benefits then looking for and</v>

1983
01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:43.420
<v Speaker 1>not have to do it again tomorrow I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work as little as pot I want.</v>

1984
01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.313
<v Speaker 1>If I want to do a leg day and Puke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know because of it today I don't </v>

1985
01:23:48.311 --> 01:23:51.520
<v Speaker 1>want to do it again tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only working out to get the benefits.</v>

1986
01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not working out for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>working out.</v>

1987
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not working out every single day </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just love to go to the gym and</v>

1988
01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 1>some people do by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to judge that,</v>

1989
01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:01.653
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm working out to get the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of benefits I can from the work </v>

1990
01:24:04.571 --> 01:24:09.571
<v Speaker 1>that I've chosen to do and in this case </v>
<v Speaker 1>that includes my strategy post workout.</v>

1991
01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:11.800
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1992
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.633
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fascinating because I've never </v>

1993
01:24:13.721 --> 01:24:16.120
<v Speaker 2>heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a catch 22.</v>

1994
01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:21.121
<v Speaker 2>So refueling the glycogen levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually deplenishes though it blunt.</v>

1995
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Blunt is the best word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1996
01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Deplenishes I sent even a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

1997
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:28.323
<v Speaker 2>You make it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's trade trade market right now to </v>

1998
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.440
<v Speaker 2>plan it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

1999
01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:34.750
<v Speaker 2>I said it like it was real too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2000
01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:37.720
<v Speaker 2>but I've never heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

2001
01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:40.570
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be catch 22 in there then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like.</v>

2002
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:46.770
<v Speaker 2>So is there a negative effect of having </v>
<v Speaker 2>those hard workouts more than one day in</v>

2003
01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:49.330
<v Speaker 2>a row?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And would you be better off in,</v>

2004
01:24:49.331 --> 01:24:54.040
<v Speaker 2>would you gain more if you went the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it by not replenishing,</v>

2005
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2006
01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.093
<v Speaker 2>Now it's even for an elite athlete </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's competing in a sport like say </v>

2007
01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:02.170
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts or something along </v>
<v Speaker 2>those lines.</v>

2008
01:25:02.171 --> 01:25:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2009
01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:03.213
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what the game plan is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the week and what the game plan is to </v>

2010
01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 1>get you into the ring or to get you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the starting line.</v>

2011
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2012
01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:13.860
<v Speaker 1>if we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2013
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

2014
01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2015
01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.110
<v Speaker 1>let's just use a leg day again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2016
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you're doing hard legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do it again tomorrow.</v>

2017
01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:23.884
<v Speaker 1>So there's no need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the post workout drink because </v>

2018
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.013
<v Speaker 1>here's what else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that happens is if you </v>

2019
01:25:31.061 --> 01:25:34.450
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wait a couple of hours,</v>

2020
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:37.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have an hour or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a meal,</v>

2021
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even a high carb meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a regular meal.</v>

2022
01:25:39.641 --> 01:25:41.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not high carb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not contemplated to,</v>

2023
01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:46.720
<v Speaker 1>to increase glycogen stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but within that meal and within the next</v>

2024
01:25:46.721 --> 01:25:49.110
<v Speaker 1>meal and within the next meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body will riff.</v>

2025
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:51.370
<v Speaker 1>It'll replenish glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it'll,</v>

2026
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:52.690
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wants to do that.</v>

2027
01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:53.553
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not preventing it from </v>

2028
01:25:53.891 --> 01:25:58.891
<v Speaker 1>replenishing glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no immediate urgency to do it</v>

2029
01:25:59.771 --> 01:26:01.540
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a post workout drink.</v>

2030
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:02.403
<v Speaker 1>If the meals for the rest of the day or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next morning have some amount of </v>

2031
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:07.124
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of which will go to replenishing </v>

2032
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:10.363
<v Speaker 1>glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might wind up instead of having </v>

2033
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:13.880
<v Speaker 1>restored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2034
01:26:13.881 --> 01:26:16.220
<v Speaker 1>275 grams of glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.133
<v Speaker 2>Restore 230 big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the benefits of forcing your </v>

2036
01:26:21.941 --> 01:26:22.774
<v Speaker 2>body to do more work to up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning level and would that be </v>

2037
01:26:27.671 --> 01:26:32.671
<v Speaker 2>mitigated or wood with some like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you will your strategy being too,</v>

2038
01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.593
<v Speaker 2>not replenish the stores after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout and to not have those hard </v>

2039
01:26:38.921 --> 01:26:41.020
<v Speaker 2>workouts two days in a row?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

2040
01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 2>if you instead had the hard workout </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2041
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:49.180
<v Speaker 2>through your idea of allowing your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have its natural,</v>

2042
01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uptake of testosterone and growth </v>

2043
01:26:51.431 --> 01:26:52.264
<v Speaker 2>hormone because of that hard workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then giving yourself adequate time to </v>

2044
01:26:54.821 --> 01:26:57.430
<v Speaker 2>recover before engaging in the next hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2045
01:26:57.431 --> 01:26:58.264
<v Speaker 2>I would you in fact have more progress </v>
<v Speaker 2>then keeping slamming your head up </v>

2046
01:27:01.721 --> 01:27:03.880
<v Speaker 2>against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is at least with like,</v>

2047
01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers and for mixed martial artists,</v>

2048
01:27:06.731 --> 01:27:07.564
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the time that's the standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>operational approach is to beat your </v>

2049
01:27:10.301 --> 01:27:11.134
<v Speaker 2>body down to be absolutely exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think that's in fact maybe </v>

2050
01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.880
<v Speaker 2>counterintuitive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally think,</v>

2051
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I totally think that is wow.</v>

2052
01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2053
01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.900
<v Speaker 1>the notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2054
01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.130
<v Speaker 1>and again this is during sports and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mixed martial arts are,</v>

2055
01:27:26.190 --> 01:27:28.440
<v Speaker 1>are very similar in it's about pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>management.</v>

2056
01:27:28.441 --> 01:27:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about managing,</v>

2057
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:33.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally a pain and perceive pain,</v>

2058
01:27:33.630 --> 01:27:35.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a exertion over time.</v>

2059
01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

2060
01:27:38.161 --> 01:27:39.590
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2061
01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:41.363
<v Speaker 1>that you can train in the gym in </v>
<v Speaker 1>selective areas that all come together </v>

2062
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.910
<v Speaker 1>in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a legitimate choice.</v>

2063
01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.013
<v Speaker 1>But another choice and the one for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 30 years is sort of the rocky </v>

2064
01:27:51.811 --> 01:27:52.644
<v Speaker 1>Balboa choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just go hard every single day </v>

2065
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and build up the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when it comes up,</v>

2066
01:27:57.870 --> 01:27:58.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2067
01:27:58.831 --> 01:28:02.170
<v Speaker 1>the fifth round and mental toughness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2068
01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:06.960
<v Speaker 1>really comes to play there and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to dig deeper just because you know</v>

2069
01:28:06.961 --> 01:28:07.794
<v Speaker 1>how to beat yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not to say that one's better </v>

2070
01:28:10.171 --> 01:28:12.180
<v Speaker 1>than the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just alternative strategies.</v>

2071
01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:14.190
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest runners the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever produced.</v>

2072
01:28:14.191 --> 01:28:15.024
<v Speaker 1>Steve Prefontaine was fairly talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not the most talented runner in </v>

2073
01:28:19.021 --> 01:28:20.430
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2074
01:28:20.431 --> 01:28:21.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would,</v>

2075
01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:23.760
<v Speaker 1>he would go to the starting line and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd look at some guy who was,</v>

2076
01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.920
<v Speaker 1>who was clearly a more talented but </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't had,</v>

2077
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:29.783
<v Speaker 1>they'd run the Sim similar times and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prefontaine would look them in the face </v>

2078
01:28:31.771 --> 01:28:32.581
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2079
01:28:32.581 --> 01:28:33.414
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may be more fit and more talented </v>

2080
01:28:34.261 --> 01:28:36.360
<v Speaker 1>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm willing to die for this.</v>

2081
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to hurt more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2082
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:39.090
<v Speaker 1>and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

2083
01:28:39.091 --> 01:28:40.200
<v Speaker 1>he could dig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig deep.</v>

2084
01:28:40.201 --> 01:28:44.350
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it was a result of his hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 20 mile weeks of training and,</v>

2085
01:28:44.351 --> 01:28:45.184
<v Speaker 1>and beating himself up every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose there's value in that in a </v>

2086
01:28:48.451 --> 01:28:52.530
<v Speaker 1>sport where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time that gun goes off till the</v>

2087
01:28:52.531 --> 01:28:53.364
<v Speaker 1>time you cross the finish line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never sang to yourself in a </v>

2088
01:28:56.101 --> 01:28:56.580
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>

2089
01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fun.</v>

2090
01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2091
01:28:59.221 --> 01:29:00.600
<v Speaker 1>you never know if you're at the elite </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

2092
01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 1>you never that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2093
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's about pain management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

2094
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.693
<v Speaker 1>there's a legitimate strategy in maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>having some days where you do what I </v>

2095
01:29:10.471 --> 01:29:15.471
<v Speaker 1>outlined and some days or some weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you do what you outlined is,</v>

2096
01:29:15.481 --> 01:29:17.100
<v Speaker 1>are they mutually exclusive though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2097
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:17.940
<v Speaker 1>here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2098
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:21.600
<v Speaker 1>do you have to beat yourself up in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be mentally tough?</v>

2099
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Can't you be mentally tough just through</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation?</v>

2100
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have to beat yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to be mentally tough.</v>

2101
01:29:27.421 --> 01:29:29.760
<v Speaker 1>And the danger there is you literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat yourself up,</v>

2102
01:29:29.761 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 1>but the dangerous you overtrain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that,</v>

2103
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.673
<v Speaker 1>maybe doing that and trying to force </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself into these mentally tough </v>

2104
01:29:37.741 --> 01:29:38.574
<v Speaker 1>exercises is actually a form of weakness</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not able to look at your </v>

2105
01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:44.400
<v Speaker 1>body objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not able to assess it.</v>

2106
01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And more of a scientific fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2107
01:29:46.351 --> 01:29:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the,</v>

2108
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:51.810
<v Speaker 1>back in the day when I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>training for marathons and triathlons,</v>

2109
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I defined myself worth as based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous workout I'd done,</v>

2110
01:29:58.250 --> 01:29:59.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you skip a day and you feel like a </v>

2111
01:30:00.841 --> 01:30:03.830
<v Speaker 1>slacker and hoser and a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2112
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:05.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet,</v>

2113
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:06.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2114
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:07.783
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was chronically overtrained all the </v>

2115
01:30:08.791 --> 01:30:11.670
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had those days back because,</v>

2116
01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have,</v>

2117
01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my career would have been extended.</v>

2118
01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.920
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had him back,</v>

2119
01:30:16.921 --> 01:30:17.754
<v Speaker 1>I probably wouldn't have arrived at </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I am today through the pain and </v>

2120
01:30:20.611 --> 01:30:22.010
<v Speaker 1>the suffering and the sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2121
01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.240
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2122
01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2123
01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:29.040
<v Speaker 1>my friend Steve Maxwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a strength conditioning coach,</v>

2124
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.903
<v Speaker 1>says that you should monitor your heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate every morning and if your heart </v>

2125
01:30:34.261 --> 01:30:37.560
<v Speaker 1>rate is over a certain beats per minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over what?</v>

2126
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It's naturally normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five plus beats per minute.</v>

2127
01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:42.990
<v Speaker 1>You just take the day off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

2128
01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 1>That's one modality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one protocol.</v>

2129
01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's now heart rate variability,</v>

2130
01:30:48.541 --> 01:30:49.374
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which looks beyond what the heart rate </v>

2131
01:30:51.151 --> 01:30:51.984
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks at the,</v>

2132
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.823
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time between the beats and </v>

2133
01:30:54.931 --> 01:30:58.590
<v Speaker 1>suggest that if there's greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability,</v>

2134
01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:01.560
<v Speaker 1>if there's more time or there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's you know,</v>

2135
01:31:01.561 --> 01:31:02.394
<v Speaker 1>0.8 seconds here and 1.1 second here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.7 and 1.1 that that's better than </v>

2136
01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:07.494
<v Speaker 1>having 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of counterintuitive because </v>

2137
01:31:09.691 --> 01:31:10.524
<v Speaker 1>you'd think the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd want the heart to beat </v>

2138
01:31:11.161 --> 01:31:12.500
<v Speaker 1>metronomically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.810
<v Speaker 1>But if it's beating metronomically it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sign of overtraining annually.</v>

2140
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2141
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a sign of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a low heartbeat.</v>

2142
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so correct.</v>

2143
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.430
<v Speaker 1>If you wake up and you got 40 beats per </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute,</v>

2144
01:31:23.431 --> 01:31:25.380
<v Speaker 1>but they're all the same equal beats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2145
01:31:25.770 --> 01:31:26.520
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to happen.</v>

2146
01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.353
<v Speaker 1>It's typically going to be higher with </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've overtrained as well as having </v>

2147
01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:35.480
<v Speaker 1>a metronomic interval to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2148
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:36.443
<v Speaker 1>but there are programs you can get so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can wear your heart monitor and get </v>

2149
01:31:38.881 --> 01:31:39.714
<v Speaker 1>these hrv heart rate variability </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs and they'll literally tell you </v>

2150
01:31:42.361 --> 01:31:45.270
<v Speaker 1>what the score you for the day till he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>use those.</v>

2151
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2152
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:50.520
<v Speaker 1>primarily because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2153
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I have a premature ventricular </v>
<v Speaker 1>contractions,</v>

2154
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:56.940
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now at 62.</v>

2155
01:31:56.941 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this for 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2156
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 1>actually 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started running when I was 12 a to and</v>

2157
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:06.430
<v Speaker 1>from school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like that nut brown African lad,</v>

2158
01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:09.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my converse,</v>

2159
01:32:09.821 --> 01:32:10.654
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2160
01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:11.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneakers on.</v>

2161
01:32:11.891 --> 01:32:12.724
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2162
01:32:12.850 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 1>so I've been doing this a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent so much of my career,</v>

2163
01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.680
<v Speaker 1>stupidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishly,</v>

2164
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:20.440
<v Speaker 1>my heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart rate out every day.</v>

2165
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:22.030
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2166
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written about this for the last two</v>

2167
01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:25.234
<v Speaker 1>decades about how training for endurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition is somewhat antithetical to </v>

2168
01:32:29.351 --> 01:32:30.970
<v Speaker 1>health and certainly training the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to,</v>

2169
01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.960
<v Speaker 1>which is accumulating miles and miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and miles in,</v>

2170
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.450
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2171
01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:34.870
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2172
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:36.520
<v Speaker 1>at a heart rate that we call the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole,</v>

2173
01:32:36.521 --> 01:32:38.290
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2174
01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:42.400
<v Speaker 1>it's too high to benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2175
01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:45.190
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but too low to,</v>

2176
01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:46.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create sort of the interval training </v>

2177
01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:47.980
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

2178
01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:48.813
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2179
01:32:49.210 --> 01:32:51.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it again explain it in the book,</v>

2180
01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:56.161
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spent years and years and years,</v>

2181
01:32:56.231 --> 01:33:01.231
<v Speaker 1>decades training a lot of athletes at </v>
<v Speaker 1>say anywhere from 75 to 85% of their max</v>

2182
01:33:02.891 --> 01:33:04.330
<v Speaker 1>heart rate for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>

2183
01:33:04.331 --> 01:33:05.470
<v Speaker 1>three hours at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

2184
01:33:05.471 --> 01:33:07.090
<v Speaker 1>over time the heart responds to that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets,</v>

2185
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:08.583
<v Speaker 1>it gets thicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart muscle gets thicker and </v>

2186
01:33:10.331 --> 01:33:11.630
<v Speaker 1>thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2187
01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:14.650
<v Speaker 1>partly it's like the heart can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a say in it.</v>

2188
01:33:14.651 --> 01:33:17.380
<v Speaker 1>So your brain tells your legs to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the heart goes,</v>

2189
01:33:17.381 --> 01:33:19.060
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotta keep up with this cat.</v>

2190
01:33:19.061 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 1>So the heart's pumping away in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumping away,</v>

2191
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:23.020
<v Speaker 1>in pumping away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do this enough,</v>

2192
01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:24.543
<v Speaker 1>day in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day out,</v>

2193
01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.870
<v Speaker 1>day out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over years,</v>

2194
01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:28.900
<v Speaker 1>the heart starts to get damaged a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

2195
01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:29.734
<v Speaker 1>And in some cases it gets thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ventricle gets thicker and thicker </v>

2196
01:33:32.051 --> 01:33:33.220
<v Speaker 1>because it's growing muscle.</v>

2197
01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:33.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

2198
01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:34.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2199
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily a good kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thicker,</v>

2200
01:33:36.970 --> 01:33:38.260
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2201
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:39.870
<v Speaker 1>it may be stretched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2202
01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:41.560
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may just not have,</v>

2203
01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.110
<v Speaker 1>it may not recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to the gym and you say,</v>

2204
01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:45.280
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2205
01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:46.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2206
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:49.720
<v Speaker 1>200 preacher curls of 75 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2207
01:33:49.730 --> 01:33:51.430
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to say,</v>

2208
01:33:51.431 --> 01:33:52.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2209
01:33:52.391 --> 01:33:53.224
<v Speaker 1>my boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe your biceps can handle that </v>

2210
01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:54.994
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my camp.</v>

2211
01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.193
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2212
01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they'll,</v>

2213
01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:58.360
<v Speaker 1>they'll fry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll shred,</v>

2214
01:33:58.810 --> 01:34:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but they feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel it.</v>

2215
01:34:00.011 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Speaker 1>The pain is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2216
01:34:01.571 --> 01:34:02.980
<v Speaker 1>the heart doesn't feel that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

2217
01:34:02.981 --> 01:34:06.790
<v Speaker 1>So if you force the heart to calf to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep up and it's a demand Oregon,</v>

2218
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:07.624
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just feeds whatever the demand is </v>

2219
01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:11.360
<v Speaker 1>from the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2220
01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:14.440
<v Speaker 1>and if that's held at too high a heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate for too long,</v>

2221
01:34:14.441 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 1>over decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can manifest itself in problems.</v>

2222
01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 1>There's item,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an epidemic of Afib,</v>

2223
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:24.700
<v Speaker 1>atrial fibrillation in my generation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>runners from that very problem.</v>

2224
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.080
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

2225
01:34:26.081 --> 01:34:29.440
<v Speaker 1>so I have the occasional premature </v>
<v Speaker 1>ventricular contraction,</v>

2226
01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.630
<v Speaker 1>which is just a couple of cells in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

2227
01:34:31.631 --> 01:34:34.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe a thickness in the ventricle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>misfire every once in a while.</v>

2228
01:34:34.631 --> 01:34:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not life threatening.</v>

2229
01:34:36.581 --> 01:34:37.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just annoying.</v>

2230
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:39.423
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2231
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:40.383
<v Speaker 1>it makes my hrv look really good cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's big interval between </v>

2232
01:34:44.171 --> 01:34:45.280
<v Speaker 1>beats sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2233
01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:47.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a false positive.</v>

2234
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

2235
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:52.420
<v Speaker 1>So you don't necessarily monitor your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart rate because of that?</v>

2236
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.313
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of more go on the way you </v>

2237
01:34:55.391 --> 01:34:56.290
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2238
01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

2239
01:34:57.381 --> 01:34:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm at my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at my age,</v>

2240
01:34:58.731 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I just want to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to play.</v>

2241
01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2242
01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not seeking to win any age group </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitions anymore.</v>

2243
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Those days are long behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hurts too much.</v>

2244
01:35:07.761 --> 01:35:08.510
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2245
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:09.920
<v Speaker 1>it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2246
01:35:09.921 --> 01:35:10.754
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to extract the greatest </v>

2247
01:35:11.241 --> 01:35:12.590
<v Speaker 1>amount of pleasure out of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>

2248
01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:16.100
<v Speaker 1>when I go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much contemplated to,</v>

2249
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do as little as possible.</v>

2250
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:21.680
<v Speaker 1>That keeps me looking good naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

2251
01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps me somewhat immune from injury.</v>

2252
01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a very honest of your brother or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2253
01:35:25.941 --> 01:35:27.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

2254
01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care about that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2255
01:35:29.651 --> 01:35:30.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2256
01:35:30.111 --> 01:35:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I still going to care about that until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day I die.</v>

2257
01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:32.650
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2258
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:33.643
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2259
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:35.550
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2260
01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 1>it's about avoiding injury when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

2261
01:35:37.641 --> 01:35:39.530
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm playing Frisbee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2262
01:35:39.531 --> 01:35:40.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sprinting,</v>

2263
01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.291
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2264
01:35:41.291 --> 01:35:46.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm keeping up with 20 somethings on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a long bomb run to the end zone a and</v>

2265
01:35:46.821 --> 01:35:47.654
<v Speaker 1>then have to come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn around and come back and get them </v>

2266
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:50.324
<v Speaker 1>on defense.</v>

2267
01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2268
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.630
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has some cost attached to it.</v>

2269
01:35:53.631 --> 01:35:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some metabolic costs for an old guy like</v>

2270
01:35:55.941 --> 01:35:57.500
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the stuff I do in the gym is trying,</v>

2271
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:59.690
<v Speaker 1>is trying to keep me from getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>injured,</v>

2272
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:00.913
<v Speaker 1>knock wood and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I spent time on the paddle for </v>

2273
01:36:03.831 --> 01:36:07.100
<v Speaker 1>two hours and it's a best upper body </v>
<v Speaker 1>workout you'll ever get paddling.</v>

2274
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Stand up paddling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2275
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2276
01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun and I don't think,</v>

2277
01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when's he going to be over?</v>

2278
01:36:14.571 --> 01:36:15.291
<v Speaker 1>I'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

2279
01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get back cause I've got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting,</v>

2280
01:36:16.461 --> 01:36:17.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out hanging out with dolphins and </v>

2281
01:36:17.871 --> 01:36:20.420
<v Speaker 1>whales and looking down at fish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>catching the wave once in a while.</v>

2282
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to have,</v>

2283
01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

2284
01:36:23.710 --> 01:36:24.910
<v Speaker 3>when I moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I workout,</v>

2285
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:25.960
<v Speaker 3>I did some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2286
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.823
<v Speaker 3>paddling a few years back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a canoe trip down the Missouri </v>

2287
01:36:30.011 --> 01:36:31.420
<v Speaker 3>River and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2288
01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.190
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was shocked at how tired my arms got.</v>

2289
01:36:35.230 --> 01:36:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like a legit workout.</v>

2290
01:36:37.241 --> 01:36:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought I was in pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>

2291
01:36:38.651 --> 01:36:39.484
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be nothing paddling St </v>

2292
01:36:41.351 --> 01:36:42.071
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2293
01:36:42.071 --> 01:36:42.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2294
01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.240
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a good shots when w,</v>

2295
01:36:44.250 --> 01:36:45.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after paddling,</v>

2296
01:36:45.610 --> 01:36:48.300
<v Speaker 3>and that's how I tr I treated it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>workout too.</v>

2297
01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Just decided like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2298
01:36:49.541 --> 01:36:51.220
<v Speaker 3>we're doing this for a couple hours a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2299
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:52.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just,</v>

2300
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:54.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to leave it all out there on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the river,</v>

2301
01:36:55.150 --> 01:36:55.983
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were with some other guys who </v>

2302
01:36:56.761 --> 01:36:58.240
<v Speaker 3>were under the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to kick their ass.</v>

2303
01:36:58.450 --> 01:36:59.283
<v Speaker 3>So I was just trying to stay ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them the entire way and calling them </v>

2304
01:37:01.481 --> 01:37:03.460
<v Speaker 3>pussies and yelling at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2305
01:37:03.461 --> 01:37:05.010
<v Speaker 3>But it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lat work out.</v>

2306
01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:05.940
<v Speaker 3>It's Serratus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2307
01:37:05.970 --> 01:37:07.150
<v Speaker 3>it's deltoids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everything.</v>

2308
01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.440
<v Speaker 3>One of the big issues with a Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitors and,</v>

2309
01:37:11.441 --> 01:37:14.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just practice even as a hobby is,</v>

2310
01:37:14.231 --> 01:37:16.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a joint injuries,</v>

2311
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:20.500
<v Speaker 3>inflammation in the joints and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also spine injuries,</v>

2312
01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:23.170
<v Speaker 3>a lot of bulging discs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things along those lines.</v>

2313
01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.513
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that some of that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitigated by reducing the amount of </v>

2314
01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:30.160
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory foods?</v>

2315
01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:31.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2316
01:37:31.671 --> 01:37:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got such a trauma based sport,</v>

2317
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little,</v>

2318
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:39.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

2319
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:40.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're 10% less prone to getting the </v>

2320
01:37:42.831 --> 01:37:45.530
<v Speaker 1>disc issue or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the joint,</v>

2321
01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:48.740
<v Speaker 1>the joint pain as a result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of that is just the brute,</v>

2322
01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 1>just the brute force of the impact and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2323
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>

2324
01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.920
<v Speaker 1>that's a choice that you make to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those sports.</v>

2325
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not</v>

2326
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.040
<v Speaker 3>even impact like with grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it is just,</v>

2327
01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.820
<v Speaker 3>it's just twisting and twisting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>constant pressure and yeah,</v>

2328
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.073
<v Speaker 3>just the day to day grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Jujitsu is one of those sports </v>

2329
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:12.000
<v Speaker 3>where a lot of recreational </v>
<v Speaker 3>practitioners who get really addicted to</v>

2330
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:13.380
<v Speaker 3>it because it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2331
01:38:13.381 --> 01:38:14.214
<v Speaker 3>you're essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having a life or death struggle </v>

2332
01:38:16.471 --> 01:38:19.530
<v Speaker 3>with someone and you can tap out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then go right back at it.</v>

2333
01:38:19.531 --> 01:38:21.620
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very different than a lot of other,</v>

2334
01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:23.550
<v Speaker 3>other martial arts in that way that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

2335
01:38:23.551 --> 01:38:26.400
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of do it a full blast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2336
01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Whereas sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kickboxing and things along,</v>

2337
01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:29.613
<v Speaker 3>you really can't do it full blast for </v>
<v Speaker 3>very long because the body just can't </v>

2338
01:38:32.401 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 3>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The head can't take it.</v>

2339
01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.613
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2340
01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with Jujitsu,</v>

2341
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys are injured then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just wrap themselves up and kind of</v>

2342
01:38:40.951 --> 01:38:42.440
<v Speaker 3>go back in where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2343
01:38:42.441 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to roll light and my next</v>
<v Speaker 3>bother may just lay off my neck.</v>

2344
01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 3>And I always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2345
01:38:48.451 --> 01:38:49.284
<v Speaker 3>is there maybe a dietary choice that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could perhaps limit the amount of </v>

2346
01:38:53.071 --> 01:38:56.040
<v Speaker 3>inflammation that you're experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 3>after these brutal workouts?</v>

2347
01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:56.941
<v Speaker 3>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2348
01:38:56.941 --> 01:38:57.660
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>

2349
01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:01.680
<v Speaker 3>if the Diet is currently horrendous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then just probably some amount of,</v>

2350
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.460
<v Speaker 3>some amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2351
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:04.290
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2352
01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:05.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2353
01:39:05.190 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 3>management of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could,</v>

2354
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:08.340
<v Speaker 3>that could be increased in pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>

2355
01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Could be a little bit better and less </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation for sure.</v>

2356
01:39:10.951 --> 01:39:14.330
<v Speaker 3>But if the Diet's already good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then um,</v>

2357
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.293
<v Speaker 3>you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still putting the body through </v>

2358
01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:18.024
<v Speaker 3>some unnatural torsions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just amazed that we were talking </v>

2359
01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:23.700
<v Speaker 3>about your hands and arthritis deep into</v>
<v Speaker 3>your forties,</v>

2360
01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 3>that you were able to mitigate that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>by changing your diet.</v>

2361
01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:28.860
<v Speaker 3>It was so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

2362
01:39:28.861 --> 01:39:29.694
<v Speaker 3>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually the most powerful thing for me </v>

2363
01:39:32.041 --> 01:39:32.874
<v Speaker 3>was the ibs cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it literally ruined my life or ruled my </v>

2364
01:39:35.461 --> 01:39:36.180
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2365
01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:36.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2366
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:38.640
<v Speaker 3>but the arthritis thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2367
01:39:38.641 --> 01:39:39.474
<v Speaker 3>I play golf with friends and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even grip the frig and club the </v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2385
01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:24.080
<v Speaker 3>what other ways do you think there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>dietary ways to reduce information other</v>

2386
01:40:24.241 --> 01:40:28.190
<v Speaker 3>than a reduction of grains or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or elimination of grains?</v>

2387
01:40:28.210 --> 01:40:29.043
<v Speaker 3>Know I say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get rid of the industrial seed </v>

2388
01:40:30.601 --> 01:40:33.450
<v Speaker 3>oils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you replace the soybean oil,</v>

2389
01:40:33.451 --> 01:40:35.970
<v Speaker 3>the canola oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the corn oil,</v>

2390
01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:36.883
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at the labels of the </v>

2391
01:40:37.801 --> 01:40:39.600
<v Speaker 3>ingredients because they're all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2392
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:40.833
<v Speaker 3>The different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the different mechanism in the </v>

2393
01:40:42.061 --> 01:40:42.894
<v Speaker 3>body as far as like the way your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>processes s soy or corn oil versus </v>

2394
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:50.520
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil is the profile of fatty </v>
<v Speaker 3>acids.</v>

2395
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:51.623
<v Speaker 3>These are polyunsaturated fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they're partially </v>

2396
01:40:53.831 --> 01:40:54.490
<v Speaker 3>hydrogenated,</v>

2397
01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been processed with,</v>

2398
01:40:56.501 --> 01:40:57.334
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of nasty processing agents like a </v>

2399
01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:00.643
<v Speaker 1>nickel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2400
01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:02.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been,</v>

2401
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:06.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've undergone enough alteration that</v>

2402
01:41:06.041 --> 01:41:06.874
<v Speaker 1>maybe they contain some transfats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transfats are known to be </v>

2403
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:10.900
<v Speaker 1>proinflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2404
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:12.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Omega six,</v>

2405
01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:15.520
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omega six in and of themselves are not,</v>

2406
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:17.590
<v Speaker 1>they're not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

2407
01:41:17.591 --> 01:41:19.690
<v Speaker 1>there's Omega three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's or make a six or nine to seven.</v>

2408
01:41:19.691 --> 01:41:20.411
<v Speaker 1>There's 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these,</v>

2409
01:41:20.411 --> 01:41:21.244
<v Speaker 1>but the three to six ratio is the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gotten the most pressable s </v>

2410
01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.400
<v Speaker 1>decade omega three fatty acids that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>found in,</v>

2411
01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:27.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2412
01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

2413
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:30.303
<v Speaker 1>krill oil or fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that that just supplement </v>

2414
01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:33.220
<v Speaker 1>with fish oil a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2415
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit,</v>

2416
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:37.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of capsules,</v>

2417
01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:38.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every other day.</v>

2418
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

2419

<v Speaker 1>Other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2420

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2421
01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and I manufactured them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2422
01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:44.320
<v Speaker 1>it's part of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2423
01:41:44.321 --> 01:41:45.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my line of products,</v>

2424
01:41:45.581 --> 01:41:48.550
<v Speaker 1>but because my diet is pretty much based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2425
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:49.703
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2426
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:53.390
<v Speaker 1>an otherwise healthy intake of Omega </v>
<v Speaker 1>threes and more importantly,</v>

2427
01:41:53.391 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 1>a reduction of Omega six.</v>

2428
01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:55.563
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the Omega threes are by </v>

2429
01:41:56.741 --> 01:41:57.574
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antiinflammatories they are and Omega </v>

2430
01:42:00.311 --> 01:42:02.950
<v Speaker 1>six are proinflammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's this ratio.</v>

2431
01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:04.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some requirement for Omega six </v>

2432
01:42:06.161 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 1>in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the ratio gets way thrown off,</v>

2433
01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 1>it tends to be a pro inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

2434
01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:11.014
<v Speaker 1>Where do Omega six has come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That those are the industrial seed oils </v>

2435
01:42:13.271 --> 01:42:14.104
<v Speaker 1>that we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a slight benefit to having </v>

2436
01:42:16.001 --> 01:42:17.460
<v Speaker 1>some industrial seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2437
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:17.711
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2438
01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:20.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a slight benefit to having omega</v>
<v Speaker 1>six from other sources.</v>

2439
01:42:20.171 --> 01:42:21.610
<v Speaker 1>So what are the other sources?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2440
01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:22.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2441
01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:24.500
<v Speaker 1>any most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2442
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:27.110
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll also have oh six.</v>

2443
01:42:27.170 --> 01:42:27.731
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2444
01:42:27.731 --> 01:42:28.541
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>

2445
01:42:28.541 --> 01:42:31.110
<v Speaker 1>They're in any kind of fatty food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2446
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.070
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have them.</v>

2447
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2448
01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:35.253
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the source of most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the Paleo movement get the </v>

2449
01:42:37.691 --> 01:42:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Omega six from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2450
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.050
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2451
01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:44.680
<v Speaker 1>it's about sort of the totality of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet,</v>

2452
01:42:44.681 --> 01:42:45.980
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2453
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:48.490
<v Speaker 1>and it's largely a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2454
01:42:48.491 --> 01:42:49.324
<v Speaker 1>of what you're not eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you eliminate from the Diet that </v>

2455
01:42:51.161 --> 01:42:52.690
<v Speaker 1>has the greatest effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what you're reading.</v>

2456
01:42:52.691 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 1>So when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2457
01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:54.611
<v Speaker 1>Paleo Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2458
01:42:54.611 --> 01:42:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I've had such great results on the Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet,</v>

2459
01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:59.230
<v Speaker 1>or I've had great results on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2460
01:42:59.231 --> 01:43:00.250
<v Speaker 1>in some Vegetarian Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2461
01:43:00.251 --> 01:43:01.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2462
01:43:01.121 --> 01:43:01.954
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not eating the same shit we're </v>

2463
01:43:03.071 --> 01:43:03.904
<v Speaker 1>not eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that you get your protein </v>

2464
01:43:05.741 --> 01:43:06.574
<v Speaker 1>from plant sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm maybe gonna suggest you could have </v>

2465
01:43:10.661 --> 01:43:12.670
<v Speaker 1>more protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that big a deal.</v>

2466
01:43:12.671 --> 01:43:13.504
<v Speaker 1>It's really about what you've eliminated</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that has the greatest impact on </v>

2467
01:43:16.541 --> 01:43:17.480
<v Speaker 1>your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2468
01:43:17.481 --> 01:43:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2469
01:43:18.090 --> 01:43:21.240
<v Speaker 2>have conversations like that often with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are Vegan.</v>

2470
01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.880
<v Speaker 2>When they start talking about all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things they eat,</v>

2471
01:43:23.881 --> 01:43:25.740
<v Speaker 2>how much better they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I tell them,</v>

2472
01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:28.110
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat all the same things you eat.</v>

2473
01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Like my diet is pretty vegan other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

2474
01:43:31.230 --> 01:43:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2475
01:43:32.251 --> 01:43:33.690
<v Speaker 2>most of what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this morning,</v>

2476
01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.730
<v Speaker 2>what I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink a Kale shake.</v>

2477
01:43:35.850 --> 01:43:38.820
<v Speaker 2>So I blend Kale with cucumbers and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it's gross,</v>

2478
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:43.560
<v Speaker 2>but it makes me feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blend Kale with cucumbers,</v>

2479
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:45.270
<v Speaker 2>garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2480
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:48.920
<v Speaker 2>celery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ginger and pear.</v>

2481
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I throw a pair in and a I that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

2482
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:52.993
<v Speaker 3>and a half a beat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I blend that all up and I had an elk </v>

2483
01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:58.850
<v Speaker 3>stake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the two things together,</v>

2484
01:43:58.900 --> 01:43:59.990
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I eat.</v>

2485
01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:01.520
<v Speaker 3>That's my lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2486
01:44:01.521 --> 01:44:03.050
<v Speaker 3>that's what I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't eat breakfast.</v>

2487
01:44:03.051 --> 01:44:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I just ate lunch today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how does it,</v>

2488
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:06.350
<v Speaker 3>how does the Kale shake tastes like </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2489
01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't as good.</v>

2490
01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:08.413
<v Speaker 3>One of my rules is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my rules is I don't put anything </v>

2491
01:44:11.781 --> 01:44:12.614
<v Speaker 3>in my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't taste awesome and it feels </v>

2492
01:44:13.491 --> 01:44:14.810
<v Speaker 3>good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

2493
01:44:14.811 --> 01:44:15.644
<v Speaker 3>I eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get this burst of nutrients I'm going </v>

2494
01:44:17.741 --> 01:44:18.830
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to keep doing it.</v>

2495
01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:19.693
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not going to terrible with a </v>

2496
01:44:20.901 --> 01:44:22.220
<v Speaker 3>full pair in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2497
01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause the full pair,</v>

2498
01:44:23.511 --> 01:44:25.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean so big Bartlett,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pear,</v>

2499
01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.830
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

2500
01:44:27.831 --> 01:44:29.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very sweet.</v>

2501
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is that too much sugar?</v>

2502
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:32.660
<v Speaker 3>That one pair?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2503
01:44:32.661 --> 01:44:33.494
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your sugar load is over the course </v>

2504
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:35.690
<v Speaker 3>of a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's,</v>

2505
01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:39.110
<v Speaker 3>if that's the only sugar you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pairs are pretty high and you know,</v>

2506
01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:41.100
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty high in sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2507
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:42.303
<v Speaker 3>if the whole pair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I eat a pear before yoga </v>

2508
01:44:45.111 --> 01:44:46.790
<v Speaker 3>class too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was,</v>

2509
01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:50.550
<v Speaker 3>that that gets me through a yoga class </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I got pairs.</v>

2510
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Your favorite fruit or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>pears.</v>

2511
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that okay for you?</v>

2512
01:44:52.941 --> 01:44:54.530
<v Speaker 3>It's totally good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just get the first,</v>

2513
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:57.080
<v Speaker 3>first guy I've known it's favorite fruit</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a payer.</v>

2514
01:44:57.110 --> 01:44:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I like a pair,</v>

2515
01:44:58.581 --> 01:44:59.480
<v Speaker 3>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2516
01:44:59.481 --> 01:45:02.180
<v Speaker 3>I like mangoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mangoes are my also favorite.</v>

2517
01:45:02.181 --> 01:45:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Those are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2518
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd take sliced so I'll do that.</v>

2519
01:45:05.001 --> 01:45:06.760
<v Speaker 3>What would we be better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pears and mangoes,</v>

2520
01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:08.300
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No difference.</v>

2521
01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:09.134
<v Speaker 3>Difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

2522
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:12.020
<v Speaker 3>But fruit is what I usually choose </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I work out.</v>

2523
01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:12.853
<v Speaker 3>But now I'm thinking that maybe fruit is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little too high in sugar listening to </v>

2524
01:45:16.491 --> 01:45:19.070
<v Speaker 3>you or I should limit the amount of it I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have in a day.</v>

2525
01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:20.421
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2526
01:45:20.421 --> 01:45:21.254
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like where you're at and </v>

2527
01:45:22.251 --> 01:45:24.800
<v Speaker 3>everything's good and life is wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you enjoy it,</v>

2528
01:45:24.801 --> 01:45:26.150
<v Speaker 3>then I'm not going to tell you to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

2529
01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:27.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all about optimize them.</v>

2530
01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:28.613
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2531
01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:31.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can chug down those Kale shakes,</v>

2532
01:45:31.461 --> 01:45:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously willing to eat some </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible shit to feel better.</v>

2533
01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>

2534
01:45:35.421 --> 01:45:36.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not that horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2535
01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I kind of exaggerate a little bit how my</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance for gross food is pretty high.</v>

2536
01:45:41.061 --> 01:45:41.894
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

2537
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.883
<v Speaker 3>I can eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry eat any of that shit on fear </v>

2538
01:45:45.351 --> 01:45:45.861
<v Speaker 3>factor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2539
01:45:45.861 --> 01:45:47.120
<v Speaker 3>I hit a bunch of good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2540
01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I balls,</v>

2541
01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.360
<v Speaker 3>sheeps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyeballs.</v>

2542
01:45:50.361 --> 01:45:51.590
<v Speaker 3>I super worms.</v>

2543
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:52.341
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those worms,</v>

2544
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:55.080
<v Speaker 3>they use a on cadavers cleanup bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2545
01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.970
<v Speaker 3>I ate a tomato hornworms it was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>gross.</v>

2546
01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I ate a Madagascar hissing cockroaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the one that was at,</v>

2547
01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:04.160
<v Speaker 3>that's the one I think it would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawn the line in.</v>

2548
01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:06.540
<v Speaker 3>That one was the easiest to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2549
01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all psychological but that's chewy.</v>

2550
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:12.470
<v Speaker 3>But it's very mild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it has almost no flavor.</v>

2551
01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:15.500
<v Speaker 3>It was all just in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was no big deal at all.</v>

2552
01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.140
<v Speaker 3>The really hard things to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

2553
01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:18.974
<v Speaker 3>The smells were probably the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 3>part and a big factor in the smell was </v>

2554
01:46:25.401 --> 01:46:26.234
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would add this really expensive </v>

2555
01:46:28.371 --> 01:46:31.640
<v Speaker 3>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would go to this beverly hills.</v>

2556
01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:33.390
<v Speaker 3>What is up for module?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2557
01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:36.860
<v Speaker 3>One of those fucking places called where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sell the cheese for Masuri.</v>

2558
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:38.083
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a very expensive type of French </v>

2559
01:46:40.911 --> 01:46:45.230
<v Speaker 3>cheese that just smells like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>death because cheese,</v>

2560
01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:50.250
<v Speaker 3>a big part of what makes a cheese </v>
<v Speaker 3>fragrant or interesting is the culture,</v>

2561
01:46:50.251 --> 01:46:51.870
<v Speaker 3>which is actually bacteria.</v>

2562
01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:52.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we would buy this bacteria laden </v>

2563
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:56.003
<v Speaker 3>cheese that smelled so fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would take it and they would open </v>

2564
01:46:59.371 --> 01:47:00.204
<v Speaker 3>the little cup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little plastic tub in front of me </v>

2565
01:47:02.431 --> 01:47:04.380
<v Speaker 3>and sticking from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

2566
01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.341
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2567
01:47:05.341 --> 01:47:07.890
<v Speaker 3>that shit is expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really expensive.</v>

2568
01:47:07.891 --> 01:47:08.724
<v Speaker 3>And we would throw that into like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>blender full of maggots and that's what </v>

2569
01:47:13.051 --> 01:47:15.240
<v Speaker 3>would make it disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The maggots on the,</v>

2570
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.150
<v Speaker 3>on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really didn't have that much of a</v>

2571
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:19.380
<v Speaker 3>smell or taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2572
01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:21.810
<v Speaker 3>It's more psychological than it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2573
01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of stuff on fear factor.</v>

2574
01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:27.480
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just the sheer volume.</v>

2575
01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Like they would have to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2576
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:33.450
<v Speaker 3>a gigantic blender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>phil with his horrible shit.</v>

2577
01:47:33.451 --> 01:47:36.570
<v Speaker 3>And there's the amount of mass that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're putting in your body and you have</v>

2578
01:47:36.571 --> 01:47:39.750
<v Speaker 3>like three minutes to do it or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>and keep it down and keep it down.</v>

2579
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2580
01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:41.393
<v Speaker 3>I think we gave them like they had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep it down for like 30 seconds or </v>

2581
01:47:43.681 --> 01:47:44.514
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that at the end of that 30 seconds </v>

2582
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.540
<v Speaker 3>they would sprint towards everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurl.</v>

2583
01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw more people.</v>

2584
01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I probably seen more people throw up </v>
<v Speaker 3>then like a very small percentage of the</v>

2585
01:47:57.061 --> 01:47:59.520
<v Speaker 3>population than most ers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2586
01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:00.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe ers would have me like </v>

2587
01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:04.470
<v Speaker 3>nightclub bouncers might have me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2588
01:48:04.471 --> 01:48:06.870
<v Speaker 3>if you put in 20 years as a nightclub </v>
<v Speaker 3>bouncer,</v>

2589
01:48:06.871 --> 01:48:09.750
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably see more people puke than</v>
<v Speaker 3>me because you're seeing it every night.</v>

2590
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was only one day a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2591
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:15.540
<v Speaker 3>But one day a week I'd watch it at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>two people just fucking hurl.</v>

2592
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Just raw projectile vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2593
01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:20.420
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2594
01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:22.590
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more psychological than anything,</v>

2595
01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:23.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2596
01:48:23.671 --> 01:48:25.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual taste of those things,</v>

2597
01:48:25.351 --> 01:48:26.880
<v Speaker 3>especially the roach was nothing.</v>

2598
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:28.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like really no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was,</v>

2599
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:29.663
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was starving somewhere and I found </v>

2600
01:48:31.681 --> 01:48:35.040
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big batch of a hissing cockroaches,</v>

2601
01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:35.874
<v Speaker 3>those Madagascar ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely scoop those up and </v>

2602
01:48:37.501 --> 01:48:38.460
<v Speaker 3>eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2603
01:48:38.461 --> 01:48:39.294
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2604
01:48:39.710 --> 01:48:40.543
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2605
01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:41.493
<v Speaker 3>a bar company called Xo that makes their</v>
<v Speaker 3>bars out of cricket protein and I'm an </v>

2606
01:48:45.541 --> 01:48:48.870
<v Speaker 3>investor in their company there and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by the concept that,</v>

2607
01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:50.213
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2608
01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.233
<v Speaker 3>billion and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2 billion people around the world eat </v>

2609
01:48:52.501 --> 01:48:54.240
<v Speaker 3>insects all the time and think nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

2610
01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's what a lobster is.</v>

2611
01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:57.953
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that we found out when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did fear factor was if you have an </v>

2612
01:48:59.941 --> 01:49:02.850
<v Speaker 3>allergy to shellfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also have an allergy to roaches.</v>

2613
01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:08.090
<v Speaker 3>We found that out the hard way because a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who listed shellfish as an allergy,</v>

2614
01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:09.023
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a roach and got really sick and we had </v>

2615
01:49:10.081 --> 01:49:12.180
<v Speaker 3>to take him to the Er,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got to give him an adrenaline shot,</v>

2616
01:49:12.450 --> 01:49:13.283
<v Speaker 3>the whole deal.</v>

2617
01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:16.830
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the enzymes apparently are very similar,</v>

2618
01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.053
<v Speaker 3>but you can eat those bugs and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the very high in protein and very good </v>

2619
01:49:21.571 --> 01:49:24.300
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they can also be an excellent source</v>

2620
01:49:24.301 --> 01:49:28.260
<v Speaker 3>of protein for a inexpensive source of </v>
<v Speaker 3>protein.</v>

2621
01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:31.800
<v Speaker 3>For a lot of people it's the cricket </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is very sustainable.</v>

2622
01:49:31.801 --> 01:49:35.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like 20 times less resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fewer resources to,</v>

2623
01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.730
<v Speaker 3>to an equivalent amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2624
01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.830
<v Speaker 3>of steak and also equivalent amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>amino acids.</v>

2625
01:49:40.831 --> 01:49:42.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like a very good profile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2626
01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:43.733
<v Speaker 3>that's really fascinating to me that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could get like really high quality </v>

2627
01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:47.154
<v Speaker 3>protein from,</v>

2628
01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:50.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2629
01:49:50.081 --> 01:49:52.300
<v Speaker 1>we're prejudice against bugs I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2630
01:49:52.301 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying not to be anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you eat your bars?</v>

2631
01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get all the time.</v>

2632
01:49:56.861 --> 01:49:58.540
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

2633
01:49:58.541 --> 01:50:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Just because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't use those kinds of snacks.</v>

2634
01:50:02.141 --> 01:50:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I make my own bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they,</v>

2635
01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.210
<v Speaker 1>the guys who started expo are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto something and they're trying to,</v>

2636
01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.750
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to change the way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world thinks about sourcing protein.</v>

2637
01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:12.093
<v Speaker 1>So the first hurdle you have to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>is making a bar tastes great and not </v>

2638
01:50:15.791 --> 01:50:19.630
<v Speaker 1>turn people off because it's cricket </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's crickets and you know,</v>

2639
01:50:19.631 --> 01:50:21.940
<v Speaker 1>there's not like heads and antenna </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticking out of these bars.</v>

2640
01:50:21.941 --> 01:50:22.774
<v Speaker 1>It's a powder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been ground down to a fine powder </v>

2641
01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:25.203
<v Speaker 1>and it basically looks and probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>taste the same as whey protein isolate </v>

2642
01:50:28.271 --> 01:50:30.370
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it's ground down,</v>

2643
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:31.180
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2644
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:32.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you lose any of it when you're </v>

2645
01:50:33.341 --> 01:50:36.070
<v Speaker 1>dehydrating in or grinding it down or </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn away?</v>

2646
01:50:36.690 --> 01:50:37.420
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2647
01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.253
<v Speaker 1>it retains its properties pretty nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no benefit whatsoever to </v>

2648
01:50:41.351 --> 01:50:43.120
<v Speaker 1>eating it fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2649
01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:44.381
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2650
01:50:44.381 --> 01:50:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can compact more into,</v>

2651
01:50:46.031 --> 01:50:47.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the beauty of,</v>

2652
01:50:47.531 --> 01:50:52.180
<v Speaker 1>of I think insect protein powder is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to fortify foods,</v>

2653
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:53.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2654
01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:54.780
<v Speaker 1>that otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2655
01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:58.690
<v Speaker 1>rather than having 40 crickets on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick,</v>

2656
01:50:58.720 --> 01:50:59.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2657
01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:02.590
<v Speaker 1>to have the powder equivalent in a bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>is kind of a neat way of doing it.</v>

2658
01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten crickets like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like roasted crickets.</v>

2659
01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't taste bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad.</v>

2660
01:51:07.390 --> 01:51:08.450
<v Speaker 1>It's all in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2661
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:09.820
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all in your mind.</v>

2662
01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:10.371
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2663
01:51:10.371 --> 01:51:11.204
<v Speaker 1>you chew them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're crunchy and they're broasted </v>

2664
01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:14.320
<v Speaker 1>over a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually not bad at all.</v>

2665
01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:15.513
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sold as delicacy in the streets </v>

2666
01:51:16.841 --> 01:51:17.621
<v Speaker 1>of sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2667
01:51:17.621 --> 01:51:19.060
<v Speaker 1>in Bangkok and most of Asia.</v>

2668
01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:19.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you put some spices on </v>

2669
01:51:20.681 --> 01:51:21.514
<v Speaker 1>them or some point that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be quite tasting like maybe </v>

2670
01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.930
<v Speaker 1>some butter or some oil and some spices </v>
<v Speaker 1>on them.</v>

2671
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:27.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have these ideas about different </v>

2672
01:51:28.961 --> 01:51:30.570
<v Speaker 1>things that are good to eat and not good</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>

2673
01:51:30.571 --> 01:51:34.660
<v Speaker 1>And since more based on custom than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and a lot of ways,</v>

2674
01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:35.893
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many people that are vegan </v>

2675
01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:39.310
<v Speaker 1>would be willing to eat bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2676
01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Vegan as far as I know it goes against </v>
<v Speaker 1>their religion,</v>

2677
01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:44.620
<v Speaker 1>which I don't even want to use honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2678
01:51:44.621 --> 01:51:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

2679
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:47.223
<v Speaker 1>That's funny you say that because we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a bar that we just introduced with </v>

2680
01:51:50.291 --> 01:51:53.470
<v Speaker 1>grass fed whey protein isolate and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2681
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got collagen in it.</v>

2682
01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:57.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a great bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2683
01:51:57.670 --> 01:52:02.670
<v Speaker 1>and we tried to bake one for the Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 1>community and because it has honey in it</v>

2684
01:52:02.831 --> 01:52:04.930
<v Speaker 1>is as a suite near the Vegan said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we can't,</v>

2685
01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:07.480
<v Speaker 1>we can't eat cause it has honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bs,</v>

2686
01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's there's are slaves,</v>

2687
01:52:09.701 --> 01:52:11.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2688
01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2689
01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2690
01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:17.620
<v Speaker 1>you want to go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2691
01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:18.563
<v Speaker 1>Honeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2692
01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:19.983
<v Speaker 1>It fucks.</v>

2693
01:52:21.850 --> 01:52:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Is there any like nutritional benefit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a Vegan or is it an deficits,</v>

2694
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:27.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's involved in it.</v>

2695
01:52:28.270 --> 01:52:29.103
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably some foods that </v>

2696
01:52:31.181 --> 01:52:33.880
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting that would provide a </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro nutrients,</v>

2697
01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:37.660
<v Speaker 1>the micro nutrition that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to you in the long run.</v>

2698
01:52:37.661 --> 01:52:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet the human body is so frigging,</v>

2699
01:52:41.410 --> 01:52:42.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptable to,</v>

2700
01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:45.290
<v Speaker 1>to any sort of dietary strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2701
01:52:45.710 --> 01:52:46.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

2702
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:48.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight foot tall,</v>

2703
01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africans,</v>

2704
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:50.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the go play in the NBA that grew up on </v>

2705
01:52:52.911 --> 01:52:53.510
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2706
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:56.580
<v Speaker 1>500 calories a day and cow patties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2707
01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Irish potato famine,</v>

2708
01:52:58.401 --> 01:53:01.640
<v Speaker 1>people live for six weeks on shoe </v>
<v Speaker 1>leather and seaweed.</v>

2709
01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human body is pretty adaptable.</v>

2710
01:53:03.891 --> 01:53:06.640
<v Speaker 1>So you on that one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2711
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:07.633
<v Speaker 1>you can't describe the perfect diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're choosing to be Vegan and </v>

2712
01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:14.630
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want to do and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're mindful about it,</v>

2713
01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not militant about it and not</v>

2714
01:53:17.661 --> 01:53:19.550
<v Speaker 1>trying to convince everybody else that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they ought to do,</v>

2715
01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:20.990
<v Speaker 1>then then go for it.</v>

2716
01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't exist yet.</v>

2717
01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.860
<v Speaker 1>So few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2718
01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.390
<v Speaker 1>that was a requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Unicorn Fart.</v>

2719
01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:28.650
<v Speaker 1>A requirement of membership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2720
01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Um hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2721
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:32.990
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>

2722
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:36.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a few plants that do have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>

2723
01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:37.760
<v Speaker 1>complete amino acid profile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2724
01:53:37.761 --> 01:53:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Like keen Wa is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:53:39.951 --> 01:53:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's great plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2726
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:44.060
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say they have a full amino </v>
<v Speaker 1>acid profile.</v>

2727
01:53:44.061 --> 01:53:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's what's lacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2728
01:53:45.681 --> 01:53:47.240
<v Speaker 1>there's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's nothing lacking,</v>

2729
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:48.103
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the relative amounts that make the </v>

2730
01:53:49.701 --> 01:53:51.620
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a protein efficiency ratio,</v>

2731
01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:52.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2732
01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:53.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2733
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:54.343
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2734
01:53:55.190 --> 01:53:57.480
<v Speaker 1>the protein amino acid score that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2735
01:53:57.481 --> 01:53:59.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really determines whether a protein is,</v>

2736
01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:01.490
<v Speaker 1>is exceptional and that's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2737
01:54:01.491 --> 01:54:03.470
<v Speaker 1>meat and eggs and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2738
01:54:03.471 --> 01:54:04.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2739
01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.890
<v Speaker 1>that dairy and things that someone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to describe that to me,</v>

2740
01:54:06.891 --> 01:54:11.330
<v Speaker 1>the amount of Broccoli you would need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the same amount of protein and amino</v>

2741
01:54:11.331 --> 01:54:14.270
<v Speaker 1>acids as an eight ounce steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something insane.</v>

2742
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:16.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like two pounds of Broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2743
01:54:16.371 --> 01:54:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's insane.</v>

2744
01:54:17.691 --> 01:54:18.524
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ll those same people will argue that </v>

2745
01:54:20.841 --> 01:54:22.080
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2746
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:24.740
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that it's a on a,</v>

2747
01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:27.100
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's on a per pound basis.</v>

2748
01:54:27.101 --> 01:54:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it has the same amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of amino acids.</v>

2749
01:54:29.001 --> 01:54:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I forget where I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I heard that some,</v>

2750
01:54:30.741 --> 01:54:31.574
<v Speaker 1>some Vegan side of that to me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that broccoli does have some </v>

2751
01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:35.534
<v Speaker 1>amino acids in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to eat a big bowl of it </v>

2752
01:54:37.041 --> 01:54:38.420
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do anyway.</v>

2753
01:54:38.421 --> 01:54:39.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2754
01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to criticize that choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that um,</v>

2755
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:43.663
<v Speaker 1>if you're missing certain amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better balance it with something </v>

2756
01:54:45.891 --> 01:54:48.830
<v Speaker 1>coming from lagoons or some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>source.</v>

2757
01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:49.813
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what amino acids </v>
<v Speaker 1>are lacking based on what plant protein </v>

2758
01:54:52.711 --> 01:54:53.544
<v Speaker 1>in the human diet was always based on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide variety of things that you were </v>

2759
01:54:55.791 --> 01:54:57.050
<v Speaker 1>taking it and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2760
01:54:57.051 --> 01:54:58.760
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just one kind of thing,</v>

2761
01:54:58.761 --> 01:55:01.130
<v Speaker 1>but something off of this Shrub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off of this Bush,</v>

2762
01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:05.300
<v Speaker 1>out of this ground and the tuber here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some quail eggs here.</v>

2763
01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:05.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2764
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:09.420
<v Speaker 1>it was always a 200 different choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2765
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:10.363
<v Speaker 1>within a five mile radius or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just get whatever you get your </v>

2766
01:55:12.921 --> 01:55:14.570
<v Speaker 1>hands on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the insects came in.</v>

2767
01:55:14.571 --> 01:55:15.800
<v Speaker 1>That's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2768
01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.010
<v Speaker 1>we don't talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2769
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.863
<v Speaker 1>amphibians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine living on frogs and snakes </v>

2770
01:55:20.131 --> 01:55:21.740
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eggs and,</v>

2771
01:55:21.741 --> 01:55:22.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2772
01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:24.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in wheat grass and just,</v>

2773
01:55:24.710 --> 01:55:25.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2774
01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:28.640
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty amazing the variety of foods</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can eat.</v>

2775
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:31.220
<v Speaker 1>So typically you start your morning off </v>
<v Speaker 1>with butter,</v>

2776
01:55:31.221 --> 01:55:32.054
<v Speaker 1>coffee with mct oils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't just eat a regular coffee </v>

2777
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's regular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

2778
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2779
01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a buttered coffee every once </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a while,</v>

2780
01:55:40.011 --> 01:55:43.110
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I need the calories to</v>

2781
01:55:43.111 --> 01:55:45.150
<v Speaker 1>get my day going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want the cup of coffee.</v>

2782
01:55:45.151 --> 01:55:46.620
<v Speaker 1>You just want the caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want the caffeine.</v>

2783
01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.770
<v Speaker 1>And I actually don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2784
01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to interfere with burning </v>
<v Speaker 1>off my own body fat.</v>

2785
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2786
01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.440
<v Speaker 1>not that it interferes with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's 500 calories that,</v>

2787
01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:56.593
<v Speaker 1>that or 250 calories coming out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee that otherwise just coming off </v>

2788
01:55:59.791 --> 01:56:00.840
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2789
01:56:00.841 --> 01:56:02.700
<v Speaker 1>my gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2790
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:04.223
<v Speaker 1>So when you wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all dependent upon how hungry you </v>

2791
01:56:07.801 --> 01:56:08.790
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2792
01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:09.953
<v Speaker 1>So if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe then you'll have some butter </v>

2793
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:13.410
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not hungry,</v>

2794
01:56:13.411 --> 01:56:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it was her regular coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>

2795
01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:16.920
<v Speaker 1>a nod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of cream,</v>

2796
01:56:16.921 --> 01:56:20.340
<v Speaker 1>but just enough to color it and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2797
01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:22.350
<v Speaker 1>your first meal of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably lunch.</v>

2798
01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:23.091
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did,</v>

2799
01:56:23.091 --> 01:56:24.380
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2800
01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:27.000
<v Speaker 1>usually a salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a big ass salad,</v>

2801
01:56:27.001 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2802
01:56:28.110 --> 01:56:28.943
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's lots of Greens and some form of </v>

2803
01:56:31.711 --> 01:56:32.544
<v Speaker 1>protein might be salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be chicken from last night's </v>

2804
01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:37.140
<v Speaker 1>dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a tuna.</v>

2805
01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what size?</v>

2806
01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Like an eight ounce portion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a bitch.</v>

2807
01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:42.053
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2808
01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not much protein.</v>

2809
01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:44.393
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing that I've </v>

2810
01:56:44.911 --> 01:56:47.940
<v Speaker 1>realized over the years is that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>need that much protein.</v>

2811
01:56:47.970 --> 01:56:50.460
<v Speaker 1>And even if you're doing work in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym,</v>

2812
01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:51.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need 200 grams of protein a </v>

2813
01:56:52.681 --> 01:56:53.410
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

2814
01:56:53.410 --> 01:56:55.350
<v Speaker 1>You just can't process that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that from?</v>

2815
01:56:55.351 --> 01:56:56.184
<v Speaker 1>That's from a bodybuilding power lifting</v>
<v Speaker 1>my town that's from the muscle and </v>

2816
01:56:59.491 --> 01:57:00.324
<v Speaker 1>fitness days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's from Dave draper and his </v>

01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:48.090
<v Speaker 1>super human levels of steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can process all kinds of protein.</v>

2838
01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Look at them today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today,</v>

2839
01:57:49.921 --> 01:57:52.770

<v Speaker 1>Maybe does a little steroids too when we</v>

2844
01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:06.990
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think could be huh?</v>

2845
01:58:08.190 --> 01:58:10.590
<v Speaker 1>But a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people using needing protein,</v>

2846
01:58:10.591 --> 01:58:11.011
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2847
01:58:11.011 --> 01:58:15.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe women probably need 50 to 75,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 80 grams a day.</v>

2848
01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even guys,</v>

2849
01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:18.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training fairly hard,</v>

2850
01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:21.390
<v Speaker 1>don't no more than 113 hundred 40 grams </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>

2851
01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:22.313
<v Speaker 1>Now what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the muscle and fitness mentality </v>

2852
01:58:25.471 --> 01:58:26.304
<v Speaker 1>or the powerlifting mentality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a certain amount of </v>

2853
01:58:28.591 --> 01:58:31.030
<v Speaker 1>grams per pound of body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Describe.</v>

2854
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2855
01:58:32.250 --> 01:58:33.083
<v Speaker 1>that's all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it might've been one gram per pound </v>

2856
01:58:34.921 --> 01:58:37.680
<v Speaker 1>of body weight at 1.5 grams per pound of</v>
<v Speaker 1>body weight.</v>

2857
01:58:37.681 --> 01:58:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 200 grams a day for me or,</v>

2858
01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:40.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2859
01:58:40.621 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 200 pounds.</v>

2860
01:58:42.850 --> 01:58:45.130
<v Speaker 3>200 grams of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a shitload of broke.</v>

2861
01:58:45.131 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 3>How much is a steak?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a 12 ounce steak?</v>

2862
01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:49.990
<v Speaker 3>50 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Jesus Christ.</v>

2863
01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:50.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'd have to four fucking stakes in a </v>

2864
01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:52.781
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2865
01:58:52.781 --> 01:58:55.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean by the time you cook that down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2866
01:58:55.230 --> 01:58:56.080
<v Speaker 3>It might be less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2867
01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:58.210
<v Speaker 3>What about eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much is it an egg?</v>

2868
01:58:58.211 --> 01:58:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Seven or eight per ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2869
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:02.110
<v Speaker 3>That's why these guys would do a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>dozen eggs in there,</v>

2870
01:59:02.111 --> 01:59:03.770
<v Speaker 3>shake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2871
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be 70 or 80,</v>

2872
01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:10.060
<v Speaker 3>or 80 or 90 or whatever grams of protein</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus some powder in there.</v>

2873
01:59:10.061 --> 01:59:10.990
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2874
01:59:10.991 --> 01:59:11.824
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we learned a long time ago was a </v>

2875
01:59:12.581 --> 01:59:15.970
<v Speaker 3>body really can't handle more than 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>35 grams of protein at a sitting.</v>

2876
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:19.020
<v Speaker 3>So the rest of it turns into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2877
01:59:19.150 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the farts.</v>

2878
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:21.483
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2879
01:59:23.110 --> 01:59:25.060
<v Speaker 3>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're eating,</v>

2880
01:59:25.061 --> 01:59:25.894
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever been around people who </v>

2881
01:59:26.921 --> 01:59:29.770
<v Speaker 3>drink a lot of protein shakes and eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>protein bars,</v>

2882
01:59:29.771 --> 01:59:33.280
<v Speaker 3>they're farts are brutal like </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilder type dudes.</v>

2883
01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:34.990
<v Speaker 3>And that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

2884
01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:36.460
<v Speaker 3>there's too much protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2885
01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Among other things.</v>

2886
01:59:37.571 --> 01:59:38.404
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2887
01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:39.750
<v Speaker 3>A lot of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2888
01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.690
<v Speaker 3>they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2889
01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.840
<v Speaker 3>who knows what's going on with their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their gut bacteria too.</v>

2890
01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:46.270
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of protein to put in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're probably,</v>

2891
01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:47.133
<v Speaker 3>if they're eating that much protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not eating much of the way of </v>

2892
01:59:48.911 --> 01:59:51.550
<v Speaker 3>vegetables and those muscle milk type </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements,</v>

2893
01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:52.384
<v Speaker 3>although there are delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of sugar in those damn </v>

2894
01:59:54.341 --> 01:59:55.031
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2895
01:59:55.031 --> 01:59:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those bars,</v>

2896
01:59:56.351 --> 01:59:58.240
<v Speaker 3>a lot of bars have a lot of sugar in </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2897
01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:59.970
<v Speaker 3>This is a giant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2898
02:00:01.110 --> 02:00:01.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2899
02:00:02.410 --> 02:00:03.450
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2900
02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:04.393
<v Speaker 3>you think that these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these bodybuilder guys are power </v>

2901
02:00:06.281 --> 02:00:07.114
<v Speaker 3>powerlifter guys that are operating on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that inefficient method of one gram per </v>

2902
02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:13.420
<v Speaker 3>pound.</v>

2903
02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:16.420
<v Speaker 3>If they had reduced it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would still have the same amount of</v>

2904
02:00:16.421 --> 02:00:19.120
<v Speaker 3>gains and maybe their body would operate</v>
<v Speaker 3>more efficiently.</v>

2905
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Are we talking on juice or off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>juice?</v>

2906
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:22.301
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2907
02:00:22.301 --> 02:00:23.350
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

2908
02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So back to your on steroids.</v>

2909
02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Back to your point about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2910
02:00:28.330 --> 02:00:29.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hard gainer and you know,</v>

2911
02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:31.390
<v Speaker 3>putting on muscle is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2912
02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:32.760
<v Speaker 3>is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2913
02:00:33.370 --> 02:00:35.080
<v Speaker 3>most people are overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to hear this,</v>

2914
02:00:35.081 --> 02:00:38.470
<v Speaker 3>but putting on muscle is much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult than losing body fat.</v>

2915
02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take a 165 pound guy and you say,</v>

2916
02:00:43.331 --> 02:00:44.290
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

2917
02:00:44.291 --> 02:00:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I want to put on 20 pounds of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ain't going to happen.</v>

2918
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:48.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might put on 10 pounds of muscle,</v>

2919
02:00:48.911 --> 02:00:52.570
<v Speaker 3>might put on seven over a very focused </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time.</v>

2920
02:00:52.571 --> 02:00:55.660
<v Speaker 3>It might have to work hard to keep it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the body also going.</v>

2921
02:00:55.930 --> 02:00:56.763
<v Speaker 3>If you don't create on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my requirement to continue to maintain </v>

2922
02:01:00.761 --> 02:01:01.594
<v Speaker 3>this muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back down to where it was </v>

2923
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.863
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that there's a number of </v>

2924
02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:08.793
<v Speaker 3>days or years or whatever it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain that body mass where it starts </v>

2925
02:01:11.261 --> 02:01:13.240
<v Speaker 3>to become normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then your body says,</v>

2926
02:01:13.241 --> 02:01:14.680
<v Speaker 3>well this is what we way now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2927
02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:16.000
<v Speaker 3>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you maintain it,</v>

2928
02:01:16.001 --> 02:01:16.834
<v Speaker 3>but there's this touch and go period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say if you weigh one 65 and you put on </v>

2929
02:01:19.451 --> 02:01:20.284
<v Speaker 3>that 10 pounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you got to keep pushing for a long </v>

2930
02:01:22.301 --> 02:01:23.590
<v Speaker 3>time for your body to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2931
02:01:23.591 --> 02:01:25.690
<v Speaker 3>this is what we way we need all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

2932
02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:26.553
<v Speaker 3>We needed all this horsepower and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were going to be able to carry a lot of </v>

2933
02:01:28.691 --> 02:01:29.920
<v Speaker 3>heavy shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

2934
02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:32.290
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2935
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Bring your own honey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's going on with no,</v>

2936
02:01:34.450 --> 02:01:34.820
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2937
02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This guy's serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This brings his own hunting.</v>

2940
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:43.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2941
02:01:43.071 --> 02:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but honey is good for you,</v>

2942
02:01:44.421 --> 02:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>isn't it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raw honey.</v>

2943
02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

2944
02:01:46.670 --> 02:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you?</v>

2945
02:01:48.930 --> 02:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you.</v>

2946
02:01:50.511 --> 02:01:51.344
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know any that's one of those </v>

2947
02:01:53.211 --> 02:01:54.044
<v Speaker 1>moderation foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to use it to like in this </v>

2948
02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>case I put a couple of drops in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the tea,</v>

2949
02:01:57.860 --> 02:01:59.780
<v Speaker 1>but I always hear it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like raw honey.</v>

2950
02:01:59.810 --> 02:02:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you hear it from?</v>

2951
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Not The vegans money that people make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey.</v>

2952
02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2953
02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I've always heard is</v>

2954
02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just all sugar.</v>

2955
02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:11.933
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you overdo it then it's probably </v>

2956
02:02:14.511 --> 02:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>not as wise a decision as to cut it </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2957
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:17.803
<v Speaker 1>So we got to your launch your launch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a big ass out with a small amount </v>

2958
02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>of protein.</v>

2959
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>So maybe like four ounces of protein or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>

2960
02:02:23.631 --> 02:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2961
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>What piece of chicken or a piece of fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

2962
02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2963
02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:29.510
<v Speaker 1>what about dinner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2964
02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a stake.</v>

2965
02:02:31.521 --> 02:02:34.280
<v Speaker 1>I got this Wagyu short rib that I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2966
02:02:34.281 --> 02:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Like that stuff is so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all fatty.</v>

2967
02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>

2968
02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>We like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point,</v>

2969
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:41.120
<v Speaker 1>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2970
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you liked fat.</v>

2971
02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:43.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2972
02:02:43.251 --> 02:02:44.084
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my diet is probably 55% of my calories </v>

2973
02:02:45.681 --> 02:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>come from fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Wagyu is a lot of corn fed animal.</v>

2974
02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:50.691
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

2975
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>so I make a little bit of an exception </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2976
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could get a grass fed when I,</v>

2977
02:02:56.170 --> 02:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

2978
02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:59.690
<v Speaker 1>when I look forward at a Pc Greens where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shop in Malibu,</v>

2979
02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at whole foods or whatever.</v>

2980
02:03:03.170 --> 02:03:04.520
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Wagyu,</v>

2981
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a delicious,</v>

2982
02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you like a nice tender juicy steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2983
02:03:10.130 --> 02:03:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Is there any benefit like what are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>health benefits of eating grass fed meat</v>

2984
02:03:13.761 --> 02:03:16.400
<v Speaker 1>and using grass fed cows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Butter?</v>

2985
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting because,</v>

2986
02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I,</v>

2987
02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:20.333
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of have to raise my eyebrows</v>
<v Speaker 1>add is I hear about grass fed whey </v>

2988
02:03:24.711 --> 02:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>protein isolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2989
02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.390
<v Speaker 1>So you have grass fed whey protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever they put in the drink.</v>

2990
02:03:29.391 --> 02:03:30.224
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you eat grass fed cows is </v>

2991
02:03:33.261 --> 02:03:37.190
<v Speaker 1>because the fatty acid profile is more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2992
02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:38.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2993
02:03:38.451 --> 02:03:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a more desirable fatty acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>profile.</v>

2994
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:41.623
<v Speaker 1>The protein compliment is the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a corn fed steak or a grass fed </v>

2995
02:03:46.161 --> 02:03:46.994
<v Speaker 1>steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't tell the difference in </v>

2996
02:03:47.391 --> 02:03:48.224
<v Speaker 1>the protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fatty acid profile that's </v>

2997
02:03:49.251 --> 02:03:50.084
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other difference might be the </v>

2998
02:03:51.681 --> 02:03:53.240
<v Speaker 1>residual hormones and antibiotics.</v>

2999
02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:57.290
<v Speaker 1>So when they raise corn fed beef and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they start from an early age,</v>

3000
02:03:58.310 --> 02:04:01.250
<v Speaker 1>that's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cows native diet.</v>

3001
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:04.220
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cow tends to get sick,</v>

3002
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:07.160
<v Speaker 1>get infected and so these antibiotics </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to use a in,</v>

3003
02:04:07.161 --> 02:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes he use growth hormone just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get them off the lot quicker.</v>

3004
02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3005
02:04:12.081 --> 02:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3006
02:04:13.190 --> 02:04:14.023
<v Speaker 1>the reason to have grass fed beef is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fatty acid profile is much more </v>

3007
02:04:17.961 --> 02:04:19.700
<v Speaker 1>desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3008
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:21.590
<v Speaker 1>and yet it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still fat.</v>

3009
02:04:21.591 --> 02:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a couple of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of stearic acid and,</v>

3010
02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>and different versions of the saturated </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat that you're talking about.</v>

3011
02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:32.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even like this life or death</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision that you make.</v>

3012
02:04:32.901 --> 02:04:37.901
<v Speaker 1>Like if I have a wonderful cut of corn </v>
<v Speaker 1>fed steak,</v>

3013
02:04:38.131 --> 02:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I have grass fed a live forever.</v>

3014
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>These are just choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

3015
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:43.133
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can find a great tasting grass </v>

3016
02:04:44.611 --> 02:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>fed steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by all means habit.</v>

3017
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>If you can have a great find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively inexpensive,</v>

3018
02:04:49.110 --> 02:04:51.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lined line caught wild salmon,</v>

3019
02:04:51.631 --> 02:04:54.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a probably a better choice for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your stated goals.</v>

3020
02:04:54.751 --> 02:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Then some farm raised salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3021
02:04:58.291 --> 02:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>the farm raised salmon is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's problematic because of their diet,</v>

3022
02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:02.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3023
02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>But so back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just back to the,</v>

3024
02:05:03.650 --> 02:05:04.483
<v Speaker 1>the grasp of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you get to grass fed whey </v>

3025
02:05:05.971 --> 02:05:06.804
<v Speaker 1>protein isolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whey protein isolate is 90 to 95% </v>

3026
02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:12.533
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3027
02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:15.270
<v Speaker 1>they took all the fat out of it so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

3028
02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:16.553
<v Speaker 1>They all the good fatty acid profile </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in it because it was grass fed </v>

3029
02:05:19.891 --> 02:05:20.724
<v Speaker 1>is now gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a marketing strategy to </v>

3030
02:05:23.131 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 1>call it grass fed whey protein isolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not bad,</v>

3031
02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's not any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3032
02:05:28.291 --> 02:05:29.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely not bad.</v>

3033
02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:30.783
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not demonstrably better to have </v>

3034
02:05:32.521 --> 02:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>grass fed whey protein isolate versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>just regular.</v>

3035
02:05:34.770 --> 02:05:37.620
<v Speaker 1>What about grass fed butter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grass fed butter?</v>

3036
02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3037
02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:39.930
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all fat.</v>

3038
02:05:40.170 --> 02:05:42.180
<v Speaker 1>So that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's an example of,</v>

3039
02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:43.133
<v Speaker 1>that's the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they took all the protein out of it </v>

3040
02:05:44.401 --> 02:05:48.210
<v Speaker 1>and now just giving you fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So grass fed butter is a great choice.</v>

3041
02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And what is the difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>profile?</v>

3042
02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:51.293
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fatty profile of a grass fed butter </v>

3043
02:05:53.101 --> 02:05:56.130
<v Speaker 1>versus same as it is with the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it w when is that difference?</v>

3044
02:05:56.150 --> 02:05:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

3045
02:05:57.420 --> 02:05:58.253
<v Speaker 1>I can't cite the research and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>cite to break down to the of the fatty </v>

3046
02:06:01.171 --> 02:06:02.004
<v Speaker 1>acids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that they're more appropriate </v>

3047
02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:05.093
<v Speaker 1>for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cow that was raised on its native </v>

3048
02:06:07.411 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop was the difference between the fact,</v>

3049
02:06:10.741 --> 02:06:13.890
<v Speaker 1>cause I've heard it but I can't cite it </v>
<v Speaker 1>when somebody wants to bring it up.</v>

3050
02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:17.220
<v Speaker 1>But I prefer the taste of a grass fed </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

3051
02:06:17.250 --> 02:06:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's a leaner,</v>

3052
02:06:18.690 --> 02:06:22.560
<v Speaker 1>like more dense meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like wild game.</v>

3053
02:06:22.561 --> 02:06:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then um,</v>

3054
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:27.630
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ribeye from a cow that's fed corn.</v>

3055
02:06:27.810 --> 02:06:28.643
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're saying that like health wise </v>

3056
02:06:30.001 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 1>had rib eyes pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>

3057
02:06:31.861 --> 02:06:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more of a fatty cut.</v>

3058
02:06:33.810 --> 02:06:34.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3059
02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.633
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying there's not that much </v>

3060
02:06:37.591 --> 02:06:39.930
<v Speaker 1>of a difference in terms of like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>health benefits.</v>

3061
02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.090
<v Speaker 1>If you can get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3062
02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>a humanely raised a cow that was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>given antibiotics or hormones,</v>

3063
02:06:48.170 --> 02:06:50.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty close to where you want to</v>

3064
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:51.354
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm suggesting that the fatty </v>

3065
02:06:52.441 --> 02:06:56.250
<v Speaker 1>acid profile isn't going to be hugely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

3066
02:06:56.670 --> 02:07:00.570
<v Speaker 1>isn't the issue with cows that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>give a cow grains,</v>

3067
02:07:00.571 --> 02:07:04.300
<v Speaker 1>their body isn't designed to process it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they develop a lot of infections and,</v>

3068
02:07:04.330 --> 02:07:06.090
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they use the antibiotics.</v>

3069
02:07:06.810 --> 02:07:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3070
02:07:07.801 --> 02:07:10.680
<v Speaker 1>just automatically problematic if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a grain fed cow?</v>

3071
02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times you'll have a cow that</v>

3072
02:07:13.051 --> 02:07:15.240
<v Speaker 1>was raised on grass and then finished </v>
<v Speaker 1>with grain.</v>

3073
02:07:15.610 --> 02:07:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's different types of grains.</v>

3074
02:07:18.241 --> 02:07:20.700
<v Speaker 1>So some it's not automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>

3075
02:07:21.150 --> 02:07:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3076
02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:26.040
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look for the cows that were,</v>

3077
02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:27.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastured up until a certain point and </v>

3078
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:29.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3079
02:07:29.461 --> 02:07:30.900
<v Speaker 1>they might've been grass finished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they'll,</v>

3080
02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:35.070
<v Speaker 1>they'll say grass fed and they won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't tell you it was grain.</v>

3081
02:07:35.710 --> 02:07:38.440
<v Speaker 1>And when they say green finished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time do they spend feeding them</v>

3082
02:07:38.441 --> 02:07:39.700
<v Speaker 1>grain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a couple of weeks.</v>

3083
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:40.773
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3084
02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:41.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just fatten up for the last </v>

3085
02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:43.893
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks before the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3086
02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:45.153
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't have enough time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a lot of the massive issues of </v>

3087
02:07:47.261 --> 02:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>they might have if they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3088
02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:51.700
<v Speaker 1>in Corinth the whole life in theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3089
02:07:51.701 --> 02:07:52.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

3090
02:07:52.541 --> 02:07:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you'll lead a little bit of steak and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>steam vegetables.</v>

3091
02:07:56.440 --> 02:08:01.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what I have my big plate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli or Broccolini or partial spouts</v>

3092
02:08:01.271 --> 02:08:02.370
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3093
02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:05.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about like drinks?</v>

3094
02:08:05.130 --> 02:08:09.880
<v Speaker 1>What do you drink mostly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I used to drink wine at meals.</v>

3095
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink a lot of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a soothing a throat today,</v>

3096
02:08:13.721 --> 02:08:15.280
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>

3097
02:08:15.281 --> 02:08:17.950
<v Speaker 1>but normally I wouldn't drink much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3098
02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:20.560
<v Speaker 1>much water during the course of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let my thirst mechanism,</v>

3099
02:08:21.010 --> 02:08:22.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of tell me what to do.</v>

3100
02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:24.730
<v Speaker 1>And I don't get thirsty that often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3101
02:08:24.731 --> 02:08:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I used to go on 50 mile bike rides and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not get thirsty,</v>

3102
02:08:26.861 --> 02:08:27.950
<v Speaker 1>so I've got a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3103
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that just weird?</v>

3104
02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Just you missed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know other people like that.</v>

3105
02:08:31.590 --> 02:08:34.390
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are of the belief that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should drink water all day,</v>

3106
02:08:34.391 --> 02:08:37.390
<v Speaker 1>so you have to pee all the time cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're flushing your body.</v>

3107
02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that at all.</v>

3108
02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:40.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unnecessary.</v>

3109
02:08:40.091 --> 02:08:40.960
<v Speaker 1>It's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3110
02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:41.853
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3111
02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't agree with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

3112
02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:45.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might want to do it once in a </v>

3113
02:08:46.121 --> 02:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>while just to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3114
02:08:47.650 --> 02:08:48.483
<v Speaker 1>do your own little cleanse or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think as a rule of thumb </v>

3115
02:08:50.771 --> 02:08:51.604
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's any particular health </v>

3116
02:08:52.451 --> 02:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>benefit to that put about the toxins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the toxins out.</v>

3117
02:08:57.250 --> 02:08:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pay clear.</v>

3118
02:08:58.391 --> 02:08:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I need to drink more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3119
02:08:59.710 --> 02:09:00.670
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>

3120
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

3121
02:09:02.410 --> 02:09:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3122
02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people who still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of,</v>

3123
02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the gym bring their gallon jug</v>

3124
02:09:08.831 --> 02:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>of distilled water in or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell it is really bad.</v>

3125
02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:13.031
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ros,</v>

3126
02:09:13.031 --> 02:09:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Ros water yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3127
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Because when you drink distilled water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no minerals in it.</v>

3128
02:09:17.890 --> 02:09:19.930
<v Speaker 1>It actually robs your body of minerals </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're like,</v>

3129
02:09:19.931 --> 02:09:20.890
<v Speaker 1>takes the minerals out.</v>

3130
02:09:20.890 --> 02:09:21.723
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:09:22.330 --> 02:09:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't drink unless your Thursday.</v>

3132
02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my rule of thumb and I,</v>

3133
02:09:26.410 --> 02:09:28.480
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do I drink with meals?</v>

3134
02:09:28.690 --> 02:09:29.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until recently I was drinking wine with </v>

3135
02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:33.940
<v Speaker 1>meals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come he stopped?</v>

3136
02:09:34.450 --> 02:09:35.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3137
02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I'd written a lot about wines over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and,</v>

3138
02:09:37.361 --> 02:09:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3139
02:09:38.231 --> 02:09:39.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the research shows that wine drinkers </v>

3140
02:09:40.331 --> 02:09:42.640
<v Speaker 1>live longer than teetotallers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resveratrol,</v>

3141
02:09:42.670 --> 02:09:43.600
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3142
02:09:43.601 --> 02:09:44.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good,</v>

3143
02:09:44.741 --> 02:09:49.120
<v Speaker 1>compelling evidence to drink wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet at the root of the matter,</v>

3144
02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:52.930
<v Speaker 1>wine is still a source of ethanol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethanol is toxic to the body.</v>

3145
02:09:52.931 --> 02:09:55.210
<v Speaker 1>So you're putting a toxin in your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you drink wine.</v>

3146
02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to look at that in my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>case and realized that I wasn't sleeping</v>

3147
02:09:59.621 --> 02:10:01.690
<v Speaker 1>as well as I want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sleep's a big thing for me.</v>

3148
02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3149
02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:07.770
<v Speaker 1>but I was a two glass a night wine </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinker for 30 years.</v>

3150
02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't dinner if I didn't have wine.</v>

3151
02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:11.973
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3152
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:13.383
<v Speaker 1>so I went on a 30 day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I do often when a 30 day </v>

3153
02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:17.050
<v Speaker 1>experiment of one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what happened,</v>

3154
02:10:17.210 --> 02:10:18.790
<v Speaker 1>it cut out the wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3155
02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:20.100
<v Speaker 1>felt great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3156
02:10:20.170 --> 02:10:22.720
<v Speaker 1>slept better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I was never really,</v>

3157
02:10:22.721 --> 02:10:24.190
<v Speaker 1>it never woke up hungover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3158
02:10:24.191 --> 02:10:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids have never seen me.</v>

3159
02:10:25.630 --> 02:10:27.760
<v Speaker 1>My kids are 22 and 25 they'd never seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>me drunk.</v>

3160
02:10:27.761 --> 02:10:30.220
<v Speaker 1>My wife has never seen me drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I was abusing anything,</v>

3161
02:10:30.221 --> 02:10:32.950
<v Speaker 1>but I had this regular pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking wine.</v>

3162
02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:36.740
<v Speaker 1>So I went off it and I realized that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was benefiting from it.</v>

3163
02:10:37.110 --> 02:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for last year and a half,</v>

3164
02:10:38.961 --> 02:10:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I really cut back on the one I still </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a glass or two.</v>

3165
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:43.490
<v Speaker 1>What was the benefit of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watched?</v>

3166
02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't wake up at three o'clock in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and then not be able to get back</v>

3167
02:10:46.971 --> 02:10:47.810
<v Speaker 1>to sleep for an hour.</v>

3168
02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:48.853
<v Speaker 1>That was the big thing that I noticed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for myself was I would fall asleep </v>

3169
02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:52.753
<v Speaker 1>really easily and then I would wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three in the morning and have a </v>

3170
02:10:55.971 --> 02:10:56.804
<v Speaker 1>tough time getting back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of subsided when I went </v>

3171
02:10:59.631 --> 02:11:01.040
<v Speaker 1>off the wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

3172
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:03.890
<v Speaker 1>that's that's the result of the effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of alcohol.</v>

3173
02:11:03.891 --> 02:11:04.724
<v Speaker 1>Your body processed to the alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alcohol is a depressant and knocks </v>

3174
02:11:07.221 --> 02:11:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body processes it,</v>

3175
02:11:09.051 --> 02:11:11.920
<v Speaker 1>and then once it's done processing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your sleep cycles disturbed.</v>

3176
02:11:11.921 --> 02:11:12.754
<v Speaker 1>So you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what happened in Chinese </v>

3177
02:11:13.611 --> 02:11:16.500
<v Speaker 1>medicine says that that's when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>liver is working at at three,</v>

3178
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:18.830
<v Speaker 1>three o'clock in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's when the real processing</v>

3179
02:11:18.831 --> 02:11:22.100
<v Speaker 1>was starting to take take place or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

3180
02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:25.640
<v Speaker 1>You know what item,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not huge adherent of Chinese medicine.</v>

3181
02:11:25.641 --> 02:11:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting that it's not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing to look at,</v>

3182
02:11:28.131 --> 02:11:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but in my case the sleep benefited </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously.</v>

3183
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:33.590
<v Speaker 1>So feel any better other than the sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3184
02:11:33.591 --> 02:11:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3185
02:11:34.521 --> 02:11:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I say,</v>

3186
02:11:35.581 --> 02:11:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I never woke up hung over and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>always felt refreshed waking up,</v>

3187
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't like not getting that sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3188
02:11:42.271 --> 02:11:44.270
<v Speaker 1>and having to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in my case,</v>

3189
02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:45.104
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at managing stress and I </v>

3190
02:11:47.811 --> 02:11:49.970
<v Speaker 1>have a fair amount of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just business stuff in my life.</v>

3191
02:11:49.971 --> 02:11:51.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3192
02:11:51.111 --> 02:11:51.944
<v Speaker 1>when you can't sleep at three o'clock in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning and that's when all the </v>

3193
02:11:53.331 --> 02:11:56.180
<v Speaker 1>business shit kind of starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulate in the brain,</v>

3194
02:11:56.630 --> 02:11:57.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how's this going to happen and how </v>

3195
02:11:58.011 --> 02:11:58.940
<v Speaker 1>are we going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3196
02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:02.330
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't like that part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3197
02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:06.660
<v Speaker 1>so year and a half went without drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine and I replaced it with,</v>

3198
02:12:07.190 --> 02:12:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a prodigious beer drinker </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I gave up the grains.</v>

3199
02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3200
02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:16.970
<v Speaker 1>and I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a couple of,</v>

3201
02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:20.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonalcoholic beers that I like.</v>

3202
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:21.201
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3203
02:12:21.201 --> 02:12:22.034
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was for me it was about the habit </v>

3204
02:12:23.451 --> 02:12:25.160
<v Speaker 1>that the ritual of dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I needed,</v>

3205
02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:26.630
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't just drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate,</v>

3206
02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I hate drinking water with dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to find something to replace</v>

3207
02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:31.633
<v Speaker 1>the ritual part of the wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found these nonalcoholic beers </v>

3208
02:12:34.130 --> 02:12:37.070
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had one with dinner at night,</v>

3209
02:12:37.071 --> 02:12:40.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe one and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These non grained made,</v>

3210
02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:40.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3211
02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:42.170
<v Speaker 1>they're made with grains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

3212
02:12:42.171 --> 02:12:43.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't affect me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3213
02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:45.860
<v Speaker 1>to an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3214
02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:49.910
<v Speaker 1>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've been doing for the last</v>

3215
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:51.170
<v Speaker 1>year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then recently,</v>

3216
02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:52.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across a guy who is looking at </v>

3217
02:12:54.081 --> 02:12:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Paleo wines and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

3218
02:12:56.850 --> 02:12:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it if you coined a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase,</v>

3219
02:12:58.971 --> 02:13:00.050
<v Speaker 1>this as a marketing ploy.</v>

3220
02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Now there's these wines are 300 wineries</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world among the tens of </v>

3221
02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:08.690
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3222
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:09.793
<v Speaker 1>that don't use additives or sulfites or </v>
<v Speaker 1>colorants or formaldehyde or any of the </v>

3223
02:13:15.231 --> 02:13:17.180
<v Speaker 1>shit that we put in wine in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

3224
02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:18.433
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how wines are made in the u s some of </v>

3225
02:13:20.781 --> 02:13:21.770
<v Speaker 1>the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3226
02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:27.100
<v Speaker 1>desirable wines from a nose perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all kinds of crap in them.</v>

3227
02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:29.413
<v Speaker 1>And there's like 87 approved additives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government allows us wine </v>

3228
02:13:32.101 --> 02:13:32.934
<v Speaker 1>makers to put in their wines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the shit that causes you to </v>

3229
02:13:36.901 --> 02:13:39.660
<v Speaker 1>get the hangover and feel bad from </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking the wine,</v>

3230
02:13:39.690 --> 02:13:41.550
<v Speaker 1>particularly red wines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3231
02:13:41.610 --> 02:13:44.460
<v Speaker 1>and wake up in the middle of the night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not be able to sleep.</v>

3232
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:46.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3233
02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:48.670
<v Speaker 1>this guy approaches me one day actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him at,</v>

3234
02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:51.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a conference and uh,</v>

3235
02:13:51.630 --> 02:13:54.630
<v Speaker 1>he started telling me a story and last </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3236
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm not buying it.</v>

3237
02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:57.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got these wines that don't have,</v>

3238
02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:59.730
<v Speaker 1>that won't cause you to fall asleep or </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3239
02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:01.580
<v Speaker 1>won't cause you to wake up in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the night.</v>

3240
02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:03.330
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3241
02:14:03.331 --> 02:14:05.130
<v Speaker 1>you mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave up drinking wine and I'm a,</v>

3242
02:14:05.190 --> 02:14:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I love wines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gave him up because I didn't like</v>

3243
02:14:06.991 --> 02:14:08.910
<v Speaker 1>what it was doing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found this new,</v>

3244
02:14:09.330 --> 02:14:10.163
<v Speaker 1>these new wines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sources wines from around the </v>

3245
02:14:12.211 --> 02:14:16.470
<v Speaker 1>world that are made in wineries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't use any of these additives.</v>

3246
02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:17.363
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

3247
02:14:17.490 --> 02:14:18.323
<v Speaker 1>he gave me a case of them to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>different brands and different things </v>

3248
02:14:21.210 --> 02:14:22.043
<v Speaker 1>and none of them from the u s they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all from Europe or South America or </v>

3249
02:14:24.271 --> 02:14:25.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3250
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:27.090
<v Speaker 1>and these are wineries had been around </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 300 years.</v>

3251
02:14:27.091 --> 02:14:31.410
<v Speaker 1>They just never bought into the concept </v>
<v Speaker 1>of adding shit to wines.</v>

3252
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3253
02:14:32.791 --> 02:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized I,</v>

3254
02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:37.830
<v Speaker 1>some of these wines I can drink and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy and feel a little bit of,</v>

3255
02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:38.664
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the edge off and then go to bed </v>

3256
02:14:40.951 --> 02:14:41.784
<v Speaker 1>and have no ill effects at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sort of opening my mind to the </v>

3257
02:14:44.761 --> 02:14:45.594
<v Speaker 1>fact that there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Paleo type wines out there that </v>

3258
02:14:48.751 --> 02:14:51.540
<v Speaker 1>don't have the additives in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in them that,</v>

3259
02:14:51.570 --> 02:14:52.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that consumed in moderation or probably </v>

3260
02:14:55.890 --> 02:14:57.870
<v Speaker 1>enjoyable and potentially helpful.</v>

3261
02:14:58.100 --> 02:14:58.933
<v Speaker 3>The term Paleo seems to be a loaded term</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people connect it with the idea </v>

3262
02:15:02.811 --> 02:15:05.510
<v Speaker 3>of the Paleolithic era and what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>ate at that time.</v>

3263
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:08.750
<v Speaker 3>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about that when you're</v>

3264
02:15:08.751 --> 02:15:11.600
<v Speaker 3>talking about Paleo wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3265
02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Like it seems a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird term.</v>

3266
02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:15.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he doesn't,</v>

3267
02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.670
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't really use the term he uses </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural.</v>

3268
02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3269
02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:20.690
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

3270
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:21.763
<v Speaker 3>the market to which he was catering at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time itself to Paleo communicates </v>

3271
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:26.840
<v Speaker 3>the Paleo community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3272
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they need a better word</v>

3273
02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:30.493
<v Speaker 3>than Paleo because it's not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>even what people ate during the </v>

3274
02:15:33.531 --> 02:15:34.364
<v Speaker 3>Paleolithic era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just reducing grains or eliminating </v>

3275
02:15:36.651 --> 02:15:39.290
<v Speaker 3>them and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and concentrating on fats.</v>

3276
02:15:39.590 --> 02:15:41.600
<v Speaker 3>That's not necessarily what people ate </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the period.</v>

3277
02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:43.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the great misnomers that </v>

3278
02:15:45.061 --> 02:15:47.220
<v Speaker 1>general public has about the Paleo Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

3279
02:15:47.490 --> 02:15:49.230
<v Speaker 1>if a caveman didn't need it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we should need it.</v>

3280
02:15:49.231 --> 02:15:50.870
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this stuff existed in caveman.</v>

3281
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It's time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that we'd even,</v>

3282
02:15:52.450 --> 02:15:56.010
<v Speaker 1>even the stuff we get out of the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>or off the trees didn't exist then.</v>

3283
02:15:56.011 --> 02:15:59.070
<v Speaker 1>It's all been manipulated by farming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3284
02:15:59.100 --> 02:15:59.791
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3285
02:15:59.791 --> 02:16:00.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3286
02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:03.240
<v Speaker 1>whether it was inserting gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't inserting genes,</v>

3287
02:16:03.241 --> 02:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>but we still did genetic manipulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3288
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:06.060
<v Speaker 1>of foods to get them</v>

3289
02:16:06.490 --> 02:16:07.323
<v Speaker 3>sweeter and more protein or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a loaded term and we need a </v>

3290
02:16:10.721 --> 02:16:13.690
<v Speaker 3>new term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like primal maybe or,</v>

3291
02:16:14.070 --> 02:16:14.521
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3292
02:16:14.521 --> 02:16:16.180
<v Speaker 3>the primal blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3293
02:16:16.181 --> 02:16:17.350
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good one.</v>

3294
02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you should run with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I'll try.</v>

3295
02:16:19.571 --> 02:16:21.370
<v Speaker 3>It honestly is probably better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>Paleo,</v>

3296
02:16:21.371 --> 02:16:21.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3297
02:16:21.790 --> 02:16:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I thought from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I s I started,</v>

3298
02:16:23.890 --> 02:16:25.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my project,</v>

3299
02:16:25.570 --> 02:16:26.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing the blog in 2006 and I knew </v>

3300
02:16:28.570 --> 02:16:32.740
<v Speaker 1>early on wanted a brand that was sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique and separate from Paleo.</v>

3301
02:16:32.741 --> 02:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I thought Paleo had too much baggage </v>
<v Speaker 1>from caveman on it.</v>

3302
02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And primal sort of has a primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3303
02:16:39.071 --> 02:16:40.750
<v Speaker 1>first importance kind of thing as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

3304
02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:42.393
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as going back to primal times </v>

3305
02:16:44.141 --> 02:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>and primal urge or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3306
02:16:45.401 --> 02:16:46.234
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence the term primal blueprint and my </v>

3307
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:52.150
<v Speaker 1>primal fuel and my food products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primal kitchen,</v>

3308
02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:53.073
<v Speaker 1>they're all kind of based around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these additives that they're putting </v>

3309
02:16:55.181 --> 02:16:57.330
<v Speaker 1>in wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just from an economic standpoint,</v>

3310
02:16:57.331 --> 02:16:58.164
<v Speaker 1>it allows the process to want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from a consumer demand point of </v>

3311
02:17:01.571 --> 02:17:03.670
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know when you get some of these,</v>

3312
02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:06.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to name names,</v>

3313
02:17:06.191 --> 02:17:07.024
<v Speaker 1>but some of my favorite really expensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>California wines that I used to love </v>

3314
02:17:11.171 --> 02:17:16.171
<v Speaker 1>because of the way they taste them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thick and rich looking and you know,</v>

3315
02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:17.433
<v Speaker 1>Okie and all this just additives all </v>
<v Speaker 1>crap they're putting in there because </v>

3316
02:17:20.711 --> 02:17:25.711
<v Speaker 1>that's what the consumer thinks is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make for a sophisticated wine.</v>

3317
02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:27.453
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that is chemical additives that </v>

3318
02:17:30.161 --> 02:17:31.450
<v Speaker 1>fuck with your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3319
02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it enough that they all do.</v>

3320
02:17:35.290 --> 02:17:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre.</v>

3321
02:17:37.001 --> 02:17:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I never would have thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I think of wine,</v>

3322
02:17:39.071 --> 02:17:39.904
<v Speaker 1>I thought wines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fermented grapes and they go </v>

3323
02:17:41.441 --> 02:17:44.590
<v Speaker 1>through a process and they store it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3324
02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:47.440
<v Speaker 1>my friend Maynard makes one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to contact him.</v>

3325
02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:49.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the band tool?</v>

3326
02:17:49.690 --> 02:17:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maynard,</v>

3327
02:17:50.531 --> 02:17:52.590
<v Speaker 1>the lead singer tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a,</v>

3328
02:17:52.591 --> 02:17:55.330
<v Speaker 1>an awesome wine company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could do ceus.</v>

3329
02:17:55.331 --> 02:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Why did they make their own wine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they somebody else's,</v>

3330
02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:58.950
<v Speaker 1>somebody won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grows his own grease.</v>

3331
02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3332
02:18:00.250 --> 02:18:00.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3333
02:18:00.911 --> 02:18:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to grow grapes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malibu,</v>

3334
02:18:03.101 --> 02:18:04.890
<v Speaker 1>but none of them make their own wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stayed,</v>

3335
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:07.440
<v Speaker 1>they truck it out to some distillery </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand.</v>

3336
02:18:07.450 --> 02:18:08.283
<v Speaker 1>When they truck it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy takes it and throws a bunch of </v>

3337
02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:10.150
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3338
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that the grower,</v>

3339
02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:14.860
<v Speaker 1>the grapes who's got his own label will </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3340
02:18:14.861 --> 02:18:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I want it to have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these properties.</v>

3341
02:18:16.481 --> 02:18:17.314
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3342
02:18:17.390 --> 02:18:18.970
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this color and this thick.</v>

3343
02:18:19.090 --> 02:18:22.010
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes if the grapes don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3344
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:24.220
<v Speaker 1>can't pr in and of themselves provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3345
02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the stuff comes from the,</v>

3346
02:18:26.710 --> 02:18:29.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the tannins in wine come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grape skin.</v>

3347
02:18:30.130 --> 02:18:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the deep,</v>

3348
02:18:31.631 --> 02:18:32.140
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

3349
02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:33.520
<v Speaker 1>deep rich color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

3350
02:18:33.730 --> 02:18:37.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to mash the grapes up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin up even more and more and more.</v>

3351
02:18:37.571 --> 02:18:41.580
<v Speaker 1>So more that Tannin to get the red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deep red colors in the wine date,</v>

3352
02:18:41.581 --> 02:18:42.414
<v Speaker 1>they have to provide more of the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's causing a lot of the </v>

3353
02:18:45.191 --> 02:18:47.340
<v Speaker 1>tannins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for some people have issues with the,</v>

3354
02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:49.150
<v Speaker 1>that you hear about the histamines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

3355
02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:50.883
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

3356
02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:53.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the marketplace demanding a deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>red wine.</v>

3357
02:18:53.891 --> 02:18:56.180
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a color issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a color.</v>

3358
02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.060
<v Speaker 1>It could be color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

3359
02:18:58.510 --> 02:18:59.590
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>

3360
02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:01.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding sugar to the wines.</v>

3361
02:19:01.121 --> 02:19:03.070
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the u s wines have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar in them,</v>

3362
02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.050
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fairly high sugar content.</v>

3363
02:19:05.410 --> 02:19:06.243
<v Speaker 1>The Guy I'm talking about here who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who led me down this this road and sort </v>

3364
02:19:09.991 --> 02:19:10.824
<v Speaker 1>of opened my eyes to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been in Ketosis for two years and </v>

3365
02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:18.610
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't drink wine because the sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>would take him out of Ketosis,</v>

3366
02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:20.333
<v Speaker 1>the sugar and why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of one of the reasons he </v>

3367
02:19:21.431 --> 02:19:23.950
<v Speaker 1>got started on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a lifetime wine drinker,</v>

3368
02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:28.980
<v Speaker 1>grew up in wine country up in Sonoma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm an adult Delton the business and</v>

3369
02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:30.494
<v Speaker 1>sort of left it because he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>disenchanted and then came back when he </v>

3370
02:19:32.901 --> 02:19:34.970
<v Speaker 1>discovered that there were these wines </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have no sugar,</v>

3371
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:36.750
<v Speaker 1>that have no self or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3372
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:37.970
<v Speaker 1>minimal sulfite to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>

3373
02:19:37.971 --> 02:19:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3374
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:40.170
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3375
02:19:40.550 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 1>fruits and vegetables have some amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sulfites but not added,</v>

3376
02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:45.470
<v Speaker 1>no added Sulfites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3377
02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:46.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3378
02:19:46.921 --> 02:19:50.480
<v Speaker 1>and none of these 80 or so approved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3379
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:53.450
<v Speaker 1>added ingredients that can affect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>color and the smell and the,</v>

3380
02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:54.590
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thickness.</v>

3381
02:19:54.930 --> 02:19:57.750
<v Speaker 2>That is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something I never even consider.</v>

3382
02:19:57.820 --> 02:20:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I never even thought there was additives</v>
<v Speaker 2>and won.</v>

3383
02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was just grapes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was pretty simple.</v>

3384
02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:03.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are American companies that do </v>

3385
02:20:05.021 --> 02:20:06.070
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything local?</v>

3386
02:20:06.310 --> 02:20:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

3387
02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:07.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3388
02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:10.540
<v Speaker 1>the things that he's given me are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3389
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:13.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all from,</v>

3390
02:20:13.390 --> 02:20:14.650
<v Speaker 1>from other countries.</v>

3391
02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:15.553
<v Speaker 2>That sounds so counter intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive that we grow so much wine in </v>

3392
02:20:19.581 --> 02:20:22.070
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to get wine without any shit in it,</v>

3393
02:20:22.071 --> 02:20:25.490
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to get it from Europe because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so concentrated right now,</v>

3394
02:20:25.491 --> 02:20:28.220
<v Speaker 2>at least this part of the country is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3395
02:20:28.221 --> 02:20:29.001
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3396
02:20:29.001 --> 02:20:34.001
<v Speaker 2>natural foods and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grass fed beef and organic vegetables.</v>

3397
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:37.460
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we would have wines that </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all primarily.</v>

3398
02:20:37.610 --> 02:20:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nuts.</v>

3399
02:20:39.350 --> 02:20:40.183
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

3400
02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it may be that I'm,</v>

3401
02:20:42.190 --> 02:20:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he hasn't sent me any that are from</v>

3402
02:20:44.361 --> 02:20:46.420
<v Speaker 1>the u s but most of these are from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from other,</v>

3403
02:20:46.421 --> 02:20:46.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3404
02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>and where would you order something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

3405
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I want to try that now because I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>wine.</v>

3406
02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I love red wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A dry wine farms is the guys,</v>

3407
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:58.170
<v Speaker 2>is the name of the company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dry wine farms dry.</v>

3408
02:20:58.570 --> 02:21:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think of dry.</v>

3409
02:21:01.511 --> 02:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the way that</v>

3410
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:06.860
<v Speaker 2>kind of white wine that people like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dry white wine.</v>

3411
02:21:06.861 --> 02:21:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3412
02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3413
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:10.423
<v Speaker 2>I just never would have believed that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the additives that are causing all </v>

3414
02:21:12.381 --> 02:21:13.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3415
02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we're back to that,</v>

3416
02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:16.840
<v Speaker 1>that initial discussion we had about </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

3417
02:21:16.841 --> 02:21:17.674
<v Speaker 1>what you don't eat right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really affects you more than what </v>

3418
02:21:19.781 --> 02:21:20.614
<v Speaker 1>you do eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3419
02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:22.240
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3420
02:21:22.990 --> 02:21:23.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3421
02:21:23.890 --> 02:21:24.723
<v Speaker 1>you're eating appropriately grown cuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of meat and organic vegetables and </v>

3422
02:21:28.601 --> 02:21:30.730
<v Speaker 1>you're cutting out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organic,</v>

3423
02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

3424
02:21:31.250 --> 02:21:33.340
<v Speaker 1>cutting out the industrial seed oils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting out the sugar,</v>

3425
02:21:33.341 --> 02:21:36.760
<v Speaker 1>cutting out the processed grains and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the other grains.</v>

3426
02:21:37.330 --> 02:21:38.830
<v Speaker 1>And in their place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3427
02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:40.540
<v Speaker 1>and you're cutting out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

3428
02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:42.580
<v Speaker 1>crappy wine and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3429
02:21:42.910 --> 02:21:46.240
<v Speaker 1>and substituting fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

3430
02:21:46.241 --> 02:21:46.661
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

3431
02:21:46.661 --> 02:21:47.171
<v Speaker 1>fowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>

3432
02:21:47.171 --> 02:21:48.004
<v Speaker 1>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeds,</v>

3433
02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:49.360
<v Speaker 1>and hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have,</v>

3434
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3435
02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:51.573
<v Speaker 1>if we want to enjoy life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things that we </v>

3436
02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:55.910
<v Speaker 1>might consider an enjoyable part of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3437
02:21:56.110 --> 02:21:59.860
<v Speaker 1>is partaking of a glass of red or white </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine with dinner.</v>

3438
02:22:00.310 --> 02:22:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Now it's kind of back on the menu for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people.</v>

3439
02:22:02.470 --> 02:22:04.930
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

3440
02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:06.573
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not necessarily on the menu </v>

3441
02:22:07.601 --> 02:22:08.740
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3442
02:22:08.741 --> 02:22:09.460
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3443
02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>and having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3444
02:22:11.740 --> 02:22:12.573
<v Speaker 1>I'm not finding myself back in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where I'm drinking wine with </v>

3445
02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:18.610
<v Speaker 1>dinner again because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3446
02:22:18.670 --> 02:22:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I still recognize for myself that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethanol that I'm not,</v>

3447
02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:24.513
<v Speaker 1>I just intuitively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like putting that amount of </v>

3448
02:22:27.211 --> 02:22:32.010
<v Speaker 1>ethanol in my body on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once in a while as a hormetic,</v>

3449
02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:32.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3450
02:22:33.050 --> 02:22:34.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insult,</v>

3451
02:22:34.261 --> 02:22:35.460
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

3452
02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:38.940
<v Speaker 1>The body will adapt to it and use it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>to its benefit.</v>

3453
02:22:38.941 --> 02:22:40.320
<v Speaker 1>But on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

3454
02:22:40.530 --> 02:22:44.940
<v Speaker 1>So just the sheer alcohol content of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine was causing an issue.</v>

3455
02:22:44.941 --> 02:22:47.520
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just the additives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3456
02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

3457
02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:51.570
<v Speaker 1>the additives were probably causing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue because with,</v>

3458
02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:52.433
<v Speaker 1>with these wines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't waking up in the middle of the </v>

3459
02:22:54.810 --> 02:22:57.090
<v Speaker 1>night and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I felt as if I hadn't had the wine.</v>

3460
02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:00.570
<v Speaker 1>So what's the ethanol ethanol is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that's the alcohol,</v>

3461
02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:03.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the form of alcohol in the wines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3462
02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:05.070
<v Speaker 1>But it's not the additives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3463
02:23:05.071 --> 02:23:05.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no that,</v>

3464
02:23:05.530 --> 02:23:07.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're trying to get at is,</v>

3465
02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:09.570
<v Speaker 1>is ethanol is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the alcohol and the wine.</v>

3466
02:23:09.610 --> 02:23:10.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3467
02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:11.900
<v Speaker 1>That's not what's being added.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3468
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.983
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you had decided that it wasn't the </v>

3469
02:23:15.271 --> 02:23:18.420
<v Speaker 1>ethanol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still didn't like the idea.</v>

3470
02:23:18.421 --> 02:23:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the issues as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3471
02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:23.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I can,</v>

3472
02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:24.233
<v Speaker 1>I can consume a fair amount of sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the course of a day and not have </v>

3473
02:23:28.830 --> 02:23:31.030
<v Speaker 1>not gained weight and not have it affect</v>
<v Speaker 1>my blood sugar.</v>

3474
02:23:31.290 --> 02:23:33.210
<v Speaker 1>I just choose not to because I know it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for me.</v>

3475
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:34.123
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't even like a glass of wine </v>

3476
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:38.063
<v Speaker 1>once it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

3477
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once in a while it's fine.</v>

3478
02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:39.743
<v Speaker 1>But it hasn't ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has it been shown that there's some </v>

3479
02:23:41.791 --> 02:23:43.020
<v Speaker 1>longevity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3480
02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:43.981
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3481
02:23:43.981 --> 02:23:46.860
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that's the Rivera trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an antioxidant?</v>

3482
02:23:46.861 --> 02:23:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3483
02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:48.593
<v Speaker 1>I think I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my interpretation of some of these </v>

3484
02:23:50.711 --> 02:23:51.544
<v Speaker 1>studies is that you take two cohorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have each of whom have a </v>

3485
02:23:56.241 --> 02:24:00.800
<v Speaker 1>shitty diet and are going to die of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease in large numbers.</v>

3486
02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And you give one with the cohorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two glasses of wine a night and you give</v>

3487
02:24:05.421 --> 02:24:07.970
<v Speaker 1>the other glass or the other cohort </v>
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

3488
02:24:08.390 --> 02:24:09.223
<v Speaker 1>And over time you look at the two groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you realize that the group that had </v>

3489
02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:17.080
<v Speaker 1>two glasses of wine tonight didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>as many cardiac events as probably cause</v>

3490
02:24:17.121 --> 02:24:20.060
<v Speaker 1>their blood was thin from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the wine or something.</v>

3491
02:24:20.061 --> 02:24:20.894
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3492
02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:24.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not that it's bestowing longevity </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these people,</v>

3493
02:24:24.171 --> 02:24:27.860
<v Speaker 1>it's that they're not dying at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate from their shitty diet.</v>

3494
02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:29.173
<v Speaker 1>Because some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my guess is it's probably some </v>

3495
02:24:30.891 --> 02:24:33.470
<v Speaker 1>artificial blood thinning that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening or something like that.</v>

3496
02:24:33.610 --> 02:24:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why is it a,</v>

3497
02:24:35.721 --> 02:24:38.270
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of conventional wisdom that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's resveratrol.</v>

3498
02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair one of the components of why,</v>

3499
02:24:41.221 --> 02:24:42.054
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

3500
02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:44.640
<v Speaker 1>you would have to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3501
02:24:44.641 --> 02:24:45.474
<v Speaker 1>750 glasses of wine to get the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>resveratrol that you can get in a </v>

3502
02:24:49.121 --> 02:24:49.954
<v Speaker 1>resveratrol capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of resveratrol in </v>

3503
02:24:53.071 --> 02:24:54.300
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some,</v>

3504
02:24:54.301 --> 02:24:55.134
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3505
02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:58.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a well studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3506
02:24:58.130 --> 02:24:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>component of,</v>

3507
02:24:59.390 --> 02:25:00.900
<v Speaker 1>of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3508
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:01.743
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there've been companies founded on just </v>

3509
02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:06.810
<v Speaker 1>providing resveratrol as an anti aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3510
02:25:07.230 --> 02:25:09.360
<v Speaker 1>nutrient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

3511
02:25:09.361 --> 02:25:11.070
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of risk virtual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

3512
02:25:11.071 --> 02:25:11.904
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think any of these studies </v>

3513
02:25:13.081 --> 02:25:13.914
<v Speaker 1>have ever pointed to the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the resveratrol in the wine that you're </v>

3514
02:25:16.201 --> 02:25:17.034
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's conferring longevity on this </v>

3515
02:25:18.211 --> 02:25:19.044
<v Speaker 1>group versus that group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's any benefit and </v>

3516
02:25:21.071 --> 02:25:23.770
<v Speaker 1>consuming exogenous ketones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3517
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3518
02:25:26.110 --> 02:25:26.943
<v Speaker 1>not on balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're an athlete and you're </v>

3519
02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:29.560
<v Speaker 1>looking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3520
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:35.070
<v Speaker 1>to maximize performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be places in which you could</v>

3521
02:25:35.561 --> 02:25:37.810
<v Speaker 1>consume exogenous ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3522
02:25:37.811 --> 02:25:40.210
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not keto adapted,</v>

3523
02:25:40.211 --> 02:25:41.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a joke.</v>

3524
02:25:41.151 --> 02:25:43.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to take exogenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones if,</v>

3525
02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:46.540
<v Speaker 1>if you're fat adapted in Quito adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3526
02:25:46.570 --> 02:25:49.650
<v Speaker 1>there may be a reason to take exogenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones in,</v>

3527
02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:51.470
<v Speaker 1>in an event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3528
02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:52.810
<v Speaker 1>instead of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

3529
02:25:53.010 --> 02:25:54.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say if you're going to run,</v>

3530
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:55.590
<v Speaker 3>do some</v>

3531
02:25:57.060 --> 02:26:00.430
<v Speaker 1>amen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet to my knowledge,</v>

3532
02:26:00.431 --> 02:26:01.990
<v Speaker 1>there aren't many great tasting</v>

3533
02:26:02.210 --> 02:26:03.043
<v Speaker 3>tone salts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you've got a palatability issue </v>

3534
02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:08.780
<v Speaker 3>as well with a lot of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you tried them?</v>

3535
02:26:09.140 --> 02:26:09.973
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

3536
02:26:09.980 --> 02:26:13.280
<v Speaker 3>but I've been fascinated by ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diets over the last couple months.</v>

3537
02:26:13.281 --> 02:26:15.790
<v Speaker 3>I've been really considering trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3538
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:16.833
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some potentially good science </v>

3539
02:26:18.621 --> 02:26:19.454
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't give you a practical </v>

3540
02:26:20.091 --> 02:26:21.950
<v Speaker 3>application right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3541
02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:22.813
<v Speaker 3>where it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it would work other than in some </v>

3542
02:26:25.161 --> 02:26:27.380
<v Speaker 3>elite event where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where somebody was,</v>

3543
02:26:27.381 --> 02:26:28.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3544
02:26:28.670 --> 02:26:29.503
<v Speaker 3>racing all out for hours and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely keto adapted prior to the </v>

3545
02:26:34.011 --> 02:26:34.844
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3546
02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:36.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

3547
02:26:36.021 --> 02:26:37.970
<v Speaker 3>was so good at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3548
02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:38.571
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3549
02:26:38.571 --> 02:26:41.030
<v Speaker 3>using ketones in the brain that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

3550
02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:43.970
<v Speaker 3>they could hold off bonking for another </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour or two.</v>

3551
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:44.833
<v Speaker 3>So they would take a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a ketogenic supplement in </v>

3552
02:26:47.151 --> 02:26:48.590
<v Speaker 3>their water or something along those </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>

3553
02:26:48.591 --> 02:26:49.424
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3554
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily on water,</v>

3555
02:26:51.531 --> 02:26:52.181
<v Speaker 3>but some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3556
02:26:52.181 --> 02:26:54.740
<v Speaker 3>some drink would probably be the easiest</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to do it.</v>

3557
02:26:54.741 --> 02:26:55.574
<v Speaker 3>So if you were going to recommend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone to try to make your body more </v>

3558
02:26:58.341 --> 02:26:59.390
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptive,</v>

3559
02:26:59.630 --> 02:27:01.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be the first step?</v>

3560
02:27:01.671 --> 02:27:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Just just to radically cut back on </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar?</v>

3561
02:27:03.921 --> 02:27:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Should you do it slowly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She to taper off.</v>

3562
02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:06.531
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>

3563
02:27:06.531 --> 02:27:07.364
<v Speaker 3>just give him up.</v>

3564
02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:09.361
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either way.</v>

3565
02:27:09.361 --> 02:27:09.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier.</v>

3566
02:27:09.991 --> 02:27:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I think if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just give it up,</v>

3567
02:27:11.611 --> 02:27:12.240
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3568
02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:13.630
<v Speaker 1>go all in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3569
02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:17.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're somebody who's been depending </v>
<v Speaker 1>on sugar your whole life and you're,</v>

3570
02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:18.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing four or 500,</v>

3571
02:27:18.961 --> 02:27:21.960
<v Speaker 1>600 grams a day of carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3572
02:27:22.050 --> 02:27:23.220
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3573
02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:24.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going down to a hundred or 120 is going </v>

3574
02:27:26.191 --> 02:27:28.140
<v Speaker 1>to be painful for the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

3575
02:27:28.141 --> 02:27:28.974
<v Speaker 1>Now I say painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this thing called the low carb </v>

3576
02:27:30.541 --> 02:27:33.000
<v Speaker 1>flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go from your body,</v>

3577
02:27:33.001 --> 02:27:33.834
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting to have you refuel every meal </v>

3578
02:27:36.241 --> 02:27:40.770
<v Speaker 1>for every couple of hours every day with</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate to then,</v>

3579
02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:42.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3580
02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>reducing it down to 120,</v>
<v Speaker 1>150 grams a day.</v>

3581
02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:46.800
<v Speaker 1>The brain starts to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3582
02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:48.690
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3583
02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:52.800
<v Speaker 1>the muscles haven't yet built the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolic machinery to burn fat.</v>

3584
02:27:52.801 --> 02:27:55.320
<v Speaker 1>They're working on it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>upregulating the,</v>

3585
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:57.600
<v Speaker 1>the genes are turning on to create the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzymes,</v>

3586
02:27:57.601 --> 02:28:00.090
<v Speaker 1>but they're not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes about 21 days to do this.</v>

3587
02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:04.410
<v Speaker 1>So in the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body's expecting sugar,</v>

3588
02:28:04.411 --> 02:28:06.450
<v Speaker 1>and if you're trying to work out at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>

3589
02:28:06.451 --> 02:28:07.284
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be screwed because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your sugar depleted and you </v>

3590
02:28:09.751 --> 02:28:12.270
<v Speaker 1>haven't learned how to burn fat yet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain is depleted.</v>

3591
02:28:12.271 --> 02:28:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And so the brain goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

3592
02:28:14.110 --> 02:28:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm foggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't thank,</v>

3593
02:28:15.571 --> 02:28:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I've got a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dizzy.</v>

3594
02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:18.650
<v Speaker 1>This sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a Bagel though.</v>

3595
02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:21.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot happened to me when I did the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Atkins Diet for,</v>

3596
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

3597
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:22.993
<v Speaker 1>many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people get derailed first or </v>

3598
02:28:24.771 --> 02:28:25.740
<v Speaker 1>second week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3599
02:28:25.770 --> 02:28:26.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to not train during that </v>

3600
02:28:28.431 --> 02:28:29.264
<v Speaker 1>time or at least cut it way back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do any good look glycolytic </v>

3601
02:28:32.421 --> 02:28:34.430
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just ride the bike easy,</v>

3602
02:28:34.431 --> 02:28:36.740
<v Speaker 1>go for a hike or do some stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3603
02:28:36.741 --> 02:28:37.574
<v Speaker 1>But you can't really train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>train hard when you're doing that </v>

3604
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:42.470
<v Speaker 1>because how long does it take to adapt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So f one or two weeks,</v>

3605
02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:43.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get through that fog and then </v>

3606
02:28:44.841 --> 02:28:46.070
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be good.</v>

3607
02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:47.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a book called the 21 day total </v>

3608
02:28:48.771 --> 02:28:49.604
<v Speaker 1>body transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the 21 days is about how long it </v>

3609
02:28:51.141 --> 02:28:51.974
<v Speaker 1>takes to get 80% of the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a fat burning beast is what we </v>

3610
02:28:56.031 --> 02:28:57.780
<v Speaker 1>call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fat burning piece that,</v>

3611
02:28:57.800 --> 02:28:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3612
02:29:00.350 --> 02:29:01.183
<v Speaker 1>So you got to commit to it and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to assume there's going to be an </v>

3613
02:29:04.971 --> 02:29:05.810
<v Speaker 1>adjustment period.</v>

3614
02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3615
02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:08.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that adjustment period,</v>

3616
02:29:08.691 --> 02:29:09.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3617
02:29:09.561 --> 02:29:10.394
<v Speaker 1>for some people it's minimal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they just feel a little bit low </v>

3618
02:29:13.851 --> 02:29:14.684
<v Speaker 1>energy or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people get headaches and woozy </v>

3619
02:29:16.551 --> 02:29:17.930
<v Speaker 1>because that's the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3620
02:29:18.050 --> 02:29:18.883
<v Speaker 1>recognizing that there's no glucose and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't yet built the metabolic </v>

3621
02:29:21.531 --> 02:29:24.020
<v Speaker 1>machinery to burn ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3622
02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:26.660
<v Speaker 1>even though the body may be producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones and,</v>

3623
02:29:26.690 --> 02:29:29.910
<v Speaker 1>and when the body produces ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3624
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:31.543
<v Speaker 1>you can either burn them as fuel or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can spill them out in the urine and the </v>

3625
02:29:34.341 --> 02:29:35.174
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of people who have not yet </v>

3626
02:29:36.831 --> 02:29:41.831
<v Speaker 1>become keto adapted like a sugar burner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carbohydrate dependent person will still</v>

3627
02:29:42.621 --> 02:29:44.570
<v Speaker 1>produce ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you skip two meals,</v>

3628
02:29:44.571 --> 02:29:45.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up in the morning,</v>

3629
02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:46.693
<v Speaker 1>you're basically fast and if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar burner and you wake up and if you </v>

3630
02:29:49.161 --> 02:29:52.880
<v Speaker 1>don't eat breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might smell ketones on that person's</v>

3631
02:29:52.881 --> 02:29:53.240
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

3632
02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:54.073
<v Speaker 1>Or they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3633
02:29:54.470 --> 02:29:57.110
<v Speaker 1>pee on a strip and it shows a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of ketones in the blood,</v>

3634
02:29:57.140 --> 02:29:57.950
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

3635
02:29:57.950 --> 02:29:58.783
<v Speaker 1>in the urine because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the body's just getting rid of </v>

3636
02:30:01.251 --> 02:30:03.290
<v Speaker 1>the ketones because you can't burn them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have burn him yet.</v>

3637
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:08.710
<v Speaker 1>So to consuming exonerations ketones </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't accentuate a ketogenic diet.</v>

3638
02:30:09.370 --> 02:30:11.330
<v Speaker 1>So I don't accelerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3639
02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about the clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>trials are going on right now.</v>

3640
02:30:15.171 --> 02:30:16.004
<v Speaker 1>But my assumption would be that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take exogenous ketones and you're not </v>

3641
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:22.310
<v Speaker 1>fat adapted to Quito adapted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to necessarily prompt you</v>

3642
02:30:22.311 --> 02:30:23.144
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become that unless you've done the </v>

3643
02:30:25.581 --> 02:30:27.350
<v Speaker 1>dietary manipulation as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3644
02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So there's no shortcuts to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitionary period between,</v>

3645
02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:32.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glucose based diet and a of fat based </v>

3646
02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:36.133
<v Speaker 1>Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just going to have to be a </v>

3647
02:30:36.681 --> 02:30:38.840
<v Speaker 1>transitionary period?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

3648
02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3649
02:30:39.681 --> 02:30:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I think if you skip a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're producing ketones.</v>

3650
02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:43.700
<v Speaker 1>So just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're pissing them out.</v>

3651
02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:44.534
<v Speaker 1>So adding more ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to piss out more </v>

3652
02:30:45.861 --> 02:30:47.030
<v Speaker 1>ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to show,</v>

3653
02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:48.740
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a superstar when you piss on</v>

3654
02:30:48.741 --> 02:30:52.340
<v Speaker 1>the Strip because you got your ketones </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the exogenous ketones.</v>

3655
02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:55.460
<v Speaker 1>But this all starts in great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this also,</v>

3656
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:59.060
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like shit I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Strip says I'm doing great.</v>

3657
02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3658
02:31:00.171 --> 02:31:01.004
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this trip's not nearly as important </v>

3659
02:31:01.971 --> 02:31:04.040
<v Speaker 1>as the actual physical performance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you feel.</v>

3660
02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:05.173
<v Speaker 1>So no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to go through a </v>

3661
02:31:06.281 --> 02:31:07.114
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you like they say it looks just </v>

3662
02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:10.400
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gal like me.</v>

3663
02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:12.050
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had a shitty diet,</v>

3664
02:31:12.051 --> 02:31:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean spaghetti all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3665
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:16.940
<v Speaker 1>you would recommend that for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

3666
02:31:16.970 --> 02:31:17.803
<v Speaker 1>I just take it real light and make this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a commitment to making the </v>

3667
02:31:20.701 --> 02:31:21.534
<v Speaker 1>adjustment and the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a fat based diet with very low </v>

3668
02:31:24.091 --> 02:31:25.800
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low carbohydrates,</v>

3669
02:31:25.801 --> 02:31:26.634
<v Speaker 1>cut out the grains entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get all your carbohydrates from </v>

3670
02:31:29.281 --> 02:31:30.114
<v Speaker 1>celery and lettuce and vegetables and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some fruits and just make a commitment </v>

3671
02:31:34.531 --> 02:31:35.364
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3672
02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:36.513
<v Speaker 1>And part of that commitment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to train like a banshee </v>

3673
02:31:39.721 --> 02:31:41.640
<v Speaker 1>for the first two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna I'll train,</v>

3674
02:31:41.641 --> 02:31:42.474
<v Speaker 1>but I'll do easy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the first chapter in our </v>

3675
02:31:45.421 --> 02:31:47.430
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be about diet,</v>

3676
02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:50.400
<v Speaker 1>is about training and about low level </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

3677
02:31:50.470 --> 02:31:51.303
<v Speaker 1>And which book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the primal endurance book that </v>

3678
02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:56.400
<v Speaker 1>just came out a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3679
02:31:56.430 --> 02:31:57.263
<v Speaker 1>the first chapter should be about die </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's clearly one of the most </v>

3680
02:31:59.221 --> 02:32:01.140
<v Speaker 1>important parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we talk about training first because</v>

3681
02:32:01.141 --> 02:32:01.974
<v Speaker 1>we figured enough endurance athletes </v>
<v Speaker 1>would read the book that if they read </v>

3682
02:32:04.771 --> 02:32:07.500
<v Speaker 1>the diet part first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would continue training at the high</v>

3683
02:32:07.501 --> 02:32:08.334
<v Speaker 1>level and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3684
02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:10.830
<v Speaker 1>and embrace the Diet and then fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

3685
02:32:11.370 --> 02:32:14.250
<v Speaker 1>So we got to get the training dialed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>first for those people and say,</v>

3686
02:32:14.251 --> 02:32:16.110
<v Speaker 1>you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why you have to cut back.</v>

3687
02:32:16.700 --> 02:32:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why you can't exceed a heart rate</v>

3688
02:32:20.221 --> 02:32:22.620
<v Speaker 1>of one 80 minus your age for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks,</v>

3689
02:32:22.650 --> 02:32:23.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

3690
02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:24.233
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing long distance stuff </v>

3691
02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:28.740
<v Speaker 1>and at that rate you'll be burning </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly fat.</v>

3692
02:32:28.741 --> 02:32:32.040
<v Speaker 1>So you'll be accentuating what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on on the dietary side,</v>

3693
02:32:32.041 --> 02:32:35.190
<v Speaker 1>which is restricting carbohydrates and </v>
<v Speaker 1>providing more fat and more healthy fats</v>

3694
02:32:35.191 --> 02:32:36.024
<v Speaker 1>for your body and creating more </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial biogenesis upregulating </v>

3695
02:32:39.751 --> 02:32:42.990
<v Speaker 1>those mitochondria to become efficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>at burning fat.</v>

3696
02:32:43.350 --> 02:32:44.183
<v Speaker 1>How long does it take before your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaches the optimum level of </v>

3697
02:32:46.321 --> 02:32:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3698
02:32:47.851 --> 02:32:48.684
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3699
02:32:48.690 --> 02:32:50.660
<v Speaker 1>we see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3700
02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:52.490
<v Speaker 1>athletes who are still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3701
02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:53.393
<v Speaker 1>who get 80% of their benefit the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks and then s and then another </v>

3702
02:32:56.521 --> 02:32:59.040
<v Speaker 1>10% over the next six months.</v>

3703
02:32:59.430 --> 02:33:00.263
<v Speaker 1>And then the final,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final benefits kick in the last six </v>

3704
02:33:03.091 --> 02:33:05.700
<v Speaker 1>months because it sometimes you lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3705
02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:06.653
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your top end power diminishes as you </v>

3706
02:33:09.001 --> 02:33:11.310
<v Speaker 1>become fat adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get that top end power back.</v>

3707
02:33:11.311 --> 02:33:13.210
<v Speaker 1>But that's what we build in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3708
02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:16.290
<v Speaker 1>so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a longer process,</v>

3709
02:33:16.291 --> 02:33:17.124
<v Speaker 1>but once it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like 80% and then six weeks </v>

3710
02:33:19.201 --> 02:33:20.920
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another 10% and then six weeks later,</v>

3711
02:33:20.970 --> 02:33:22.740
<v Speaker 1>six could be six months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

3712
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:26.190
<v Speaker 1>another 10%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the course of a full year,</v>

3713
02:33:26.191 --> 02:33:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you're still slowly adapting I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think within a year,</v>

3714
02:33:30.570 --> 02:33:31.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit more than a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3715
02:33:31.891 --> 02:33:32.724
<v Speaker 1>if you do everything right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be this completely rebuilt </v>

3716
02:33:35.701 --> 02:33:37.110
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

3717
02:33:37.290 --> 02:33:38.123
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's gotta be some benefits </v>

3718
02:33:39.121 --> 02:33:43.470
<v Speaker 1>in terms of longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of your ability to do work over</v>

3719
02:33:43.471 --> 02:33:44.910
<v Speaker 1>long periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3720
02:33:45.210 --> 02:33:46.043
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that that's most </v>

3721
02:33:47.371 --> 02:33:49.290
<v Speaker 1>compelling is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3722
02:33:49.291 --> 02:33:50.124
<v Speaker 1>coming from an endurance community where</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriages fall apart because the guy </v>

3723
02:33:54.121 --> 02:33:54.954
<v Speaker 1>would rather go for a 100 mile ride on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday morning and then stay in bed and </v>

3724
02:33:57.721 --> 02:33:59.580
<v Speaker 1>cuddle with a wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3725
02:33:59.581 --> 02:34:01.830
<v Speaker 1>or would would rather Ameritas fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>

3726
02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:04.170
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was money.</v>

3727
02:34:05.050 --> 02:34:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it is money,</v>

3728
02:34:06.181 --> 02:34:08.250
<v Speaker 1>the $8,000 bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3729
02:34:08.251 --> 02:34:09.540
<v Speaker 1>to go on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ride.</v>

3730
02:34:09.930 --> 02:34:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3731
02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we going with that?</v>

3732
02:34:14.210 --> 02:34:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longevity.</v>

3733
02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marriages fall apart.</v>

3734
02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3735
02:34:17.710 --> 02:34:19.210
<v Speaker 1>so the longevity part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3736
02:34:19.930 --> 02:34:22.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you train less,</v>

3737
02:34:22.151 --> 02:34:22.984
<v Speaker 1>there's less total training time to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the results that you wanted because </v>

3738
02:34:26.171 --> 02:34:27.004
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it methodically and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just putting it all out there every </v>

3739
02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:32.400
<v Speaker 1>day and crossing your fingers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3740
02:34:32.401 --> 02:34:33.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm training as much as this guy,</v>

3741
02:34:33.521 --> 02:34:34.354
<v Speaker 1>so I must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better be as fast or faster than he </v>

3742
02:34:35.831 --> 02:34:36.490
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3743
02:34:36.490 --> 02:34:39.970
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an approach that's very scripted,</v>

3744
02:34:39.971 --> 02:34:44.971
<v Speaker 1>a detailed and methodical at one on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the spectrum on the other end.</v>

3745
02:34:45.850 --> 02:34:46.683
<v Speaker 1>It's also sporadic and fractal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a wake up today and I don't </v>

3746
02:34:49.211 --> 02:34:50.650
<v Speaker 1>feel like doing what I had in my plan.</v>

3747
02:34:51.070 --> 02:34:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Take the day off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you've got,</v>

3748
02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:55.150
<v Speaker 1>if today's the day you're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard and you feel like shit,</v>

3749
02:34:55.210 --> 02:34:57.580
<v Speaker 1>do not go hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no magic,</v>

3750
02:34:57.581 --> 02:34:58.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

3751
02:34:59.410 --> 02:35:02.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no points that you gain from </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

3752
02:35:02.501 --> 02:35:03.190
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

3753
02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it'll take you down the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

3754
02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you learn to become intuitive about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and period.</v>

3755
02:35:09.421 --> 02:35:11.910
<v Speaker 1>This city is one of the words we talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about where you paradise,</v>

3756
02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:12.773
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3757
02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:13.953
<v Speaker 1>there's moments where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's times when you're going very </v>

3758
02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.073
<v Speaker 1>make your longer workouts longer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>slower and you're a hard workouts </v>

3759
02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:22.570
<v Speaker 1>shorter and harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3760
02:35:22.690 --> 02:35:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3761
02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:25.750
<v Speaker 1>and in the B in the middle of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3762
02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:26.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be intuitive about,</v>

3763
02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:28.720
<v Speaker 1>about how you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much sleep did you get?</v>

3764
02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Are you fueled appropriately for today's</v>
<v Speaker 1>event?</v>

3765
02:35:32.110 --> 02:35:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have,</v>

3766
02:35:33.551 --> 02:35:34.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3767
02:35:34.330 --> 02:35:37.780
<v Speaker 1>is there a purpose to today's workout </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than just go accumulate miles?</v>

3768
02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Because I'll feel like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll feel like a slob if I don't.</v>

3769
02:35:42.430 --> 02:35:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3770
02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and if you could get around all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3771
02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:45.993
<v Speaker 1>you can start to see some amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits with less pain and suffering </v>

3772
02:35:50.021 --> 02:35:52.660
<v Speaker 1>and sacrifice less being beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less burnout,</v>

3773
02:35:53.650 --> 02:35:57.160
<v Speaker 1>less time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And presumably if you do it right,</v>

3774
02:35:57.370 --> 02:35:59.650
<v Speaker 1>better results anyway than the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the old paradigm.</v>

3775
02:35:59.830 --> 02:36:00.663
<v Speaker 1>So that's going to cause a real dilemma </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people that are obsessed with the </v>

3776
02:36:04.691 --> 02:36:05.660
<v Speaker 1>work rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3777
02:36:05.770 --> 02:36:08.530
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with just doing more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else,</v>

3778
02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:11.710
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with proving to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They push themselves,</v>

3779
02:36:11.711 --> 02:36:14.050
<v Speaker 1>they put in all those hours and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulate and looking at it.</v>

3780
02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:15.160
<v Speaker 1>They look at their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3781
02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:16.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have apps on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

3782
02:36:16.731 --> 02:36:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Measure how many I know.</v>

3783
02:36:18.161 --> 02:36:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nine o'clock at night.</v>

3784
02:36:20.051 --> 02:36:21.220
<v Speaker 1>We just finished dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honey,</v>

3785
02:36:21.221 --> 02:36:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I only have 16,000 steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>

3786
02:36:23.411 --> 02:36:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk back to the hotel or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house cause I gotta get to 20.</v>

3787
02:36:27.370 --> 02:36:29.590
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff is so ridiculous.</v>

3788
02:36:29.890 --> 02:36:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3789
02:36:30.941 --> 02:36:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of those people who,</v>

3790
02:36:32.771 --> 02:36:33.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3791
02:36:33.791 --> 02:36:34.624
<v Speaker 1>I lived my life based on the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles I accumulated and measured myself </v>

3792
02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:44.080
<v Speaker 1>worth a on whether or not it could hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>with everybody I ever raced or race with</v>

3793
02:36:44.081 --> 02:36:45.070
<v Speaker 1>in a workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3794
02:36:45.130 --> 02:36:48.340
<v Speaker 1>and never let anybody half wheel me on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike ride,</v>

3795
02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:49.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3796
02:36:49.390 --> 02:36:50.620
<v Speaker 1>in any workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

3797
02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:54.820
<v Speaker 1>it was fun I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was part of my lifestyle,</v>

3798
02:36:54.821 --> 02:36:56.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go back to the,</v>

3799
02:36:57.130 --> 02:36:59.020
<v Speaker 1>to the essence of why are you doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

3800
02:36:59.230 --> 02:37:01.780
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing it just to hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People used to say,</v>

3801
02:37:01.781 --> 02:37:02.980
<v Speaker 1>hey mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you so disciplined,</v>

3802
02:37:02.981 --> 02:37:03.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3803
02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:06.250
<v Speaker 1>you're out there and you're riding 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles a hundred miles.</v>

3804
02:37:06.251 --> 02:37:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Some days you're running 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are so disciplined and might,</v>

3805
02:37:09.341 --> 02:37:10.690
<v Speaker 1>the joke is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking to myself,</v>

3806
02:37:10.691 --> 02:37:11.530
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

3807
02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discipline is going to work and,</v>

3808
02:37:15.471 --> 02:37:16.790
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting in a full,</v>

3809
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.863
<v Speaker 1>productive eight hours and then finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of time to work out or </v>

3810
02:37:20.211 --> 02:37:21.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe hang out with a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

3811
02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:26.660
<v Speaker 1>it was so easy for me to get on a bike </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go put some miles in or go for a run</v>

3812
02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:29.720
<v Speaker 1>and shrug every other duty off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

3813
02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:30.733
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the one of the dangers of </v>

3814
02:37:31.551 --> 02:37:33.080
<v Speaker 1>being an endurance athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's addictive.</v>

3815
02:37:33.081 --> 02:37:33.914
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3816
02:37:34.100 --> 02:37:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a very addictive pursuit you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating,</v>

3817
02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:38.710
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're beating yourself up</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

3818
02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:42.620
<v Speaker 1>You're creating endorphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endogenous morphine,</v>

3819
02:37:42.621 --> 02:37:46.250
<v Speaker 1>like substances that sit on those same </v>
<v Speaker 1>receptor sites,</v>

3820
02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:47.353
<v Speaker 1>the painkilling site and the pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving sites that you would inject </v>

3821
02:37:49.761 --> 02:37:50.594
<v Speaker 1>heroin to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you just doing it naturally and </v>

3822
02:37:53.511 --> 02:37:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it every single day and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>crave it every day.</v>

3823
02:37:55.850 --> 02:37:56.683
<v Speaker 1>And if you take five days off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like shit you go with through </v>

3824
02:37:58.401 --> 02:37:59.234
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that part of it as well that </v>

3825
02:38:00.951 --> 02:38:02.870
<v Speaker 1>we have to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do people do this?</v>

3826
02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the obsessive aspect of it,</v>

3827
02:38:05.250 --> 02:38:08.100
<v Speaker 2>the obsessive aspect of it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>addictive aspect of it.</v>

3828
02:38:08.101 --> 02:38:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
