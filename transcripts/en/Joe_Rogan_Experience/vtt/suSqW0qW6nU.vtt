1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that would pan out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a similar idea.</v>

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Kumina were alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>If it was not for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would not exist.</v>

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is 100 percent actual fact.</v>

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I was watching you doing live from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>compound.</v>

8
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.194
<v Speaker 1>Me and Brian Red Band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting in my fucking living room </v>

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>and we were watching you while you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking playing karaoke.</v>

10
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>You're singing karaoke with a machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun in front of a green screen.</v>

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

12
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.174
<v Speaker 1>this guy just set up his own studio like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he already has opie and Anthony show at </v>

13
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.694
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys were at Sirius Xm and he just </v>

14
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>decided to do this thing in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement just for a goof.</v>

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a hobby,</v>

16
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's like guys who don't have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>not married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have kids,</v>

18
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have anybody telling them </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do and they also have disposable</v>

19
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>

20
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Then you get to see what guys really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>

21
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>They want to sing karaoke with a machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun in front of a green screen.</v>

22
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy,</v>

23
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>crazy gun Guy Karaoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could do that.</v>

24
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.303
<v Speaker 1>If if I was married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have a wife that would lose her </v>

25
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:06.924

57
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>You know the thoreau quote that I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>way too many times in this podcast,</v>

58
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:34.764
<v Speaker 1>but I love the quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most men live lives of silent </v>

59
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

60
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is true.</v>

61
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a hundred percent true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

62
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was married for time and it was a,</v>

63
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>it was a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a living hell for me.</v>

64
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that got me through as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many years as I was married,</v>

65
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.833
<v Speaker 1>because I was married nine years and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't remember one happy year out of </v>

66
00:02:56.881 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>those nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had gotten into radio pretty early</v>

67
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.270
<v Speaker 1>on in that marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.603
<v Speaker 1>and that was my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I dedicated myself no matter how </v>

69
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>miserable anything else in my life was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing radio.</v>

70
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was awesome.</v>

71
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory about that.</v>

72
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.313
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that a person needs a certain </v>

73
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>amount of suffering in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at some of the all time,</v>

74
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>great comics or even all time great </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio personalities like Howard Stern,</v>

75
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during his hay day when he was,</v>

76
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 1>the fucking man was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

77
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would talk about it.</v>

78
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.330
<v Speaker 1>He would hide in his basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love those stories.</v>

79
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>

80
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest radio personality ever.</v>

81
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's huge.</v>

82
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.963
<v Speaker 1>And yet he's got to hide and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about masturbating and hiding </v>

83
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>from his wife and he can't get any sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

84
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter if he was huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter if he was famous,</v>

85
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter how rich he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter.</v>

86
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.293
<v Speaker 1>He's just hide in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that anger came out on the radio </v>

87
00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>like you related to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understood it.</v>

88
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

90
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

91
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and it worked for me because there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of misery.</v>

92
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.313
<v Speaker 1>Like when I started doing really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we moved back to New York from Boston </v>

93
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 1>after we got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

94
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.633
<v Speaker 1>opiod myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys got fired for saying that the </v>

95
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>mayor died?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

96
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.103
<v Speaker 1>it was an April fool's gag and a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we always thought that the </v>

97
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.923
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April fool's jokes was so stupid and </v>

98
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Hokey and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

99
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.743
<v Speaker 1>we changed the format to all elvis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like after 10 minutes they say </v>

100
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>April fools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're like,</v>

101
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 1>let's just go balls out and say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayor's dead and have a news guy come on</v>

102
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>and report it and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was supposed to subsequently</v>

103
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>get more outrageous as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show went on.</v>

105
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.563
<v Speaker 1>So by the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a Taiwan male hooker in the </v>

106
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>car with them and they crashed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was getting a blow job or so,</v>

107
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>like it was going to get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>

108
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>but they stopped it early on and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed us to even mention it.</v>

109
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>So people really thought he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's kind of stupid.</v>

110
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:04.324
<v Speaker 1>You go to the one show for your news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back then the internet wasn't what </v>

111
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

112
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the inner,</v>

113
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>the inner wasn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was barely a thing.</v>

114
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>It was barely a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

115
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>because that was 90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>97 around there.</v>

116
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Ninety eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year did you get on?</v>

117
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably earlier I was on really </v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

118
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.800
<v Speaker 1>like the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on bulletin board service.</v>

119
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.653
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

120
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.513
<v Speaker 1>we used to play Trivia Games with a 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Baud Modem with people and I thought it </v>

121
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>was amazing even then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in,</v>

122
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:37.680
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.583
<v Speaker 1>when we were up in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought a digital camera that was just </v>

124
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>this giant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a laptop and other giant thing</v>

125
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.903
<v Speaker 1>and I would take pictures of what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the studio and then post </v>

126
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:49.744
<v Speaker 1>them that night on a website that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out I used to code the html </v>

127
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.163
<v Speaker 1>myself and make a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just post pictures and links and people </v>

128
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>thought it was amazing.</v>

129
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you're seeing what we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that day.</v>

130
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't instant,</v>

131
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>but it was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started doing videos.</v>

132
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.863
<v Speaker 1>I was able to put video like maybe eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>second clips of nude girls if they were </v>

133
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>in the studio and pop that up and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved it.</v>

134
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.943
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I got a bill from the company </v>

135
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>for bandwidth and I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth.</v>

136
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>It was a $12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill for a month.</v>

137
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

138
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>

139
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.093
<v Speaker 1>there was no compression or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pumping video out to thousands of </v>

140
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>people uncompressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

141
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>apparently they had that happen a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times.</v>

142
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>So they told me just don't do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make me pay,</v>

143
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at that point I had to learn about,</v>

144
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coding and a compression and things like</v>

145
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.444
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just kept doing it and just put </v>

146
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>them in some sort of a compressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>format.</v>

147
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>would you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember back then?</v>

149
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a for audio.</v>

150
00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>It was real audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was hilarious.</v>

151
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little player,</v>

152
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real audio player would pop up.</v>

153
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And then for video got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember what it was,</v>

154
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all pixilated,</v>

155
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 frames per minute,</v>

156
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>kind of weird things like real audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was everywhere.</v>

157
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>They just quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave up around still unless they changed</v>

158
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:23.920
<v Speaker 1>into something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>or kind kinda got bought out by </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's happens to everything.</v>

162
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.120

<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

171
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.240
<v Speaker 1>we were on the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the same company as Howard Stern,</v>

172
00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>CBS radio.</v>

184
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>You'd watch it on real player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get porn from bit torrent.</v>

185
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:28.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

186
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes you wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything on your computer to play.</v>

187
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.850
<v Speaker 1>It was say a Codec not available.</v>

191
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:42.244
<v Speaker 1>I got to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I ever got a </v>

192
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 1>porn video sent to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

193
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch a porn video.</v>

195
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Before it was just photos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photos were insane because,</v>

196
00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was around the mid nineties.</v>

197
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>My brother had picked up a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.533
<v Speaker 1>an apple computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what model it was or </v>

199
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

200
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty good for the time.</v>

201
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.653
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sat in front of that thing for </v>

202
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>hours and hours on end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one porn pick.</v>

203
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>It was no videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pictures and you know,</v>

204
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 1>how they used to scroll sometimes it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a corrupt file,</v>

205
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 1>so halfway down it would just turn white</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pixelated and zigzaggy.</v>

206
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for hours,</v>

207
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:27.420
<v Speaker 1>just one more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more,</v>

208
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.690
<v Speaker 1>one more and just go tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

209
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.573
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

210
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.440
<v Speaker 1>tick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would slowly emerged.</v>

211
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very compelling.</v>

212
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd sit there and just waiting for the</v>

213
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.300
<v Speaker 1>three d printer is faster now than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was downloading photos on a 14 k modem.</v>

214
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.653
<v Speaker 1>It's insane to think of the technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of it because you got thumb drives </v>

216
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>with more memory than entire computers </v>
<v Speaker 1>had just a few years ago.</v>

217
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.221
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

218
00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 1>and I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was Bill Gates or something,</v>

219
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 1>said you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never need anything more powerful</v>

220
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>than a for 86 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

221
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.250
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of megs of memory and uh,</v>

222
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>just crazy the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demand for,</v>

223
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.733
<v Speaker 1>for a computer power got way out of hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially with games and stuff </v>

224
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a huge gaming got now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>download a game,</v>

225
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:19.134
<v Speaker 1>like a red dead redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or call of duty and it's 75 to 100 </v>

226
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:27.150
<v Speaker 1>gigs.</v>

227
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those games.</v>

228
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

229
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been 100 computers.</v>

230
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And to think of those floppy discs you </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to get games on,</v>

231
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.953
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a pallet stacked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like six feet high of those discs to </v>

232
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 1>load it on a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like the old doom games.</v>

233
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

234
00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

236
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 1>it would work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:56.631
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been to a gaming store in </v>
<v Speaker 1>years because with the origin or steam,</v>

239
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 1>you just download the game right off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

243
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 1>anything anymore.</v>

244
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's one in the mall I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

245
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

246
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if we used games.</v>

247
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Xbox and playstation.</v>

248
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Xbox you could download to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

249
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

250
00:11:18.521 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And playstation.</v>

251
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just plugged the cat six or whatever</v>

252
00:11:23.111 --> 00:11:23.944
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was having a conversation with </v>

253
00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson about this yesterday off</v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

254
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:27.244
<v Speaker 2>I was saying I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get concerned because I feel like all </v>

255
00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:31.714
<v Speaker 2>of our information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the vast majority of it is now </v>

256
00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:38.230
<v Speaker 2>digital and we have some things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>written down on paper,</v>

257
00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:42.430
<v Speaker 2>but even paper so it's so easy to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>and burn and fuck up.</v>

258
00:11:42.431 --> 00:11:43.264
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lost most of human beings loss most </v>

259
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 2>of the information about Egypt when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>burned the library of Alexandria,</v>

260
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.690
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

261
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>there could have been all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>schematics and some diagrams,</v>

262
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.023
<v Speaker 3>detailed diagrams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they built some of the things they </v>

263
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 3>built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost it all,</v>

264
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that easily could happen to us.</v>

265
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll be starting from scratch </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

266
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

267
00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:03.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

268
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:07.270
<v Speaker 1>when it takes some form of electricity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

269
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.520
<v Speaker 1>to get to all this information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really dependent on that.</v>

270
00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:15.060
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that type of power of forever.</v>

271
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.023
<v Speaker 3>And even if we figured out how to reboot</v>
<v Speaker 3>electricity and say some day in the </v>

272
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:19.204
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if we have a massive coronal mass </v>

273
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.190
<v Speaker 3>ejection and it fucking nukes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire,</v>

274
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 3>the whole grid and all the satellites go</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and we have to start from scratch.</v>

275
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:29.674
<v Speaker 3>So it's a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two decades before people start </v>

276
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 3>rebuilding computers again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That actually work well.</v>

277
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have to decipher all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this information.</v>

278
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>those codex.</v>

279
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.680
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

280
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get drivers to make all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff work.</v>

281
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 3>And you're gonna miss a lot of it.</v>

282
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the info is literally ones and Zeros</v>

283
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.750
<v Speaker 1>and it has to be decoded and put back </v>
<v Speaker 1>together again</v>

284
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.420
<v Speaker 3>and some important stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's on a drive somewhere,</v>

285
00:12:54.421 --> 00:12:55.980
<v Speaker 3>it could just get nuked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

286
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.050
<v Speaker 3>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone forever.</v>

287
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:00.420
<v Speaker 3>All the things that people figured out </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>

288
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't you wish that would happen at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some?</v>

289
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so cynical,</v>

290
00:13:06.801 --> 00:13:09.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really have lately more so.</v>

291
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.573
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think over the course of the past few </v>

292
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.680
<v Speaker 1>years I've just gotten more cynical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I think social media had a big effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

294
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you engaged too much.</v>

295
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

296
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm off social media now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been for,</v>

297
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.660
<v Speaker 1>for maybe months at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.510
<v Speaker 1>as a personal choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

299
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.280
<v Speaker 1>the twitter kicked me off quite a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

300
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.150
<v Speaker 1>but they kick you off just dumb shit to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like wow.</v>

302
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.280
<v Speaker 1>The last one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

303
00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.114
<v Speaker 1>I was defending Jimmy Norton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some girl was on just bashing Jimmy and </v>

<v Speaker 1>feminine guy and your hair looks like it</v>

308
00:13:59.331 --> 00:14:01.750

<v Speaker 1>You can't make fun of somebody says </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks if the sexuality.</v>

320
00:14:34.521 --> 00:14:38.930
<v Speaker 1>research for the show because a twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets the news before the news.</v>

321
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Like that's where everything breaks now </v>

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.593
<v Speaker 1>They kicked her off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about Islam and talking </v>

353
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>about how twitter was celebrating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's Day,</v>

354
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

355
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:13.241
<v Speaker 1>That was a on a certain day by focusing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the picture was one of those,</v>

356
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic women that got elected to office</v>

357
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.240
<v Speaker 1>up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>

358
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.243
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota or somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she said how hypocritical that was </v>

359
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:23.810
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Islam is for female genital mutilation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

361
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against women's rights and they kill gay</v>

362
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:29.654
<v Speaker 1>people and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all she posted and she got </v>

363
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.150
<v Speaker 1>kicked off for hate speech against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

364
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.050
<v Speaker 1>And then her argument was Louis </v>
<v Speaker 1>Farrakhan was saying,</v>

365
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an anti Semite,</v>

366
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm an anteater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might equating Jews with insects,</v>

367
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:48.881
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jeremy kind of a thing.</v>

368
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

369
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while her heart was in the right place,</v>

370
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess it did come off a little wacky.</v>

371
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.980
<v Speaker 1>She also had a star of David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a yellow star of David on her shirt,</v>

372
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as she was chained to twitter and people</v>

373
00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:04.210
<v Speaker 1>got upset with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

374
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.960
<v Speaker 1>there she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>

375
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:06.794
<v Speaker 1>to tell you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a good strategic move </v>

376
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.970
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to buy time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because the police do not want that</v>

377
00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:18.770
<v Speaker 1>optic of a uniformed guy kind of pulling</v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl off.</v>

378
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:21.920
<v Speaker 1>They're wearing a star of David.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could just picture looks bad.</v>

379
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So it might've bought her some time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if that was her motive.</v>

380
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.080
<v Speaker 1>She planned it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

381
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.273
<v Speaker 1>she did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was the number one </v>

382
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.530
<v Speaker 1>trending topic on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is odd that you know,</v>

383
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.910
<v Speaker 1>she gets kicked off and ends up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one trending topic.</v>

384
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:38.744
<v Speaker 1>What's really odd is this is while </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manafort who may have perjured himself </v>

385
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.393
<v Speaker 1>yours going after trump's deeper ties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cohen is now saying that trump was in </v>

386
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>cahoots with Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going</v>

387
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 2>to give them the $50,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>penthouse tower in Moscow.</v>

388
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

389
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

390
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

391
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 2>That girl got kicked off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up to it.</v>

392
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It sounds ridiculous because I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

393
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:04.500
<v Speaker 2>I got kicked off and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

394
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.580
<v Speaker 1>a little bummed about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

395
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.130
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's why,</v>

396
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.143
<v Speaker 1>because it's odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a private company anymore </v>

397
00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:17.300
<v Speaker 1>that can do what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not free government regulation,</v>

398
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.223
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know how you fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but twitter is now a thing where the </v>

399
00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:22.424
<v Speaker 1>presidents on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're leaders are discussing things on </v>

400
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:26.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency management,</v>

401
00:18:26.661 --> 00:18:27.494
<v Speaker 1>fema and the weather services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put out alerts in case of a danger </v>

402
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.243
<v Speaker 1>or or some kind of event that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and because of your political </v>

403
00:18:36.021 --> 00:18:38.720
<v Speaker 1>ideology or calling a girl period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood hair,</v>

404
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.810
<v Speaker 1>you're not privy to alerts and safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that</v>

405
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

406
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.053
<v Speaker 2>It's clear that it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's doesn't have to follow the </v>

407
00:18:47.331 --> 00:18:48.164
<v Speaker 2>same rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've already established that with </v>

408
00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Farah Khan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've also established that with trump.</v>

409
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris has been on a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

410
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:54.950
<v Speaker 2>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's abandoned it,</v>

411
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.993
<v Speaker 2>but it was on a quest to get jack to try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold up his terms of service </v>

412
00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:04.070
<v Speaker 2>agreement and kick trump off of twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

413
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.900
<v Speaker 2>look what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's threatening nuclear war.</v>

414
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.213
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the craziest use of twitter </v>

415
00:19:09.321 --> 00:19:10.130
<v Speaker 2>ever?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

416
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.340
<v Speaker 2>and I think Jack's position was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

417
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.660
<v Speaker 2>It's more beneficial to have him on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

418
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.913
<v Speaker 2>we're getting to see his personality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way we've never seen any president's </v>

419
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 2>personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely mean the,</v>

420
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.990
<v Speaker 2>the most ridiculous petty shit that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

421
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 2>like attacking Michelle Wolf because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>her White House correspondents dinner.</v>

422
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.500
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colin people losers,</v>

423
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:34.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making fun of the girl on Joe </v>

424
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Scarborough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girl he married.</v>

425
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

426
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:44.060
<v Speaker 2>That she had fucked up plastic surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her bleeding just make shit up.</v>

427
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think she really,</v>

428
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.550
<v Speaker 2>really thinks she showed up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

429
00:19:46.551 --> 00:19:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Maro Lago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bleeding fucking plastic surgeries.</v>

430
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.260
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

431
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.900
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

432
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.773
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

433
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.813
<v Speaker 2>it's good for us to see because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>educates us to who he is as a real </v>

434
00:19:59.391 --> 00:20:00.224
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of who you are just gets </v>

435
00:20:02.031 --> 00:20:05.360
<v Speaker 2>exposed in those tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We little bit.</v>

436
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.180
<v Speaker 2>You can't know everything about a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their twitter,</v>

437
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.163
<v Speaker 2>but you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can parse out little chunks where </v>

438
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:14.000
<v Speaker 2>you get a good taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for him it's very,</v>

439
00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:15.440
<v Speaker 2>very revealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

440
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:18.740
<v Speaker 2>it is a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think this will be looked</v>

441
00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:19.574
<v Speaker 2>back on as a very pivotal moment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>American history and in politics where </v>

442
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.800
<v Speaker 2>that kind of crossroad happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

443
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 1>because we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were pretty satisfied with,</v>

444
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that political speech thing that,</v>

445
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.473
<v Speaker 1>and we need to bring up the lower middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>class and they just go on and on and </v>

446
00:20:41.581 --> 00:20:42.414
<v Speaker 1>drone on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this weird speech that no real </v>

447
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 1>human being ever speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Hillary was hilarious.</v>

448
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And why Wayne?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

449
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:52.690
<v Speaker 1>today is the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fake.</v>

450
00:20:52.691 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 1>It comes off as fake and phony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump comes rolling in.</v>

451
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:59.650
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely batshit insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the stuff he says,</v>

452
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:01.460
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

453
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.343
<v Speaker 1>he's giving a speech and he said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was younger people said he </v>

454
00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:06.784
<v Speaker 1>looked like Elvis because he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of a commemorative thing for </v>

455
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Elvis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

456
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down in Tennessee or somewhere.</v>

457
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

458
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.910
<v Speaker 1>he looked like Elvis and we're laughing </v>
<v Speaker 1>our asses off me and Keith,</v>

459
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one ever told me Elvis,</v>

460
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 1>no one ever told him that.</v>

461
00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:25.561
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

462
00:21:25.561 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 1>and there's so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a trump guy.</v>

463
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:29.464
<v Speaker 1>I voted for the guy because I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>that monkey wrench thrown into the </v>

464
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:33.004
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt we had gotten screwed too many </v>

465
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 1>decades and it was time to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington know,</v>

466
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:39.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

467
00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 1>we'd rather elect this nut than any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys.</v>

468
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think it proved a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

469
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 1>there are enough checks and balances in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where,</v>

470
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the likes of any one president really </v>

471
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:53.614
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to do that much damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's pulled the cover off a lot </v>

472
00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:57.244
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are trying to compete </v>

473
00:21:58.841 --> 00:21:59.674
<v Speaker 1>with him on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians are trying to play his game </v>

474
00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:06.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of fun to watch as a comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainer.</v>

475
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.113
<v Speaker 1>It's gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what Tulsi Gabbert said to </v>

476
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:09.724
<v Speaker 1>him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

477
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.480
<v Speaker 1>She's a congresswoman from Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

478
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:15.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being Saudi Arabia,</v>

479
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.260
<v Speaker 1>bitch isn't making America first.</v>

480
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a congresswoman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say they're all kind of taking that.</v>

481
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.710
<v Speaker 1>They never used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

482
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:24.743
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's odd that a 70 year old guy was </v>

483
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:32.911
<v Speaker 1>the one that was like bringing twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>to social media into this forum.</v>

484
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.023
<v Speaker 1>It is on and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think it would be some young </v>

485
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:36.604
<v Speaker 1>guy get in there and do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd never do it the way he's doing </v>

486
00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:39.600
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

487
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Speaker 1>that's just like a reckless maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

488
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because he can.</v>

489
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy you,</v>

490
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 1>you'll never see a chain of events like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to elect Donald Trump,</v>

491
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.300
<v Speaker 1>the rich guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a billionaire and billion,</v>

492
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of money from his dad,</v>

493
00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.940
<v Speaker 1>from his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad.</v>

494
00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I remember him in New York when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

496
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Trump was always in the news developer.</v>

497
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.120
<v Speaker 1>He was always banging heads with </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

498
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:07.954
<v Speaker 1>trying to get some kind of zoning thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>going or build some other tower </v>

499
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:12.310
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

500
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.300
<v Speaker 1>so we were all familiar with them and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew he was like this piece of shit guy.</v>

501
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone was surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

502
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he grabbed her by the pussy.</v>

503
00:23:20.831 --> 00:23:21.664
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw in the daily news and the New </v>

504
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.560
<v Speaker 1>York Post every week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump was with some other hula is.</v>

505
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't a surprise to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

506
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.860
<v Speaker 1>but he got out there and it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect timing,</v>

507
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.620
<v Speaker 1>like we come off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

508
00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 1>the heels of eight years of a Democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

509
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just was,</v>

510
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.960
<v Speaker 1>people were ready for a maniac to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The white people were,</v>

511
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 1>some people were exactly my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of the election was that lady with</v>

512
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 1>the sock hat on her knees with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses screaming.</v>

513
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 1>That to me ushered in this era of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage and chaos.</v>

514
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.043
<v Speaker 1>It just said that was like the primal </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream that set off the dominoes and </v>

516
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 1>they're all in motion right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't supposed to happen.</v>

517
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't supposed to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary was supposed to be president.</v>

518
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.493
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go down in history as just one </v>

519
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 1>of those wacky elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then business as usual.</v>

520
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.823
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

521
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:25.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

522
00:24:25.801 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 1>when trump won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned everything upside down and rip</v>

523
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:31.760
<v Speaker 1>the cover off of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

524
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.560
<v Speaker 1>not only politics in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

525
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

526
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream media,</v>

527
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.960
<v Speaker 1>the news media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything had the covers ripped off and</v>

528
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:46.961
<v Speaker 1>everyone's now got a peek inside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize how fucked up everything is.</v>

529
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.873
<v Speaker 1>You used to assume Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the people had some kind of </v>

530
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:52.874
<v Speaker 1>control like they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were adults doing the job that </v>

531
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:56.060
<v Speaker 1>needed to be.</v>

532
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And then you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

533
00:24:57.381 --> 00:25:00.270
<v Speaker 1>everyone's just a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>

534
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Here's the story that disappeared from </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

535
00:25:02.331 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the Washington Madam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that suicide or self?</v>

536
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.433
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

537
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Book filled with politicians that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

538
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.003
<v Speaker 1>getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're banging all these prostitutes and </v>

539
00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:14.750
<v Speaker 1>she was going to release everything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was doing press conferences and then</v>

540
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 1>she committed suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed suicide.</v>

541
00:25:16.461 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

542
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.970
<v Speaker 1>case closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

543
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.160
<v Speaker 1>no big deal that will last her books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

544
00:25:20.161 --> 00:25:20.531
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever,</v>

545
00:25:20.531 --> 00:25:21.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

546
00:25:21.531 --> 00:25:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And then it disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It disappeared.</v>

547
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Things like that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

548
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.980
<v Speaker 1>flag politicians killed people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

549
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.303
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's secret backroom deals that </v>

550
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:32.594
<v Speaker 1>happen and it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>House of cards is way closer to reality </v>

551
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 1>than people would like to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

552
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Closer.</v>

553
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.410
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

554
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 1>over the course of the decades upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

555
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year that goes by,</v>

556
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:45.344
<v Speaker 1>we seem to get a little more knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a little less confident in the </v>

557
00:25:49.461 --> 00:25:50.294
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

558
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched some shit from the fifties,</v>

559
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:53.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of things on youtube and </v>

560
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 1>even even industrial films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just this thing of how a family,</v>

561
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.930
<v Speaker 1>how to raise your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There had to be a good wife,</v>

562
00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:03.764
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was all this weird propaganda of </v>

563
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:10.310
<v Speaker 1>what America was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as years go by,</v>

564
00:26:10.311 --> 00:26:11.031
<v Speaker 1>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

565
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:11.864
<v Speaker 1>it was all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like politicians were always getting </v>

566
00:26:15.381 --> 00:26:18.830
<v Speaker 1>rich and no one seems to know how or </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

567
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>And these deals that are made aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>always in our best interest.</v>

568
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.270
<v Speaker 1>They're not civil servants there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent and help you.</v>

569
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.001
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

570
00:26:27.001 --> 00:26:27.834
<v Speaker 1>and as the years go by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see more and more of this and the </v>

571
00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:34.880
<v Speaker 1>past two years with trump has just been </v>
<v Speaker 1>a man quite a crash course.</v>

572
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 1>It really has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

573
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated to see where it goes.</v>

574
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated to see if he seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean they always called</v>

576
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Godaddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Teflon Don,</v>

577
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like trump is the teflon </v>
<v Speaker 2>donald.</v>

578
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seems,</v>

579
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 2>it seems like all these things keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and,</v>

580
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 2>and even because I remember Justin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin Dale,</v>

581
00:26:57.421 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 2>a comedian friend of mine is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

582
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:02.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about stormy Daniels.</v>

583
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's our Monica Lewinsky.</v>

<v Speaker 2>wacky show in a basement somewhere for </v>

<v Speaker 2>Gq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mental patient,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like legitimately like a mental patient </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance screaming and it was like he </v>

607
00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:06.864
<v Speaker 2>was doing like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like burlesque or </v>

608
00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:11.190
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

609
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.173
<v Speaker 2>Like you know how it was like the radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of burlesque is like when you </v>

610
00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:17.304
<v Speaker 2>see a girl doing burlesque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a throwback to an old timey </v>

611
00:28:21.361 --> 00:28:22.650
<v Speaker 2>way of doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the guy,</v>

612
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.100
<v Speaker 2>the handlebar mustache with a bowler </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital introducer.</v>

613
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 2>She's body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is bodacious.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Please welcome Matt.</v>

615
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she comes out to music that nobody </v>

616
00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:36.180
<v Speaker 2>listens to anymore and she's dancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

617
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 2>It's very end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

618
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:41.400
<v Speaker 2>They're always kind of big girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not skinny little strippers.</v>

619
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.043
<v Speaker 2>There are girls who eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like it's a throwback to a </v>

620
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:49.020
<v Speaker 2>different time of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rowdiness and when he was in front of</v>

621
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:49.854
<v Speaker 2>that screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like doing this thing with his suit on </v>

622
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:52.884
<v Speaker 2>and tie like d and everything was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>really well written and these precise </v>

623
00:28:57.631 --> 00:28:58.464
<v Speaker 2>points and I don't understand like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the red blue and the background was </v>

624
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.973
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

625
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seemed like something that someone</v>

626
00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:05.724
<v Speaker 2>had set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not as good as your compound of </v>

627
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:09.360
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

628
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.000
<v Speaker 2>You live from the compound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

629
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:14.790
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't as good as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's the background.</v>

630
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.920
<v Speaker 2>This is for Gq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gq was like,</v>

631
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:21.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have $30 dollars I think.</v>

632
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>

633
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Charlie's got a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could bring it in $30.</v>

634
00:29:26.071 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

635
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.170
<v Speaker 2>We have a table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ikea table.</v>

636
00:29:28.171 --> 00:29:31.020
<v Speaker 2>That's $12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have $18 left.</v>

637
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 2>We got some construction paper for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

638
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.580
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got some big ass blue and blue and red</v>

639
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.240
<v Speaker 2>paint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

640
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Posters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

641
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he would just pontificate there</v>

642
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 2>and he and his last thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the end is eminent,</v>

643
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no reason for me to go on.</v>

644
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's finished.</v>

645
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

646
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:59.640
<v Speaker 2>My work here is done play some of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is finished in one year.</v>

647
00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.640
<v Speaker 2>One year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This week.</v>

648
00:30:00.641 --> 00:30:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One year ago.</v>

649
00:30:01.851 --> 00:30:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Last November 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>

650
00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:05.384
<v Speaker 2>It was when he quit.</v>

651
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.833
<v Speaker 4>Get a pardon from trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wore the bowler as I've also reported </v>

652
00:30:10.471 --> 00:30:11.304
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has succeeded in finding a way around </v>

653
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:14.820
<v Speaker 4>trumps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pardon?</v>

654
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Power in either of these near </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainties spelled trump's do.</v>

655
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.700
<v Speaker 4>So that's the most obvious of the seven </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways for trump to go.</v>

656
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Now smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

657
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.000
<v Speaker 4>we'll get him on Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will be ugly.</v>

658
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.330
<v Speaker 4>It will tear this country nearly apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it will be necessary.</v>

659
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.230
<v Speaker 4>The second way is as I've also </v>
<v Speaker 4>repeatedly suggested here,</v>

660
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.243
<v Speaker 4>that Mahler doesn't really need to prove</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything about trump and Russian </v>

661
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.360
<v Speaker 4>sabotage of the election.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There seems to be so much obstruction of</v>

662
00:30:42.361 --> 00:30:43.194
<v Speaker 4>justice for the firing of James Comey to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lies about trump jr's meetings with </v>

663
00:30:46.951 --> 00:30:47.784
<v Speaker 4>the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's hard to pick out a key player </v>

664
00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:53.790
<v Speaker 4>in the trump inner circle who could not </v>
<v Speaker 4>be guilty of it.</v>

665
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.290
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A year ago and it's like,</v>

666
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.120
<v Speaker 2>it's still going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still going.</v>

667
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Still going and it gets fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

668
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 2>And it now fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hoax,</v>

669
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.400
<v Speaker 2>but it is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like molar to me,</v>

670
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:14.401
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating because he seems like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruthless motherfucker takes his time.</v>

671
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.080
<v Speaker 2>He's like a guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

672
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 2>look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill you.</v>

673
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

674
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 2>That's all you need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes I can be today,</v>

675
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:24.724
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like every day he's plotting on </v>

676
00:31:27.341 --> 00:31:29.440
<v Speaker 2>killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them drive by your house in ways</v>

677
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.600
<v Speaker 2>like when is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when is the hammer fall?</v>

678
00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 2>And you look out your window of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

679
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:34.990
<v Speaker 2>He's out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that guy drinking coffee.</v>

680
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has seen some shit.</v>

681
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

682
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.670
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

683
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a cold blooded intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent.</v>

684
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

685
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 2>those guys have seen everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows the inner workings,</v>

686
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:47.803
<v Speaker 2>the machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he knows how you bring a guy like </v>

687
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:53.260
<v Speaker 2>that down and how you fuck it up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing everything.</v>

688
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 2>That leads me to believe that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking it up.</v>

689
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:56.993
<v Speaker 2>This is a slow play and if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there is anything to the Russian </v>

690
00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:03.604
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think something would have </v>

691
00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:05.890
<v Speaker 2>leaked out by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

692
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 2>it has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

693
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.863
<v Speaker 2>there was a video the other day of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald that they just played on cnn of </v>

694
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Donald was talking about how many times </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually been to rush donald junior</v>

695
00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had said that he hadn't been.</v>

696
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.660
<v Speaker 2>But then there's another video of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>from years ago saying,</v>

697
00:32:19.661 --> 00:32:20.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been there many times.</v>

698
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.331
<v Speaker 2>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

699
00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:22.960
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

700
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.150
<v Speaker 2>talking about business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with,</v>

701
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that are going after trump,</v>

702
00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:28.683
<v Speaker 2>they don't seem to understand the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>right up until he became president of </v>

703
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:37.240
<v Speaker 2>the United States was just a private </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen businessman.</v>

704
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>So he had a lot of dealings around</v>

705
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.770
<v Speaker 1>the world with his real estate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings and golf courses.</v>

706
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.780
<v Speaker 1>All this shit happened when he was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a citizen doing business now,</v>

707
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 1>whether it was ethical or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

708
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.043
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could definitely be brought into </v>

709
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:58.680
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's legal or not a,</v>

710
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's what they're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>into also,</v>

711
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:01.484
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't beholden to the people as a </v>

712
00:33:05.331 --> 00:33:06.164
<v Speaker 1>public servant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a conflict of interest </v>

713
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:08.714
<v Speaker 1>because he was a lifelong politician and</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the power of his office to make </v>

714
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 1>deals so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that also goes hand in hand with him</v>

715
00:33:17.031 --> 00:33:18.870
<v Speaker 1>just fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

716
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.793
<v Speaker 1>like if he went from a selectman in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hometown and then years and years go by </v>

717
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:26.510
<v Speaker 1>and then you're the president and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>built that career up.</v>

718
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:27.703
<v Speaker 1>Any at any point in there they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>call you out on being a horrible human </v>

719
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 1>being because you fucked girls or you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

720
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.400
<v Speaker 1>So you'd had a shady business dealings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But up until two years ago,</v>

721
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.650
<v Speaker 1>he was just donald fucking trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

722
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.513
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to call them out on even </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with Russia because there's </v>

723
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:45.650
<v Speaker 1>plenty of business and deal with Russia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and China.</v>

724
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:46.484
<v Speaker 1>I think the question is whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>he colluded with Russia to get </v>

725
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:50.954
<v Speaker 1>information about Hillary and also to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put out all that propaganda against </v>

726
00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:56.744
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and also saying that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make a deal to do the trump </v>

727
00:33:59.661 --> 00:34:00.494
<v Speaker 1>tower in Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all while he was running for </v>

728
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not being honest about it.</v>

729
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets again.</v>

730
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know almost there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal there.</v>

731
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.653
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's anything that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he did that is illegal because I </v>

732
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:16.214
<v Speaker 1>believe when you're campaigning say </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want to anybody </v>

733
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.330
<v Speaker 1>really running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're really running anything.</v>

734
00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.770
<v Speaker 1>It really running the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

735
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:25.604
<v Speaker 1>If he lost the presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would still have to have some ducks </v>

736
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:31.680
<v Speaker 1>in a row to continue his business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

737
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.533
<v Speaker 1>and his son took over that part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what he was doing so he could </v>

738
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:36.584
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether Donny Jr went over to Russia </v>

739
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:40.980
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really see.</v>

740
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 1>You might think it's unethical and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might go,</v>

741
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he say if we win,</v>

742
00:34:45.471 --> 00:34:48.860
<v Speaker 1>we'll do this and help you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows about that part of it,</v>

743
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:49.933
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see in and of itself him </v>
<v Speaker 1>going over there being that big a </v>

744
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:54.010
<v Speaker 1>problem and the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.063
<v Speaker 1>the Clinton campaign and the DNC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a lot of shady deals going on </v>

746
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:04.631
<v Speaker 1>with Russia also in that crazy dossier </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an English spy and a Russian like.</v>

747
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.900
<v Speaker 1>And that just never seems to get any </v>
<v Speaker 1>traction.</v>

748
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

749
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:13.780
<v Speaker 1>there's way more left wing media </v>
<v Speaker 1>publications in the right way.</v>

750
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.743
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact there's only a few right </v>

751
00:35:16.191 --> 00:35:17.100
<v Speaker 1>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

752
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.000
<v Speaker 1>newspapers and right wing websites are </v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes maligned,</v>

753
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.173
<v Speaker 1>treated seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no right wing newspaper </v>

754
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:29.610
<v Speaker 1>that's treated with the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect is the New York Times columnist.</v>

755
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

756
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.024
<v Speaker 1>What the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

757
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.280
<v Speaker 1>the New York Post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Post right wing.</v>

758
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.973
<v Speaker 1>Outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

759
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>They don't give</v>

760
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.370
<v Speaker 2>a fuck who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberal Democrat,</v>

761
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Sro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative Republican.</v>

762
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:44.770
<v Speaker 2>They'll fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the headlines that have come off</v>

763
00:35:44.771 --> 00:35:47.520
<v Speaker 2>of the fucking post have been classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years.</v>

764
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.770
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

765
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Like comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

766
00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just comedy.</v>

767
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 2>One was one I thought was just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>douchey when Fred astaire died,</v>

768
00:35:56.821 --> 00:36:01.730
<v Speaker 2>it was said a stairway to heaven like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

769
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.390
<v Speaker 2>but that someone must have gotten a hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

770
00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.700
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that I do love about New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York and Boston to yeah,</v>

771
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 2>is a harshness to the comedy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are fucking cold.</v>

772
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:17.480
<v Speaker 2>It's cold in the wintertime is calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck you and that growing up there,</v>

773
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:21.860
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucking flavored me flavored bourbon.</v>

774
00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 2>There's a million guys like that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

775
00:36:24.721 --> 00:36:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Patrice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking comedy.</v>

776
00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:27.684
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it came out of that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world because that part of the world is </v>

777
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that weird?</v>

778
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.513
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cold and you think that just makes </v>

779
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:36.384
<v Speaker 2>people angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A cold and a lot of people I think and </v>

780
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.350
<v Speaker 2>very few people makes people like more </v>
<v Speaker 2>down home.</v>

781
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Me and compassionate and they stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

782
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Tana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for a few serial killers randomly</v>

783
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.860
<v Speaker 2>scattered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scattered out into the woods,</v>

784
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.003
<v Speaker 2>but other than that you get like people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that work together and help each other </v>

785
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:54.990
<v Speaker 2>because they realized they were in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

786
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is A.</v>

787
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.653
<v Speaker 2>There's a stark difference between New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York and Boston based comics and La </v>

788
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:04.370
<v Speaker 2>based company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing difference.</v>

789
00:37:04.371 --> 00:37:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

790
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:09.240
<v Speaker 2>And some of them have that crossover </v>
<v Speaker 2>appeal there and they've moved,</v>

791
00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

792
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 2>like bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maintains that Boston sensibility,</v>

793
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 2>that New York sensibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

794
00:37:16.351 --> 00:37:17.184
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's appealing about him is that he's </v>

795
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:19.620
<v Speaker 2>still a savage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

796
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.730
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

797
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

798
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't grow that out here.</v>

799
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:26.550
<v Speaker 2>It's sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice every day.</v>

800
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.383
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's seems kind of pleasant out </v>

801
00:37:30.421 --> 00:37:33.150
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's real or phoniness,</v>

802
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:34.223
<v Speaker 2>but it comes off as pleasantry and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York is just a grave disregard for </v>

803
00:37:39.271 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

804
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:44.670
<v Speaker 2>you literally step over people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people lose their value.</v>

805
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:45.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have a million pennies and </v>

806
00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:50.170
<v Speaker 2>you drop a penny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put up.</v>

807
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lost the guy on the train.</v>

808
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:53.883
<v Speaker 2>Now it is odd when you think about if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was somebody just laying in the </v>

809
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:04.590
<v Speaker 2>gutter of the street in some small town </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Kansas,</v>

810
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police and ambulance would be called</v>

811
00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:09.940
<v Speaker 2>and people would stop and ask if he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

812
00:38:09.941 --> 00:38:10.774
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in New York you literally step over </v>

813
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:14.970
<v Speaker 2>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't even look in their face.</v>

814
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:16.103
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

<v Speaker 2>A three inch ledge.</v>

1049
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1050
00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Come around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing this?</v>

1051
00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:25.600
<v Speaker 2>You fuck a one little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One.</v>

1052
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Little fucking miscalculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or how do you do that?</v>

1053
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 2>How do you know your center of gravity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it just gonna?</v>

1054
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Pull your right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuck up.</v>

1055
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went around the corner.</v>

1056
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this guy's lifelike?</v>

1057
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.930
<v Speaker 2>If he decides he's going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This makes me very uncomfortable.</v>

1058
00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:45.820
<v Speaker 2>That is so fucking high up.</v>

1059
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.210
<v Speaker 2>It's so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so high.</v>

1060
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.353
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do what he did if he was on the </v>

1061
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:52.000
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1062
00:48:52.001 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1063
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:52.991
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1064
00:48:52.991 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't do those handstands and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>jazz brown mark out three inches and try</v>

1065
00:48:57.911 --> 00:48:58.744
<v Speaker 2>to stay on it with your hand or mark it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up enough so that you like put pads </v>

1066
00:49:01.871 --> 00:49:02.710
<v Speaker 2>under me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1067
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:03.603
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then give it so I could jump up and </v>

1068
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:07.300
<v Speaker 2>grab it and hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See how much of that I could do,</v>

1069
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.550
<v Speaker 2>like a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could king from my fingers.</v>

1070
00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I might be able to pull myself up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I got to the top I probably slip.</v>

1071
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:14.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1072
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Your height will definitely fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1073
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're riding a bike on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sidewalk,</v>

1074
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 2>you will never fall off the sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just ride your bike.</v>

1075
00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:25.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to think about it.</v>

1076
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Sidewalk what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couple of feet wide.</v>

1077
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.280
<v Speaker 2>If that was over like the Grand Canyon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1078
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>you would be shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't do it.</v>

1079
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:38.590
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just your perception and the height</v>

1080
00:49:38.591 --> 00:49:39.790
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be,</v>

1081
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.200
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

1082
00:49:41.201 --> 00:49:42.034
<v Speaker 2>there's going to fall off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have that htc vibe in the back room </v>

1083
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:45.791
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1084
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1085
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 2>there's one game we have to download </v>
<v Speaker 2>that game.</v>

1086
00:49:48.431 --> 00:49:49.264
<v Speaker 2>We haven't gotten that game when you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the hardware store and you buy a two </v>

1087
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 2>by four and you lay it down on the floor</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the game is,</v>

1088
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:59.720
<v Speaker 2>you put the vr goggles on and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking on this two by four over,</v>

1089
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.920
<v Speaker 2>like in between two skyscrapers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1090
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:05.750
<v Speaker 2>So as you're doing it in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is,</v>

1091
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:07.740
<v Speaker 2>this is the actual game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1092
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:10.150
<v Speaker 2>You step out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1093
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 2>here's the two by four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this two by four is real.</v>

1094
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you have an actual two by fours </v>
<v Speaker 2>really walking on this.</v>

1095
00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:19.210
<v Speaker 2>So you're feeling it and you walk the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plank.</v>

1096
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1097
00:50:22.901 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 2>And you look down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1098
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.610
<v Speaker 2>what is that thing floating in front of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

1099
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.330
<v Speaker 1>What's that supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1100
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1101
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.550
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1102
00:50:34.551 --> 00:50:35.384
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all watching it on a screen </v>

1103
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:39.650
<v Speaker 1>does vr no justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't really,</v>

1104
00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 1>you are in a space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cold to kind of look around.</v>

1105
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:46.370
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they definitely have more work to do.</v>

1106
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1107
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:48.163
<v Speaker 1>it looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're in a three d </v>

1108
00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:51.450
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not very photo realistic.</v>

1109
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1110
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 1>for kids are addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really run here afterschool.</v>

1111
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put the vr goggles.</v>

1112
00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:58.283
<v Speaker 1>They fight over it and they put the vr </v>
<v Speaker 1>goggles on and play these fucking crazy </v>

1113
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

1115
00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:05.504
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Oculus and the vive and the </v>

1116
00:51:06.951 --> 00:51:07.784
<v Speaker 1>playstation vr at home and right now the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oculus is the highest quality of the vr </v>

1117
00:51:14.901 --> 00:51:15.990
<v Speaker 1>goggles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1118
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I think playstation has some pretty cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>games out there though.</v>

1119
00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:20.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1120
00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.550
<v Speaker 1>does too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think uh,</v>

1121
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:26.930
<v Speaker 1>a Oculus is going to come out very soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a completely wireless one.</v>

1122
00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:29.140
<v Speaker 1>So it was a htc vive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1123
00:51:29.141 --> 00:51:29.974
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not tethered to anything and </v>

1124
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:34.160
<v Speaker 1>you're tripping over wires and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be big.</v>

1125
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1126
00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.520
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird though because uh,</v>

1127
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.880
<v Speaker 1>some games aren't conducive to vr and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think like I play call of duty</v>

1128
00:51:43.821 --> 00:51:47.550
<v Speaker 1>or battlefield five World War II thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>just came out and I love that,</v>

1129
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.433
<v Speaker 1>that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I couldn't play that for our </v>

1130
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.330
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will play for fucking hours on end and</v>

1131
00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:58.420
<v Speaker 1>to have the goggles on that long and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to play a shooter like that.</v>

1132
00:51:58.530 --> 00:51:59.363
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think vr right now is more conducive </v>

1133
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:05.600
<v Speaker 1>to experiences than it is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much not a game.</v>

1134
00:52:05.601 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 1>It's an experience and it brings you </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a whole nother three d world around</v>

1135
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:09.950
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1136
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:11.990
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shooter game,</v>

1137
00:52:11.991 --> 00:52:15.620
<v Speaker 1>like battlefield or call of duty not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really conducive to vr right now.</v>

1138
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I think in the future though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plastic gun.</v>

1140
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a real.</v>

1141
00:52:20.901 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 1>If you were holding a real plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd need that interface.</v>

1142
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:24.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be fucking amazing for a </v>

1143
00:52:25.581 --> 00:52:26.720
<v Speaker 1>shooter game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:27.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few other ideas that they're </v>

1145
00:52:30.321 --> 00:52:31.154
<v Speaker 1>working on that should be available </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty relatively soon where the system </v>

1146
00:52:36.231 --> 00:52:38.110
<v Speaker 1>maps your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the room you're,</v>

1147
00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:43.240
<v Speaker 1>you're in off of your headset and will </v>
<v Speaker 1>superimpose things over the couch.</v>

1148
00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Like it'll be a ammo crate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A chair turns into a box ammo crate.</v>

1149
00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:50.310
<v Speaker 1>So as you walk around the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1150
00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:54.950
<v Speaker 1>it's reading your room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but making this vr world that looks more</v>

1151
00:52:54.951 --> 00:52:57.890
<v Speaker 1>military or like a jungle or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1152
00:52:57.891 --> 00:53:00.620
<v Speaker 1>so it won't be a couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll hit it,</v>

1153
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 1>but in your vision it'll be a box or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ammo crate or you know,</v>

1154
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:06.560
<v Speaker 1>what a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1155
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:07.394
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1156
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.850
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1157
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.240
<v Speaker 1>utilizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1158
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.610
<v Speaker 1>the real environment around you and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>superimposing shit over it.</v>

1159
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is really cool?</v>

1160
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:16.840
<v Speaker 1>The boxing games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And the boxing games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a crazy workout,</v>

1162
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:24.200

<v Speaker 1>kids play.</v>

1178
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get a bunch of guns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ammo and then the zombies are closing in</v>

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:11.733
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some games or experiences </v>

1183
00:54:13.991 --> 00:54:14.824
<v Speaker 1>where you're walking through a kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>haunted house thing that are genuinely </v>

1184
00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:18.730
<v Speaker 1>fucking alarming.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go around a corner,</v>

1187
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do anything and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1188
00:54:24.581 --> 00:54:28.240
<v Speaker 1>like when you watch on the Monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the Monitor.</v>

1189
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:32.530
<v Speaker 1>There's shit behind you that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing unless you turn around and look.</v>

1190
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.320
<v Speaker 1>So you hear a sound and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not to.</v>

1191
00:54:35.321 --> 00:54:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that thing's going to be right in</v>

1192
00:54:37.511 --> 00:54:42.511
<v Speaker 1>my face and it's frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the alien game for?</v>

1193
00:54:42.911 --> 00:54:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Is that for the vibe or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oculus is a Ridley Scott Alien.</v>

1194
00:54:46.811 --> 00:54:48.360

1195
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.070

<v Speaker 1>Oculus.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alien something.</v>

1197
00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one like alien.</v>

1198
00:54:56.411 --> 00:54:57.860
<v Speaker 1>The original movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1200
00:54:58.830 --> 00:54:59.663
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts with the doors open up and </v>

1201
00:55:00.971 --> 00:55:02.950
<v Speaker 1>that little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking of the water.</v>

1202

<v Speaker 1>That little chotchkies on the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1204
00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.390

<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

1205
00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:12.250
<v Speaker 1>of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was fucking awesome.</v>

1206
00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the greatest one goes down</v>
<v Speaker 1>as one of my</v>

1207
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:19.220
<v Speaker 3>favorite scene is also one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite examples when people talk about</v>

1208
00:55:19.561 --> 00:55:21.760
<v Speaker 3>pushing diversity and movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1209
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.213
<v Speaker 3>This movie had a female lead who is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>female superstar who a spoiler alert </v>

1210
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:34.100
<v Speaker 3>winds up winning in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't need even notice now.</v>

1211
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 3>It never feels like it's crammed down </v>
<v Speaker 3>your throat.</v>

1212
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the last star wars,</v>

1213
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.170
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of here,</v>

1220
00:55:58.671 --> 00:56:01.400
<v Speaker 1>idea of how to present that then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>because traditional movies,</v>

1246
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:05.920
<v Speaker 2>the guys the hero and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when Tom Skerritt gets it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>movie where the spaceship was kind of a </v>

1253
00:57:22.421 --> 00:57:23.254
<v Speaker 2>truck and it was just dirty and just </v>

<v Speaker 2>a year or two ago.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It didn't matter if a woman was running </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

1292
00:58:56.071 --> 00:58:56.904
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're putting out too many star wars </v>

1293
00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:03.451
<v Speaker 2>movies to have that mystique and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a atmosphere that it was like to</v>

1294
00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 2>go to one of them years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Which is great because it's consistent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's good.</v>

1298
00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's never stunning.</v>

1299
00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.160
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's never fucked up.</v>

1303
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Like when you leave the theater going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

1304
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1305
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:26.653
<v Speaker 2>Can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kind of polish off the sharp edges </v>

1306
00:59:29.421 --> 00:59:34.421
<v Speaker 2>and sued the experience down to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>palatable mainstream appeal that first,</v>

1307
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:39.270
<v Speaker 2>the first star wars back in [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>77 again.</v>

1308
00:59:39.271 --> 00:59:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I saw that in a movie theater with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncle.</v>

1309
00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 2>My uncle joe took me and I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>stores from a home of wall.</v>

1310
00:59:46.581 --> 00:59:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I remember the trailer playing on tv and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1311
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems kind of cool.</v>

1312
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:51.223
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we sit down and that opening </v>

1313
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 2>scene with the giant ship just does a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fly over.</v>

1314
00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 2>And I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that point on,</v>

1315
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:00.404
<v Speaker 2>I was just mesmerized with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The illusion of size that they got in </v>

1316
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:04.214
<v Speaker 2>the ship and it was an old school ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The added out of like plastic model of </v>

1317
01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.650
<v Speaker 2>practical effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all like models,</v>

1318
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 2>like they went and bought like a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of different.</v>

1319
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.010
<v Speaker 2>You remember those old bottles that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to do like cars and oem.</v>

1320
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Remember those glue them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the bottle glue,</v>

1321
01:00:22.191 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 2>rIght?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to love those.</v>

1322
01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took a bunch of parts from those </v>

1323
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:26.924
<v Speaker 2>things and built the millennium falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They built those battleships from like </v>

1324
01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:31.724
<v Speaker 2>parts and you can kind of tell because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so weird and eclectic and some </v>

1325
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:38.770
<v Speaker 2>of the parts don't seem to match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worked.</v>

1326
01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.060
<v Speaker 2>It totally worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they're out there and you hear the </v>

1369
01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:53.130

1374
01:03:04.771 --> 01:03:05.604

<v Speaker 1>As a kid.</v>

1393
01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certain things,</v>

1394
01:03:58.860 --> 01:03:59.693
<v Speaker 3>but is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like ultimately you saw that when you </v>

1395
01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:03.810
<v Speaker 3>weRe a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe,</v>

1396
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:07.530
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's maybe it's not good to shield</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids from too much.</v>

1397
01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:09.143
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not to that extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me a cartoon first or something </v>

1398
01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.390
<v Speaker 1>because I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if it affected me.</v>

1399
01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:16.224
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell Without knowing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be like if I didn't see stuff </v>

1400
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:19.650
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1401
01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that I remember it vividly </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many years later</v>

1402
01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:26.000
<v Speaker 3>maybe had an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1403
01:04:26.001 --> 01:04:26.834
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't a negative effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certain experiences that you </v>

1404
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.180
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have,</v>

1405
01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.013
<v Speaker 3>like today as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see a movie where a guy gets </v>

1406
01:04:35.451 --> 01:04:37.850
<v Speaker 3>shot and you can handle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It dOesn't freak you out.</v>

1407
01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you saw it when you were four,</v>

1408
01:04:39.561 --> 01:04:41.120
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1409
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:44.300
<v Speaker 3>But is it good to expeRience that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're four just so that you know,</v>

1410
01:04:44.301 --> 01:04:45.134
<v Speaker 3>it's a thing and you have a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>view of the world or is it good like </v>

1411
01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.270
<v Speaker 3>you're not a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as a parent,</v>

1412
01:04:50.271 --> 01:04:51.104
<v Speaker 3>this is the age old question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like hoW much do you protect your kids </v>

1413
01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:55.340
<v Speaker 3>and how much do you let them break their</v>
<v Speaker 3>arm?</v>

1414
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Because you break your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1415
01:04:57.441 --> 01:04:58.550
<v Speaker 3>if you fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you break your arm.</v>

1416
01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.250
<v Speaker 3>If everybody's like helicopter </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenting,</v>

1417
01:05:01.251 --> 01:05:03.350
<v Speaker 3>you constantly like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anybody to die,</v>

1418
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:05.510
<v Speaker 3>but I don't mind if anybody gets banged </v>
<v Speaker 3>up a little bit.</v>

1419
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:06.471
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1420
01:05:06.471 --> 01:05:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Should I think you should know that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you trip it hurts.</v>

1421
01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:11.360
<v Speaker 3>You know there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also,</v>

1422
01:05:11.361 --> 01:05:15.350
<v Speaker 3>you should know that bullets are real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real thing that happens.</v>

1423
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:16.543
<v Speaker 3>like with my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever since my kids have been really </v>

1424
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:21.364
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been hunting and so I've been </v>

1425
01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:23.674
<v Speaker 3>bringing home meat and explaining to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them that this is meat from an animal </v>

1426
01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:30.160
<v Speaker 3>that I shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to the supermarket and you buy</v>

1427
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:34.600
<v Speaker 3>a steak that came from an animal and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to get this in their head at a early</v>

1428
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:35.434
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then I introduced them to watching a </v>

1429
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:42.670
<v Speaker 3>hunting show with me where we shot a </v>
<v Speaker 3>deer and then took the deer apart.</v>

1430
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Polshek shake you seeing like they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching us cut an elca part.</v>

1431
01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 3>My kids watching this and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is where you get meat.</v>

1432
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:52.840
<v Speaker 3>Like when we eat dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we eat elk for dinner,</v>

1433
01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:56.170
<v Speaker 3>this is exactly where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shot it in the mountains.</v>

1434
01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:59.110
<v Speaker 3>We cut it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We packed it out on our back.</v>

1435
01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.350
<v Speaker 3>We put it into a truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We drove somewhere and now we're here.</v>

1436
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Now we're eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a.</v>

1437
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you present it like that,</v>

1438
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.940
<v Speaker 3>that's I would guess is a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

1439
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:10.803
<v Speaker 3>But there's something weird about </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching a little kid watching animal </v>

1440
01:06:13.031 --> 01:06:15.550
<v Speaker 3>gets shot where like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1441
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:16.483
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they realized my dad and that is that </v>

1442
01:06:17.981 --> 01:06:19.390
<v Speaker 3>good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is my debt a piece of shit?</v>

1443
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:23.860
<v Speaker 3>These animals are so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1444
01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:24.723
<v Speaker 3>animals aRe hot dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your hot dogs a fucking that you want a </v>

1445
01:06:26.261 --> 01:06:26.981
<v Speaker 3>hot dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1446
01:06:26.981 --> 01:06:27.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1447
01:06:27.701 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 3>And that'S an animal like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1448
01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because most kids just,</v>

1449
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a hot dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the.</v>

1450
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an actual animal.</v>

1451
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 3>They kind of know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you asked a little kid,</v>

1452
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.150
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're this cheeseburger came from,</v>

1453
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.790
<v Speaker 3>oh it's from a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's like,</v>

1454
01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:46.180
<v Speaker 3>damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like saying the moon is a one,</v>

1455
01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:48.160
<v Speaker 3>six earth's gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

1456
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:49.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1457
01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:50.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1458
01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:51.443
<v Speaker 3>No real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a real chance apply it to </v>

1459
01:06:53.861 --> 01:06:55.240
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>

1460
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:57.430
<v Speaker 3>So when do you show your kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1461
01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.150
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of videos that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch while close my laptop and the kids</v>

1462
01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:03.040
<v Speaker 3>come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like violent videos.</v>

1463
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like animals.</v>

1464
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Like I was watching this video of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyenas tearing apart this gazelle.</v>

1465
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking horrific.</v>

1466
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:12.160
<v Speaker 3>the ripping the guts out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1467
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:13.503
<v Speaker 3>yanking on the guts and this thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>making these weird noises like home and </v>

1468
01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:20.860
<v Speaker 3>chunks of its guts out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>

1469
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.290
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1470
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:24.280
<v Speaker 3>And then my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1471
01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:26.110
<v Speaker 3>my lIttle girl comes over and slammed it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's like,</v>

1472
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:26.944
<v Speaker 3>what are you watching?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm watching the hyena rip apart </v>

1473
01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.370
<v Speaker 3>gazelles guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

1474
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.791
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1475
01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1476
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1477
01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:34.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1478
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:39.630
<v Speaker 3>but kind of what's the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between that and showing you hunting?</v>

1479
01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:41.980
<v Speaker 3>like is there a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing a quick.</v>

1480
01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:46.000
<v Speaker 3>That's one difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I shoot an animal,</v>

1481
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.850
<v Speaker 3>if I shoot an animal with a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dead in seconds.</v>

1482
01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1483
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:52.060
<v Speaker 3>with a well placed shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going anywhere.</v>

1484
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:52.923
<v Speaker 3>It's like the last elk I shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one that's right out there on the </v>

1485
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:58.420
<v Speaker 3>floor in front of the werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing died in five yards,</v>

1486
01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.300
<v Speaker 3>five yards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tipped over,</v>

1487
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.360
<v Speaker 3>feet up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got shot.</v>

1488
01:08:02.361 --> 01:08:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Her rIght in the heart was perfect shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

1489
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.790
<v Speaker 3>it was almost instantaneous death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1490
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:12.850
<v Speaker 3>it might've lived 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 seconds and that was it.</v>

1491
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.290
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1492
01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't seem</v>

1493
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.873
<v Speaker 1>to be shocked that much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're trying to keep it from </v>

1494
01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>your kids and things like that obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense,</v>

1495
01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:27.701
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost impossible to keep some </v>
<v Speaker 1>really horrific shit from people,</v>

1496
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>especially if you give your kid a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1497
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:30.944
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're giving them access to a lot of </v>

1498
01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:37.511
<v Speaker 1>nasty stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I remember when I was a kid,</v>

1499
01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big thing was like faces of death.</v>

1500
01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>You want to go get faces a death man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll watch it.</v>

1501
01:08:42.681 --> 01:08:43.514
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They beat up a monkey and cut his head </v>

1502
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:47.660
<v Speaker 1>off and eat the brains and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1503
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:49.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of fake.</v>

1504
01:08:49.131 --> 01:08:49.964
<v Speaker 1>And you could tell the stage things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the only real stuff was a like </v>

1620
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:09.720
<v Speaker 1>that came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you bring a black man to</v>

1621
01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:12.790
<v Speaker 1>the kkk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have fucking kkk,</v>

1622
01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:15.040
<v Speaker 1>rally planned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rally going on and there's a part of the</v>

1623
01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:15.874
<v Speaker 1>game where you have to infiltrate what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when you bring a black guy at </v>

1624
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:21.920
<v Speaker 1>different happened really the clan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't freak out.</v>

1625
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in particular,</v>

1626
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 1>but the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the mission here is to just kill</v>

1627
01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:27.994
<v Speaker 1>all the klan guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you join up and I'll have </v>

1628
01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:31.024
<v Speaker 1>a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be more realistic is if you </v>

1629
01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:37.240
<v Speaker 1>brought a black guy to the clan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean they tried to kill the black guy.</v>

1630
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1631
01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 1>But that would be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be crazy.</v>

1632
01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:41.733
<v Speaker 1>There are some weird parts in it where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very misogynistic because it's </v>

1633
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:49.180
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be like 1899 or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very misogynistic.</v>

1634
01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some race references </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they make that are kind of like,</v>

1635
01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.560
<v Speaker 1>oof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oof.</v>

1636
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.120
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bold.</v>

1637
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they say about black guy?</v>

1638
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll call them boy in some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1639
01:15:00.671 --> 01:15:01.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1640
01:15:01.441 --> 01:15:02.274
<v Speaker 1>when a guy like a non player character </v>
<v Speaker 1>will pass by and be kind of nasty and </v>

1641
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never presented in a good way.</v>

1642
01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.081
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1643
01:15:09.081 --> 01:15:09.611
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

1644
01:15:09.611 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 1>this guy's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1645
01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it's always some scumbag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A character.</v>

1646
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

1647
01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like the last frontier for chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1648
01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

1649
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:20.044
<v Speaker 1>And I think because there's such a lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of awareness on the part of a lot of </v>

1650
01:15:23.831 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1651
01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I get games the day they come and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually before I get alpha testing,</v>

1652
01:15:29.381 --> 01:15:32.710
<v Speaker 1>beta testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing the games months before they</v>

1653
01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:33.430
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1654
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:34.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1655
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I get it on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1656
01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you sign up for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1657
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:39.963
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate package on origin or steam </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get access to the games when </v>

1658
01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:45.820
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're testing them.</v>

1659
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Mostly just pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:15:47.111 --> 01:15:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pay thing.</v>

1661
01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they want to make some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some money and I want to play.</v>

1662
01:15:51.011 --> 01:15:54.430
<v Speaker 1>The games are really busting your report</v>
<v Speaker 1>bugs and things on.</v>

1663
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:56.093
<v Speaker 1>If you just play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they automatically kind of have </v>

1665
01:15:58.451 --> 01:15:59.284
<v Speaker 1>something in place that will let them </v>
<v Speaker 1>know if there's a problem or you can </v>

1666
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.170
<v Speaker 1>email them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey there,</v>

1667
01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I died and I'm stuck in a rock now up to</v>

1668
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:07.354
<v Speaker 1>my waist.</v>

1669
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever talked to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that make those things?</v>

1670
01:16:09.501 --> 01:16:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever have them on your show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laszlo works at rockstar.</v>

1671
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.910
<v Speaker 1>He's a sound engineer guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He records all the sound,</v>

1672
01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:16.744
<v Speaker 1>but he's involved in every aspect of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those games from the beginning of grand </v>

1673
01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:23.740
<v Speaker 1>theft auto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first red dead redemption two.</v>

1674
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1675
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:26.283
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to rockstar in New York and </v>

1676
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:33.540
<v Speaker 1>took a tour of the place and it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of fucking nerds sitting around.</v>

1677
01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:34.700
<v Speaker 1>They have a day where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1678
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you can bring your dogs in and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide open.</v>

1679
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.943
<v Speaker 1>No cubicles or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys that run it are these english </v>

1680
01:16:41.651 --> 01:16:45.190
<v Speaker 1>guys and they're brilliant or New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand or something.</v>

1681
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:46.533
<v Speaker 1>They have that accent sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those weird accents that you </v>

1682
01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:51.520
<v Speaker 1>can't tell where it's from work insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

1683
01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1684
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.930
<v Speaker 1>They are dedicated like a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1685
01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:58.660
<v Speaker 1>like a rockstar game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gta or that.</v>

1686
01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:02.720
<v Speaker 1>It's so above other games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1687
01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:03.563
<v Speaker 1>like you can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played some shitty games where I </v>

1688
01:17:06.281 --> 01:17:07.114
<v Speaker 1>download it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped playing and within five </v>

1689
01:17:08.381 --> 01:17:09.620
<v Speaker 1>minutes I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1690
01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:11.210
<v Speaker 1>this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it just,</v>

1691
01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sucks.</v>

1692
01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And rockstar games or just,</v>

1693
01:17:14.811 --> 01:17:16.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like I'm doing a spot for him,</v>

1694
01:17:16.281 --> 01:17:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so above everything else.</v>

1695
01:17:19.371 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 1>The animation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1696
01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:21.813
<v Speaker 1>the sandbox quality where you're able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just run around and do shit like that's </v>

1697
01:17:25.611 --> 01:17:26.444
<v Speaker 1>an appeal that I don't like feeling like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on a track in a game and a </v>

1698
01:17:30.531 --> 01:17:35.531
<v Speaker 1>certain games are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a call of duty is very track based,</v>

1699
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:36.824
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play online a lot against other </v>

1700
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:40.010
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're small maps,</v>

1701
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.430
<v Speaker 1>but a game like that you could just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>off if you want to.</v>

1702
01:17:43.431 --> 01:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>You could just spend time fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could just get tackle and go to</v>

1703
01:17:47.841 --> 01:17:49.880
<v Speaker 1>a lake and fish and catch fish.</v>

1704
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 1>You catch fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

1705
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:52.904
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just spend eight hours just </v>

1706
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:55.430
<v Speaker 1>catching fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fishing,</v>

1707
01:17:55.431 --> 01:17:56.810
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could go out and hunt.</v>

1708
01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that you track like the bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1709
01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and that motherfucker can you saw like </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get you a.</v>

1710
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 1>I love games like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love open ended games.</v>

1711
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I always liked that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when I was um,</v>

1712
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:09.660
<v Speaker 1>back in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1713
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.513
<v Speaker 1>my cousin got a atari 800 computer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it had a cartridge for a game called </v>

1714
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:17.203
<v Speaker 1>star raiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was right after star wars came </v>

1715
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:20.474
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was fascinated because it wasn't </v>

1716
01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:26.660
<v Speaker 1>just a joystick and a button that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got on an arcade game,</v>

1717
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:27.523
<v Speaker 1>it was you used the keyboard like for </v>
<v Speaker 1>warp drive or you had a dock with a </v>

1718
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:37.370
<v Speaker 1>space station at one point and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going in orbit around a planet.</v>

1719
01:18:37.371 --> 01:18:40.340
<v Speaker 1>LIke there was all these things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>used the keyboard for.</v>

1720
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.173
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like just a running gun </v>

1721
01:18:43.611 --> 01:18:44.444
<v Speaker 1>type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like being able to use a lot of </v>

1722
01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:48.470
<v Speaker 1>different keys and have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

1723
01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.510
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you spend playing video</v>
<v Speaker 1>games?</v>

1724
01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm getting the impression it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

1725
01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:55.013
<v Speaker 1>There have been days where I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekends or something where I have </v>

1726
01:18:57.921 --> 01:19:01.910
<v Speaker 1>played from maybe 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM till 3:00</v>

<v Speaker 1>AM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 12,</v>

1728
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.640
<v Speaker 1>13 hours of playing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no eating.</v>

1729
01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's playing viDeo games like I'll be </v>

1733
01:19:17.661 --> 01:19:18.494
<v Speaker 1>playing on the computer and that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of me on the table I was talking </v>

1734
01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:23.420
<v Speaker 1>about in the living room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the big screen tv,</v>

1735
01:19:23.421 --> 01:19:27.500
<v Speaker 1>which is in front of me on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sitting in like a folding chair with</v>

1736
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:31.340
<v Speaker 1>a tv tray playing red dead redemption on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the xbox.</v>

1737
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.930
<v Speaker 1>So occasionally look back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1738
01:19:35.931 --> 01:19:36.764
<v Speaker 1>you got to see this great kills a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a funny video of a couple engaging in </v>

1739
01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:45.310
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality and they're having sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the girls blowing the guy.</v>

1740
01:19:45.311 --> 01:19:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And then the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joeY diaz comes in the room.</v>

1741
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:54.800
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a.</v>

1742
01:19:54.801 --> 01:19:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Well there is vr porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have You checked that out?</v>

1743
01:19:57.170 --> 01:19:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting there.</v>

1744
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some that is pretty amazing.</v>

1745
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Like a girl Will come up like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>laying on your back and a girl is in the</v>

1746
01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:11.514
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She takes her clothes off and comes up </v>

1747
01:20:13.321 --> 01:20:17.890
<v Speaker 1>on you and gets right by your ear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whisper something and,</v>

1748
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:21.270
<v Speaker 1>and you hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost feel the breath on you.</v>

1749
01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:23.710
<v Speaker 1>It's that fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1750
01:20:23.711 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you can reach and touch,</v>

1751
01:20:26.581 --> 01:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no one there.</v>

1752
01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:29.071
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1753
01:20:29.071 --> 01:20:32.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't even get close to showing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like on a regular flat screen,</v>

1754
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but when you put that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real space.</v>

1755
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:37.103
<v Speaker 1>It's three d and they look pretty real </v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from the resolution difference </v>

1756
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.800
<v Speaker 1>because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you magnify something that close to</v>

1757
01:20:43.801 --> 01:20:45.810
<v Speaker 1>your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pixels get bigger too.</v>

1758
01:20:45.811 --> 01:20:50.520
<v Speaker 1>So it's not quite there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could see where that's going.</v>

1759
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:53.520
<v Speaker 1>You get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of those fucking flashlights.</v>

1760
01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:57.733
<v Speaker 3>I used a really early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really early version of the htc vive </v>

1761
01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.720
<v Speaker 3>many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>duncan had one,</v>

1762
01:21:02.721 --> 01:21:06.920
<v Speaker 3>my friend duncan trussell had one in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>house and it was really pixelated and it</v>

1763
01:21:06.921 --> 01:21:07.754
<v Speaker 3>was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a real simple game and it </v>

1764
01:21:10.251 --> 01:21:11.084
<v Speaker 3>was real blocky looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like like old doom or </v>

1765
01:21:13.251 --> 01:21:16.700
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was in complete three dimensions.</v>

1766
01:21:16.701 --> 01:21:18.500
<v Speaker 3>And so I was looking up and looking all </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1767
01:21:18.501 --> 01:21:18.861
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1768
01:21:18.861 --> 01:21:19.694
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I went back to his place like </v>

1769
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:25.740
<v Speaker 3>two years later and there had been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic leap and them.</v>

1770
01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.790
<v Speaker 3>And now the leap is sort of balanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1771
01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:31.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't gotten that much better.</v>

1772
01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Right yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:33.543
<v Speaker 1>There are a few games that I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing on the oculus because it's like </v>

1775
01:21:38.921 --> 01:21:42.250
<v Speaker 1>flying games are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1776
01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.520
<v Speaker 1>and if you have a Really good system </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a duel 10,</v>

1777
01:21:47.651 --> 01:21:48.484
<v Speaker 1>80 ti I graphics cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them is insane to have and my </v>

1778
01:21:53.231 --> 01:21:56.660
<v Speaker 1>assistant has two of them and so I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>run everything on ultrasound.</v>

1779
01:21:56.730 --> 01:21:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you prefer videos on a computer?</v>

1780
01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1781
01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer a pc,</v>

1782
01:22:01.941 --> 01:22:03.900
<v Speaker 1>But I'll play on xbox and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1783
01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:05.640
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1784
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible with a controller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1785
01:22:07.551 --> 01:22:08.384
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mouse and a keyboard is so much more </v>

1786
01:22:09.861 --> 01:22:11.160
<v Speaker 1>precise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a.</v>

1787
01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say I,</v>

1788
01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.760
<v Speaker 1>if anyone ever argues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1789
01:22:13.761 --> 01:22:16.220
<v Speaker 1>I've never missed a folder on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>desktop.</v>

1790
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I've never gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

1791
01:22:18.051 --> 01:22:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something called a,</v>

1792
01:22:21.391 --> 01:22:22.224
<v Speaker 1>an ap zim apex that you plug into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>xbox or playstation and then plug </v>

1793
01:22:27.921 --> 01:22:28.754
<v Speaker 1>keyboard mouse into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're runnIng on xbox with a keyboard </v>

1794
01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:33.950
<v Speaker 1>and mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1795
01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I destroy people,</v>

1796
01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:38.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I play on that because it's more </v>

1797
01:22:39.711 --> 01:22:40.544
<v Speaker 1>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more accuracy and you're just </v>

1798
01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:44.630
<v Speaker 1>quick reflexes and yeah,</v>

1799
01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:49.900
<v Speaker 3>from the online video game days of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>early two thousands and the nineties,</v>

1800
01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:51.280
<v Speaker 3>like it was always.</v>

1801
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1802
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Mouse and keyboard was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was It a console was for babies?</v>

1803
01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.630
<v Speaker 1>They weren't good back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now curious.</v>

1804
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:01.300
<v Speaker 1>He was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1805
01:23:01.301 --> 01:23:02.134
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1806
01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 1>when I play some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1807
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:07.780
<v Speaker 1>like combat flying games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have things now that are,</v>

1808
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 1>you look like you're in the cockpit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>

1809
01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:11.613
<v Speaker 1>All the gauges work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have reflectIons of light coming </v>

1810
01:23:14.351 --> 01:23:16.450
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the ground looks amazing.</v>

1811
01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And in vr when you pull the stick back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and turn,</v>

1812
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.300
<v Speaker 1>because I use a joy stick and throttle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1813
01:23:23.301 --> 01:23:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1814
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.473
<v Speaker 1>you can look over your shoulder and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing your wing and the ground </v>

1815
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:31.420
<v Speaker 1>and you're pulling back and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>dizzy.</v>

1816
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Like you get so fucking dizzy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashes are startling.</v>

1817
01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Like like if you lose control and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>plow into the ground,</v>

1818
01:23:41.690 --> 01:23:45.220
<v Speaker 1>you kind of jump because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

1819
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.054
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's that primal part of your </v>

1820
01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:49.540
<v Speaker 1>head going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like accepting what it's seeing.</v>

1821
01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there would be a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to learn how to fly.</v>

1822
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:53.343
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it would be that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stole that plane up in portland </v>

1823
01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:00.750
<v Speaker 1>recently slammed into the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1824
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:01.783
<v Speaker 1>killed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he learned how to fly on a </v>

1825
01:24:03.641 --> 01:24:04.474
<v Speaker 1>simulator flight simulator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft flight simulator x is like </v>

1826
01:24:08.891 --> 01:24:09.724
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was doing like loop de loops in </v>

1827
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:12.760
<v Speaker 1>the sky and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1828
01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:13.594
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we could do a loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was saying I'm going to kill </v>

1829
01:24:15.371 --> 01:24:16.060
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1830
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:16.691
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1831
01:24:16.691 --> 01:24:17.321
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1832
01:24:17.321 --> 01:24:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a,</v>

1833
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to do a loop and then knows it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and call it a day what a maniac.</v>

1834
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:28.450
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that he could get access </v>
<v Speaker 1>and take off like that is kind of scary.</v>

1835
01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all think,</v>

1836
01:24:29.741 --> 01:24:30.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1837
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:31.143
<v Speaker 1>everything so secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when we thought there were like </v>

1838
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:36.880
<v Speaker 1>missiles on the roof of the white house </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the pentagon and stuff,</v>

1839
01:24:36.881 --> 01:24:37.900
<v Speaker 1>and then after nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 and I.</v>

1840
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:38.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess not.</v>

1841
01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that was all bullshit.</v>

1842
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:45.040
<v Speaker 1>The actual pentagon got hit by a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>

1843
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:49.060
<v Speaker 1>although now you're going to get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people writing this play,</v>

1844
01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:50.800
<v Speaker 1>bro was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a mitchell.</v>

1845
01:24:50.801 --> 01:24:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a gatekeeper.</v>

1846
01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.440
<v Speaker 1>You're a shill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shill for the eu.</v>

1847
01:24:56.441 --> 01:24:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

1848
01:24:58.691 --> 01:24:58.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1849
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.050
<v Speaker 1>who does your show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a flat earth or eddie bravo.</v>

1850
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Eddie bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1851
01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's still a flutter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might've abandoned.</v>

1852
01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:06.304
<v Speaker 1>He might've moved on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me think that still he thought the </v>

1853
01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:13.030
<v Speaker 1>earth is a disk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he said,</v>

1854
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't want to misinterpret </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's saying.</v>

1855
01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to misrepresent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was saying he doesn't know,</v>

1856
01:25:18.610 --> 01:25:19.443
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't believe nasa because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>only someone's word over history and he </v>

1857
01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:27.640
<v Speaker 1>likes that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks it's fun.</v>

1858
01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.060
<v Speaker 1>He just conspiracies.</v>

1859
01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they are.</v>

1860
01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are kind of fun.</v>

1861
01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:33.243
<v Speaker 1>But that flat earth one I realized I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing with flat earthers on twitter </v>

1862
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:38.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's when I really started going </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1863
01:25:38.291 --> 01:25:38.681
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1864
01:25:38.681 --> 01:25:41.080
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing?</v>

1865
01:25:41.081 --> 01:25:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Why am I engaging that debt is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbest version of I know you are,</v>

1866
01:25:45.161 --> 01:25:48.010
<v Speaker 1>but what am I for the rest of time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1867
01:25:48.011 --> 01:25:49.270
<v Speaker 1>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That argument is,</v>

1868
01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

1869
01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.173
<v Speaker 1>I was talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was arguing with somebody and then I </v>

1870
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:54.753
<v Speaker 1>had my show to do and I'm neil degrasse </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyson was taping his show in my studio </v>

1871
01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 1>before I came on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was in the lobby when I was in our</v>

1872
01:26:04.281 --> 01:26:05.114
<v Speaker 1>greenroom when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was on and I started talking </v>

1873
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.090
<v Speaker 1>about it and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1874
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.800
<v Speaker 1>let's get someone in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that might have a,</v>

1875
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.410
<v Speaker 1>an opinion on this.</v>

1876
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse tyson coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he gets shit all the time</v>

1877
01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:18.700
<v Speaker 1>from flat earthers saying that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1879
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.120
<v Speaker 1>it all started off as a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to just like everything else.</v>

1880
01:26:23.121 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 1>But it started off on four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chan did it like free bleeding.</v>

1881
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:29.210

<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1882
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People explain that to people don't know</v>

1883
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:33.163
<v Speaker 1>free bleeding is a woMan's rights thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a instead of using a tampon </v>

1884
01:26:37.581 --> 01:26:38.414
<v Speaker 1>during their period or a pad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just bleed through their pants and </v>

1885
01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 1>show it proudly that they will walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>around bleeding and it was never real.</v>

1886
01:26:45.621 --> 01:26:50.621
<v Speaker 1>It was neveR a real thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>people saw it and thought it was real.</v>

1887
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:51.763
<v Speaker 1>Like they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put it out there for chan and </v>

1888
01:26:53.481 --> 01:26:56.440
<v Speaker 1>people actually believed and know not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just believed it started.</v>

1889
01:26:56.441 --> 01:26:57.910
<v Speaker 1>He started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1890
01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 1>They started doing it for real.</v>

1891
01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 1>They turned it into something women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>

1892
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:04.183
<v Speaker 1>badge of honor to have a pair of white </v>
<v Speaker 1>pants on with a giant patch of a </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Things that happen like that.</v>

1896
01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:20.450
<v Speaker 1>UnfortunatelY it turned out to be goofs.</v>

1962
01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.293
<v Speaker 1>and so over the top that it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the way to get beaten </v>

1963
01:30:14.101 --> 01:30:14.934
<v Speaker 1>into this gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this club was that you had to recite </v>

1964
01:30:17.431 --> 01:30:21.530
<v Speaker 1>five breakfast cereals while the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>members punched you and,</v>

1965
01:30:21.531 --> 01:30:24.390
<v Speaker 1>and they would keep punching you until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you spit a soul.</v>

1966
01:30:24.391 --> 01:30:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ridiculous.</v>

1967
01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Such parody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1968
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:33.350
<v Speaker 1>and slowly this fucking thing mutated </v>
<v Speaker 1>into some.</v>

1969
01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It got more members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1970
01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:39.760
<v Speaker 1>they started wearing one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirts,</v>

1971
01:30:39.761 --> 01:30:43.290
<v Speaker 1>the with the yellow car Piping on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collar and stuff.</v>

1972
01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a specific shirt that became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniform,</v>

1973
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:46.853
<v Speaker 1>perry ellis perry ellis shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a specific black shirt with gold piping </v>

1974
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.750
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the collar and,</v>

1975
01:30:53.751 --> 01:30:54.310
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1976
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:57.210
<v Speaker 1>the sleeves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that became like the uniform.</v>

1977
01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:02.880
<v Speaker 1>And because it was presented as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chauvinist club,</v>

1978
01:31:02.881 --> 01:31:04.590
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like girls are allowed,</v>

1979
01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.560
<v Speaker 1>minorities are allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter who you are,</v>

1980
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:08.543
<v Speaker 1>but in essence it is a guy thing and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>will talk shit about girls and we're </v>

1981
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 1>going to drink and get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a men thing.</v>

1982
01:31:16.770 --> 01:31:19.050
<v Speaker 1>So they started getting together at </v>
<v Speaker 1>bars,</v>

1983
01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the area in manhattan.</v>

1984
01:31:20.911 --> 01:31:21.744
<v Speaker 1>And how is this organized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's organized through his compound </v>

1985
01:31:24.121 --> 01:31:26.290
<v Speaker 1>media show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the compound media show,</v>

1986
01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:29.490
<v Speaker 1>his own twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an facebook,</v>

1987
01:31:29.491 --> 01:31:34.380
<v Speaker 1>which he subsequently lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's persona non grata on social media,</v>

1988
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:35.753
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it never was supposed to go any </v>

1989
01:31:39.721 --> 01:31:40.554
<v Speaker 1>further than that.</v>

1990
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Gavin himself didn't really take it any </v>
<v Speaker 1>further than that.</v>

1991
01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:45.203
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get together every so often we </v>

1992
01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:47.880
<v Speaker 1>have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We drink,</v>

1993
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:49.050
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like that.</v>

1994
01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Well then this whole thing with politics</v>
<v Speaker 1>got involved because antifa,</v>

1995
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:57.730
<v Speaker 1>which antifascist started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1996
01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:58.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming into a conservatives that wanted </v>

1997
01:32:02.690 --> 01:32:03.523
<v Speaker 1>to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So gavin was conservative as </v>

1998
01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:06.163
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd get speaking engagements at </v>

1999
01:32:07.841 --> 01:32:10.480
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nyu or,</v>

2000
01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:11.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2001
01:32:11.531 --> 01:32:11.890
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2002
01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:12.723
<v Speaker 1>numerous places around New York city and</v>
<v Speaker 1>antifa would show up to protest him and </v>

2003
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:17.734
<v Speaker 1>try to shut down the event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the proud boys would go and </v>

2004
01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:22.474
<v Speaker 1>protect gavin so he wouldn't get harmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing these speaking engagements and </v>

2005
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.193
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it turned into this because </v>

2006
01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.940
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting with antifa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must be the fall,</v>

2007
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.880
<v Speaker 1>the fascists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nazis.</v>

2008
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once that gets out there,</v>

2009
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.593
<v Speaker 1>there's no pulling it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could try to explain how you're not </v>

2010
01:32:43.451 --> 01:32:45.910
<v Speaker 1>a nazi till you're blue in the face.</v>

2011
01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:47.043
<v Speaker 1>It ain't going away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially because it's a good </v>

2012
01:32:49.031 --> 01:32:50.860
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The press likes it.</v>

2013
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:54.110
<v Speaker 1>It's this good versus evil thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They present antifa.</v>

2014
01:32:54.111 --> 01:32:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I like their protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always call them and the protesters</v>

2015
01:32:57.401 --> 01:32:59.470
<v Speaker 1>were beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their fucking violent,</v>

2016
01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.900
<v Speaker 1>violent group of people that are there </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2017
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 1>to hit people they don't agree with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>silence people that want to speak.</v>

2018
01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:06.573
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 1>gavin and ann coulter and milo </v>

2019
01:33:10.241 --> 01:33:11.600
<v Speaker 1>yiannopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2020
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.650
<v Speaker 1>a ben shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2021
01:33:13.651 --> 01:33:17.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these conservative people can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to these venues and speak.</v>

2022
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:21.130
<v Speaker 1>They get shut down because of a violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people called antifa.</v>

2023
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.800
<v Speaker 1>So proud boys were kind of the answer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2024
01:33:23.801 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 1>So gavin can go around and actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2025
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:29.530
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when that happened,</v>

2026
01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:33.940
<v Speaker 1>more people came on board because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of liked to beat people up.</v>

2027
01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:36.970
<v Speaker 1>When you have a gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of people,</v>

2028
01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:38.133
<v Speaker 1>and one of their missions is now to beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>up people you don't agree with </v>

2029
01:33:41.591 --> 01:33:42.210
<v Speaker 1>politically.</v>

2030
01:33:42.210 --> 01:33:44.940
<v Speaker 3>When there was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's tiers to the membership.</v>

2031
01:33:44.941 --> 01:33:45.774
<v Speaker 3>Like the highest tier was you fought for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cause to actually get into a </v>

2032
01:33:48.811 --> 01:33:49.680
<v Speaker 3>fistfight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2033
01:33:49.681 --> 01:33:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure gavin thought was like,</v>

2034
01:33:51.570 --> 01:33:53.220
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to gavin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like gavin,</v>

2035
01:33:53.221 --> 01:33:54.054
<v Speaker 3>I've had gavin on the podcasts and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last time I had them on I didn't know </v>

2036
01:33:57.121 --> 01:33:57.954
<v Speaker 3>what this whole thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he was explaining the proud boys </v>

2037
01:34:00.810 --> 01:34:02.670
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking to me about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to punch them.</v>

2038
01:34:02.671 --> 01:34:03.900
<v Speaker 3>We're going to punch people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2040
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:05.303
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2041
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:08.460
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you know you can't just punch people</v>

2042
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:09.383
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they punched back and then you get mad </v>

2043
01:34:11.431 --> 01:34:13.530
<v Speaker 3>that you punched them in and they shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>you when you get out of your car.</v>

2044
01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:16.650
<v Speaker 3>This escalates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't just take it.</v>

2045
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never supposed to be an offensive</v>

2046
01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.100
<v Speaker 1>punching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2047
01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:21.973
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I would speak to gavin and every </v>

2048
01:34:23.091 --> 01:34:25.520
<v Speaker 1>example I would see it was an answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

2049
01:34:25.521 --> 01:34:26.354
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have violence perpetrated on </v>

2050
01:34:27.441 --> 01:34:27.740
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2051
01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.573
<v Speaker 3>Proper context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all bald needed to say is he's </v>

2052
01:34:31.351 --> 01:34:32.850
<v Speaker 3>calling for violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2053
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's what they've said about gavin</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over again,</v>

2054
01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.090
<v Speaker 3>taking things out of context and use it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a gamble.</v>

2055
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:39.183
<v Speaker 1>The other problem being that the antifa </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are a lot of skinny dudes and </v>

2056
01:34:45.341 --> 01:34:47.770
<v Speaker 1>chicks with masks on and they</v>

2057
01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.333
<v Speaker 3>that adept at fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a horrible video of this one </v>

2058
01:34:51.710 --> 01:34:52.543
<v Speaker 3>antifa guy tries to hit someone with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like some kind of a stick or a </v>

2059
01:34:55.401 --> 01:34:56.270
<v Speaker 3>pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2060
01:34:56.271 --> 01:34:58.610
<v Speaker 3>And the guy it and fucking</v>

2061
01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.350
<v Speaker 2>blasted him on the chin and fucking put </v>
<v Speaker 2>him down.</v>

2062
01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.240
<v Speaker 2>His head bounces off the concrete </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious,</v>

2063
01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 2>which is a whole lot of people die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2064
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:08.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2065
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:09.790
<v Speaker 2>That's how people die in fights like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2066
01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.930
<v Speaker 2>he killed them with his bare hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2067
01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:13.250
<v Speaker 2>He hit his fucking head on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit his head on the concrete.</v>

2068
01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:16.100
<v Speaker 2>You got hit by the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally the world,</v>

2069
01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.193
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2070
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The budge it.</v>

2071

<v Speaker 2>the head.</v>

2072
01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:25.250
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people have this idea that they're</v>

2073
01:35:25.251 --> 01:35:27.410
<v Speaker 2>going to go places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to shut everybody down and</v>

2074
01:35:27.411 --> 01:35:28.244
<v Speaker 2>because they're in a group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to scream and yell and hit </v>

2075
01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:32.860
<v Speaker 2>people with bike locks and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that y'all seen.</v>

2076
01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Weird thing is that that's from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

2077
01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:38.270
<v Speaker 2>That was never from the left before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid.</v>

2078
01:35:38.271 --> 01:35:39.104
<v Speaker 2>I grew up when I was eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from eight slash seven slash 11 during </v>

2079
01:35:41.571 --> 01:35:42.404
<v Speaker 2>the Vietnam war.</v>

2080
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.333
<v Speaker 2>I lived in san francisco and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the real hippies and I remember </v>

2081
01:35:45.981 --> 01:35:46.814
<v Speaker 2>being a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that moment of times like a </v>

2082
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.900
<v Speaker 2>flower children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2083
01:35:50.901 --> 01:35:55.901
<v Speaker 2>they were the hippies and the lefties </v>
<v Speaker 2>were were love and peace and no violence</v>

2084
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.823
<v Speaker 2>and everyone was doing acid and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all on adderall and they're </v>

2085
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:03.320
<v Speaker 2>hitting people with bike locks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2086
01:36:03.321 --> 01:36:04.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different thing.</v>

2087
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
<v Speaker 2>There was a time where the liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hippies,</v>

2088
01:36:08.001 --> 01:36:08.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2089
01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:10.123
<v Speaker 2>they were the ones that when there would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a demonstration and the national </v>

2090
01:36:14.151 --> 01:36:16.430
<v Speaker 2>guard would show up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be putting flowers in.</v>

2091
01:36:16.431 --> 01:36:18.830
<v Speaker 2>The barrels of the guns are famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of that,</v>

2092
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:19.873
<v Speaker 2>and then kent state was a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippies literally getting shot by the </v>

2093
01:36:24.141 --> 01:36:24.974
<v Speaker 2>national guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the national guard that has completely </v>

2094
01:36:28.101 --> 01:36:31.670
<v Speaker 2>flipped around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the weirdest thing and I don't know</v>

2095
01:36:31.671 --> 01:36:33.710
<v Speaker 2>how it got distinguished.</v>

2096
01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:34.543
<v Speaker 2>We're proud boys became this evil group </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people and an antifa is the good </v>

2097
01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:41.840
<v Speaker 2>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I understand that.</v>

2098
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:42.703
<v Speaker 2>Proud boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a proud boys were infiltrated by white </v>

2099
01:36:45.111 --> 01:36:47.090
<v Speaker 2>nationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nazi,</v>

2100
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 2>white supremacist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

2101
01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:51.770
<v Speaker 2>but those were constantly being </v>
<v Speaker 2>disavowed by gavin.</v>

2102
01:36:51.771 --> 01:36:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Gavin never wanted any of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

2103
01:36:54.581 --> 01:36:56.930
<v Speaker 2>but is there a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you get in though?</v>

2104
01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is my.</v>

2105
01:36:58.611 --> 01:36:59.444
<v Speaker 2>You saw my last comedy special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my criticism of a vegans is not </v>

2106
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:06.560
<v Speaker 2>that there's anything wrong with being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegan,</v>

2107
01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 2>is that when you have a group where </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody can join,</v>

2108
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.990
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking idiots.</v>

2109
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:16.210
<v Speaker 2>If you have a million people for sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have 100,000</v>

2110
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no getting around that.</v>

2111
01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you have a group where anybody can</v>

2112
01:37:21.261 --> 01:37:23.660
<v Speaker 2>join and you have a million people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that group,</v>

2113
01:37:23.730 --> 01:37:24.563
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking fucking idiots and those people </v>

2114
01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:28.424
<v Speaker 2>are going to define your group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst behavior in that group is </v>

2115
01:37:30.561 --> 01:37:32.840
<v Speaker 2>where people are going to call too as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

2116
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:33.703
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is also a symptom of the </v>

2117
01:37:35.301 --> 01:37:36.134
<v Speaker 2>social media era today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with twitter because you </v>

2118
01:37:38.631 --> 01:37:42.860
<v Speaker 2>can't express yourself and explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>things 140 or 280 characters.</v>

2119
01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:45.110
<v Speaker 2>It just takes too much time so they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2120
01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:46.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proud boys,</v>

2121
01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:51.140

<v Speaker 2>and they'll always racist gum back nazi.</v>

2122
01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative and everybody keeps pushing it</v>

2123
01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>and the videos of people punching</v>

2124
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.150
<v Speaker 1>little skinny people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2125
01:37:57.151 --> 01:37:58.830
<v Speaker 1>look at these people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>these fucking assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gavin's an asshole.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2128
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:06.120
<v Speaker 1>that's what it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it presented a.</v>

2129
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:07.463
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ask how it starts and how it grows </v>

2130
01:38:09.061 --> 01:38:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and how you become a member by buying a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shirt,</v>

2131
01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.313
<v Speaker 1>by buying a perry ellis shirt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening a chapter to their chapters </v>

2132
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.990
<v Speaker 1>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it.</v>

2133
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>supposed to get to that point and </v>

2137
01:38:31.261 --> 01:38:36.261
<v Speaker 1>regardless of how these people act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it now reflects on gavin.</v>

2138
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:37.583
<v Speaker 1>Even though he wanted to hang out in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar with a few people do is public </v>

2140
01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:45.183
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see the way the media manipulates </v>

2141
01:38:46.981 --> 01:38:47.814
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been party to it myself and I've </v>

<v Speaker 1>just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you know he didn't </v>

<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

2195
01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a lot of mistakes </v>

2198
01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>of blurring the lines between parody and</v>

<v Speaker 2>but people need to understand.</v>

2212
01:41:53.951 --> 01:41:58.270

<v Speaker 2>wearing.</v>

2216
01:42:05.051 --> 01:42:06.970
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look like they're wearing old tiMey</v>

2217
01:42:06.971 --> 01:42:07.804
<v Speaker 2>suits with the skinny ties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gavin mcinnes literally started that </v>

2218
01:42:11.801 --> 01:42:12.634
<v Speaker 2>fashion trend in williamsburg and they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took off from there that the hipster </v>

2219
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:17.823
<v Speaker 2>dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people would dress with those </v>

2220
01:42:19.301 --> 01:42:23.110
<v Speaker 2>weird mustaches and all that shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally came out of gavin gavin,</v>

<v Speaker 2>which is amazing.</v>

2222
01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:27.003
<v Speaker 2>He is a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something like magnetic about </v>

2223
01:42:31.661 --> 01:42:34.960
<v Speaker 2>the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is what a cult leader is like.</v>

2224
01:42:34.961 --> 01:42:35.794
<v Speaker 2>He could Just start a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in essence by accident he did </v>

2225
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:43.760
<v Speaker 2>between the hipsters and then this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys like,</v>

2226
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I like gavin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you start?</v>

2227
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you start a cult where you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fuck the people's wives.</v>

2228
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why do you go with.</v>

2229
01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:52.433
<v Speaker 2>We also did some really good interviews </v>
<v Speaker 2>online where he would trIck these </v>

2230
01:42:57.011 --> 01:42:57.844
<v Speaker 2>leftists into sitting down with him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews and then along the way there </v>

2231
01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:06.160
<v Speaker 2>we're having this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be exposed that he didn't agree</v>

2232
01:43:06.161 --> 01:43:06.994
<v Speaker 2>with them at all and they were trapped </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this hardcore feminist got trapped </v>

2233
01:43:10.391 --> 01:43:11.224
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of other people get trapped in </v>

2234
01:43:12.821 --> 01:43:16.000
<v Speaker 2>this room with him and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realized like halfway,</v>

2235
01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:18.650
<v Speaker 2>like some of the line of questioning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he's approaching things.</v>

2236
01:43:18.651 --> 01:43:19.990
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

2237
01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:22.750
<v Speaker 2>he's an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very interesting.</v>

2238
01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.460
<v Speaker 2>And outside of this voice thing of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

2239
01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.950
<v Speaker 2>never invented that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never did any of that.</v>

2240
01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.750
<v Speaker 2>He would be doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:29.584
<v Speaker 2>Although he had a problem with one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his own companies that he made </v>

2242
01:43:32.561 --> 01:43:36.380
<v Speaker 2>after vice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bought them out of vice because uh,</v>

2243
01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:41.470
<v Speaker 2>shane turned more liberal and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2244
01:43:41.471 --> 01:43:44.410
<v Speaker 2>they weren't really a meshing anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>over their advice.</v>

2245
01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:47.230
<v Speaker 2>So they kind of just bought out a gavin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2246
01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:49.420
<v Speaker 2>he got a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to do his own thing.</v>

2247
01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:50.290
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2248
01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>had an firm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

2249
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.710
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2250
01:43:52.710 --> 01:43:53.543
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he got the boot from that for </v>

2251
01:43:55.701 --> 01:43:56.534
<v Speaker 3>making a trans gender comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll use opinion on transgender people </v>

2252
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:02.560
<v Speaker 3>have mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental health issue.</v>

2253
01:44:02.561 --> 01:44:05.540
<v Speaker 3>And he was brInging up all these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem.</v>

2254
01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:06.613
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying some things that are </v>

2255
01:44:08.271 --> 01:44:09.610
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2256
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Interspersed with again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday and sarcasm in his mind.</v>

2257
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:16.070
<v Speaker 3>This was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2258
01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 3>this is something you can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was in the public side,</v>

2259
01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.580
<v Speaker 3>particularly during the caitlyn jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>

2260
01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:25.100
<v Speaker 3>people had decided the transgender was </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

2261
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful.</v>

2262
01:44:26.541 --> 01:44:28.100
<v Speaker 3>She's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was saying,</v>

2263
01:44:28.101 --> 01:44:28.934
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are people that are menTally ill </v>

2264
01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:30.673
<v Speaker 3>and there's an a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a website that he was pointing </v>

2265
01:44:32.571 --> 01:44:33.404
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called transgender regrets </v>

2266
01:44:34.761 --> 01:44:35.594
<v Speaker 3>or something like that where they haVe </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these stories of all these men who </v>

2267
01:44:38.751 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 3>turned Into women and then turned back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to men again.</v>

2268
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Now they don't have dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2269
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.900
<v Speaker 3>they have to take testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 3>injections and they hate their life.</v>

2270
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:45.943
<v Speaker 3>And there's some of them who did it like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were in their sixties and now </v>

2271
01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.520
<v Speaker 3>now they're in their seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to be a man again.</v>

2272
01:44:50.521 --> 01:44:54.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that gender dysphoria was thought to</v>

2273
01:44:54.231 --> 01:44:57.680
<v Speaker 3>be a mental health issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anorexia,</v>

2274
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:59.420
<v Speaker 3>like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of other.</v>

2275
01:44:59.450 --> 01:45:02.900
<v Speaker 3>There's body dysphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people have weird,</v>

2276
01:45:02.901 --> 01:45:04.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2277
01:45:04.161 --> 01:45:05.440
<v Speaker 3>a bodybuilders credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2278
01:45:05.441 --> 01:45:07.130
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never think they're big enough.</v>

2279
01:45:07.890 --> 01:45:12.890
<v Speaker 3>You have like weird perceptions of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical presence in there and some,</v>

2280
01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:15.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a psychologist,</v>

2281
01:45:15.201 --> 01:45:16.034
<v Speaker 3>dr deborah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so who was discussing late onset gender </v>

2282
01:45:18.591 --> 01:45:22.160
<v Speaker 3>dysphoria in autistic girls that </v>
<v Speaker 3>autistic teenage girls,</v>

2283
01:45:22.161 --> 01:45:22.994
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel like they fit in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people can convince them that they're </v>

2284
01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:25.850
<v Speaker 3>actually a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2285
01:45:25.851 --> 01:45:28.150
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of them start taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones and,</v>

2286
01:45:28.151 --> 01:45:29.750
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and going through transition,</v>

2287
01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:34.040
<v Speaker 3>massive regrets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then unfortunately for women,</v>

2288

<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're a teenager and </v>

2289
01:45:36.261 --> 01:45:39.020
<v Speaker 3>you're going through puberty and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>take hormones,</v>

2290

<v Speaker 1>I can't blame anybody because I think </v>

2321
01:46:54.871 --> 01:46:59.871
<v Speaker 1>that having the security of a steady </v>
<v Speaker 1>paycheck as opposed to the guy that just</v>

2322
01:47:00.181 --> 01:47:02.950

2356
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not blaming jimmy or anything,</v>

2357
01:48:45.931 --> 01:48:47.940
<v Speaker 1>up the o and a show in time.</v>

2358
01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I think opie started resenting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of that comradery that me and</v>

2359
01:48:52.201 --> 01:48:54.030
<v Speaker 1>jimmy were having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2360
01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:54.893
<v Speaker 1>me and jimmy kind of slowly started </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling away and doing our own thing </v>

2361
01:48:58.170 --> 01:49:01.860
<v Speaker 1>like it was.</v>

2362
01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:02.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2363
01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:05.850
<v Speaker 1>the more twisted the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love sick humor.</v>

2364
01:49:05.851 --> 01:49:07.410
<v Speaker 1>He does too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we laugh.</v>

2365
01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:11.980
<v Speaker 1>We did a whole bit on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on like lacy peterson and Scott Peterson</v>

2366

<v Speaker 1>obviously he murdered his pregnant wife </v>

2368
01:49:16.171 --> 01:49:19.440
<v Speaker 1>and dumped in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could possibly be funny about that?</v>

2369
01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people wrote trIbute songs with this guy</v>

2370
01:49:22.801 --> 01:49:23.634
<v Speaker 1>wrote a tribute song to her and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one of these self centered </v>

2371
01:49:26.130 --> 01:49:29.580
<v Speaker 1>assholes that thought he was going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>viral by making a attributes.</v>

2372
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:31.103
<v Speaker 1>And we started changing the words to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>song to make it just horrible involving </v>

2373
01:49:35.701 --> 01:49:38.010
<v Speaker 1>seaweed and things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

2375
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:42.540

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.553
<v Speaker 1>like not really able to jump in or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of getting why we're laughing at </v>

2377
01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:49.550
<v Speaker 1>this sick shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2378
01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:53.010
<v Speaker 1>so it kind of pushed us further apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2379
01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:54.460
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>

2391
01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot more laid back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

2392
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I knew what real work was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked for fucking living.</v>

2393
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I did heating and air conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>installation and it was freezing cold in</v>

2394
01:50:31.481 --> 01:50:33.040
<v Speaker 1>the winter and boiling hot in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer.</v>

2395
01:50:33.041 --> 01:50:33.874
<v Speaker 1>And when I got that first gig and radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of opie and I'll always thank </v>

2396
01:50:37.661 --> 01:50:38.540
<v Speaker 1>him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2397
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:42.190
<v Speaker 1>I knew what it was like to work and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to fuck that up.</v>

2398
01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So I plasTered a smile on my face at </v>
<v Speaker 1>every turn and did the show four hours a</v>

2399
01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:48.724
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has someone at work that they </v>

2400
01:50:51.041 --> 01:50:54.490
<v Speaker 1>don't get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't leave the old fucking,</v>

2401
01:50:54.491 --> 01:50:56.020

<v Speaker 1>you just deal with it.</v>

2402
01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:56.993
<v Speaker 1>And that's eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had another 20 hours of the day that </v>

2403
01:50:59.141 --> 01:51:02.860
<v Speaker 1>didn't involve greg opi hughes so I </v>

<v Speaker 1>which I guess is healthy in a way.</v>

2406
01:51:10.150 --> 01:51:12.670
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't need to,</v>

2407
01:51:12.671 --> 01:51:14.380
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't text him.</v>

2442
01:52:35.021 --> 01:52:36.850
<v Speaker 1>if someone's pulled over on the side of </v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2480
01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:07.130
<v Speaker 1>came apart at the seams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think toward the end.</v>

2481
01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just had had it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to do a show with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2483
01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.930

<v Speaker 1>jimmy either.</v>

2484
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:18.810

<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to last long and they,</v>

2485
01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I was the buffer between the two of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2486
01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:23.330
<v Speaker 1>That ended bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really did.</v>

2487
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:26.090
<v Speaker 1>It really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2488
01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 1>have you talked to jimmy about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't,</v>

2489
01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:32.270
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't express that kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2490
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:33.583
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like jimmy's a very loyalty </v>

2491
01:54:35.781 --> 01:54:37.290
<v Speaker 1>driven guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2492
01:54:37.710 --> 01:54:42.470
<v Speaker 1>like he takes that very seriously and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>he feels somebody fucking with him,</v>

2493
01:54:42.471 --> 01:54:44.380
<v Speaker 1>he really gets pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2494
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:47.810
<v Speaker 1>usually it can get talked out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's cool after a little while.</v>

2495
01:54:48.150 --> 01:54:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one,</v>

2496
01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:50.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.670
<v Speaker 1>this work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2499
01:54:54.710 --> 01:54:55.543
<v Speaker 1>I think honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you guys interacted with each </v>

2500
01:54:58.071 --> 01:54:58.904
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was good for was sort of </v>

2501
01:54:59.841 --> 01:55:00.674
<v Speaker 1>directing the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the impression that I got and I </v>

2502
01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:04.730
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times I do the show?</v>

2503
01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:05.773
<v Speaker 1>Dozens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2504
01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2505
01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many times it did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2506
01:55:07.821 --> 01:55:08.654
<v Speaker 1>But I always felt like what he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>really well was sort of guide things </v>

2507
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:13.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit back more.</v>

2508
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Let you guys be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2509
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:17.630
<v Speaker 1>but guide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2510
01:55:17.631 --> 01:55:19.790
<v Speaker 1>figure out like maybe we need more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2511
01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:22.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe we need more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was real value to that.</v>

2512
01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:23.773
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that's fun when you go </v>

2513
01:55:25.611 --> 01:55:26.444
<v Speaker 1>out and do an appearance and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>clamoring about a bit that me and jimmy </v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2521
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:52.260

01:56:08.821 --> 01:56:12.800
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two magicians know and it,</v>

2533
01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:13.360
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2534
01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good movie,</v>

2535
01:56:14.761 --> 01:56:15.930
<v Speaker 1>but at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2536
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:18.780
<v Speaker 1>because he has to use a body double,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2537
01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:19.614
<v Speaker 1>the actual magician has to drop below </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage and the body double comes out </v>

2538
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:26.700
<v Speaker 1>and gets all the applause and he's under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage.</v>

2539
01:56:26.701 --> 01:56:27.534
<v Speaker 1>The real guy that did the whole act is </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the stage and he shuts his eyes </v>

2540
01:56:31.321 --> 01:56:32.154
<v Speaker 1>and puts his arms out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying to enjoy the adulation from </v>

2541
01:56:34.801 --> 01:56:37.770
<v Speaker 1>the fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even him getting it.</v>

2542
01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think that kind of mindset was </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2543
01:56:41.341 --> 01:56:42.174
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then resentment starts bubbling up </v>

2544
01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:50.240
<v Speaker 1>and you start doing things like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthony just got in,</v>

2545
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:53.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2546
01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:55.140
<v Speaker 1>you hold things over people's heads.</v>

2547
01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:59.220
<v Speaker 1>the contract negotiations were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare every time.</v>

2548
01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:02.190
<v Speaker 1>And opiate always wanted a one year </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

2549
01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

2550
01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's sign for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a shit?</v>

2551
01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:07.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they want to fire they're gonna fight</v>

2552
01:57:07.891 --> 01:57:09.660
<v Speaker 1>it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contract or not,</v>

2553
01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.380
<v Speaker 1>but let's lock them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if something happens,</v>

2554
01:57:13.381 --> 01:57:14.480
<v Speaker 1>at least we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2555
01:57:14.590 --> 01:57:17.640
<v Speaker 1>a settlement portion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can take half the,</v>

2556
01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:19.800
<v Speaker 1>what they owe us for five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

2557
01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:20.843
<v Speaker 1>Not one year deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I want because he always had </v>

2558
01:57:22.651 --> 01:57:23.484
<v Speaker 1>this delusion of grandeur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was always something better </v>

2559
01:57:26.970 --> 01:57:27.803
<v Speaker 1>waiting for us to grab up and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth of the matter was the glory </v>

2560
01:57:32.341 --> 01:57:35.370
<v Speaker 1>years of the o and a show were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new year's and the,</v>

2561
01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that crazy fucking radio.</v>

2562
01:57:38.370 --> 01:57:42.960
<v Speaker 1>We were damaged goods after the sex in </v>
<v Speaker 1>st patrick's cathedral debacle.</v>

2563
01:57:42.970 --> 01:57:45.050
<v Speaker 1>We had a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2564
01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.100
<v Speaker 1>we had a contest where people had to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>around New York city and have sex at,</v>

2565

<v Speaker 1>people that work for the show,</v>

2568
01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:00.240
<v Speaker 1>follow them around and they would call </v>
<v Speaker 1>us on the show and go,</v>

2569
01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:01.173
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like what locations are,</v>

2577

2584
01:58:36.241 --> 01:58:39.690
<v Speaker 1>location because they all had point </v>
<v Speaker 1>values for how dangerous it was.</v>

2585
01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:42.870
<v Speaker 1>A pat was watching to be sure that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>went in the house.</v>

2586
01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Paul paul was watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2590
01:58:49.541 --> 01:58:53.590
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of theater of the mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on to who knows what the fuck they</v>

2591
01:58:53.591 --> 01:58:54.424
<v Speaker 1>were doing or where I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear it was in the vestibule outside </v>

2592
01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:58.473
<v Speaker 1>st pat's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but regardless it's sex at st pat's and </v>

2593
01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.550
<v Speaker 1>a nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We looked at each other.</v>

2594
01:59:03.551 --> 01:59:06.340
<v Speaker 1>We both had digital delay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the delay button.</v>

2595
01:59:06.450 --> 01:59:09.010
<v Speaker 1>A seven second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have like a 32nd delay.</v>

2596
01:59:09.250 --> 01:59:10.083
<v Speaker 1>We both had buttons in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another guy in a locked room </v>

2597
01:59:12.431 --> 01:59:13.264
<v Speaker 1>down the hall that had a button to dump </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of because we were constantly doing </v>

2598
01:59:15.911 --> 01:59:17.710
<v Speaker 1>shit that would have gotten fcc </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaints.</v>

2599
01:59:17.711 --> 01:59:18.544
<v Speaker 1>So the boston stalled these buttons </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere while we both had our finger </v>

2600
01:59:21.971 --> 01:59:22.804
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Con like,</v>

2601
01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:26.140
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we punch out of this?</v>

2602
01:59:26.141 --> 01:59:26.974
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking his girl in the ass at st pat's </v>

2603
01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:33.220
<v Speaker 1>a and neither of us hit the button and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guY down the hall didn't hit it.</v>

2604
01:59:33.221 --> 01:59:36.240
<v Speaker 1>We just went with it at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2605
01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:40.900
<v Speaker 1>that is one of those moments like talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a defining moment.</v>

2606
01:59:41.050 --> 01:59:45.460
<v Speaker 1>You move your finger one inch down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that never happens.</v>

2607
01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:48.940
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year was this?</v>

2608
01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:51.910
<v Speaker 1>A 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

2609
01:59:51.911 --> 01:59:52.900
<v Speaker 1>2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2610
01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:53.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2611
01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:56.110
<v Speaker 1>it was nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2612
01:59:56.111 --> 01:59:58.120
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went through nine slash 11 on the air</v>

2613
01:59:58.121 --> 01:59:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

2614
01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And then I guess that summer maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year did you guys wind up on xm?</v>

2615
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:06.490
<v Speaker 1>A 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

2616
02:00:06.491 --> 02:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>We had to sit out two fucking years out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our contract.</v>

2617
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not working.</v>

2618
02:00:11.890 --> 02:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want us to go to mornings </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a clear channel radio,</v>

2619
02:00:16.031 --> 02:00:19.330
<v Speaker 1>which was another radio company and cbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

2620
02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of fighting for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clear channel wanted us to do mornings</v>

2621
02:00:23.381 --> 02:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>against howard stern who was on cbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2622
02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>we worked for cbs at the time doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoons,</v>

2623
02:00:29.050 --> 02:00:29.883
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were put in a position where they </v>

2624
02:00:31.091 --> 02:00:33.910
<v Speaker 1>were both just throwing huge amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money at us.</v>

2625
02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cbs was like,</v>

2626
02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>we can't let them go to morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

2627
02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:40.233
<v Speaker 1>it would be impossible to beat howard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we would take enough listeners away </v>

2628
02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.370
<v Speaker 1>where he might not be number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2629
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>That affects revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2630
02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:48.213
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to sell the show as the number </v>

2631
02:00:49.331 --> 02:00:50.200
<v Speaker 1>one rated show.</v>

2632
02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:51.453
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cbs was doing anything they could to </v>

2633
02:00:53.261 --> 02:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>keep us in afternoons with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>company as howard.</v>

2634
02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was the most lucrative contract we</v>

2635
02:00:58.721 --> 02:01:00.490
<v Speaker 1>ever signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a three year deal.</v>

2636
02:01:01.450 --> 02:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>We signed it in I guess 2001.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2637
02:01:06.010 --> 02:01:06.843
<v Speaker 1>after one year they canceled the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the sex at st pat's thing </v>

2638
02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>that blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2639
02:01:12.221 --> 02:01:13.600
<v Speaker 1>it was in the newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2640
02:01:13.601 --> 02:01:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I had to look at opi and dopey on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front page of.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My family and everything.</v>

2644
02:01:23.411 --> 02:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It was just fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2645
02:01:25.991 --> 02:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cbs was like,</v>

2646
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we canceled your show,</v>

2647
02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:31.270
<v Speaker 1>but we're not letting you out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

2648
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

2649
02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:34.150
<v Speaker 1>We talked to our agent and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2650
02:01:34.151 --> 02:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'Re not letting you work.</v>

2651
02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>You'll still get paid and do it.</v>

2652
02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:39.123
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was millions of dollars that they </v>

2653
02:01:42.201 --> 02:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>had to give us for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you think like,</v>

2654
02:01:45.951 --> 02:01:46.784
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

2655
02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>And back then there was no internet to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak of.</v>

2656
02:01:50.121 --> 02:01:50.954
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you had no way to contact your </v>

2657
02:01:51.831 --> 02:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2658
02:01:52.671 --> 02:01:53.504
<v Speaker 1>you could have a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what are the ways that we </v>

2659
02:01:55.671 --> 02:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>became friends as I wrote about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

2660
02:01:57.650 --> 02:01:58.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2661
02:01:58.731 --> 02:01:59.564
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a big piece on my website about </v>

2662
02:02:01.341 --> 02:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>how it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2663
02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people supported us,</v>

2664
02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>but it got a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In two years you'd just disappear on the</v>

2665
02:02:09.471 --> 02:02:10.304
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's if you're not doing a show and </v>

2666
02:02:12.341 --> 02:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>you're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will go away,</v>

2667
02:02:13.551 --> 02:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>they will find something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were really worried about that.</v>

2668
02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged goods.</v>

2669
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>So no one was really clamoring to hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>us anyway,</v>

2670
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:23.623
<v Speaker 1>but we went through two years where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just making huge amounts of money </v>

2671
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>and just find toys.</v>

2672
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to atlantis for a couple of weeks</v>

2673
02:02:34.730 --> 02:02:35.563
<v Speaker 1>ago in The Bahamas and I was literallY,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pulling my luggage to leave at </v>

2674
02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2675
02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:43.370
<v Speaker 1>the desk and I go to my chick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2676
02:02:44.150 --> 02:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>what do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we going home?</v>

2677
02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:47.211
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2678
02:02:47.211 --> 02:02:48.044
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I have the room for another two </v>

2679
02:02:49.161 --> 02:02:49.761
<v Speaker 1>weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2680
02:02:49.761 --> 02:02:52.370
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went back upstairs and just stayed for a</v>

2681
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:53.203
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason why am I going home </v>

2682
02:02:55.341 --> 02:02:56.174
<v Speaker 1>after two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so conditioned like how long a </v>

2683
02:02:58.221 --> 02:03:01.850
<v Speaker 1>vacation is and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that lasted for two years.</v>

2684
02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:06.800
<v Speaker 1>And then a satellite came calling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was we considered radio prison.</v>

2685
02:03:07.190 --> 02:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>At that point it was radio jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that,</v>

2686
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 1>because everyone that had fucked up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular radio ended up in satellite,</v>

2687
02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:15.710
<v Speaker 1>like no one wanted to be in satellite </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio at the time.</v>

2688
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:19.550
<v Speaker 1>They had no subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and opie sat on the side of,</v>

2689
02:03:19.551 --> 02:03:20.361
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2690
02:03:20.361 --> 02:03:22.970
<v Speaker 1>the belt parkway once by my house in </v>
<v Speaker 1>brooklyn.</v>

2691
02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:24.433
<v Speaker 1>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see how many satellite radio </v>

2692
02:03:26.331 --> 02:03:29.090
<v Speaker 1>antennas we see because they used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very obvious shark fin,</v>

2693
02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.100
<v Speaker 1>big antennas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aftermarket.</v>

2694
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:33.230
<v Speaker 1>They stuck them and drilled them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your roof.</v>

2695
02:03:33.231 --> 02:03:35.990
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The installation process was stupid.</v>

2696
02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:39.380
<v Speaker 1>No one wanted to get fucked their car up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this dumb antenna.</v>

2697
02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:42.470
<v Speaker 1>So we're looking at when like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2698
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:44.030
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one.</v>

2699
02:03:44.810 --> 02:03:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money's one thing obviously,</v>

2700
02:03:48.021 --> 02:03:52.730
<v Speaker 1>but as a broadcaster you want to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>be talking to people you know,</v>

2701
02:03:52.731 --> 02:03:54.860
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to entertain people,</v>

2702
02:03:54.861 --> 02:03:55.820
<v Speaker 1>you want people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2703
02:03:55.821 --> 02:03:56.654
<v Speaker 1>that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was just no subscribers back </v>

2704
02:03:58.791 --> 02:04:02.810
<v Speaker 1>then during our 10 years there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wound up getting very,</v>

2705
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:03.740
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2706
02:04:03.741 --> 02:04:04.460
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2707
02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:06.980
<v Speaker 1>we had a lot of listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but early on,</v>

2708
02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:09.680
<v Speaker 1>no one but satellite was calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2709
02:04:09.681 --> 02:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2710
02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>we signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we signed the deal,</v>

2711
02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

2712
02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:16.820
<v Speaker 1>we definitely would have preferred </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrestrial radio.</v>

2713
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting now,</v>

2714
02:04:19.611 --> 02:04:23.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because now satellIte satellite became a</v>

2715
02:04:23.061 --> 02:04:23.894
<v Speaker 1>big thing when howard got on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and people were talking </v>

2716
02:04:26.601 --> 02:04:27.434
<v Speaker 1>about it and then it became a big thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because every new car you buy you'd get </v>

2717
02:04:30.111 --> 02:04:34.730
<v Speaker 1>a free 90 days or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now no one gives a shit.</v>

2718
02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2719
02:04:36.210 --> 02:04:39.060
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the short lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology's,</v>

2720
02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:40.133
<v Speaker 1>not that it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll always be there in some </v>

2721
02:04:41.581 --> 02:04:42.720
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2722
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:46.830
<v Speaker 1>It is fucking clinging by a thread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many other,</v>

2723
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:48.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they bought pandora.</v>

2724
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's so many other streaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlets out there.</v>

2725
02:04:53.190 --> 02:04:56.370
<v Speaker 1>And the fact in podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that podcasts are all free.</v>

2726
02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2727
02:04:57.270 --> 02:05:00.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you can play them in a tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2728
02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't peter out on ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2729
02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that signal constantly now.</v>

2730
02:05:07.471 --> 02:05:09.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the old days a,</v>

2731
02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:10.853
<v Speaker 1>every time you get in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your system identifies your phone </v>

2732
02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>and then links up with commercials.</v>

2733
02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I remember when theY started playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials,</v>

2734
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

2735
02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying so that you can play </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials.</v>

2736
02:05:22.781 --> 02:05:24.630
<v Speaker 1>He ouT of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2737
02:05:24.631 --> 02:05:28.260
<v Speaker 1>That was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to be a commercial free.</v>

2738
02:05:28.261 --> 02:05:29.910
<v Speaker 1>They all talk about commercial free and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it ends up.</v>

2739
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen into seven days on seven,</v>

2740
02:05:32.341 --> 02:05:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I guess you want to have to listen to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>

2741
02:05:34.561 --> 02:05:36.650
<v Speaker 1>But I think they have commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2742
02:05:36.690 --> 02:05:38.460
<v Speaker 1>They started throwing commercials on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2743
02:05:38.461 --> 02:05:40.250
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2744
02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Short lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2745
02:05:41.550 --> 02:05:42.600
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2746
02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:43.434
<v Speaker 1>And then to put all of your eggs in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of baskets that are circling the </v>

2747
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:53.010
<v Speaker 1>earth always seemed weird to me that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get it in Hawaii.</v>

<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

2750
02:06:00.181 --> 02:06:01.050

2752
02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:02.933
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to deal with a satellite </v>

2753

<v Speaker 1>orbiting the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2754
02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:09.870
<v Speaker 1>something happens to the transmitter on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrestrial station.</v>

2755
02:06:09.871 --> 02:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>They send an engineer up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turns a few screws or what have you.</v>

2756
02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.790

2760
02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:24.510

2761
02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary effect that sirius is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted from a thing in the sky down</v>

2762
02:06:29.821 --> 02:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2763
02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:31.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's transmitted from the </v>

2764
02:06:32.911 --> 02:06:33.744
<v Speaker 1>people on the ground up into the sky and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then back down to the people on the </v>

2765
02:06:37.321 --> 02:06:38.130
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2766
02:06:38.130 --> 02:06:41.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so unnecessary.</v>

2767
02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Just the people on the ground could just</v>
<v Speaker 1>send it to the people on the ground,</v>

2768
02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:46.630
<v Speaker 1>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you do breezy?</v>

2769
02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in this day and age with the.</v>

2770
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:51.300
<v Speaker 1>But they still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>

2771
02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2772
02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:53.790
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to do soMething.</v>

2773
02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:56.220
<v Speaker 1>The model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2774
02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:57.473
<v Speaker 1>like I said by pandora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe start scooping up a internet </v>

2775
02:07:00.241 --> 02:07:02.370
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to do.</v>

2776
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to move towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that direction.</v>

2777
02:07:03.961 --> 02:07:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all.</v>

2778
02:07:05.370 --> 02:07:06.203
<v Speaker 1>You know what's really weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Fucking am radio is still </v>

2779
02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:12.750
<v Speaker 1>a thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's the weirdest thing to be.</v>

2780
02:07:12.751 --> 02:07:17.400
<v Speaker 1>The death knell for radio has been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been forever,</v>

2781
02:07:17.401 --> 02:07:19.800
<v Speaker 1>like the second another technology came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2782
02:07:19.801 --> 02:07:20.634
<v Speaker 1>IT was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess that's it for radio and </v>

2783
02:07:22.651 --> 02:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>

2784
02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:25.630
<v Speaker 1>an amazing invention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2785
02:07:25.890 --> 02:07:29.880
<v Speaker 1>And radio was supposed to be dead but </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just hangs in there.</v>

2786
02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:34.980
<v Speaker 1>People just can't let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regular radio,</v>

2787
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:36.180
<v Speaker 1>especially a am</v>

2788
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:37.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember as a kid,</v>

2789
02:07:37.841 --> 02:07:42.820
<v Speaker 2>my dad having the agm or like music on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the am radio sounded like was coming out</v>

2790
02:07:42.821 --> 02:07:47.020
<v Speaker 2>of a tin can static and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was kind of all you had.</v>

2791
02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I drove home a look like a year ago and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just on a goof I decided to uh,</v>

2792
02:07:52.450 --> 02:07:53.283
<v Speaker 2>put on am radio and I was listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>an am radio show and I had a big smile </v>

2793
02:07:57.011 --> 02:07:59.800
<v Speaker 2>on my face all the way home because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like I was listening to the past.</v>

2794
02:07:59.801 --> 02:08:00.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2795
02:08:00.251 --> 02:08:01.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like a time machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2796
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:02.223
<v Speaker 2>I was some weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the local talk shows a weird </v>

2797
02:08:06.041 --> 02:08:06.874
<v Speaker 2>local talk show in la where they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about traffic and the dodgers </v>

2798
02:08:10.421 --> 02:08:12.880
<v Speaker 2>game and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's archaic.</v>

2799
02:08:12.881 --> 02:08:15.070
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like first of all,</v>

2800
02:08:15.071 --> 02:08:15.904
<v Speaker 2>anything with anything that is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>inform you is just unnecessary at this </v>

2801
02:08:22.241 --> 02:08:22.950
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

2802
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Unless it's fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big cnn and fox news and everything.</v>

2803
02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Those will always be a fixture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

2804
02:08:31.241 --> 02:08:35.440
<v Speaker 2>but local fucking news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you really need the,</v>

2805
02:08:35.570 --> 02:08:36.403
<v Speaker 2>the the team that cares at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all just shit that you've </v>

2806
02:08:40.901 --> 02:08:41.734
<v Speaker 2>already seen online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not one story that will be on </v>

2807
02:08:45.131 --> 02:08:47.980
<v Speaker 2>the 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>news that I don't already know in depth.</v>

2808
02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:51.670
<v Speaker 2>It's also the lowest rung of show </v>
<v Speaker 2>business in terms of competence.</v>

2809
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:56.110
<v Speaker 2>People that they're terrible at it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all drunks.</v>

2810
02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:57.920
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2811
02:08:57.970 --> 02:09:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I have never seen a group of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can drink more than fucking newspeople.</v>

2812
02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:03.233
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just get hammered on instantly are </v>

2813
02:09:05.381 --> 02:09:07.180
<v Speaker 2>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it.</v>

2814
02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:10.210
<v Speaker 2>I think they're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went through a whole thing when roseanne</v>

2815
02:09:10.211 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 2>was supposed to be on the podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>right after she got fired,</v>

2816
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:15.190
<v Speaker 2>she announced she was going to come on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast.</v>

2817
02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:17.133
<v Speaker 2>These fucking news casters started </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up where our old studio is </v>

2818
02:09:20.921 --> 02:09:21.754
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went to our old studio and they </v>

2819
02:09:22.931 --> 02:09:25.870
<v Speaker 2>were parked out front with cameras and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where I got.</v>

2820
02:09:25.871 --> 02:09:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I got upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2821
02:09:27.221 --> 02:09:28.900
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are terrible at this,</v>

2822
02:09:28.930 --> 02:09:29.763

<v Speaker 2>because you put your camera and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're not good at talking.</v>

2828

<v Speaker 2>like a really good job doing this </v>

2829
02:09:49.121 --> 02:09:50.920

<v Speaker 2>You're not good at it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You will one day get a really good job </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this or you're just not good at </v>

2831

02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:51.530
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2875
02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:52.453
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just been banging divorces and </v>

2876
02:11:54.010 --> 02:11:56.660
<v Speaker 2>riding a motorcycle to trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back on tv.</v>

2877
02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:01.040
<v Speaker 2>That is just stunning to me is how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money he made.</v>

2878
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2879
02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't know he was making that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much money.</v>

2880
02:12:03.651 --> 02:12:04.484
<v Speaker 2>Like that is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for Years for a long fucking like a </v>

2881
02:12:08.210 --> 02:12:09.043
<v Speaker 2>giant ranch in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like thousands of acres and you </v>

2882
02:12:11.850 --> 02:12:15.250
<v Speaker 2>decide you need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy because he's got a,</v>

2883
02:12:15.370 --> 02:12:20.370
<v Speaker 2>some access issues like the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get to certain parts of the uh,</v>

2884
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:23.450
<v Speaker 2>public land they have to go through his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranch.</v>

2885
02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.553
<v Speaker 2>So there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an access issue like some sort of </v>

2886
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:29.680
<v Speaker 2>easement where these people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be able to drive through and</v>

2887
02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:30.593
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting it off and he should </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sit at his desk with that button </v>

2888
02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:34.220
<v Speaker 2>that opens the door.</v>

2889
02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:37.490
<v Speaker 2>But it lists a gate up so theY could get</v>
<v Speaker 2>through that button.</v>

2890
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:39.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a misconception about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>button.</v>

2891
02:12:40.130 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 2>They all had that button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2892
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:42.231
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2893
02:12:42.231 --> 02:12:44.970
<v Speaker 2>it was because they had big offices and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to be able to lock their doors</v>

2894
02:12:44.971 --> 02:12:47.090
<v Speaker 2>suddenly interrupted on a phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't,</v>

2895
02:12:47.091 --> 02:12:47.924
<v Speaker 2>so they could bang chicks in the office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like women executives had that button </v>

2896
02:12:50.391 --> 02:12:51.021
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2897
02:12:51.021 --> 02:12:51.711
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2898
02:12:51.711 --> 02:12:54.650
<v Speaker 2>but that's the thing that sounded very </v>
<v Speaker 2>audrey,</v>

2899
02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:58.310
<v Speaker 2>audrey and d.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The media grabbed onto that and like,</v>

2900
02:12:58.311 --> 02:12:59.131
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a button,</v>

2901
02:12:59.131 --> 02:13:00.890
<v Speaker 2>the lock it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sit in there.</v>

2902
02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:04.660
<v Speaker 2>When I fuck around being our rep that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to fuck on,</v>

2903
02:13:04.661 --> 02:13:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I hit that button and just start fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>some nervous girl.</v>

2904
02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Just seals that click goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

2905
02:13:11.571 --> 02:13:14.450
<v Speaker 2>He hit the button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of that.</v>

2906
02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:18.890
<v Speaker 2>That was accentuated like there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>one guest that brought in a bunch of sex</v>

2907
02:13:18.891 --> 02:13:23.360
<v Speaker 2>toys and he went back and he kept it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his office and he was like,</v>

2908
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:24.223
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he keeps a bag of sex toys in his </v>

2909
02:13:25.011 --> 02:13:25.760
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

2910
02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Like this shit in this office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a flame thrower.</v>

2911
02:13:29.690 --> 02:13:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elan gave me a flame thrower.</v>

2912
02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to do with it?</v>

2913
02:13:33.931 --> 02:13:36.900
<v Speaker 2>It's right there by the flame thrower in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his office.</v>

2914
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that kind of thing,</v>

2915
02:13:38.401 --> 02:13:40.050
<v Speaker 2>like if somebody gave me a bag of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dildos,</v>

2916
02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:42.090
<v Speaker 2>it will be right over there next to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flame thrower.</v>

2917
02:13:42.091 --> 02:13:42.924
<v Speaker 2>He has a bag of cheetos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a conscious decision to throw it </v>

2918
02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:47.430
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my wife found it.</v>

2919
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:51.600
<v Speaker 2>It would wind up getting tossed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but matt lauer decided to keep it in his</v>

2920
02:13:51.601 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking closet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2921
02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he gave some people some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the guy was getting laid.</v>

2922
02:13:58.220 --> 02:13:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

2923
02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:02.640
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of what else happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2924
02:14:02.641 --> 02:14:04.500
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the details of it.</v>

2925
02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:08.850
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that it's all of it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like very blown out of proportion.</v>

2926
02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2927
02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:10.973
<v Speaker 2>that that's happening because everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>is being lumped into the harvey </v>

2928
02:14:13.651 --> 02:14:15.720
<v Speaker 2>weinstein category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2930
02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:20.311
<v Speaker 2>The tip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I believe it was cnn or one of those </v>

2934
02:14:27.630 --> 02:14:28.500
<v Speaker 2>talk show.</v>

<v Speaker 2>rapist in history.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

2969
02:16:10.981 --> 02:16:13.470

02:16:58.390 --> 02:17:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Like the fbi allowed him to sell drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do a lot.</v>

2989
02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:06.340
<v Speaker 2>He won the lottery twice while he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>

2990
02:17:06.341 --> 02:17:07.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that works and how the [inaudible] </v>

2991
02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:14.140
<v Speaker 2>would win the lottery and he would use </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as a way to show income.</v>

2992
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:15.243
<v Speaker 2>So he would pay them for their lottery </v>
<v Speaker 2>ticket or steal it from him or whatever </v>

2993
02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:21.070
<v Speaker 2>they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he would say,</v>

2994
02:17:21.071 --> 02:17:21.904
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won the lottery and then he would win </v>

2995
02:17:23.411 --> 02:17:26.200
<v Speaker 2>the lottery so that when he would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this money laundered,</v>

2996
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:30.640
<v Speaker 2>it could avoid tax evasion charges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way I'll get proof of income.</v>

2997
02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't want to get that boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you get that cadillac?</v>

2998
02:17:33.641 --> 02:17:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you get that house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2999
02:17:34.661 --> 02:17:35.494
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3000
02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:36.441
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3001
02:17:36.441 --> 02:17:40.630
<v Speaker 2>that's fucked up twice now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both live to win it twice.</v>

3002
02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:41.770
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3003
02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:42.701
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3004
02:17:42.701 --> 02:17:43.481
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3005
02:17:43.481 --> 02:17:48.481
<v Speaker 2>the fbi was helping him too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they were given up competitors</v>

3006
02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:50.250
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they,</v>

3007
02:17:50.251 --> 02:17:51.084
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were responsible probably for some </v>

3008
02:17:52.331 --> 02:17:53.200
<v Speaker 2>murders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3009
02:17:53.201 --> 02:17:54.034
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would bring people to him like </v>

3010
02:17:55.541 --> 02:17:56.590
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing like,</v>

3011
02:17:56.591 --> 02:17:59.110
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to kill anyone but we'll</v>

3012
02:17:59.111 --> 02:18:03.010
<v Speaker 2>bring this guy to you so you could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little chit chat and you know,</v>

3013
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:05.110
<v Speaker 2>you're driving the guy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his death.</v>

3014
02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:06.933
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was living in an apartment in </v>

02:18:08.141 --> 02:18:10.450
<v Speaker 2>santa monica with some girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talked a lot.</v>

3016
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:12.840
<v Speaker 2>And apparently she was yelling at him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

3017
02:18:12.841 --> 02:18:14.910
<v Speaker 2>that's how he got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it,</v>

3018
02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:19.060
<v Speaker 2>like a domestic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some screaming and yelling and</v>

3019

3053
02:19:57.380 --> 02:19:59.120
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

3055
02:19:59.751 --> 02:20:02.020

<v Speaker 1>But then it does sometimes,</v>

3056
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:03.590
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

3057
02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:06.230
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people get what's coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3058
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:08.200
<v Speaker 1>How do we get on the subject of why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary?</v>

3059
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always,</v>

3060
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:12.750
<v Speaker 1>we just ramble about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love it.</v>

3061
02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:18.140
<v Speaker 1>So I love that you've established your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own sort of media company.</v>

3062
02:20:18.650 --> 02:20:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I love that you decided to start your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own network,</v>

3063
02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:24.320
<v Speaker 1>but is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

3064
02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:28.400
<v Speaker 1>are there challenges like what we do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty simple because we just put it out</v>

3065
02:20:28.401 --> 02:20:29.690
<v Speaker 1>there and then we put ads on it.</v>

3066
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3067
02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:31.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or youtube puts ads on it.</v>

3068
02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:34.580
<v Speaker 1>But is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it challenging to like,</v>

3069
02:20:35.050 --> 02:20:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a bunch of people.</v>

3070
02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:37.453
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other folks were coming in and they had </v>

3071
02:20:39.141 --> 02:20:42.750
<v Speaker 1>their shows in the studio as well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had you changed your green screen,</v>

3072
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:43.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should change the most convenient </v>

3073
02:20:45.261 --> 02:20:46.094
<v Speaker 1>way to kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of having a different set for </v>

3074
02:20:47.631 --> 02:20:50.450
<v Speaker 1>every show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a green screen and then we just pop</v>

3075
02:20:50.451 --> 02:20:51.284
<v Speaker 1>it in a pop in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could do some pretty funny things </v>

3076
02:20:54.291 --> 02:20:55.460
<v Speaker 1>with it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done that.</v>

3077
02:20:55.461 --> 02:21:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I did a reading last week of a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my book and uh,</v>

3078
02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:01.393
<v Speaker 1>we went to an establishing shot of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabin and I moved to a chair behind the </v>

3079
02:21:04.311 --> 02:21:07.440
<v Speaker 1>green screen and it's just made by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little fire burning and I.</v>

3080
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>

3081
02:21:09.250 --> 02:21:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect you and you know,</v>

3082
02:21:11.391 --> 02:21:13.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of fun to be creative with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>

3083
02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than that,</v>

3084
02:21:15.351 --> 02:21:17.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of challenges.</v>

3085
02:21:17.211 --> 02:21:19.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not,</v>

3086
02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I am in front of the mic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3087
02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like any of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the business.</v>

3088
02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:28.150
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3089
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:32.180
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because this is the ceo of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the business or I'm the guy.</v>

3090
02:21:32.181 --> 02:21:33.014
<v Speaker 1>Keith though is the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've delegated a lot of the </v>

3091
02:21:35.331 --> 02:21:38.570
<v Speaker 1>responsibility as to the tech end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and uh,</v>

3092
02:21:38.810 --> 02:21:39.643
<v Speaker 1>finding the people we need to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment and stuff over the course of </v>

3093
02:21:42.021 --> 02:21:45.720
<v Speaker 1>the years and it's worked out very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3094
02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:47.460
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is one of those things.</v>

3095
02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:49.550
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's two companies.</v>

3096
02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:50.443

<v Speaker 1>into the microphone and then all the </v>

<v Speaker 1>yelling and I get an anxiety attack.</v>

02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:17.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a,</v>

3134
02:23:17.491 --> 02:23:18.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3135
02:23:18.031 --> 02:23:18.864
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were always looking for a many shows </v>

3136
02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:21.324
<v Speaker 1>you have on shows that fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many that is available </v>

3137
02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:26.370
<v Speaker 1>to stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like anytime you want.</v>

3138
02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:27.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3139
02:23:27.001 --> 02:23:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Every show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the shows go out live.</v>

3140
02:23:29.611 --> 02:23:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I like the element of just a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger there of,</v>

3141
02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:35.500
<v Speaker 1>of being live as it goes out.</v>

3142
02:23:35.970 --> 02:23:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

3143
02:23:39.301 --> 02:23:40.134
<v Speaker 1>but just knowing you could edit </v>
<v Speaker 1>something might make you a little lazy </v>

3144
02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:46.170
<v Speaker 1>as you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop.</v>

3145
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:47.063
<v Speaker 1>You have to keep calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie brought it up like it feels </v>

3146
02:23:48.991 --> 02:23:50.940
<v Speaker 1>different and we've done shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't live.</v>

3147
02:23:51.090 --> 02:23:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it does.</v>

3148
02:23:52.021 --> 02:23:53.870
<v Speaker 1>If something happened with streaming at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one point in time,</v>

3149
02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:54.773
<v Speaker 1>we fucked up and we couldn't stream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we just edited it and put it or a </v>

3150
02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:00.000
<v Speaker 1>filmed in advance rather than put it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

3151
02:24:00.210 --> 02:24:01.950
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this field feels weird?</v>

3152
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:03.750
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because there's a net.</v>

3153
02:24:04.050 --> 02:24:05.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a net down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

3154
02:24:05.430 --> 02:24:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you could leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to take a piss,</v>

3155
02:24:07.051 --> 02:24:07.461
<v Speaker 1>you could go,</v>

3172
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.983
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went with subscriber based because </v>

3173
02:24:40.321 --> 02:24:43.290
<v Speaker 1>when I got the boot from a serious years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

3174
02:24:44.130 --> 02:24:44.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine people want me to be </v>

3175
02:24:47.311 --> 02:24:50.100
<v Speaker 1>hawking their products in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

3176
02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:51.473
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3177
02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:54.960
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't want to be beholden to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsors,</v>

3178
02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't have anyone telling me what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can and can't say anymore,</v>

3179
02:24:59.550 --> 02:25:00.383
<v Speaker 1>just ain't going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is there an issue trying to get </v>

3180
02:25:02.551 --> 02:25:03.270
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3181
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:04.103
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was on radio and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and went to do a podcast nana </v>

3182
02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:08.580
<v Speaker 1>subscription podcast.</v>

3183
02:25:08.610 --> 02:25:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

3184
02:25:09.810 --> 02:25:12.420
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really difficult to grow.</v>

3185
02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:13.313
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep those people that you </v>

3186
02:25:14.191 --> 02:25:17.790
<v Speaker 1>have to keep them happy and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would do things to engage with them</v>

3187
02:25:17.791 --> 02:25:20.160
<v Speaker 1>and they would do like little events </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they'd go to a bar,</v>

3188
02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:23.200
<v Speaker 1>meet everybody and do a show from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3189
02:25:23.201 --> 02:25:24.034
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard to grow because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to pay when there's </v>

3190
02:25:26.351 --> 02:25:28.240
<v Speaker 1>all these different shows they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just get for free.</v>

3191
02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

3192
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:30.423
<v Speaker 1>that's always a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the commodity that </v>

3193
02:25:34.661 --> 02:25:37.180
<v Speaker 1>people can't get anywhere else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining.</v>

3194
02:25:37.210 --> 02:25:38.043
<v Speaker 1>Shows like you could have a free show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sucks and there's plenty of those </v>

3195
02:25:43.061 --> 02:25:44.590
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3196
02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:49.090
<v Speaker 1>but if you're good at what you do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you already have an audience,</v>

3197
02:25:49.091 --> 02:25:52.870
<v Speaker 1>because I say it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corola had the greatest line once he was</v>

3198
02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:54.890
<v Speaker 1>being interviewed in so and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3199
02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:58.840
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you make a successful podcast?</v>

3200
02:25:58.840 --> 02:25:59.321
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3201
02:25:59.321 --> 02:26:00.340
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule number one,</v>

3202
02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:02.950
<v Speaker 1>be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3203

<v Speaker 1>you gotta.</v>

3204
02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:07.360

<v Speaker 1>a month,</v>

3205
02:26:07.430 --> 02:26:08.450
<v Speaker 1>and then keith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3206
02:26:08.650 --> 02:26:09.483
<v Speaker 1>figured it out that we could hold onto a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the o and a audience that would </v>

3207
02:26:13.781 --> 02:26:16.450
<v Speaker 1>come over and subscribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it quick,</v>

<v Speaker 1>get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3209
02:26:17.411 --> 02:26:18.244
<v Speaker 1>And that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank god I had that studio already </v>

3210
02:26:19.691 --> 02:26:21.420
<v Speaker 1>built in my basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3211
02:26:21.430 --> 02:26:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I was able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we needed was the logistics of,</v>

3212
02:26:23.711 --> 02:26:24.544
<v Speaker 1>of pumping it out onto the internet in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger number than I was doing at three </v>

3213
02:26:27.401 --> 02:26:30.130
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were doing some of them outside too.</v>

3215
02:26:30.941 --> 02:26:34.450

<v Speaker 1>Like my first guest was dice,</v>

3216
02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:36.080

3217
02:26:36.081 --> 02:26:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dice came by,</v>

3218
02:26:37.361 --> 02:26:42.361
<v Speaker 1>we sat by the pool and then later on he </v>
<v Speaker 1>went downstairs in my basement,</v>

3219
02:26:42.761 --> 02:26:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I that karaoke stage and he was singing </v>
<v Speaker 1>elvis karaoke songs.</v>

3220
02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:47.433
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of those voluntary like </v>

3221
02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:54.240
<v Speaker 1>dice is in my basement singing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elvis did that fucking awesome.</v>

3222
02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3223
02:26:57.101 --> 02:27:00.580
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that model works for us and it's been</v>

3224
02:27:00.581 --> 02:27:04.210
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm kind of seeing a,</v>

3225
02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:07.690
<v Speaker 1>you gotta keep on your toes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a technology based business.</v>

3226
02:27:07.691 --> 02:27:09.070
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about satellite </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>

3227
02:27:09.071 --> 02:27:09.904
<v Speaker 1>like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't tell what's going to </v>

3228
02:27:11.021 --> 02:27:13.330
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really gotta kind of look for future</v>

3229
02:27:13.331 --> 02:27:15.400
<v Speaker 1>trends and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3230
02:27:15.430 --> 02:27:16.263
<v Speaker 1>maybe more of a hybrid thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a balancing act of bringing new </v>

3231
02:27:19.571 --> 02:27:20.404
<v Speaker 1>people in and like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping the people that are there </v>

3232
02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:23.853
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bringing new people in with some </v>

3233
02:27:25.121 --> 02:27:25.954
<v Speaker 1>free content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe get tiered subscription thing </v>

3234
02:27:28.571 --> 02:27:31.030
<v Speaker 1>where there is a free level with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsors.</v>

3235
02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then a tiered,</v>

3236
02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:38.100
<v Speaker 1>a premium level with the material that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already had.</v>

3237
02:27:38.260 --> 02:27:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a past shows or something or extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

3238
02:27:41.770 --> 02:27:42.381
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're,</v>

3239
02:27:42.381 --> 02:27:46.600
<v Speaker 1>we're always trying to think of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a good option.</v>

3240
02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.130
<v Speaker 1>When I first fired this thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had no fucking clue.</v>

3241
02:27:51.370 --> 02:27:52.203
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would kind of do some kind of a </v>

3242
02:27:54.701 --> 02:27:59.701
<v Speaker 1>research testing or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing analysis of day parts and shit</v>

3243
02:28:00.041 --> 02:28:01.990
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just was like,</v>

3244
02:28:02.090 --> 02:28:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be here by 4:00</v>

3245
02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:06.280
<v Speaker 1>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long is this show going to be?</v>

3246
02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hours.</v>

3247
02:28:08.921 --> 02:28:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Four to six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

3248
02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I could go out at six and then I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be there until 4:00</v>

3249
02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:15.400
<v Speaker 1>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking easy.</v>

3250
02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Still lets me party a monday through </v>
<v Speaker 1>friday.</v>

3251
02:28:18.490 --> 02:28:19.323
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the three day weekend all the </v>

3252
02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:21.853
<v Speaker 1>time for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we do monday through </v>

3253
02:28:24.651 --> 02:28:25.484
<v Speaker 1>thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have programming on friday </v>

3254
02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:30.750
<v Speaker 1>in the slot that I'm supposed to begin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3255
02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:31.633
<v Speaker 1>during the week.</v>

3256
02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:33.470
<v Speaker 1>So it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted,</v>

3257
02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to fucking be driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself like that forever.</v>

3258
02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:43.220
<v Speaker 1>So cut back on the hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the days and it worked.</v>

3259
02:28:43.221 --> 02:28:44.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3260
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

3261
02:28:46.401 --> 02:28:47.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always assessing and seeing what </v>

3262
02:28:47.961 --> 02:28:51.590
<v Speaker 1>we could do to kind of build it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that trade off of audience,</v>

3263
02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:52.693
<v Speaker 1>like obviously we're not going to get as</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people watching on a subscriber </v>

3264
02:28:55.401 --> 02:28:58.550
<v Speaker 1>based than we would if it was free with </v>
<v Speaker 1>spots,</v>

3265
02:28:58.551 --> 02:28:59.750
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3266
02:28:59.751 --> 02:29:04.751
<v Speaker 1>do you want to cut down on the paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers and boost it up and then how</v>

3267
02:29:04.911 --> 02:29:07.940
<v Speaker 1>far do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go with advertisers where somebody can</v>

3268
02:29:07.941 --> 02:29:08.774
<v Speaker 1>call them and fuck me over now and do I </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly have free speech now or just free </v>

3269
02:29:13.011 --> 02:29:15.650
<v Speaker 1>as I can be a what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A subscriber base.</v>

3270
02:29:15.651 --> 02:29:16.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3271
02:29:16.551 --> 02:29:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a balancing act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

3272
02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:19.693
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to totally abandoned the </v>

3273
02:29:20.571 --> 02:29:23.420
<v Speaker 1>subscriber model because then you're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mercy of subscribe,</v>

3274
02:29:23.450 --> 02:29:24.283
<v Speaker 1>have a advert of advertisers and it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we have advertisers now we have a </v>

3275
02:29:27.981 --> 02:29:29.190
<v Speaker 1>couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3276
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:32.900
<v Speaker 1>that we pop maybe two spots on a show </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do.</v>

3277
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:34.520
<v Speaker 1>They're all live reads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

3278
02:29:34.530 --> 02:29:37.970
<v Speaker 1>I make them fun and funny and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3279
02:29:37.971 --> 02:29:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I learned that from howard years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>when howard,</v>

3280
02:29:40.671 --> 02:29:41.504
<v Speaker 1>we'd go to spots before he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndicated to when he had all the time </v>

3281
02:29:43.851 --> 02:29:44.684
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you didn't even know he was </v>

3282
02:29:46.731 --> 02:29:49.010
<v Speaker 1>still in a commercial break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just funny.</v>

3283
02:29:49.310 --> 02:29:52.970
<v Speaker 1>So I try to keep it light and fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>add in things.</v>

3284
02:29:52.971 --> 02:29:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't feel so intrusive,</v>

3285
02:29:56.060 --> 02:29:58.100
<v Speaker 1>but I don't live in thai by sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3286
02:29:58.101 --> 02:30:01.580
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of supplements the subscribers</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3287
02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:02.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3288
02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:05.540
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know,</v>

3289
02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:10.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm paranoid because of my past </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3290
02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:11.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sponsors might get pissed at what </v>

3291
02:30:13.011 --> 02:30:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying.</v>

3292
02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:14.293
<v Speaker 1>But when I look at the shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the shows I've been doing in </v>

3293
02:30:16.191 --> 02:30:19.970
<v Speaker 1>the past year or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not as harsh as they were.</v>

3294
02:30:19.971 --> 02:30:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I was really fucking angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3295
02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:25.640
<v Speaker 1>like five years ago when I started this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>

3296
02:30:25.641 --> 02:30:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it's almost five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

3297
02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:28.513
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been doing this a compound </v>

3298
02:30:29.061 --> 02:30:30.370
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3299
02:30:30.890 --> 02:30:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I was just pissed and the show was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform of like venting and,</v>

3300
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:37.790
<v Speaker 1>and revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

3301
02:30:37.791 --> 02:30:38.624
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to fucking yell and be pissed </v>

3302
02:30:41.421 --> 02:30:45.200
<v Speaker 1>about things and bang the desk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and society and,</v>

3303
02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3304
02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:51.340
<v Speaker 1>it came off as very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3305
02:30:51.980 --> 02:30:55.400
<v Speaker 1>and then as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as time went on,</v>

3306
02:30:55.401 --> 02:30:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I realized like people would tell him he</v>
<v Speaker 1>got dude just be funny,</v>

3307
02:30:59.610 --> 02:31:02.750
<v Speaker 1>like just joke about shit and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be serious.</v>

3308
02:31:02.751 --> 02:31:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought for some reason I had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do almost like a political show,</v>

3309
02:31:06.050 --> 02:31:06.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that you had gone </v>

3310
02:31:08.061 --> 02:31:08.930
<v Speaker 1>through so much shit.</v>

3311
02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was resentful.</v>

3312
02:31:10.911 --> 02:31:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I was pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3313
02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:14.090
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3314
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:17.360
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>carried over onto the show,</v>

3315
02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 1>but the past couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's been,</v>

3316
02:31:21.270 --> 02:31:22.103
<v Speaker 1>especially with bringing artie lange on </v>
<v Speaker 1>board for the eight months he was with </v>

3317
02:31:24.541 --> 02:31:25.410
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3318
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:26.423
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to get into any kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a commentary on society with hardy </v>

3319
02:31:30.091 --> 02:31:33.270
<v Speaker 1>lank sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was odd.</v>

3320
02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:34.530
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3321
02:31:34.531 --> 02:31:35.364
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3322
02:31:35.550 --> 02:31:37.980
<v Speaker 1>the preface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gives us fucking love already.</v>

3323
02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:40.740
<v Speaker 1>He's hilariously funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3324
02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:45.210
<v Speaker 1>so quick and just a goofy knock around </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular guy a,</v>

3325
02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:47.870
<v Speaker 1>but the demon span,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demons.</v>

3326
02:31:47.900 --> 02:31:51.150
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of rough to deal with.</v>

3327
02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a relaxed guy if already didn't show</v>

3328
02:31:54.061 --> 02:31:56.230
<v Speaker 1>up one day I do the show myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't need,</v>

3329
02:31:56.290 --> 02:31:59.590
<v Speaker 1>do the show with opi for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3330
02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:00.433
<v Speaker 1>he was a guest on the show and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess be approached him to be a </v>

3331
02:32:04.651 --> 02:32:06.050
<v Speaker 1>cohost or something to eat.</v>

3332
02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:08.100
<v Speaker 1>He said no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3333
02:32:08.250 --> 02:32:09.690
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never part of the show.</v>

3334
02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was going to be part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

3335
02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:12.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was kind of a rumor going around </v>

3336
02:32:13.111 --> 02:32:14.610
<v Speaker 1>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3337
02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:15.473
<v Speaker 1>so when he came on I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to kill me if he doesn't </v>

3338
02:32:18.361 --> 02:32:23.190
<v Speaker 1>show up for a day every so often because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do the show myself.</v>

3339
02:32:23.440 --> 02:32:24.273
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turned out to be a little more </v>

3340
02:32:26.251 --> 02:32:28.230
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was some days that were really</v>

3341
02:32:28.231 --> 02:32:32.250
<v Speaker 1>good and other days where it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little frayed around the edges and uh,</v>

3342
02:32:32.310 --> 02:32:33.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>redundant.</v>

3343
02:32:33.690 --> 02:32:37.020
<v Speaker 1>He's got different kinds of demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boza bub,</v>

3344
02:32:37.650 --> 02:32:40.080
<v Speaker 1>he's got like the main demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really does,</v>

3345
02:32:40.081 --> 02:32:43.470
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so fucking sad to say because,</v>

3346
02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no question about the talent.</v>

3363
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:24.930

<v Speaker 1>left the stern show,</v>

3364
02:33:24.931 --> 02:33:28.990

3367
02:33:35.350 --> 02:33:37.310
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely earned a place in,</v>

3368
02:33:37.311 --> 02:33:39.840
<v Speaker 1>in broadcast history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just,</v>

3369
02:33:39.841 --> 02:33:40.674
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after eight months it got a little too </v>

3370
02:33:41.611 --> 02:33:46.290
<v Speaker 1>crazy to unpredictable and you need some</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictability.</v>

3371
02:33:46.290 --> 02:33:47.760
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was bad about it?</v>

3372
02:33:48.270 --> 02:33:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the attendance issue was a little</v>

3373
02:33:51.721 --> 02:33:53.550
<v Speaker 1>odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a principal.</v>

3374
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:54.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3375
02:33:54.301 --> 02:33:56.100
<v Speaker 1>The attendance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't,</v>

3376
02:33:56.101 --> 02:33:57.730
<v Speaker 1>he was tardy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3377
02:33:58.110 --> 02:34:00.570
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were some days he was fucking,</v>

3378
02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:02.280
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most days it was awesome,</v>

3379
02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:04.710
<v Speaker 1>but there were some days where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3380
02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:08.970
<v Speaker 1>the heads down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of kind of a little iffy and</v>

3381
02:34:08.971 --> 02:34:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>

3382
02:34:10.141 --> 02:34:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I know he knows that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

3383
02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:14.220
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives in that body,</v>

3384
02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:15.180
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3385
02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:17.590
<v Speaker 1>he knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a little odd.</v>

3386
02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we picked up dave landau,</v>

3387
02:34:19.691 --> 02:34:20.524
<v Speaker 1>who's a young comic out of detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He filled in a couple of times when we </v>

3388
02:34:25.601 --> 02:34:26.434
<v Speaker 1>had them as guests on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he filled in a couple of times </v>

3389
02:34:27.821 --> 02:34:32.140
<v Speaker 1>during a few sabbaticals that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>away for a week or so.</v>

3390
02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And me and dave just hit it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great sense of humor.</v>

3391
02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:39.940
<v Speaker 1>He's a little twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great backstory.</v>

3392
02:34:40.210 --> 02:34:43.500
<v Speaker 1>The guy was just a fucking piece of shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

3393
02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:47.670
<v Speaker 1>His stories about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk driving crashed.</v>

3394
02:34:47.690 --> 02:34:48.523
<v Speaker 1>Every car he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was arrested 15 times before he was </v>

3395
02:34:51.251 --> 02:34:54.130
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just a disaster.</v>

3396
02:34:54.490 --> 02:34:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And you look at him now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great wife,</v>

3397
02:34:57.851 --> 02:35:02.710
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a working comic and he's awesome.</v>

3398
02:35:02.711 --> 02:35:05.770
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to cohost my show.</v>

3399
02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:07.150
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets it.</v>

3400
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:08.343
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3421
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:56.950
<v Speaker 1>you basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got put into a corner and said,</v>

3422
02:35:56.951 --> 02:35:58.360
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to figure my way out of this.</v>

3423
02:35:58.420 --> 02:35:59.253
<v Speaker 1>It was a lifeboat at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really expanded it now and </v>

3424
02:36:01.580 --> 02:36:04.210
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become a really interesting thing.</v>

3425
02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:05.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3426
02:36:05.430 --> 02:36:06.263
<v Speaker 1>and I never expected it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave it a lot of thought in between </v>

3427
02:36:11.651 --> 02:36:15.970
<v Speaker 1>being fired and when we finally fired it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a compound media,</v>

3428
02:36:15.971 --> 02:36:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do too?</v>

3429
02:36:17.861 --> 02:36:18.694
<v Speaker 1>Why do I go fucking buy a ranch </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the middle of the sticks </v>

3430
02:36:23.111 --> 02:36:26.320
<v Speaker 1>and get guns and write a manifesto or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or,</v>

3431
02:36:26.350 --> 02:36:28.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to do.</v>

3432
02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:29.333
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was knocking on my door to </v>

3433
02:36:30.491 --> 02:36:31.990
<v Speaker 1>fucking get me a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3434
02:36:32.450 --> 02:36:33.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

3435
02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:36.730
<v Speaker 1>when the idea came to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty much all right,</v>

3436
02:36:36.731 --> 02:36:37.564
<v Speaker 1>I want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And regardless of how many subs I guy </v>

3437
02:36:40.511 --> 02:36:41.344
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overhead is going to be barely </v>

3438

<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's me and my basement doing a </v>

3440
02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:48.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really worried about the number</v>

3441
02:36:48.641 --> 02:36:49.474
<v Speaker 1>of subscribers or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we launched and it was really </v>

3442
02:36:52.721 --> 02:36:54.460
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3447
02:37:03.241 --> 02:37:04.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their own thing.</v>

3448
02:37:04.301 --> 02:37:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Louis j gomez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3449
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:06.810
<v Speaker 1>They got their own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3450
02:37:07.130 --> 02:37:08.560
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their own network.</v>

3451
02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:09.733
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a while they were doing their </v>

3452
02:37:10.811 --> 02:37:14.200
<v Speaker 1>show from my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was so weird.</v>

3453
02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.033
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need their legion of skanks </v>

3454
02:37:17.751 --> 02:37:18.670
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have their,</v>

3455
02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:20.480
<v Speaker 1>part of their show is that live </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

3456
02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:21.673
<v Speaker 1>So I'd have people coming into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard that I didn't know from a hole </v>

3457
02:37:24.201 --> 02:37:25.034
<v Speaker 1>in the wall that had driven out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>roslyn long island to sit on folding </v>

3458
02:37:28.611 --> 02:37:32.180
<v Speaker 1>chairs in front of the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm walking around my basement,</v>

3459
02:37:32.181 --> 02:37:33.320
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are these?</v>

3460
02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a little weird.</v>

3461
02:37:34.671 --> 02:37:37.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a little intrusive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's cool.</v>

3462
02:37:37.131 --> 02:37:37.964
<v Speaker 1>But it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it really started getting </v>

3463
02:37:39.051 --> 02:37:40.550
<v Speaker 1>fucked up because during the summer </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

3464
02:37:40.890 --> 02:37:42.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all jumped in the pool.</v>

3465
02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:43.873
<v Speaker 1>So now they're swimming in my pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legion of skanks was in my pool and it </v>

3466
02:37:48.801 --> 02:37:51.140
<v Speaker 1>was the weirdest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was cold and we'd all just,</v>

3467
02:37:51.141 --> 02:37:52.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a few beers talk,</v>

3468
02:37:52.581 --> 02:37:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you get to know people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't that bad.</v>

3469
02:37:55.071 --> 02:37:56.150
<v Speaker 1>No one ever did anything bad.</v>

3470
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:58.340
<v Speaker 1>They respected the house and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was very cool.</v>

3471
02:37:58.660 --> 02:38:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then gavin was doing the show.</v>

3472
02:38:00.561 --> 02:38:05.561
<v Speaker 1>We got gavin on board from my house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times it was at night,</v>

3473
02:38:05.631 --> 02:38:08.300
<v Speaker 1>so I'd be upstairs on my couch watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>tv or something.</v>

3474
02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:09.313
<v Speaker 1>He'd finish up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come upstairs and sit on the couch and </v>

3475
02:38:10.761 --> 02:38:11.541
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3476
02:38:11.541 --> 02:38:12.410
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just like,</v>

3477
02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked all day,</v>

3478
02:38:15.261 --> 02:38:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch tv.</v>

3479
02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So it became a little weird and after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

3480
02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:22.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keith was like,</v>

3481
02:38:22.011 --> 02:38:24.080
<v Speaker 1>let's get a place in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier for guests.</v>

3482
02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:28.040
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a place at a 35th and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventh right near penn station,</v>

3483
02:38:28.570 --> 02:38:29.840
<v Speaker 1>which works great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3484
02:38:29.841 --> 02:38:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I take the train and now I don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking drive into the city a,</v>

3485
02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:37.010
<v Speaker 1>although that's another nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transit long island railroad.</v>

3486
02:38:37.430 --> 02:38:38.263
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3487
02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:39.890
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just works out better that way.</v>

3488
02:38:39.891 --> 02:38:43.920
<v Speaker 1>It gets me out of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a separation of personal life and,</v>

3489
02:38:43.921 --> 02:38:44.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3490
02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:45.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job.</v>

3491
02:38:45.611 --> 02:38:50.240
<v Speaker 1>So it works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked my podcasts in my house too.</v>

3492
02:38:50.570 --> 02:38:51.403
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody does a little kids to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear him in the background screaming at </v>

3493
02:38:53.961 --> 02:38:54.860
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mommy,</v>

3494
02:38:54.861 --> 02:38:55.940
<v Speaker 1>she took my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3495
02:38:55.980 --> 02:38:58.730
<v Speaker 1>because they were really little at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because doing it for nine years,</v>

3496
02:38:58.731 --> 02:39:00.260
<v Speaker 1>the holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3497
02:39:00.470 --> 02:39:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no time.</v>

3498
02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:03.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did it in my house and then we </v>

3499
02:39:04.971 --> 02:39:07.530
<v Speaker 1>started doing some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice house and then I got a,</v>

3500
02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:08.930
<v Speaker 1>got a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3503
02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:13.250
<v Speaker 1>You went to remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as the show got bigger,</v>

3504
02:39:13.251 --> 02:39:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get a big place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much you've shown the </v>

3507
02:39:19.221 --> 02:39:20.054
<v Speaker 1>people on your show.</v>

3508
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you venture out and show him </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>

3509
02:39:22.071 --> 02:39:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

3510
02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:25.213
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking airplane hangar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is giant and everything in every </v>

3511
02:39:30.891 --> 02:39:34.070
<v Speaker 1>corner is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all just cool.</v>

3512
02:39:34.250 --> 02:39:39.250
<v Speaker 1>There's for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got weights and mats and then that,</v>

3513
02:39:40.130 --> 02:39:43.670
<v Speaker 1>that hunting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that archery game.</v>

3514
02:39:43.690 --> 02:39:44.900
<v Speaker 1>A game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No hunt.</v>

3515
02:39:44.990 --> 02:39:46.280
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3516
02:39:46.281 --> 02:39:47.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a game.</v>

3517
02:39:47.271 --> 02:39:49.490
<v Speaker 1>The scores like you compete against each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

3518
02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:50.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're firing real arrows with your </v>

3519
02:39:51.711 --> 02:39:52.544
<v Speaker 1>compound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bow into what does that kevlar kevlar </v>

3520
02:39:54.891 --> 02:39:55.670
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3521
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:58.310
<v Speaker 1>the tips are flat like the top of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>water bottle.</v>

3522
02:39:58.311 --> 02:40:00.080
<v Speaker 1>So slaps it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't penetrate.</v>

3523
02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:01.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a gun range a couple of times </v>

3524
02:40:04.131 --> 02:40:04.964
<v Speaker 1>on long island that also used a video on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a screen that was made with a giant </v>

3525
02:40:10.851 --> 02:40:12.950
<v Speaker 1>rolls of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one horizontal,</v>

3526
02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:17.960
<v Speaker 1>one vertical and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sensor would read the light that would</v>

3527
02:40:18.001 --> 02:40:18.834
<v Speaker 1>come through when a bullet hit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would record where you shot and </v>

3528
02:40:22.831 --> 02:40:23.760
<v Speaker 1>accurately show that.</v>

3529
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:24.743
<v Speaker 1>And then after too many holes got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is wind the paper a </v>

3530
02:40:28.741 --> 02:40:32.220
<v Speaker 1>little bit on each one and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it misaligns the holes.</v>

3531
02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:34.920
<v Speaker 1>So now you got a whole new sheet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper to shoot at.</v>

3532
02:40:35.070 --> 02:40:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3533
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:36.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3534
02:40:36.781 --> 02:40:38.820
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very cold to be able to shoot it.</v>

3535
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Video targets of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3536
02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:41.800
<v Speaker 1>the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3537
02:40:41.801 --> 02:40:44.520
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like really good for real life</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations for hunting.</v>

3538
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:46.320
<v Speaker 1>That thing's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3539
02:40:46.350 --> 02:40:46.861
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3540
02:40:46.861 --> 02:40:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you're not just looking at a bullseye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a typical target face.</v>

3541
02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:51.953
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at the crease behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder where you're trying to hit the </v>

3542
02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:55.200
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

3543
02:40:55.201 --> 02:40:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you nailed that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the second one.</v>

3544
02:40:57.571 --> 02:40:58.980
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a deer.</v>

3545
02:40:58.981 --> 02:41:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Just a video of a deer standing there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's moving.</v>

3546
02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:02.513
<v Speaker 1>It's not a still picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you drew that back and hit it </v>

3547
02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:07.920
<v Speaker 1>exactly in the crease behind the leg.</v>

3548
02:41:08.430 --> 02:41:09.930
<v Speaker 1>That was a hard shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really cool.</v>

3549
02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:12.060
<v Speaker 1>This fucking game is very addictive </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3550
02:41:12.090 --> 02:41:14.920
<v Speaker 1>You'll be out there pulling that boback </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck your shoulder up,</v>

3551
02:41:15.570 --> 02:41:20.550
<v Speaker 1>pulling back 70 pounds all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gets super addictive.</v>

3552
02:41:20.551 --> 02:41:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Like think about how addictive it is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play video games.</v>

3553
02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:23.873
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about competing against another </v>

3554
02:41:25.321 --> 02:41:27.450
<v Speaker 1>bow hunter and you talking shit to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

3555
02:41:27.451 --> 02:41:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Playing this game with deer walking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the field.</v>

3556
02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:32.520
<v Speaker 1>It's really great practice for actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting.</v>

3557
02:41:32.670 --> 02:41:33.503
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell it's very accurate to </v>

3558
02:41:34.711 --> 02:41:35.760
<v Speaker 1>wherever that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3559
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:39.130
<v Speaker 1>wherever the bolt hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking right.</v>

3560
02:41:39.131 --> 02:41:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Right on the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

3561

3574
02:42:10.021 --> 02:42:12.420

<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

3575
02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I just want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was doing that I,</v>

3576
02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was trial and error.</v>

3577
02:42:16.171 --> 02:42:21.171
<v Speaker 1>I would go to b and h photo in manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just buy shit and take it home,</v>

3578
02:42:21.241 --> 02:42:22.370
<v Speaker 1>hook it up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3579
02:42:22.390 --> 02:42:25.320
<v Speaker 1>that don't quite work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw something in the closet,</v>

3580
02:42:25.321 --> 02:42:26.154
<v Speaker 1>get something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And slowly built up what I needed to </v>

3581
02:42:29.191 --> 02:42:30.024
<v Speaker 1>have at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal was really to have lower thirds </v>

3582
02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:33.863
<v Speaker 1>and video over my shoulder and look into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera with a teleprompter so it </v>

3583
02:42:38.371 --> 02:42:39.204
<v Speaker 1>looked like the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was done by a drunk guy who is </v>

3584
02:42:43.890 --> 02:42:47.250
<v Speaker 1>good to go off and just sing karaoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible language.</v>

3585
02:42:47.430 --> 02:42:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Like that to me was always funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was a parody of a real tv show.</v>

3586
02:42:52.081 --> 02:42:52.914
<v Speaker 1>I want it to look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just a grainy camera with xbox </v>

3587
02:42:56.191 --> 02:42:57.024
<v Speaker 1>headset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just talking about this at the comedy </v>

3588
02:42:59.341 --> 02:43:00.174
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other night we were watching the </v>

3589
02:43:00.631 --> 02:43:01.464
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on the television and we're </v>

3590
02:43:02.611 --> 02:43:03.444
<v Speaker 1>saying how much better would the news </v>
<v Speaker 1>being if you get a couple of us and get </v>

3591
02:43:06.211 --> 02:43:08.450
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and start smoking weed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just.</v>

3592
02:43:08.910 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 1>But the real news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like actual real stores like oh</v>

3597
02:43:23.891 --> 02:43:24.724

<v Speaker 3>Like having a nightly news show or a </v>

3598
02:43:28.331 --> 02:43:32.650
<v Speaker 3>morning news show or just a show where </v>
<v Speaker 3>one hour of the day is just like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the news feed and you've got video to go</v>

3600
02:43:37.361 --> 02:43:42.010
<v Speaker 3>with it and you do a stoned out or drunk</v>
<v Speaker 3>new show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>PM and it's hilarious because he'll put </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the other day was talking about </v>

3604
02:43:54.361 --> 02:43:58.400

<v Speaker 1>but he does that on purpose.</v>

3610
02:44:12.541 --> 02:44:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Like he fucks with the graphics and the </v>

<v Speaker 2>competes with another company that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden they all just universally </v>

3676
02:46:57.441 --> 02:46:59.990
<v Speaker 2>decided on their own independently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

3682
02:47:11.151 --> 02:47:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of speech is about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government in this.</v>

3683
02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:14.931
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3684
02:47:14.931 --> 02:47:15.764
<v Speaker 2>but are you okay with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you okay with a faceless </v>

3685

<v Speaker 2>corporation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3686
02:47:20.901 --> 02:47:21.734
<v Speaker 2>deciding what you can watch and see and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear and who can speak based on nothing </v>

3687
02:47:25.761 --> 02:47:29.180
<v Speaker 2>but this arbitrary ideology that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a building.</v>

3688
02:47:29.390 --> 02:47:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that.</v>

3689
02:47:30.711 --> 02:47:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I want anyone to have the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak about anything they want,</v>

3690
02:47:35.691 --> 02:47:40.220
<v Speaker 2>no matter how repugnant it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like like meet it with a lively debate.</v>

02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the.</v>

3692
02:47:40.940 --> 02:47:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget Alex Jones was talking about what</v>

3693
02:47:44.901 --> 02:47:47.600
<v Speaker 2>we talked about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laura loomer versus louis farrakhan.</v>

3694
02:47:47.970 --> 02:47:48.803
<v Speaker 2>You where's your consistency?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to explain to me how that </v>

3695
02:47:50.391 --> 02:47:50.840
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

3696
02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:51.673
<v Speaker 2>How does that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it okay for the guy on twitter to be </v>

3697
02:47:53.451 --> 02:47:55.400
<v Speaker 2>calling jewish people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Termites?</v>

3698
02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:57.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

3699
02:47:57.710 --> 02:47:59.530
<v Speaker 2>That's something you exterminate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3700
02:47:59.531 --> 02:48:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nazi Germany type.</v>

3701
02:48:01.180 --> 02:48:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3702
02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:03.350
<v Speaker 2>How is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3703
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:05.360
<v Speaker 2>That's okay with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

3704
02:48:06.090 --> 02:48:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about look,</v>

3705
02:48:07.450 --> 02:48:08.283
<v Speaker 2>it works that way on the left as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how about that guy that just got </v>

3706
02:48:10.521 --> 02:48:14.590
<v Speaker 2>kicked off of cnn as he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the jewish people,</v>

3707
02:48:14.610 --> 02:48:15.443
<v Speaker 2>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>palestine and that he's for palestinian </v>

3708
02:48:17.421 --> 02:48:19.160
<v Speaker 2>liberation and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

3709
02:48:19.161 --> 02:48:19.994
<v Speaker 2>you're done like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This decision that or the thought </v>

3710
02:48:24.321 --> 02:48:25.154
<v Speaker 2>processes involved in decisions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they make is not based on rational </v>

3711
02:48:27.831 --> 02:48:30.710
<v Speaker 2>thinking and objective reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so arbitrary.</v>

3712
02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:32.083
<v Speaker 2>You just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's based on which way the culture </v>

3713
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:39.150
<v Speaker 2>swinging and the culture is swinging in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way that avoids any,</v>

3714
02:48:40.370 --> 02:48:44.390
<v Speaker 2>any possible accusations of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think in any way,</v>

3715
02:48:44.391 --> 02:48:46.280
<v Speaker 2>shape or form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be thought of as racist.</v>

3716
02:48:46.430 --> 02:48:47.263
<v Speaker 2>You avoid that because there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that say horrific shit about </v>

3717
02:48:50.091 --> 02:48:51.250
<v Speaker 2>white people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

3781
02:51:12.100 --> 02:51:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that anyone would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe all women is as mentally saying,</v>

3782
02:51:16.541 --> 02:51:17.820
<v Speaker 1>believed no women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like no one really wants equality.</v>

3786
02:51:30.250 --> 02:51:32.140

<v Speaker 1>Equality isn't good.</v>

3787
02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:33.393
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight for equality is where it's at </v>

3788
02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:39.250
<v Speaker 1>and you never want to attain it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not special anymore.</v>

3789
02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:42.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're fighting for equality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always a victim.</v>

3790
02:51:42.101 --> 02:51:42.934
<v Speaker 1>There's always a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oppressor and you're fighting that </v>

3791
02:51:45.070 --> 02:51:48.100
<v Speaker 1>once you're equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be called a shithead.</v>

3792
02:51:48.101 --> 02:51:51.100
<v Speaker 1>You could be called stupid everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

3793
02:51:51.101 --> 02:51:51.934
<v Speaker 1>You're just another face in the crowd </v>
<v Speaker 1>with another stupid voice that probably </v>

3794
02:51:54.221 --> 02:51:55.390
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3795
02:51:55.600 --> 02:52:00.260
<v Speaker 1>so no one ever really wants equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much they're clamoring was</v>

3796
02:52:00.430 --> 02:52:01.263
<v Speaker 1>get achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find some reason why </v>

3797
02:52:02.531 --> 02:52:04.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why it's not valid.</v>

3798
02:52:04.151 --> 02:52:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And you can still say that you're</v>

3799
02:52:06.220 --> 02:52:08.980
<v Speaker 2>being victimized by something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>currency in it.</v>

3800
02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:09.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3801
02:52:09.701 --> 02:52:10.421
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3802
02:52:10.421 --> 02:52:14.890
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely equity and being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim and not being equal yet,</v>

3803
02:52:15.590 --> 02:52:18.200
<v Speaker 2>but you're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say things that other people can</v>

3804
02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:19.990
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see it all ties.</v>

3805
02:52:19.991 --> 02:52:23.080
<v Speaker 2>You can be completely prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do a lot of things.</v>

3806
02:52:23.081 --> 02:52:24.940
<v Speaker 2>You could never do if you were another </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

3807
02:52:24.970 --> 02:52:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now you see this,</v>

3808
02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:28.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that avi naughty guy,</v>

3809
02:52:28.901 --> 02:52:29.734
<v Speaker 2>that lawyer just hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the whole believe all women and </v>

3810
02:52:33.941 --> 02:52:34.774
<v Speaker 2>then like a fucking movie script spins </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and bites him right in the ass </v>

3811
02:52:39.761 --> 02:52:41.350
<v Speaker 2>where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do that.</v>

3812
02:52:41.351 --> 02:52:42.184
<v Speaker 2>She's lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fact that it happened so </v>

3813
02:52:45.701 --> 02:52:46.534
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if that would have been hilarious </v>

3814
02:52:48.490 --> 02:52:49.323
<v Speaker 2>if it happened two years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that it happened right </v>

3815
02:52:52.091 --> 02:52:57.091
<v Speaker 2>after that is just beyond hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the asia argento chick,</v>

3816
02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:58.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3817
02:52:58.300 --> 02:52:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one,</v>

3818
02:52:59.170 --> 02:53:02.320
<v Speaker 2>the one who was accusing harvey </v>
<v Speaker 2>weinstein of raping her.</v>

3819
02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then turned out that she had been.</v>

3820
02:53:06.390 --> 02:53:08.520
<v Speaker 2>It's basically what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they call it?</v>

3821
02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Statutory rape when you have sex with 17</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old boy,</v>

3822
02:53:11.231 --> 02:53:12.064
<v Speaker 2>which.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3823
02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:15.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you think it is either,</v>

3824
02:53:15.281 --> 02:53:18.490
<v Speaker 2>but the law's the law and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it came out,</v>

3825
02:53:18.820 --> 02:53:23.050
<v Speaker 2>it came out that bordain had paid this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid off there the whole time.</v>

3826
02:53:23.051 --> 02:53:26.320
<v Speaker 2>They're all just believe all women and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like who don't believe that one.</v>

3827
02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3828
02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:28.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one we probably shouldn't believe.</v>

3829
02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem.</v>

3830
02:53:31.241 --> 02:53:34.690
<v Speaker 2>You got a real fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that all that went down,</v>

3831
02:53:34.930 --> 02:53:35.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just when these things play </v>

3832
02:53:38.021 --> 02:53:39.920
<v Speaker 2>out like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost makes you wonder like,</v>

3833
02:53:40.420 --> 02:53:41.260
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3834
02:53:41.261 --> 02:53:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe we're living in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation.</v>

3835
02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:49.510
<v Speaker 2>But if we were living in something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's designed to almost,</v>

3836
02:53:50.860 --> 02:53:55.860
<v Speaker 2>it instills this lack of appreciation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for reality,</v>

3837
02:53:57.980 --> 02:53:58.813
<v Speaker 2>it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all seems so bizarre and ludicrous </v>

3838
02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:02.373
<v Speaker 2>and it keeps people keep like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the anthony wiener got in trouble </v>

3839
02:54:04.691 --> 02:54:07.690
<v Speaker 2>for pulling his dick out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to god there was part of me that</v>

3840
02:54:07.691 --> 02:54:09.570
<v Speaker 2>was going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't even make sense.</v>

3841
02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Like this is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so obvious.</v>

3842
02:54:12.611 --> 02:54:15.010
<v Speaker 2>It's so like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3843
02:54:15.011 --> 02:54:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the button.</v>

3844
02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even subtle enough.</v>

3845
02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:19.773
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like everything works out too </v>

3846
02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:25.720
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's scripted.</v>

3847
02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Like during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during trump's campaign,</v>

3848
02:54:28.630 --> 02:54:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I kept saying he's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I go,</v>

3849
02:54:31.451 --> 02:54:33.490
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't win,</v>

3850
02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:35.890
<v Speaker 2>this isn't rocky one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has to be rocky too.</v>

3851
02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:36.993
<v Speaker 2>He's got a fucking win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about the battle and the </v>

3852
02:54:38.921 --> 02:54:41.980
<v Speaker 2>bravery and that he's got to win this </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this to work.</v>

3853
02:54:42.100 --> 02:54:44.980
<v Speaker 2>To really highlight the theater of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absurd.</v>

3854
02:54:45.010 --> 02:54:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to win.</v>

3855
02:54:46.490 --> 02:54:47.323
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all fucking one spotlights in </v>

3856
02:54:48.911 --> 02:54:51.670
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the theater of the absurd.</v>

3857
02:54:51.730 --> 02:54:52.563
<v Speaker 2>I mean that guy being president with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake hair sprayed down and orange skin </v>

3858
02:54:57.251 --> 02:55:00.190
<v Speaker 2>with the wider on the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all seems so fake.</v>

3859
02:55:00.191 --> 02:55:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Everything he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says the way he looks like.</v>

3860
02:55:03.381 --> 02:55:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is insane.</v>

3861
02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:05.893
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I see him walking down the </v>

3862
02:55:07.971 --> 02:55:09.650
<v Speaker 2>stairs at air force one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

3863
02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:13.010
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump is the president.</v>

3864
02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of wacky world of really wacky</v>

3865
02:55:18.651 --> 02:55:20.320
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideally wacky.</v>

3866
02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:21.553
<v Speaker 2>The other day when he was given that </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech about elvis and it's just like </v>

3867
02:55:25.610 --> 02:55:27.470
<v Speaker 2>people telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked like elvis.</v>

3868
02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:30.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what people have told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I wasn't blonde,</v>

3869
02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:32.980
<v Speaker 2>I looked like elvis and and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3870
02:55:33.050 --> 02:55:36.500
<v Speaker 2>no one told you that a little bit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>elvis.</v>

3871
02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:37.393
<v Speaker 2>No one ever told you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your belly right when elvis was </v>

3872
02:55:41.241 --> 02:55:44.270
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the ball for the last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's about it.</v>

3873
02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:48.500
<v Speaker 2>How about when that reporter confronted </v>
<v Speaker 2>him with the two of them together?</v>

3874
02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I look at that picture,</v>

3875
02:55:53.180 --> 02:55:55.070
<v Speaker 2>if he was to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a leg leg,</v>

3876
02:55:55.071 --> 02:55:57.700
<v Speaker 2>the king maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

3877
02:55:57.900 --> 02:56:01.490
<v Speaker 2>A little bit about the upper right hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner one.</v>

3878
02:56:01.491 --> 02:56:06.491
<v Speaker 2>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen anyone do that?</v>

3879
02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Fat was my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fat elvis.</v>

3880
02:56:13.150 --> 02:56:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Too much baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

3881
02:56:16.041 --> 02:56:16.874
<v Speaker 2>A thousand times now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen someone so committed </v>

3882
02:56:20.871 --> 02:56:23.810
<v Speaker 2>to a comb over for so many years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so committed.</v>

3883
02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:26.210
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

3884
02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:27.593
<v Speaker 2>It's a contraption walking up the stairs</v>
<v Speaker 2>of air force one where the wind's </v>

3885
02:56:31.401 --> 02:56:32.234
<v Speaker 2>blowing wind behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the whole back of his head is </v>

3886
02:56:33.981 --> 02:56:36.350
<v Speaker 2>bald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where's the hair coming from?</v>

3887
02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:37.213
<v Speaker 2>It was like a fucking vader's head </v>
<v Speaker 2>without the helmet is kind of looked </v>

3888
02:56:39.981 --> 02:56:41.990
<v Speaker 2>like that weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on?</v>

3889
02:56:42.230 --> 02:56:45.210
<v Speaker 2>You never know where it's starting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it ends at,</v>

3890
02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:46.790
<v Speaker 2>how long it is.</v>

3891
02:56:46.790 --> 02:56:48.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

3892
02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a picture.</v>

3893
02:56:50.390 --> 02:56:53.320
<v Speaker 2>The video is more disturbing because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the flops.</v>

3894
02:56:53.650 --> 02:56:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3895
02:56:54.740 --> 02:56:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3896
02:56:55.761 --> 02:56:56.660
<v Speaker 2>how about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3897
02:56:57.050 --> 02:56:57.883
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want to go out there for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>4th of July memorial because he didn't </v>

3898
02:57:01.251 --> 02:57:03.220
<v Speaker 2>want to get his hair with his hair wet </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the rain.</v>

3899
02:57:03.250 --> 02:57:04.250
<v Speaker 2>That was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3900
02:57:04.251 --> 02:57:05.084
<v Speaker 2>that's what they were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it's such a weird </v>

3901
02:57:08.871 --> 02:57:11.780
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was September 11th.</v>

3902
02:57:11.781 --> 02:57:12.614
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president of nine slash 11 was a </v>

3903
02:57:14.451 --> 02:57:19.451
<v Speaker 2>veteran's memorial or veteran's day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it odd that the president is a guy</v>

3904
02:57:21.771 --> 02:57:26.510
<v Speaker 2>that's so like insecure than ever for </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

3905

<v Speaker 2>a fucking dairy queen ice cream.</v>

02:57:31.041 --> 02:57:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Fucking move on his head every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's fat.</v>

3907
02:57:34.130 --> 02:57:34.963
<v Speaker 2>Like if your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is like if you really </v>

3908
02:57:36.261 --> 02:57:41.000
<v Speaker 2>concerned so much about your looks or </v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you fat while you're at it?</v>

3909
02:57:41.450 --> 02:57:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he thinks he's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like one of those guys that</v>

3910
02:57:44.271 --> 02:57:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you talked about having a body </v>
<v Speaker 2>dysmorphia body dysmorphia.</v>

3911
02:57:48.591 --> 02:57:50.870
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks in the mirror and sees elvis,</v>

3912
02:57:50.871 --> 02:57:53.960
<v Speaker 2>like young leather clad elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3913
02:57:53.961 --> 02:57:55.330
<v Speaker 2>He's got this weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3914
02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:58.640
<v Speaker 2>where he doesn't believe in exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he feels like the body is like a</v>

3915
02:57:58.641 --> 02:58:01.700
<v Speaker 2>battery and if you put any energy and</v>

3916
02:58:02.330 --> 02:58:03.900
<v Speaker 3>where is it out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3917
02:58:03.901 --> 02:58:06.070
<v Speaker 3>the motherfucker is up at all hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3918
02:58:06.290 --> 02:58:09.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the campaign for the midterms,</v>

3919
02:58:09.780 --> 02:58:14.430
<v Speaker 3>he was doing three rallies a day flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the country and he never seemed</v>

3920
02:58:14.431 --> 02:58:17.490
<v Speaker 3>to be like he was falling asleep or </v>
<v Speaker 3>losing energy.</v>

3921
02:58:17.491 --> 02:58:19.470
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3922
02:58:19.570 --> 02:58:21.960
<v Speaker 3>you know about all that he says I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>

3923
02:58:21.961 --> 02:58:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk,</v>

3924
02:58:23.400 --> 02:58:25.500
<v Speaker 3>I this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I that trump's nobody wants that.</v>

3925
02:58:25.501 --> 02:58:28.380
<v Speaker 3>During the oval office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run over to a building next door.</v>

3926
02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I get more exercise than people think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run over to a field basing my exercise</v>

3927
02:58:35.471 --> 02:58:38.160
<v Speaker 3>is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on allegedly,</v>

3928
02:58:38.190 --> 02:58:41.040
<v Speaker 3>according to one reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on diet pills and that he's been on</v>

3929
02:58:41.041 --> 02:58:44.070
<v Speaker 3>diet pills forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a prescription that,</v>

3930
02:58:44.350 --> 02:58:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3931
02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:45.873
<v Speaker 3>he actually even cited the exact dwayne </v>
<v Speaker 3>reed pharmacy where he was supposed to </v>

3932
02:58:49.891 --> 02:58:52.320
<v Speaker 3>take this for a little while and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wound up taking it for years.</v>

3933
02:58:52.540 --> 02:58:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I was taking some form of amphetamines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in this day and age,</v>

3934
02:58:57.790 --> 02:59:02.730
<v Speaker 3>if you would be fucking stunned if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>found out how many journalists,</v>

3935
02:59:02.910 --> 02:59:05.970
<v Speaker 3>how many people who are writers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people that are professionals,</v>

3936
02:59:06.090 --> 02:59:09.780
<v Speaker 3>how many people that work were on </v>
<v Speaker 3>adderall that I'm in.</v>

3937
02:59:09.810 --> 02:59:11.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in an area where there's a lot of</v>

3938
02:59:11.701 --> 02:59:12.534
<v Speaker 3>people that have money and they work </v>
<v Speaker 3>real hard and because of the fact that </v>

3939
02:59:15.271 --> 02:59:16.104
<v Speaker 3>they need energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a shitload of people that are </v>

3940
02:59:18.601 --> 02:59:19.700
<v Speaker 3>taken adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3941
02:59:19.800 --> 02:59:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Folks that are in hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks that are in finance,</v>

3942
02:59:23.401 --> 02:59:24.520
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3943
02:59:24.740 --> 02:59:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I know quite a few also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3944
02:59:26.451 --> 02:59:27.330
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everywhere,</v>

3945
02:59:27.331 --> 02:59:29.130
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is such a,</v>

3946
02:59:30.060 --> 02:59:30.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between methamphetamines </v>

3947
02:59:33.090 --> 02:59:33.923
<v Speaker 3>and amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference between math and what </v>

3948
02:59:36.091 --> 02:59:40.350
<v Speaker 3>you're getting when you get adderall is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so god damn close.</v>

3949
02:59:41.150 --> 02:59:42.650
<v Speaker 3>So close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But math,</v>

3950
02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:45.030
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy that you take that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

3951
02:59:45.060 --> 02:59:45.810
<v Speaker 3>you're a meth head.</v>

3952
02:59:45.810 --> 02:59:48.060
<v Speaker 3>The only difference is how quick it hits</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3953
02:59:48.260 --> 02:59:49.093
<v Speaker 3>It's literally the only difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the dosage that you get is </v>

3954
02:59:51.661 --> 02:59:54.360
<v Speaker 3>obviously regulated if you get adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3955
02:59:54.361 --> 02:59:55.470
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3956
02:59:55.471 --> 02:59:56.101
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3957
02:59:56.101 --> 02:59:57.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a pill guy.</v>

3958
02:59:57.671 --> 02:59:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I never have been.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what he said.</v>

3989
03:01:22.271 --> 03:01:23.104
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they're talking like that </v>

3990
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:26.560
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absurd.</v>

3991
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:31.090
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking funny that bull and </v>
<v Speaker 2>biden has said the same thing.</v>

3992
03:01:31.091 --> 03:01:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Like he kick his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a blake.</v>

3993
03:01:33.430 --> 03:01:37.030
<v Speaker 2>When did the truman and dewey trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>barbs like that?</v>

3994
03:01:37.031 --> 03:01:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Back in the day is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he saying?</v>

3995
03:01:38.830 --> 03:01:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Nixon and kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did make a mistake,</v>

3996
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:44.950
<v Speaker 2>but they asked me what I like to debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this gentleman.</v>

3997
03:01:45.550 --> 03:01:46.091
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3998
03:01:46.091 --> 03:01:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're in high school,</v>

3999
03:01:47.111 --> 03:01:52.111
<v Speaker 2>I've taken behind the gym and beat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell out of them mean well,</v>

4000
03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that.</v>

4001
03:01:54.010 --> 03:01:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I think trump would kick his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

4002
03:01:57.160 --> 03:01:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Trump is meaner and I think biden would </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a mistake,</v>

4003
03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:00.613
<v Speaker 2>yet trump better be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would swing any would slip and he </v>

4004
03:02:03.671 --> 03:02:04.504
<v Speaker 2>would fall and he'd fuck is nea and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump would kick him in the face like a </v>

4005
03:02:06.911 --> 03:02:08.740
<v Speaker 2>soccer ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would get lucky,</v>

4006
03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:09.613
<v Speaker 2>he would walk away and biden would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding this teeth and blood coming out </v>

4007
03:02:12.131 --> 03:02:14.200
<v Speaker 2>of his mouth and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you in the best,</v>

4008
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:16.210
<v Speaker 2>the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'd get away with it.</v>

4009
03:02:16.660 --> 03:02:20.470
<v Speaker 2>It gets away with a lot of things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a lot of people want to kick</v>

4010
03:02:20.471 --> 03:02:23.200
<v Speaker 2>trump's ass and get back at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would never manifested,</v>

4011
03:02:23.220 --> 03:02:25.960
<v Speaker 2>so would never come to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like what's going on now.</v>

4012
03:02:26.100 --> 03:02:28.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like where people thought stormy </v>
<v Speaker 2>daniels going to take them down.</v>

4013
03:02:28.950 --> 03:02:32.050
<v Speaker 2>And then it turns out stormy daniels </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat some checkup on a porn set.</v>

4014
03:02:32.050 --> 03:02:34.660
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now she's after menotti also because</v>

4015
03:02:34.661 --> 03:02:35.320
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

4069
03:04:55.910 --> 03:04:59.720
<v Speaker 2>You should never be president then </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's not what the job is.</v>

4070
03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:02.120
<v Speaker 2>That job's not some shit you put on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>resume.</v>

4071
03:05:02.180 --> 03:05:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4072
03:05:02.900 --> 03:05:04.850
<v Speaker 2>To be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a cookie.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like to be the queen.</v>

4075
03:05:08.600 --> 03:05:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like,</v>

4076
03:05:09.681 --> 03:05:13.400
<v Speaker 2>if you kiss my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would suck my toes.</v>

4077
03:05:13.880 --> 03:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>What would you would like it trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why trump comes off as like a,</v>

4078
03:05:19.280 --> 03:05:22.670
<v Speaker 2>just a bad stand up when he does those </v>
<v Speaker 2>rallies and everything.</v>

4079
03:05:22.880 --> 03:05:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Like you can tell when he's squinting at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prompter.</v>

4080
03:05:25.660 --> 03:05:26.493
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we as americans must blah blah blah </v>

4081
03:05:27.801 --> 03:05:28.634
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you see his eyes open and he's </v>

4082
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:32.360
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me tell you if he's all prompter.</v>

4083
03:05:32.361 --> 03:05:34.010

4085
03:05:36.570 --> 03:05:37.403

<v Speaker 2>when he talks about ice and he's like </v>

4086
03:05:39.500 --> 03:05:42.200
<v Speaker 2>the men and women of ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just amazing people.</v>

4087
03:05:42.500 --> 03:05:44.600
<v Speaker 2>A job that none of us want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to do.</v>

4088
03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:47.060
<v Speaker 2>And then he starts the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work this guy over here,</v>

4089
03:05:47.061 --> 03:05:48.260
<v Speaker 2>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to do it.</v>

4090
03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:53.240
<v Speaker 2>His wife knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crowd work like fuck.</v>

4091
03:05:53.241 --> 03:05:57.530
<v Speaker 2>It's the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking bizarre.</v>

4092
03:05:57.560 --> 03:05:58.393
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety minute speech that he gave this </v>

4093
03:06:00.620 --> 03:06:01.453
<v Speaker 2>rambling nonsense that people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the day the presidency </v>

4094
03:06:03.411 --> 03:06:05.870
<v Speaker 2>unraveled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was two years ago.</v>

4095
03:06:06.250 --> 03:06:09.920
<v Speaker 2>That shit was forever ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's still unraveling.</v>

4096
03:06:09.921 --> 03:06:10.510
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4097
03:06:10.510 --> 03:06:11.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not even unraveling.</v>

4098
03:06:11.841 --> 03:06:14.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we go back to the,</v>

4099
03:06:14.301 --> 03:06:15.134
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy as a whole and what we knew to </v>

4100
03:06:17.841 --> 03:06:18.674
<v Speaker 2>do because guaranteed in 2020,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be the pitch against </v>

4101
03:06:21.891 --> 03:06:22.724
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to return to some semblance of </v>

4102
03:06:25.840 --> 03:06:26.673
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a young democratic </v>

4103
03:06:28.821 --> 03:06:29.654
<v Speaker 2>socialist type character that says a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things that the young people want to </v>

4104
03:06:32.421 --> 03:06:33.100
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>

4105
03:06:33.100 --> 03:06:35.660
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like a completely anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

4106
03:06:35.661 --> 03:06:38.270
<v Speaker 2>anti homophobic trans rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

4107
03:06:38.660 --> 03:06:39.493
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who can hold it together and </v>

4108
03:06:42.591 --> 03:06:45.830
<v Speaker 2>someone doesn't have a good fucking box </v>
<v Speaker 2>above in the closet.</v>

4109
03:06:46.790 --> 03:06:49.250
<v Speaker 2>That's getting tougher and tougher to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find these days.</v>

4110
03:06:49.280 --> 03:06:50.113
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is some shit just fucking </v>

4111
03:06:52.280 --> 03:06:54.750
<v Speaker 2>graveyards falling out of people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>closets.</v>

4112
03:06:54.790 --> 03:06:58.650
<v Speaker 2>It's people that want to be in power </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all have these fucking skeletons.</v>

4113
03:06:59.540 --> 03:07:00.373
<v Speaker 2>What's the weird things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is these people that want to be in </v>

4114
03:07:02.611 --> 03:07:03.840
<v Speaker 2>power?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4115
03:07:04.650 --> 03:07:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at the.</v>

4116
03:07:06.721 --> 03:07:07.554
<v Speaker 2>I'm a politician like you just described</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a rally or a speech and behind them </v>

4117
03:07:11.851 --> 03:07:14.790
<v Speaker 2>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so well choreographed,</v>

4118
03:07:15.060 --> 03:07:19.320
<v Speaker 2>like every nationality is represented </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

4119
03:07:19.321 --> 03:07:23.490
<v Speaker 2>you just see it looks like something out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a fucking star trek episode that hats</v>

4120
03:07:23.491 --> 03:07:24.324
<v Speaker 2>from different lands and all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and it's like that to me is just </v>

4121
03:07:28.141 --> 03:07:33.141
<v Speaker 2>as fake and and potentially offensive as</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the trump background.</v>

4122
03:07:35.100 --> 03:07:39.660
<v Speaker 2>White trash is like laura dern running </v>
<v Speaker 2>star trek or star wars.</v>

4123
03:07:39.770 --> 03:07:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Just what it's like bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4124
03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:43.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4125
03:07:43.531 --> 03:07:44.670
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're doing.</v>

4126
03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Now that laura dern is a bad actress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a great actress.</v>

4127
03:07:47.280 --> 03:07:51.690
<v Speaker 2>But in that role and in this situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when she's like telling the pilot to</v>

4128
03:07:51.691 --> 03:07:54.120

<v Speaker 2>diversity and inclusiveness,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4139
03:08:26.361 --> 03:08:29.100
<v Speaker 2>like they've pushed every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no authenticity to their,</v>

4140
03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:29.953
<v Speaker 2>their message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to push every correct button </v>

4141
03:08:32.401 --> 03:08:35.520
<v Speaker 2>and say all the right notes and make all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right sounds.</v>

4142
03:08:35.521 --> 03:08:36.270
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

4145
03:08:38.090 --> 03:08:42.180
<v Speaker 2>they're complying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a compliance thing as much as it is</v>

4146
03:08:42.330 --> 03:08:43.163
<v Speaker 2>an expression of who they are as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals and have to be compliant </v>

4147
03:08:47.491 --> 03:08:50.070
<v Speaker 2>with this new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new way.</v>

4148
03:08:50.071 --> 03:08:53.430
<v Speaker 2>People are thinking and behaving but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so ham handed,</v>

4149
03:08:53.460 --> 03:08:55.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's really over the top.</v>

4150
03:08:55.620 --> 03:08:58.020
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a guy named wiener pulling his</v>

4151
03:08:58.021 --> 03:09:00.240
<v Speaker 2>dick out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not too obvious.</v>

4152
03:09:00.241 --> 03:09:01.590
<v Speaker 2>It's too clunky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

4153
03:09:01.591 --> 03:09:02.424
<v Speaker 2>Right on the head.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bad boys.</v>

4165
03:09:26.741 --> 03:09:29.180
<v Speaker 2>I read this the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4166
03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:30.533
<v Speaker 2>there's a broadway show of king kong is </v>
<v Speaker 2>now a broadway musical and they have </v>

4167
03:09:35.551 --> 03:09:40.551
<v Speaker 2>this amazing kind of marionette gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the stage giant fucking thing.</v>

4168
03:09:42.570 --> 03:09:44.990
<v Speaker 2>And the girl that plays a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an darrow,</v>

4171
03:09:50.761 --> 03:09:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole gist</v>

4172
03:09:54.130 --> 03:09:57.490
<v Speaker 1>of king kong is the fact that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>white broad,</v>

4173
03:09:57.790 --> 03:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>like the whole island is full of black </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicks.</v>

4174
03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:01.751
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

4175

<v Speaker 1>What's up with his face?</v>

4176
03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to make them,</v>

4177
03:10:06.671 --> 03:10:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost uh,</v>

4178
03:10:07.970 --> 03:10:08.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters look in the lion king </v>

4179
03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:11.860
<v Speaker 1>musical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4181
03:10:13.660 --> 03:10:15.970
<v Speaker 1>So is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I'm marrying it yet.</v>

4182
03:10:15.971 --> 03:10:18.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on cables and,</v>

4183
03:10:18.041 --> 03:10:22.050
<v Speaker 1>and shit and just people working it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how strange it.</v>

4184
03:10:22.060 --> 03:10:22.893
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a video clip of it and you </v>

4185
03:10:24.311 --> 03:10:25.810
<v Speaker 1>see it kind of move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

4186
03:10:26.020 --> 03:10:28.270
<v Speaker 1>It is strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to see a video,</v>

4187
03:10:28.660 --> 03:10:31.630
<v Speaker 1>but like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole fucking thing is based on.</v>

4188
03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:33.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the white chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4189
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:34.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it,</v>

4190
03:10:34.780 --> 03:10:37.180
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand.</v>

4191
03:10:37.181 --> 03:10:39.760
<v Speaker 1>You can cast a black actress and a white</v>
<v Speaker 1>actress as part as that,</v>

4192
03:10:39.900 --> 03:10:43.230
<v Speaker 1>but when it's so integral to the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this fucking got.</v>

03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

03:10:59.530 --> 03:11:01.490
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really is amazing.</v>

4201
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:03.100

<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

4202
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:04.503
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4203
03:11:06.810 --> 03:11:07.010
<v Speaker 1>pretty</v>

4204
03:11:07.010 --> 03:11:08.540
<v Speaker 3>bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was the old one.</v>

4205
03:11:08.570 --> 03:11:09.920
<v Speaker 3>The old one used to be a blonde chick.</v>

4206
03:11:09.980 --> 03:11:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>not anymore in our hands.</v>

4208
03:11:13.150 --> 03:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get a black trans man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4209
03:11:17.770 --> 03:11:18.603
<v Speaker 1>the whole gimmick is that kang has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this island with black chicks and he </v>

4210
03:11:22.211 --> 03:11:24.370
<v Speaker 1>sees her and just loses his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

4211
03:11:24.420 --> 03:11:25.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole bit of bike hurt it the </v>

4212
03:11:26.021 --> 03:11:27.460
<v Speaker 1>other night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fucking brilliant.</v>

4213
03:11:27.910 --> 03:11:30.160
<v Speaker 1>It's so goddamn funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is true.</v>

4214
03:11:30.161 --> 03:11:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like that movie is like the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist movie of all time.</v>

4215
03:11:33.811 --> 03:11:38.811
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

4216
03:11:39.330 --> 03:11:43.030
<v Speaker 1>when the remake came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Peter Jackson remake came</v>

4217
03:11:43.031 --> 03:11:43.980
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4218
03:11:44.020 --> 03:11:44.853
<v Speaker 1>patrice went off on it and did a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about what the movie represents </v>

4219
03:11:48.911 --> 03:11:49.744
<v Speaker 1>and what the chicken and the gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents an hour and it was fucking </v>

4220
03:11:52.631 --> 03:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only as patrice could have done it.</v>

4221
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

4222
03:11:56.590 --> 03:11:57.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he nailed it.</v>

4223
03:11:57.700 --> 03:12:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the movie frozen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little kids moving.</v>

4224
03:12:00.970 --> 03:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I never saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girl who</v>

4225
03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:04.353
<v Speaker 3>can fucking turning things into ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a disney version of live does </v>

4226
03:12:09.601 --> 03:12:14.601
<v Speaker 3>diversion that they've decided to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the live disney version there,</v>

4227
03:12:14.971 --> 03:12:18.040
<v Speaker 3>the girl is now played by a black girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

4228
03:12:18.160 --> 03:12:21.040
<v Speaker 3>it's a blonde girl who lives in like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Norway.</v>

4229
03:12:21.420 --> 03:12:25.900
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've decided to have her be played by</v>

4230
03:12:25.901 --> 03:12:29.200
<v Speaker 3>a black girl and people went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They send all these emails in like,</v>

4231
03:12:29.201 --> 03:12:30.900
<v Speaker 3>this is outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what are you do?</v>

4232
03:12:30.901 --> 03:12:31.840
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4233
03:12:31.870 --> 03:12:34.840
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like these companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4234
03:12:34.930 --> 03:12:37.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's too many people involved.</v>

4235
03:12:37.271 --> 03:12:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like compound media.</v>

4236
03:12:38.831 --> 03:12:40.570
<v Speaker 3>It's just the anthony kumi and making </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions.</v>

4237
03:12:40.610 --> 03:12:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With something like disney,</v>

4238
03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:46.780
<v Speaker 3>you have this board and you probably in </v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

4239
03:12:46.781 --> 03:12:48.520
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>women on the board.</v>

4240
03:12:48.521 --> 03:12:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine what that must be like.</v>

4241
03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:52.340
<v Speaker 3>You have to have equal</v>

4242
03:12:52.340 --> 03:12:53.173
<v Speaker 2>representation of everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's super concerned about </v>

4243
03:12:55.761 --> 03:12:58.400
<v Speaker 2>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at a fundraising pitch to show.</v>

4244
03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:00.133
<v Speaker 2>And when they walked in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first question they said he pitched </v>

4245
03:13:02.961 --> 03:13:03.471
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

4246
03:13:03.471 --> 03:13:05.090
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the diversity?</v>

4247
03:13:06.170 --> 03:13:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Where's the diversity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was pitching a sitcom.</v>

4248
03:13:10.040 --> 03:13:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Where's the diversity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4249
03:13:12.810 --> 03:13:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm just pitching you something funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A pitch.</v>

4250
03:13:14.581 --> 03:13:16.030
<v Speaker 2>You a funny program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4251
03:13:16.050 --> 03:13:16.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4252
03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:18.830
<v Speaker 2>We need a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need an asian man,</v>

4253
03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:21.320
<v Speaker 2>black woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We needed this and that.</v>

4254
03:13:21.350 --> 03:13:22.620
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about it,</v>

4255
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:25.730
<v Speaker 2>it's so obvious that it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>distracting.</v>

4256
03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:26.863
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to watch something </v>

4257
03:13:29.991 --> 03:13:32.690
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that diversity is just forced in there.</v>

4258
03:13:32.770 --> 03:13:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>

4259
03:13:33.831 --> 03:13:34.664
<v Speaker 2>you notice it and now you're distracted </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't really enjoy the things </v>

4260
03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:39.440
<v Speaker 2>like that king kong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do you,</v>

4261
03:13:39.620 --> 03:13:42.180
<v Speaker 2>how do they do the part where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4262
03:13:42.181 --> 03:13:45.860
<v Speaker 2>the natives on skull island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kong is just like ah,</v>

4263
03:13:45.861 --> 03:13:47.300
<v Speaker 2>get outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this one is like,</v>

4264
03:13:47.301 --> 03:13:48.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4265
03:13:48.790 --> 03:13:49.623
<v Speaker 2>there has to be something different and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely the hair color and skin </v>

4266
03:13:53.561 --> 03:13:53.790
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

4267
03:13:53.790 --> 03:13:54.623
<v Speaker 2>It's just what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's regardless of how horrible it is </v>

4268
03:13:57.531 --> 03:13:58.820
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever past.</v>

4269
03:13:58.821 --> 03:14:00.170
<v Speaker 2>That's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roll up.</v>

4270
03:14:00.200 --> 03:14:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Right and move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

4271
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time has passed you by old man.</v>

4272
03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Old white dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4273
03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old white dude doesn't like when a black</v>

4274
03:14:08.571 --> 03:14:12.830
<v Speaker 2>woman gets her role for all black women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all white women.</v>

4275
03:14:13.210 --> 03:14:14.043
<v Speaker 2>There are so many instances where that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine and no one would notice and </v>

4276
03:14:17.121 --> 03:14:18.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>

4277
03:14:18.170 --> 03:14:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with hamilton or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4278
03:14:20.871 --> 03:14:21.704
<v Speaker 2>They want to cast founding fathers as </v>
<v Speaker 2>black and hispanic dudes whatevs go at </v>

4279
03:14:26.121 --> 03:14:26.954
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like when it's an integral part of </v>

4280
03:14:29.001 --> 03:14:31.360
<v Speaker 2>the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's most of the stories.</v>

4281
03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:34.160
<v Speaker 2>It's most of the reason why loses his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

4282
03:14:34.380 --> 03:14:36.980
<v Speaker 2>He falls in love with the white chick a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole time.</v>

4283
03:14:37.070 --> 03:14:39.800
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's on camera in the movie.</v>

4284
03:14:40.380 --> 03:14:41.213
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're losing his mind because of the </v>

4285
03:14:42.411 --> 03:14:46.650
<v Speaker 2>white chick that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4286
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.863
<v Speaker 2>just don't make a movie then just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't make the movie or don't make the </v>

4287
03:14:51.681 --> 03:14:52.520
<v Speaker 2>play the.</v>

4288
03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:53.353
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get to make the playbook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have a black woman of </v>

4289
03:14:54.891 --> 03:14:55.724
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a young woman of </v>

4290
03:14:56.691 --> 03:14:57.524
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite criticisms is how </v>

4291
03:15:00.981 --> 03:15:04.850
<v Speaker 2>dare to white people have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion without a person of color.</v>

4292
03:15:04.910 --> 03:15:05.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

4293
03:15:05.601 --> 03:15:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4294
03:15:06.350 --> 03:15:09.140
<v Speaker 2>We'll probably catch shit for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's from who?</v>

4295
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:11.450
<v Speaker 2>From who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can go fuck themselves.</v>

4296
03:15:12.150 --> 03:15:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Who would you propose this idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that.</v>

4297
03:15:14.571 --> 03:15:15.291
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

4298
03:15:15.291 --> 03:15:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before we go any further,</v>

4299
03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:18.650
<v Speaker 2>let's bring it a person of color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4300
03:15:18.651 --> 03:15:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A person of color.</v>

4301
03:15:20.110 --> 03:15:21.250
<v Speaker 2>How should we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are.</v>

4302
03:15:21.310 --> 03:15:23.410
<v Speaker 2>We were too privileged people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't be discussing.</v>

4303
03:15:23.540 --> 03:15:24.373
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't even communicate about </v>

4304
03:15:25.701 --> 03:15:26.180
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4305
03:15:26.180 --> 03:15:27.013
<v Speaker 2>no you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all we hear about is how we need an </v>

4306
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.863
<v Speaker 2>open and honest discussion about race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second year try to half </v>

4307
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:35.390
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>

4308
03:15:35.450 --> 03:15:36.283
<v Speaker 2>Don't talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's one that everybody keeps </v>

4309
03:15:37.401 --> 03:15:39.500
<v Speaker 2>ignoring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to know what's racist?</v>

4310
03:15:39.650 --> 03:15:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Harvard tries really hard to keep asian </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out.</v>

4311
03:15:43.520 --> 03:15:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4312
03:15:43.930 --> 03:15:44.763
<v Speaker 2>Make you get way more difficult because </v>
<v Speaker 2>asian people are far better at school </v>

4313
03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:49.980
<v Speaker 2>than white people.</v>

4314
03:15:50.010 --> 03:15:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have to balance it.</v>

4315
03:15:53.200 --> 03:15:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It would be full of asians if everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

4316
03:15:57.450 --> 03:15:59.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got accepted for qualifications,</v>

4317
03:16:00.060 --> 03:16:01.980
<v Speaker 1>that would be asian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harvard.</v>

4318
03:16:02.010 --> 03:16:02.843
<v Speaker 1>But it is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are rallying against </v>

4319
03:16:04.921 --> 03:16:05.754
<v Speaker 1>racial discrimination don't look at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that is absolute racial </v>

4320
03:16:08.491 --> 03:16:10.560
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other end of the spectrum,</v>

4321
03:16:10.640 --> 03:16:11.160
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4322
03:16:11.160 --> 03:16:14.820
<v Speaker 1>You're taking these people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are a minority.</v>

4323
03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:15.783
<v Speaker 1>There are a small percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population and they vastly outperform </v>

4324
03:16:18.990 --> 03:16:20.110
<v Speaker 1>most other groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4325
03:16:20.140 --> 03:16:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

4326
03:16:21.301 --> 03:16:23.640
<v Speaker 1>harvard has made it more difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to get in.</v>

4327
03:16:23.641 --> 03:16:24.474
<v Speaker 1>And now there's a giant class action </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit against one of the most liberal </v>

4328
03:16:27.001 --> 03:16:31.620
<v Speaker 1>and progressive institutes of higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning ever racist.</v>

4329
03:16:31.680 --> 03:16:34.830
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking undeniably racist is </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

4330
03:16:34.890 --> 03:16:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the superior people.</v>

4331
03:16:37.650 --> 03:16:41.460
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely based on nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's race,</v>

4332
03:16:41.461 --> 03:16:43.680
<v Speaker 1>ethnic background and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

4333
03:16:43.681 --> 03:16:44.514
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it.</v>

4334
03:16:44.620 --> 03:16:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it for now,</v>

4335
03:16:46.830 --> 03:16:47.663
<v Speaker 1>for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't hear about this from the </v>

4336
03:16:48.811 --> 03:16:49.644
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors and now no race </v>
<v Speaker 1>baiters they want to go on about white </v>

4337
03:16:52.441 --> 03:16:54.790
<v Speaker 1>privilege and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4338
03:16:54.880 --> 03:16:56.010
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4339
03:16:56.090 --> 03:16:56.923
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like bringing shit up that I </v>

4340
03:16:58.411 --> 03:16:59.244
<v Speaker 1>notice and if I notice that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>squeezing diversity into something that </v>

4341
03:17:02.701 --> 03:17:04.140
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4342
03:17:04.141 --> 03:17:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it looks like I said distracting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's out of place.</v>

4343
03:17:07.980 --> 03:17:10.470
<v Speaker 1>And then other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the other day I noticed,</v>

4344
03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:11.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4345
03:17:11.290 --> 03:17:13.920
<v Speaker 1>and you probably shouldn't even say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

4346
03:17:13.921 --> 03:17:14.754
<v Speaker 1>a mars probe that just landed on mars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they showed the control room at jet </v>

4347
03:17:18.901 --> 03:17:21.840
<v Speaker 1>propulsion laboratories and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>applauding.</v>

4348
03:17:22.590 --> 03:17:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Could possibly be the least diverse room</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen in my life.</v>

4349
03:17:26.680 --> 03:17:29.610
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of white nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it was.</v>

4350
03:17:29.790 --> 03:17:32.880
<v Speaker 1>There were a couple of like a big women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4351
03:17:32.881 --> 03:17:34.400
<v Speaker 1>like a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4352
03:17:34.860 --> 03:17:36.090
<v Speaker 1>lesbians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesbians,</v>

4353
03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:39.450
<v Speaker 1>a couple of them in there.</v>

4354
03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:40.553
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was every nerdy guy grown up and </v>

4355
03:17:43.950 --> 03:17:48.950
<v Speaker 1>landing a fucking spec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a billion miles away on fucking mars.</v>

4356
03:17:50.740 --> 03:17:55.200
<v Speaker 1>It's insane because when it push comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shove,</v>

4357
03:17:55.230 --> 03:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>you need the people that can get the job</v>
<v Speaker 1>done and if it's that room of people,</v>

4358
03:17:59.581 --> 03:18:00.414
<v Speaker 1>it's that room of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't artificially diversify </v>

4359
03:18:04.141 --> 03:18:08.220
<v Speaker 1>something just for the optic and get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>job done.</v>

4360
03:18:08.250 --> 03:18:10.800
<v Speaker 1>They had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in that room had a reason to be</v>

4361
03:18:10.801 --> 03:18:13.560
<v Speaker 1>there and I assume it's based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualifications,</v>

4362
03:18:13.770 --> 03:18:18.770
<v Speaker 1>but if you notice that or mention it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'll be called a fucking racist</v>

4363
03:18:18.931 --> 03:18:19.740
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4364
03:18:19.740 --> 03:18:20.573
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever notice things you can't </v>

4365
03:18:21.880 --> 03:18:23.820
<v Speaker 1>switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule is don't notice.</v>

4366
03:18:23.821 --> 03:18:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Trends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't notice things.</v>

4367
03:18:25.541 --> 03:18:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's going away though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really do.</v>

4368
03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it lasting.</v>

4369
03:18:30.990 --> 03:18:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's a,</v>

4370
03:18:33.321 --> 03:18:34.154
<v Speaker 1>a bright wave of nonsense that's hitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>us and it's going to balance back out </v>

4371
03:18:38.521 --> 03:18:40.090
<v Speaker 1>and rational thinking is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you.</v>

4372
03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that drives me</v>

4373
03:18:42.211 --> 03:18:43.110
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4374
03:18:43.440 --> 03:18:45.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>address your white privilege.</v>

4375
03:18:45.631 --> 03:18:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Recognize your white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4376
03:18:47.530 --> 03:18:48.363
<v Speaker 1>You know why</v>

4377
03:18:48.490 --> 03:18:49.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4378
03:18:49.901 --> 03:18:52.750
<v Speaker 3>so if I'm not racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be concentrating on racism.</v>

4379
03:18:52.990 --> 03:18:53.823
<v Speaker 3>He shouldn't be concentrating on people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who don't experience racism because </v>

4380
03:18:57.071 --> 03:18:59.290
<v Speaker 3>there fortunately white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I didn't do anything,</v>

4381
03:18:59.380 --> 03:19:00.213
<v Speaker 3>didn't do anything just by being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they're doing is they're </v>

4382
03:19:01.751 --> 03:19:02.584
<v Speaker 3>putting you in a position where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>always guilty and once they put you in </v>

4383
03:19:05.231 --> 03:19:06.064
<v Speaker 3>that box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always can shut you up because </v>

4384
03:19:08.081 --> 03:19:11.500
<v Speaker 3>there the logic is not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the discourse is not.</v>

4385
03:19:11.501 --> 03:19:14.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really nuanced.</v>

4386
03:19:14.200 --> 03:19:15.033
<v Speaker 3>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to be able to just push a </v>

4387
03:19:16.691 --> 03:19:17.524
<v Speaker 3>button and shut you off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That button is the white privilege </v>

4388
03:19:19.901 --> 03:19:20.980
<v Speaker 3>button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's.</v>

4389
03:19:21.010 --> 03:19:23.380
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at a reality.</v>

4390
03:19:23.381 --> 03:19:24.214
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do white people have it easier than </v>

4391
03:19:24.941 --> 03:19:27.220
<v Speaker 3>people who get racially discriminated </v>
<v Speaker 3>against?</v>

4392
03:19:27.280 --> 03:19:28.113
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is not the white people </v>

4393
03:19:29.021 --> 03:19:29.854
<v Speaker 3>that have it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the people that racially </v>

4394
03:19:31.271 --> 03:19:32.570
<v Speaker 3>discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4395
03:19:32.571 --> 03:19:34.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're looking at the wrong thing.</v>

4396
03:19:34.870 --> 03:19:35.703
<v Speaker 3>So you're finding somebody you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make them a bad person just by being </v>

4397
03:19:39.310 --> 03:19:40.260
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

4398
03:19:40.300 --> 03:19:43.030
<v Speaker 3>the thing that you've decided is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor.</v>

4399
03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a racist thing.</v>

4400
03:19:44.810 --> 03:19:45.643
<v Speaker 1>Everything is the same level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you have an opinion about </v>

4401
03:19:48.471 --> 03:19:49.304
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just voicing an opinion about something </v>

4402
03:19:51.261 --> 03:19:54.200
<v Speaker 1>that involves race or sexuality or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

4403
03:19:54.620 --> 03:19:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and literally calling for violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>against people of.</v>

4404
03:19:59.360 --> 03:20:02.480
<v Speaker 1>It's all in the same category when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

4405
03:20:02.600 --> 03:20:03.433
<v Speaker 1>You could have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personal opinion on anything that </v>

4406
03:20:06.410 --> 03:20:07.970
<v Speaker 1>is sensitive these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

4407
03:20:07.971 --> 03:20:08.804
<v Speaker 1>race or sexuality or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything unless you use </v>

4408
03:20:14.180 --> 03:20:18.560
<v Speaker 1>some kind of negativity or oppression or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something against,</v>

4409
03:20:18.780 --> 03:20:21.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person because of your opinion.</v>

4410
03:20:21.590 --> 03:20:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you do that,</v>

4411
03:20:23.150 --> 03:20:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you just have a fucking opinion and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all that dangerous.</v>

4412
03:20:28.250 --> 03:20:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patrice used to say that too.</v>

4413
03:20:30.051 --> 03:20:30.884
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never met a racist in my life because </v>

4414
03:20:32.240 --> 03:20:33.073
<v Speaker 1>I never met one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never sat down and had someone calling </v>

4415
03:20:36.080 --> 03:20:38.540
<v Speaker 1>the n word or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to never met one.</v>

4416
03:20:38.580 --> 03:20:39.800
<v Speaker 1>He's been in the wrong places.</v>

4417
03:20:39.870 --> 03:20:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe take them to some places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4418
03:20:43.180 --> 03:20:44.013
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have somebody that has a </v>

4419
03:20:46.491 --> 03:20:49.120
<v Speaker 1>low opinion of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of black people and,</v>

4420
03:20:49.130 --> 03:20:49.963
<v Speaker 1>and just go into a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit down and there's a black dude </v>

4421
03:20:52.581 --> 03:20:55.430
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and watching the yankee </v>
<v Speaker 1>game or something and go,</v>

4422
03:20:55.431 --> 03:20:56.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4423
03:20:56.210 --> 03:20:56.990
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4424
03:20:56.990 --> 03:20:58.310
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The yankees are winning.</v>

4425
03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:01.310
<v Speaker 1>D is the guy gotta to turn around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

4426
03:21:01.311 --> 03:21:04.160

<v Speaker 1>to go?</v>

4427
03:21:04.161 --> 03:21:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

4428
03:21:05.420 --> 03:21:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>

4429
03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:09.030
<v Speaker 1>there's levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

4430
03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:09.883
<v Speaker 1>He might have an idea about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until you start exercising that I </v>

4431
03:21:13.370 --> 03:21:15.530
<v Speaker 1>don't honestly don't see a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4432
03:21:15.920 --> 03:21:17.170
<v Speaker 1>This piece of discrimination eight,</v>

4433
03:21:17.310 --> 03:21:21.420
<v Speaker 3>and they have discrim discriminatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas about all sorts of things.</v>

4434
03:21:21.780 --> 03:21:22.613
<v Speaker 3>It's just when you allow some but don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow others when you allow </v>

4435
03:21:26.941 --> 03:21:30.300
<v Speaker 3>discrimination against white people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't allow it against black.</v>

4436
03:21:31.170 --> 03:21:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Create resentment when you allow </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination against men,</v>

4437
03:21:34.290 --> 03:21:35.123
<v Speaker 3>but don't allow it against women because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like women have been </v>

4438
03:21:37.171 --> 03:21:38.820
<v Speaker 3>victimized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's our time.</v>

4439
03:21:38.970 --> 03:21:41.550
<v Speaker 3>It's our turn will know it doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

4440
03:21:41.750 --> 03:21:43.590
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you're talking to people</v>

4441
03:21:43.591 --> 03:21:44.424
<v Speaker 3>that aren't rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call everybody a rapist and the people </v>

4442
03:21:47.121 --> 03:21:48.080
<v Speaker 3>who aren't rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

4443
03:21:48.081 --> 03:21:49.070
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4444
03:21:49.071 --> 03:21:50.630
<v Speaker 3>So you think everybody's a rapist will </v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

4445
03:21:50.631 --> 03:21:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Will you are fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they start changing what?</v>

4446
03:21:52.741 --> 03:21:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Rape,</v>

4447
03:21:53.360 --> 03:21:53.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4448
03:21:53.901 --> 03:21:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what the,</v>

4449
03:21:54.890 --> 03:21:57.800
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously the uh,</v>

4450
03:21:58.220 --> 03:21:59.053
<v Speaker 1>like the louis ck situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that is so people are so divided </v>

4451
03:22:02.481 --> 03:22:03.314
<v Speaker 1>on that one and my opinion is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't do anything or make anyone </v>

4452
03:22:09.711 --> 03:22:10.544
<v Speaker 1>do anything against their will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a guy that has a strange </v>

4453
03:22:14.091 --> 03:22:15.560
<v Speaker 1>proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4454
03:22:15.561 --> 03:22:16.394
<v Speaker 1>he likes jerking off in front of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the cat's out of the bag </v>

4455
03:22:18.951 --> 03:22:23.660
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like where those girls that upset 20</v>

4456
03:22:23.661 --> 03:22:27.590
<v Speaker 1>years ago with a that upset 20 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4457
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:30.830
<v Speaker 1>that now it's an issue or with a giggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they let,</v>

4458
03:22:30.831 --> 03:22:31.664
<v Speaker 1>like I need to know how they were then </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't give a fuck what you </v>

4459
03:22:34.581 --> 03:22:36.950
<v Speaker 1>think now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at the time,</v>

4460
03:22:37.520 --> 03:22:38.780
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4461
03:22:38.781 --> 03:22:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Was it cool with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4462
03:22:39.631 --> 03:22:43.370
<v Speaker 1>did you sit there and fucking rib the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elbow to the ribs with you girlfriend?</v>

4463
03:22:43.371 --> 03:22:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I go look at this guy jerking off in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of us.</v>

4464
03:22:45.460 --> 03:22:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

4465
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what time is done because it,</v>

4466
03:22:51.320 --> 03:22:51.951
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4467
03:22:51.951 --> 03:22:53.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way something looks,</v>

4468
03:22:53.630 --> 03:22:58.630
<v Speaker 1>the morality or ethics or respect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is expected in 2018 ain't what it was 20</v>

4469
03:23:00.321 --> 03:23:01.154
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't be held liable for </v>

4470
03:23:02.901 --> 03:23:03.734
<v Speaker 1>something you did 20 years ago when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was normal or a little strange or </v>

4471
03:23:07.431 --> 03:23:08.750
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4472
03:23:08.751 --> 03:23:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's always been weird to beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>off in front of people.</v>

4473
03:23:10.850 --> 03:23:12.230
<v Speaker 1>That's an odd thing to do.</v>

4474
03:23:12.530 --> 03:23:15.470
<v Speaker 3>I think about it as though he asked if </v>
<v Speaker 3>he could write,</v>

4475
03:23:15.620 --> 03:23:17.860
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that I've brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>up to people go,</v>

4476
03:23:17.890 --> 03:23:18.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people say,</v>

4477
03:23:18.860 --> 03:23:19.340
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4478
03:23:19.340 --> 03:23:22.130
<v Speaker 3>he would lock these women in the room </v>
<v Speaker 3>and beat off to stop the.</v>

4479
03:23:22.170 --> 03:23:23.510
<v Speaker 3>If you're to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get like,</v>

4480
03:23:23.511 --> 03:23:24.344
<v Speaker 3>push this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying that because that fits </v>

4481
03:23:26.451 --> 03:23:27.284
<v Speaker 3>your narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's this abusive person who's abusing </v>

4482
03:23:29.781 --> 03:23:31.550
<v Speaker 3>his power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now here's another problem with that.</v>

4483
03:23:31.790 --> 03:23:34.130
<v Speaker 3>When this was all going down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't very famous.</v>

4484
03:23:34.400 --> 03:23:35.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just a tosa.</v>

4485
03:23:35.601 --> 03:23:37.280
<v Speaker 3>What power was he abusing it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

4486
03:23:37.370 --> 03:23:38.203
<v Speaker 3>he was a successful comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was admired by his peers because he </v>

4487
03:23:41.331 --> 03:23:44.130
<v Speaker 3>was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't louis c,</v>

4488
03:23:44.131 --> 03:23:47.300
<v Speaker 3>k like the superstar filling out madison</v>
<v Speaker 3>square garden,</v>

4489
03:23:47.301 --> 03:23:49.400
<v Speaker 3>louis ck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the same guy,</v>

4490
03:23:49.730 --> 03:23:50.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4491
03:23:50.240 --> 03:23:51.073
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even have all the hbo specials</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the netflix specials was the </v>

4492
03:23:53.690 --> 03:23:54.523
<v Speaker 3>same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was just another comic that like </v>

4493
03:23:56.631 --> 03:23:59.030
<v Speaker 3>to beat off in front of people and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would ask first.</v>

4494
03:23:59.270 --> 03:24:01.400
<v Speaker 3>So when you say that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4495
03:24:01.610 --> 03:24:03.710
<v Speaker 3>forced these women and wouldn't let them</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave,</v>

4496
03:24:03.770 --> 03:24:07.550
<v Speaker 3>none of them say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact he asked and when they said no,</v>

4497
03:24:07.640 --> 03:24:09.470
<v Speaker 3>he didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't say,</v>

4498
03:24:09.500 --> 03:24:10.730
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well good.</v>

4499
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:13.790
<v Speaker 3>You don't want me to beat off that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make it feel even better when I beat off</v>

4500
03:24:14.210 --> 03:24:16.700
<v Speaker 3>in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up and sit down.</v>

4501
03:24:17.090 --> 03:24:18.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't do anything.</v>

4502
03:24:18.380 --> 03:24:20.150
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was asking which is,</v>

4503
03:24:20.570 --> 03:24:23.480
<v Speaker 1>which is so strange but weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

4504
03:24:23.540 --> 03:24:27.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not in the same realm as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as harvey weinstein's.</v>

4505
03:24:27.811 --> 03:24:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not</v>

4506
03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:31.110
<v Speaker 3>even fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even close.</v>

4507
03:24:31.140 --> 03:24:31.973
<v Speaker 3>It's not even close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people don't want you to </v>

4508
03:24:33.391 --> 03:24:36.630
<v Speaker 3>rationalize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't want you to grade things.</v>

4509
03:24:36.631 --> 03:24:37.464
<v Speaker 3>They just want to talk about abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All abuse gets shoveled into this one </v>

4510
03:24:40.921 --> 03:24:45.180
<v Speaker 3>little pie chart area like this is male </v>
<v Speaker 3>abusers,</v>

4511
03:24:45.420 --> 03:24:48.630
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll put matt lauer right </v>
<v Speaker 3>next to bill cosby,</v>

4512
03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:50.100
<v Speaker 3>right next to louis ck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4513
03:24:50.101 --> 03:24:51.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this seems kind of crazy.</v>

4514
03:24:51.871 --> 03:24:54.000
<v Speaker 3>And then when you say it's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like matt damon said,</v>

4515
03:24:54.001 --> 03:24:55.800
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should make a distinction.</v>

4516
03:24:56.840 --> 03:24:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be,</v>

4517
03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:06.140
<v Speaker 1>you become a rape apologist and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

4518
03:25:06.141 --> 03:25:10.130
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because it's odd because even</v>

4519
03:25:10.131 --> 03:25:10.964
<v Speaker 1>saying the word rape these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little red flag goes off in your </v>

4520
03:25:14.511 --> 03:25:15.170
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4521
03:25:15.170 --> 03:25:16.450
<v Speaker 1>how did I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I say,</v>

4522
03:25:16.970 --> 03:25:19.150
<v Speaker 1>did I say it evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a sound.</v>

4523
03:25:19.170 --> 03:25:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Evil are salivating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4524
03:25:21.100 --> 03:25:21.933
<v Speaker 1>Don't be salivating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't smile when you say it's very </v>

4525
03:25:23.721 --> 03:25:25.480
<v Speaker 1>somber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4526
03:25:25.810 --> 03:25:27.320
<v Speaker 1>it is strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

4527
03:25:27.321 --> 03:25:29.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use the term all the time because it's</v>

4528
03:25:29.901 --> 03:25:34.740
<v Speaker 1>the only one that really fits orwellian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is so strange now it,</v>

4529
03:25:35.030 --> 03:25:35.863
<v Speaker 1>if you read 1984 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't fathom things getting like </v>

4530
03:25:40.131 --> 03:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

4531
03:25:41.901 --> 03:25:45.380
<v Speaker 1>in some cases it's even worse than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than expected.</v>

4532
03:25:45.630 --> 03:25:50.000
<v Speaker 1>You think there aren't an unperson you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think there's an unpaid Alex Jones</v>

4533
03:25:50.090 --> 03:25:53.630
<v Speaker 1>unperson wipe them clean from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that's it.</v>

4534
03:25:54.040 --> 03:25:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4535
03:25:54.860 --> 03:25:55.850
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4536
03:25:56.210 --> 03:25:57.043
<v Speaker 1>new speak words are twisted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it means the opposite of what it </v>

4537
03:26:01.401 --> 03:26:02.390
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to me.</v>

4538
03:26:02.450 --> 03:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4540
03:26:05.110 --> 03:26:07.870
<v Speaker 1>it's something that you never thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>would happen to.</v>

4541
03:26:07.940 --> 03:26:08.773
<v Speaker 1>I always thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we read a book like that or some other </v>

4542

<v Speaker 1>like an orb is supposed to be some kind </v>

4544
03:26:17.841 --> 03:26:21.500
<v Speaker 1>of orb with the government looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and don't do that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's no off the grid anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no awkward.</v>

4645
03:30:45.720 --> 03:30:47.150
<v Speaker 1>The whole world's going to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>somebody else.</v>

4653
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it amazing that gps has worked for</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it has?</v>

4654
03:31:08.001 --> 03:31:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flawlessly.</v>

4655
03:31:09.321 --> 03:31:10.154
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how good it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never a problem inch by inch like </v>

4656
03:31:12.831 --> 03:31:15.420
<v Speaker 1>literally tells you turn right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're right there.</v>

4657
03:31:16.060 --> 03:31:18.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think we have the dumbed down </v>
<v Speaker 1>version,</v>

4658
03:31:18.441 --> 03:31:22.700
<v Speaker 1>like the military has that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the premium version like sure.</v>

4659
03:31:22.730 --> 03:31:23.480

<v Speaker 1>by the inch and we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4661
03:31:25.400 --> 03:31:26.233
<v Speaker 1>buy a couple of feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's to me it's amazing that like </v>

4662
03:31:30.090 --> 03:31:32.460
<v Speaker 1>it's worked this long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never goes out.</v>

4663
03:31:32.470 --> 03:31:33.303
<v Speaker 1>like oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really had it on cd rom and my car </v>

<v Speaker 1>in 1998 styling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4665
03:31:39.771 --> 03:31:40.604
<v Speaker 1>I had the early version of of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a big stupid thing that had to </v>

4666
03:31:44.761 --> 03:31:48.260
<v Speaker 1>sit on top of the roof of my car to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch up to catch the satellite,</v>

4667
03:31:48.380 --> 03:31:49.213
<v Speaker 1>like a disc or like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird antenna that had to go up </v>

4668
03:31:52.011 --> 03:31:52.844
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4669
03:31:53.230 --> 03:31:55.640
<v Speaker 1>They used to have to have to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4670
03:31:55.641 --> 03:31:56.474
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gps and the satellites aren't any </v>

4671
03:31:57.981 --> 03:32:00.270
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the receivers are like,</v>

4672
03:32:00.290 --> 03:32:01.123
<v Speaker 1>can be a lot smaller and fucking phones </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your fucking things up while it's in </v>

4673
03:32:03.771 --> 03:32:04.604
<v Speaker 1>your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're tracking you while it's in your </v>

4674
03:32:05.871 --> 03:32:07.040
<v Speaker 1>pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your car,</v>

4675
03:32:07.041 --> 03:32:09.260
<v Speaker 1>as you're driving course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's off,</v>

4676
03:32:09.290 --> 03:32:11.900
<v Speaker 1>when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust any of these electronics.</v>

4677
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.823
<v Speaker 1>I use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to throw my fucking phone </v>

4678
03:32:14.001 --> 03:32:15.950
<v Speaker 1>away and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I do forget it,</v>

4679
03:32:15.951 --> 03:32:20.000
<v Speaker 1>there's no board horrifying feeLing than</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving away from your house and go,</v>

4680
03:32:20.330 --> 03:32:23.000
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have my tracking device.</v>

4681
03:32:23.360 --> 03:32:27.140
<v Speaker 1>And you will turn around and get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't function without it.</v>

4682
03:32:27.230 --> 03:32:29.780
<v Speaker 1>It's everything to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

4683
03:32:29.781 --> 03:32:30.614
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was that emp or whatever the </v>

4684
03:32:32.241 --> 03:32:35.090
<v Speaker 1>fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just zaps the grid,</v>

4685
03:32:35.840 --> 03:32:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you would say pandemonium in no time.</v>

4686
03:32:39.860 --> 03:32:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would see pandemonium.</v>

4687
03:32:41.331 --> 03:32:43.760
<v Speaker 1>It was just the power grid went down for</v>
<v Speaker 1>any reason.</v>

4688
03:32:43.761 --> 03:32:46.550
<v Speaker 1>If someone like a terrorist attack took </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the power grid,</v>

4689
03:32:46.940 --> 03:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>we need power way more than we think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

4690
03:32:49.760 --> 03:32:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

4691
03:32:50.920 --> 03:32:53.600
<v Speaker 1>You think nothing of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We in New York,</v>

4692
03:32:53.601 --> 03:32:56.900
<v Speaker 1>we had a hurricane a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like five or six years ago,</v>

4693
03:32:56.901 --> 03:32:59.630
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm the one that took out jersey and</v>

4694
03:32:59.631 --> 03:33:01.880
<v Speaker 1>long island and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4695
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:06.680
<v Speaker 1>we went nine days without power in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house on long island.</v>

4696
03:33:07.190 --> 03:33:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And you could see it fraying around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edges,</v>

4697
03:33:10.041 --> 03:33:11.090
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Society,</v>

4698
03:33:11.091 --> 03:33:11.924

<v Speaker 1>on online at the gas station of philip </v>

4699
03:33:15.530 --> 03:33:18.230
<v Speaker 1>jerry cans to take back to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>generators at the house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Get to the back of the line now.</v>

4708
03:33:32.121 --> 03:33:37.121
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if that was you trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get your kids medication or something</v>

4709
03:33:38.730 --> 03:33:39.563
<v Speaker 1>or food like it just goes a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer and now foods getting a little </v>

4710
03:33:42.751 --> 03:33:46.050
<v Speaker 1>scarce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to have a problem and I am</v>

4711
03:33:46.051 --> 03:33:49.950
<v Speaker 1>stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't happened to any extent.</v>

4712
03:33:49.980 --> 03:33:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw,</v>

4713
03:33:51.210 --> 03:33:53.400
<v Speaker 1>we saw close with katrina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4714
03:33:53.930 --> 03:33:55.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and violence started.</v>

4715
03:33:55.710 --> 03:33:57.750
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a little out of hand,</v>

4716
03:33:57.930 --> 03:34:01.110
<v Speaker 1>but use app that grid give people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have nothing.</v>

4717
03:34:01.590 --> 03:34:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I wound up getting a giant fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cummings generator.</v>

4718
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:08.910
<v Speaker 1>This thing like is for backup power at </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitals.</v>

4719
03:34:09.780 --> 03:34:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So when the power goes out in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

4720
03:34:11.640 --> 03:34:14.730
<v Speaker 1>literally my pool is running flood </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights in the backyard.</v>

4721
03:34:14.790 --> 03:34:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Every tv's on it comes on automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just sit there as if fuel with,</v>

4722
03:34:18.860 --> 03:34:21.090
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a liquid propane,</v>

4723
03:34:21.610 --> 03:34:26.280
<v Speaker 1>but I have to 1000 gallon tanks buried </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my front yard.</v>

4724
03:34:26.820 --> 03:34:28.170
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would,</v>

4725
03:34:28.200 --> 03:34:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would last for a long fucking time.</v>

4726
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Lungs in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4727
03:34:32.680 --> 03:34:34.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how much you use because,</v>

4728
03:34:34.591 --> 03:34:35.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more,</v>

4729
03:34:35.220 --> 03:34:37.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more draw on it,</v>

4730
03:34:37.230 --> 03:34:38.063
<v Speaker 1>the heart of the engine's got to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it depends if I'm running my whole </v>

4731
03:34:40.861 --> 03:34:41.820
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4732
03:34:41.880 --> 03:34:42.713
<v Speaker 1>it would last a few weeks and it's safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that propane to be in those cans on </v>

4733
03:34:47.780 --> 03:34:49.150
<v Speaker 1>underground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4734
03:34:49.240 --> 03:34:50.073
<v Speaker 1>they're a giant tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're running natural gas into my </v>

4735
03:34:53.460 --> 03:34:56.430
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood so I might have a converted</v>
<v Speaker 1>over to natural gas.</v>

4736
03:34:56.431 --> 03:34:59.040
<v Speaker 1>But I like the fact that if the gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks too,</v>

4737
03:34:59.400 --> 03:35:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I can still at least jacka an lp truck </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and fill up my own tank.</v>

4738
03:35:03.661 --> 03:35:05.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy push came to shove,</v>

4739
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:10.050
<v Speaker 1>but it is just every light in the house </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be on my neighborhood's dark.</v>

4740
03:35:10.290 --> 03:35:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking at it like an half </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuckers that happened.</v>

4741
03:35:14.190 --> 03:35:14.701
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4742
03:35:14.701 --> 03:35:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few times.</v>

4743
03:35:15.880 --> 03:35:16.713
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for a big one though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I really want to be bad blackout </v>

4744
03:35:20.070 --> 03:35:20.903
<v Speaker 1>just so I can dig it and know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the guy with the power that say </v>

4745
03:35:22.951 --> 03:35:24.780
<v Speaker 1>the guy with refrigerants where the guns</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>

4746
03:35:26.960 --> 03:35:30.750
<v Speaker 1>like it really is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is something a little creepy about</v>

4747
03:35:30.751 --> 03:35:35.751
<v Speaker 1>the pRospect that we are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicately balanced as a society.</v>

4748
03:35:36.360 --> 03:35:41.360
<v Speaker 1>It could really fly apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We truSt too much that the power is just</v>

4749
03:35:41.571 --> 03:35:42.404
<v Speaker 1>going beyond thAt the water's gonna run </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the food's going to be at the </v>

4750
03:35:44.491 --> 03:35:45.324
<v Speaker 1>supermarket or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got a great advantage being </v>

4751
03:35:48.451 --> 03:35:51.170
<v Speaker 1>able to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get how many people don't know.</v>

4752
03:35:51.300 --> 03:35:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what american refugees would</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like?</v>

4753
03:35:54.390 --> 03:35:55.223
<v Speaker 1>The fat fucking mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crossing some border to Canada to be </v>

4754
03:35:58.441 --> 03:36:01.020
<v Speaker 1>saved from some cataclysm that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>down here.</v>

4755
03:36:01.230 --> 03:36:02.580
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of fucking.</v>

4756

<v Speaker 1>No nothing.</v>

4757
03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:09.120

<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

4758
03:36:09.330 --> 03:36:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Just not trained in the feeding yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside in the wild.</v>

4759

03:36:20.611 --> 03:36:21.444
<v Speaker 1>the humidity in the air or there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we just don't know because </v>

4762
03:36:24.361 --> 03:36:25.194
<v Speaker 1>we depend on technology and we trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's always going to be there </v>

4763
03:36:29.160 --> 03:36:30.000
