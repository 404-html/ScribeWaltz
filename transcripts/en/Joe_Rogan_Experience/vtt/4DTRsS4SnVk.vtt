<v Speaker 1>Just a,</v>

75
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.853
<v Speaker 1>it was a shark.</v>

76
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I was coming up a hill.</v>

77
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

78
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I was in mile for it.</v>

79
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Had nothing left and I,</v>

80
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I had to fart and just Bam shard and my underwear.</v>

81
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I did that the other day in my house.</v>

82
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

83
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.081
<v Speaker 1>just a little squirt.</v>

84
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>And Jesus Christ feels like such a failure,</v>

85
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>but it had some good farts before that.</v>

86
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

87
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I got motivated because I had,</v>

89
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:57.851
<v Speaker 1>so you were on a roll rumblers watch Jesus and it was just me.</v>

90
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I wish I didn't have to cover from no worries.</v>

91
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I was pausing and leaning into them and then it just a little,</v>

92
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

93
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>fuck ah,</v>

94
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>catch the shower.</v>

95
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a shower.</v>

96
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>But it was interesting because as soon as I got on the bowl,</v>

97
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I had explosive diarrhea.</v>

98
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

99
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>where was this?</v>

100
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd had no idea that's up.</v>

101
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Diarrhea was looming.</v>

102
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

103
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>holiday eating,</v>

104
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>that's holiday eating probably.</v>

105
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>creams and Shit Wad also,</v>

108
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I go off the Diet and I started eating like Pumpkin Pie and ice cream and shit</v>

109
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:33.034
<v Speaker 1>and all the cream.</v>

110
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

111
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of bread.</v>

112
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich last night,</v>

113
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>but as the ultimate failure,</v>

114
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>because your job as a human is to provide for your family and not shit your</v>

115
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.784
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

116
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>You think about it all the time.</v>

117
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Every time you fart,</v>

118
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

119
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.781
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

120
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a little moment where you weigh in on it,</v>

121
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>you feel it out,</v>

122
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>feel your intestines,</v>

123
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.871
<v Speaker 1>you feel your anus,</v>

124
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>you make a judgment call and you let it rip.</v>

125
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.111
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting,</v>

126
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>if you think about how in you are to the sensations you get from your inner</v>

127
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>colon,</v>

128
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>because there's times you know like,</v>

129
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.291

<v Speaker 1>I'm about to shit my pants.</v>

131
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>There's like a,</v>

132
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain alarm that goes off like when you're like,</v>

133

150
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll always say one day I'm gonna try Tantra.</v>

151
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to learn how to like completely like guys say that you can have like</v>

152
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>an internal orgasm for your,</v>

153
00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>your contractions so long that you come,</v>

154
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:48.371
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

155
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:48.611
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>

156
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>comes out and your body reabsorbs it.</v>

157
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And it makes you look Super Sayan power.</v>

158
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

159
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I've choke one back.</v>

160
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

161
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Just got to grab the base right before impact and squeeze really hard.</v>

162
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be long enough where it begins,</v>

163
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>but not so long that it comes out.</v>

164
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And I've pushed it back in again.</v>

165
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>But what if you cause an injury?</v>

166
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

167
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:07.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

168
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>What if you get crazy and you just really grab it?</v>

169
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>It's why I've only done it a couple of times.</v>

170
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And you broke your own deck because you grabbed it too hard.</v>

171
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

172
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>life would not be worth living.</v>

173
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that?</v>

174
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Not Having your Dick come anymore for the rest of your life and knowing that</v>

<v Speaker 1>but once a day.</v>

178
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.240
