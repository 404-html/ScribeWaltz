Did you know just the hand.
Just the hand.
Little finger.

10
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.194
That's it.

11
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.430
We were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com makers of Alpha brain,

Alpha brain is a cognitive enhancer.

that's okay.

14
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.680
Just don't get mad at me and if you think it's too expensive poolies by the

15
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.840
ingredients separately and and enjoy.

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.860
You know I shit was actually looking at that.

17
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:56.940
I was looking at all the ingredients,
seeing if I could rebuild it and stuff.

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.050
And there were so many levels of all the ingredients that I knew and I was

19
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:03.690
talking to them to Aubrey about it and he bought like the best kind of

20
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.780
ingredients put it.
It's like if you want to get one of the components in it,

21
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.810
you could get it pretty cheap.
So there is going to be a cheap version of it,

22
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:11.550
like a lot of these ingredients and stuff like that.

23
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.080
But he definitely uses it because he definitely used as a higher quality uses.

24
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.300
The best quality can get,
but you can do a cheaper,

25
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.780
so if you want to do it cheaper and avoid all this stuff,
just stop yelling at

26
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.940
30 bucks a bottle.
And that's what took a dollar a pill,
a discount.
What do I get?

27
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.980
No,
I can't do the math.
It's like three bucks off.
Which I'm like that.

28
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.180
So what they pressing the code?
They get that?
No.
Okay.

29
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.440
It's not a bad fucking deal too.
I believe in this shit.
It works.

30
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.060
If you're broke,
I get it,
man.
It's no big deal

31
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.510
and by the fucking pills at $30 a pop for a month,
it's,
it's,
it's pennies a week.

32
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.390
It's,
it's,
you know,
that's what you break it down to $10 a day.

33
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.330
I mean if you really think about it,
if you have disposable income,

34
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.960
it's all about what do you use it for and you know,
for me,
health and,

35
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.320
and my overall sense of wellness and my ability to communicate if that's the

36
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.630
most important shit to me.
I need vitamins and good diet or like primary,

37
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:08.280
that's like one of the most important things you can have.

38
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.520
That's the things that I spend money on it and good masturbation and good

39
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.850
masturbation for the flashlight is that you bring them in all black and white

40
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.020
and bring it back and get it all back around dances here.
I'm excited.

41
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:21.310
Let's let the fire get this bitch rolling.

42
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.890
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

43
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.380
that was the highlight of my month.

44
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.320
That was pretty sweet.
Yeah,
it was the highlight of my month.

45
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.700
<v 0>She listened to that so much in the last 24 hours.</v>

46
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.820
Then I'm thinking about making a ringtone,
but,
oh,
it's a good ringtone.

47
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.310
You know the perfect thing about it too,
so it wasn't perfect.

48
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.900
It didn't even make sense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause they,

49
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.310
when he says also when he says or day

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.180
<v 2>or something like that,
you have your phone next to the shit
you do.</v>

51
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.330
So why you pointed Joey?

52
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.010
No checking around and I was checking around during the circle.
Yeah.

53
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.680
Well it's trained by day Joe Rogan podcast by night.
All Day.

54
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.280
Yet the night party almost as like die or day or something like that.

55
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.910
As far as confused as perfect.
Nick is awesome.
Holy Shit.

56
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.990
What a fucking fight that was.
God Damn Joe Diaz.
I was fucking fired up.

57
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.840
I want him to cry.
It gave me a cookie.

58
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.820
He had rite aid before the flight and by the time Chuck Congo fought me trio and

59
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.400
I was fucked up.
Like you know when you sit over in that section,

60
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.220
those lights hit you.
I don't know if they ever affect you by mistake.

61
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.400
They usually put like these orange,
red kind of lights,
blue lights and that cook.

62
00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:46.510
He made those lights,
like I couldn't even see the fucking fight and I'm like,

63
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:50.920
get this beam of light out of my eyeballs.
And then by the time a Bj,

64
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:52.810
when Bj came up,
drove,
when he listened,

65
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.850
it was too close to it with fight for anybody to call.

66
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.410
My heart was doing involved with Bj.
I really liked that while the Bj.
Yeah.

67
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.020
So I didn't want to really call it and when I was watching Bj,
come on,

68
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.030
I just wanted a decent fight.
You know Jesus fucking Christ Jesus fucking Christ.

69
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.923
What a flight home

70
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.780
<v 0>shit.
Nick Diaz look good man.
God Damn did he look good.</v>

71
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.340
That's the best,

72
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.020
the best performance I think anyone has ever had against Bj.

73
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.670
No one has ever looked that good against Bj mean.
He just boxed him up,

74
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:24.470
standing up,
man.
Just boxed him up.

75
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.620
And then the pace that Nick's Nick Diaz makes you run with him.

76
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.780
He makes you run at his pace,
you know,

77
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.870
and his endurance is just on some wicked level man.

78
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.030
And he forces this pace and fights guys using sharp boxing where he doesn't hit

79
00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:39.950
you with full blast shots.
You know,

80
00:04:39.951 --> 00:04:44.380
like he sort of 50% to 50% to you up until like the second,

81
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.961
third round.

82
00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:49.640
Then he starts digging all the hugs to the body and so effective man,

83
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.930
he's so effective.

84
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.790
<v 2>It's a,
it's really weird to watch it.
It was,
it was a great fucking fight.</v>

85
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.690
And I'm like I said,
I just,
I like going to,
you'll see the see fights,
you know,

86
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:01.210
I'm a fan,
but I also want to see a flood.
Once you some crazy,

87
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:05.290
she'll see some crazy shit.
And then they just announced the my other men,

88
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.060
Donald's Sarone against Nate Diaz.

89
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.460
Well we can fucking Donald still rolling.
And My,
I love him.

90
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:15.310
I've always loved him as a,
as a human being,
as a fighter.

91
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.870
But the other night he came out looking good like a motherfucker.

92
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.660
He was like super and 73 he was just,
he was just moved.

93
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:26.140
He just looked good out enough.
Thank you very much for taking.

94
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.600
Thank you for coming man.
You were the life of the party.
We um,

95
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.640
I talked to Greg Jackson,
yeah.

96
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.770
<v 0>About,
and he said he's never been more disciplined.
That's what it is.</v>

97
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:36.890
He's just constantly training constantly that Jim just working harder than he's

98
00:05:36.891 --> 00:05:40.040
ever worked before.
He realizes,
I think that he's knocking on the door right now.

99
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:42.530
He's like right there.
I mean,
he's at the elite of the elite.

100
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.260
You know this knock out a Seaver.
The way he puts Seaver out,
dude.

101
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.250
<v 2>Ooh,
that was big.
That was big.</v>

102
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.040
<v 0>Did he did that to see,
let me see if there's a dangerous guy,
man.</v>

103
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.260
Look with CBRE did to Andrea winner of that,

104
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.010
that turning side taking landed on Nate Moore sent him flying across the room.

105
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.130
He's a beast man.

106
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.061
<v 2>He's no joke.</v>

107
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.270
And Donald Cerrone just ran through him and I've done that right after.

108
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:06.380
He did the same to Charles Olivera.
So Ron,
he's a monster man.

109
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.570
He's fun and he's a cowboy fucking character.

110
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.660
Legit cowboy man wears cowboy boots and shit's got to hap rides bulls.

111
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:17.990
He doesn't give a fuck around man.
So he lives on a ranch man.
You know,

112
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.660
like go saying like when they were calling him cowboy Cerrone when he was about

113
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:23.000
to step in the octagon.
I'm like,
well this isn't a joke.

114
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.540
This guy lives on a ranch.
Okay.
He's got his own ranch.
These,

115
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.110
these are real cowboy boots because he wears them and it's a real fucking cowboy

116
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:30.944
hat.

117
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.380
He's a beast now I seen something on Twitter earlier is of a given conduit

118
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.500
Ellenberger or somebody else in the meantime.
I don't know.
I don't know.

119
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.170
What if it was just a ranch style house?

120
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.530
You know what if it was in a real ranch and this whole time he just misheard it

121
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.020
and then you're like go to his house.
You're like,

122
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.280
oh he did spot some cowboy boots and he has a one story house.
The Vegas,

123
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.780
which really fucking missed.

124
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:58.610
I like came home and actually watched it was the Bull Riding Association finals

125
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:03.380
with the cowboys everywhere.
The other stand be the hats.
The Shit get,

126
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.000
cause I knew that.
I was telling Joe.
Yeah.
You know,
sometimes I'll misquote,

127
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:10.160
quote my words,
you know,
I don't hate fucking anybody.

128
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:15.161
I just hate people who like think that better than you are Snobby People Aka

129
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.950
Wash,
you know my heart is the south.
Let's get down to it.

130
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:20.900
When I fucking came to this country,

131
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.300
I was a little kid when I seen a cowboy hat and a gun.

132
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.980
How are you fucking kidding me?

133
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.000
You know what you feel like when you see that we all want to be cowboys.

134
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.060
That's where we fuck fucking dressed as our first Halloween.

135
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:35.990
Somewhere along the line and I,
all three of us,
we were a cowboy for a day.

136
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.800
You know what I'm saying?
That we all giggle.

137
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.760
You wouldn't have a played a fucking cop.
Why?

138
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.600
Bet You did with the girl next door.

139
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:45.560
You tied her up and dirty fucking bastard bug.
Brian wasn't even an Indian.

140
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:48.890
He was the boy that worked in the shop.
That's where he played.

141
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.180
Everybody else played cowboys and now I put Indian and I trustless usually

142
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.370
there's a lot of people that want to be rebels.
They played Indians.

143
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.860
I play Indian after I've seen Charles Bronson and uh,

144
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.720
the one movie when he played in a chat channels land,
he plays an Indian.

145
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.430
He threw the fucking speed.
I started throwing fucking sticks outside.

146
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.400
They'll stick ball.
Charles Bronson can pull off in the uneasy,
right?
Well,

147
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.310
in the 60s,
they just let you do whatever the fuck you want it to.
I mean,

148
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:14.060
Anthony Quinn's a Mexican,
they played,
how fucked up is that?

149
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:17.960
Anthony Quinn is really Mexican,
a great actor.
And he played everything well,

150
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:19.970
he played a Mexican in that one black and white movie.

151
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:24.890
But what was that movie that he played with Kevin Costner?

152
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.520
Do you remember that movie with Kevin Costner where Kevin Costner was in love

153
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:32.870
with his wife?
One of the greatest beatings ever?

154
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.600
Forget Anderson Silva kicking.
What's his name of the face?

155
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.640
The Guy fucks his wife,

156
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:41.060
who's the crazy chick who was no longer like a hot actress.

157
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:42.350
She was very hot at that time.

158
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.920
And when they shoot Anthony Quinn was a drug or Mexicans rug,

159
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.360
fucking savage who was fairly and stones Madeline Stowe.
No.

160
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:54.850
Viagara revenge was like 87.
There was no Viagra and he was just banging.

161
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.510
This chick wanted to keep getting banged and he came in and broke his legs,

162
00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:02.550
slashed his face,
put her in the fucking brothel.
Shadow would fucking coke.

163
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.870
I mean,
Anthony Quinn didn't fuck around and revenge.
That was a scary movie,
man.

164
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.460
Probably.
Did you watch anything scary caught up in yesterday from the beginning,

165
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.620
but we got caught up in the motherfucking extra since yesterday.
And to watch,

166
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.840
you know what everybody talks about Friday the 13th I forgot.

167
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.870
Because all you think about is this movie about a kid getting possessed and is

168
00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:27.480
so fucking deep.
The cinematography,
when he pulled them,
the priest comes.
Not the,

169
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.291
not Jackie,

170
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:31.560
you know Jackie Gleason and southern Lord lead me while you do this to me.

171
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.470
That's Jason,
Patrick's mother fucking father,
Rick Dude.

172
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.900
That never even been another movie.
He just did that,
that priest,
the boxer.

173
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.790
Really?
But yeah,
he's bad that it's kind of crazy.
Look,

174
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:45.620
I didn't do that many moves.
Bumps and beautiful that he was.
Yeah,

175
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.640
he was really fucking,
that's kind of crazy.

176
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:50.370
He was so good in that movie and he never did another movie because that movie,

177
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:52.990
one of the thing can you click on and then they wouldn't anything cause if it

178
00:09:52.991 --> 00:09:55.410
didn't,
I'm going to blow up a fucking studio.

179
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.940
I'm going to blow up one of these fucking jerk offs.
You something.

180
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.740
That movie took me.
This girl was 12 years old.

181
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.920
There's one when she tells me your mother's sons Cox in the house,

182
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.130
you can't write that shit.
She takes the crush,

183
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:10.260
you sticking to her monkey and then she takes the mother,

184
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.970
puts her head down and says suck me.
In her contract.
They should've said,
listen,

185
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:16.980
I'm going to give you 50 grand a year for psychological abuse.

186
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.050
It was 1970 this kid was saying those words.
What do you think that did die?

187
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.720
But she was a free camp,
made us up with James Bitch.

188
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.290
She went right to buffalo one way.

189
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.600
It was something.
There's another scene in that she's shoving the crossing.

190
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.630
It's making noise like it's gotten into me like it is,

191
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.200
you know they shut fucking freezer so that they don't know that breathe like

192
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:47.910
that.
Her breath,
the breath was like,
wow,
what a fucking amazing,

193
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:49.920
amazing.
I was sitting there going,

194
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.820
I got to save this for the podcast because again,

195
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.120
back on the fucking seventies back to the fucking seventies and it didn't mind.

196
00:10:57.121 --> 00:11:00.270
Fuck you like a hand coming out of a wall in mind.
Fuck you.

197
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:04.470
Slowly if they didn't have the special effects so they had to do it with writing

198
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.540
and they had to do with the way they shot things.

199
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.480
You know they're special effects mean she just had a little makeup on her face.

200
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:13.260
It's really not that blue today.
What do you remember that song?
Yeah,

201
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.630
she was the creepiest fuck when he gets out of the cab,

202
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.420
Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun and often she opens that door.

203
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.290
It's just fall behind him.
That is one of the greatest fucking shots.

204
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.800
If that motherfucker was at my house,
I think I just slammed the door on.

205
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.550
This is bad ass.
How's it sound?
The beginning,

206
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:33.570
they find like a talisman or something like that,
which is why we believe,

207
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:36.540
that's why I've always thought there's so much fucking bad luck in Africa

208
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.790
because the devil that's a doubles house,
that's the devil's house,
Africa.

209
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.040
Egypt is that scene when he sees the devil statue and he looks and it's two dogs

210
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:51.060
fighting.
Oh Joe Rogan to wild dogs in the cycle.

211
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.730
I don't.
He is.
He is.
The guy comes out,

212
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:58.390
pops out with the shotgun like in an Arab suit,
isn't an Arab fucking country.

213
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.480
What?
He finds that thing.
But then when he goes to her house,

214
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:06.150
there's one part would be me while you do this to me and not my fucking mother.

215
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.700
Fuck.
Oh my God.
He has to leave the room and fucking cute.

216
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.350
That green soup and it's fucking high.
Just brilliant.
And when,

217
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:17.650
back then you have to think there was nothing like this before this movie.

218
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.940
Nothing.
But they had those old wolf man movies are

219
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.640
so stupid.
I mean,
they were fun,
but there were nothing like the exercise man.

220
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:30.700
He actually says to taking it to a deep,
deep psychological level.

221
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.820
That movie scared the fuck out of a lot of people out of people and then they

222
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:37.330
reduced it like they did it with her walking down the stairs and a fucking,
oh,

223
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.470
all the plot that he looks stupid.
She walked in their own Omoplata.
Yeah,

224
00:12:41.471 --> 00:12:43.240
that was terrible.
And it they ruined it.

225
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.670
But that took away from what the whole movie was about.

226
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.110
Those are like the scenes they cut out,

227
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:49.630
which they cut them off for a fucking reason cause it's sucked the second when

228
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:50.710
people go,
oh my God,

229
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.830
they just rerelease princes unreleased saying he didn't release them because

230
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:58.390
they sucked.
You know what I'm saying?
He's,
this is first ranch.
You're dumped fun.

231
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.260
This hits and misses that.
Except that you don't know.

232
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.350
Yeah,
that movie was a fucking classic.
That's one of the movie.

233
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.900
They just did it so well.
It was so well done in every way.

234
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.590
There's a few movies like that.
We'd go back and you watch them and go,
God damn,

235
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:18.640
they just nailed this shit.
And everybody was a superb actor like there was.

236
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.090
They set you up for it.
Well,
a lot of people forget that there was a party,

237
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:25.300
there was a party at a house and there was a fight between a Jewish guy and a

238
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:28.090
German,
the German,
and he kept saying fucking Nazis.

239
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.170
Then they got into a misunderstanding.
So when she's first started getting sick,

240
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.630
she leaves the mother and when she comes back,

241
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:36.850
the director got found in the bottom of the steps,

242
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:40.220
was head twisted all the way around.
Yeah,
they set it,

243
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.440
they set you the fuck up.
The cop comes over,
he interviews them.

244
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.380
What happened,
you know,
and then like,
Yo,

245
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.490
now you're thinking maybe the girl killed the fucking guy.
Right.

246
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.820
But she went downstairs and Pete,
when they were playing the piano,

247
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.120
she goes to the restaurant,
you're going to die up there,
minister,

248
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.130
and then pisses in the ground.
Just,
just,

249
00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:01.810
just shit that you can't even have a little girl with that Kinda face look.
No,

250
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.460
no,
you're getting it tonight.
You got to pull up.

251
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.270
When she comes out of the Yag and the priest comes up and he is,
he's a father,

252
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:10.120
goes to her.
Does she remember anything in the mother?
Goes,
no,

253
00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:12.910
she doesn't remember gun damn thing.
She gets in the car,

254
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.900
she comes out and hugs and kisses him.
That's seen them fucking kill you.

255
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.430
It will fucking kill you.
It's such a great little fucking dirty scene.
Anyway,

256
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:25.840
I don't know.
And I said you guys remember that movie house from like 1986 house.

257
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.000
So I'm hormone.
It's a horror movie.

258
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:32.640
And they did from cheers or isn't it George wind or whatever and guys,

259
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.570
I don't remember that at all.
Nevermind.
I know.
I mean listen,

260
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.790
I nightmare on elm street and the first couple of those,

261
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.630
when I first watched them,
I'm not a hardware guy,
you know,

262
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:47.320
I'm not a big horror guy so I get scared.
I can't fucking sleep at night.

263
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.470
Like yesterday to watch that,
I watched Dexter and there was something else.

264
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.280
I can't fucking sleep at night with all that horror of my life.
It's all I want.

265
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.680
I don't want Dexter,
I don't want like serial killer type Har.

266
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:01.340
I don't want to like real live shit.
I like monsters.
That's what I like.

267
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.610
I like shit.
That's not real because that's fun for me.
When I go to a movie,

268
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.930
the last thing I want is you to recreate real life.
I get enough real life.

269
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.520
I don't want,
I want vampires.
What do you got?
Who can fly?
Who shoots?

270
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:15.890
Laser beams of the rivals?
Yeah.
If you don't have that,

271
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.030
I don't want to go see your fucking million.

272
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.010
I got movies and that got movies to take my mind the fuck away.
Aka Cop gun.

273
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.050
I got movies and that got Calgon take me away.
Yeah,
you can take,

274
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.880
there's movies that you watch.
I want,

275
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:31.220
I want to watch a movie that half the way there was a movie.

276
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:34.670
You're asking yourself,
where's my life headed?
Right.
And you're giggling.

277
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.570
That's all that matters.
Right?
Like sometimes I catch myself watching road house.

278
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:40.700
I ain't going to fucking live.
Oh,
that's a great television.

279
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:44.970
I'll watch it all the way through Ben.
Cause Ira,
let me flip a coin.
Oh Bonnie,

280
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.220
the coin.

281
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.430
There's just some get rich off a lot of people in this town and I'm going to get

282
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:54.400
richer.
Yeah,
just some worries.
Dialogue ever.
That movie's a class.

283
00:15:54.401 --> 00:15:57.290
Some dumb movies.
I'm ashamed to tell people.
Able to like,

284
00:15:57.291 --> 00:16:01.340
you know the scene where the stitching,
Charles Pat Patrick Swayze up,

285
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.870
she stitched him up and he goes pain don't hurt.
Pain don't hurt.

286
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.450
She would have like a video game for that.

287
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.320
Like a first person shooter or road house where you just like going around bars

288
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:13.071
and kicking ass.

289
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:17.690
Like going through clubs and crowds being a bouncer bouncer and craziest bar

290
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:20.480
ever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They could have something like Bas levels,

291
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:23.660
the woman's restroom or something.
It was,
they weren't even bounces.

292
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.720
They were cooler.
Shit bounce.

293
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.030
I want you to be nice until it's time to not be nice.

294
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.620
Those are the cocaine days,
man.
They made different movies.

295
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.210
They made stupid movies cause they didn't know the movies were stupid because

296
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:41.430
they were all coked up or they're making them and they all had this idea that

297
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.140
they all had bad soundtracks.
They all like really like,

298
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.100
did you ever see man hunter?
Is that what it is?

299
00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:50.390
The original silence of the lambs,
I believe it was called man.
What?

300
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.280
The Dude from Asi,
William,
what's his name?
I can't think of his name.

301
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.700
Whatever homeboy's name is.
That's a weird fucking movie.
Good fucking mood.

302
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.000
We'll take good.
Brilliant.
That's Michael Mann.
His early days,

303
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.700
he got William Peterson.
This is story about William Peterson was like,

304
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.500
he put them in thief,
he's got one line and fee.

305
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:12.350
If he takes a stick is going to hit James Gunn.
That's him.

306
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.070
That's really impede us,
but he put him in men.

307
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.860
Then I think we'll end penis and then he put them in one of the best movies to

308
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.560
live and die in La,
like a mother fucker.

309
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.160
People forget about that.
The line I have stolen,

310
00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:28.790
I pull him to his face and he goes,
what?
Mine and I go,
that line is,

311
00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:33.530
I stole from him like [inaudible] 83 when John Turturro's in the jail and what's

312
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:36.430
his name goes to visit him when he first gets busted at the airport,

313
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.540
would it kind of his money?
And he goes,
listen to sit tight.
I'll get you out.

314
00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:40.790
And he looks at me.
He goes,
yeah,

315
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.150
and the check's in the mail and I promise not to cum in your mouth.

316
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.100
And then he goes,
listen,
you just,
it's all going to work out in a couple of days.

317
00:17:47.101 --> 00:17:49.680
And they also,
can you hear the bell go off?
He's got to stop visitation.

318
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.270
He's drinking Kale,
Penn state,
which makes the,
uh,
the visit even strong.

319
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:57.840
He's got a fucking also,
and as he's leaving he knocks on the glass and he goes,

320
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.310
don't forget about me and that's it.
That's your line too.
I get that line.

321
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.330
Forget about me.
Don't forget about me.

322
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.170
He just walks away through the midnight and shit.
That's a great movie.

323
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.930
Eat each other member.
That's what that one was.

324
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.200
She was an artist type woman and shit like that.
And that was a good,

325
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.810
what's the name of that dude?
Dog.
But he played last temptation of Christ.

326
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:22.450
He's just start to live in Dianella which Gyns at William at the front of it.

327
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.280
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah man.
He was great.

328
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.070
He was great in that movie.
Fuck yeah.

329
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.430
You know what's crazy about the axis is like before ecstasy and before fucking

330
00:18:33.431 --> 00:18:37.970
with all of these things,
it was a drug called THC crystal THC crystals.

331
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:43.110
This is 1976 to about 80 it was a designer drug.
It was,

332
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.620
there were supposedly THC.
There are the sticks and stems.

333
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.190
You boil them and whatever rises to the top,
you scrape it off and you freezing,

334
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.063
you snort it.

335
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.470
But what it became was something completely different like you would,

336
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.840
but for 10 bucks,
three people could get hot.

337
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.440
That's the first thing I ever snorted in my life.
I never did blow like that.

338
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:02.730
Then I just did this one thing.

339
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:07.260
People like snorted dry and one night I did that through the crystal between two

340
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:11.100
people and I went fucking home and that's one of the Times that was one of the

341
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.110
of sharing like lady and the tramp.
I don't know how we shared it.

342
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:15.680
We came in a little aluminum foil and you just,

343
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.860
you gave it to your buddy and he went and it tastes good.

344
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.830
It tastes like it tastes just like a vitamin fucking.

345
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:25.230
15 minutes later your vision would just cross,

346
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.890
but one night I went home and put that fucking excesses on and I nearly had a

347
00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:33.120
heart attack.
Who was the effects of this stuff?
Like what was it like,

348
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.390
but your menu,
it was just this a fucking uh,
design.

349
00:19:37.391 --> 00:19:41.760
The name for
Angel Dust.

350
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.021
That's all it was.

351
00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:47.850
It was a designer in the 70s all that shit was big in New York.

352
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.590
They call it something else.
When you went to buy weed,
a little envelopes,

353
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.590
Brown envelopes that you folded up,
trays a fives and tens.

354
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:59.100
Lydia would always go out.
Then not only would they have a name for the week,

355
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.530
the master mix,
the super mix,
they go,

356
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:05.740
we also got whatever killed somebody that week.
Like when I first came,

357
00:20:05.741 --> 00:20:09.930
the Len bias,
Len bias or of the Guy Anna,
like the first time I went over there,

358
00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:12.440
it was the Guy Jones,
Jeff Jones,
Jones Gypsy.

359
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.330
That's what he put in the mother fucking Kuwait.
So you move,
is it,

360
00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:17.280
and why that was always the case,
right?

361
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.770
Wasn't that always the case when somebody would die named some shit and tell you

362
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:25.400
this is the shit that put him on the moon.
This is her shipping.

363
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.710
Did you shit and putting me on the moon.
I was,

364
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.600
it was like 87 85 or 86 when Len bias died.
And I said,
shit,

365
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:37.890
they gave Kennedy before they put them in and I still remember going to Harlem

366
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:41.390
that week and like,
not even thinking about it,
like Lenny bias died,

367
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.960
left lefty drives out was the culture was the first time he had ever done blow

368
00:20:45.961 --> 00:20:46.794
whatever.

369
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.250
And I'm in the car and I pull over and we'd go get weed and Harlem and all of a

370
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.130
sudden some black guy comes around the thing and he's like,
Yo,
Yo,

371
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.080
I got the shit that killed Lenny bias.

372
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.410
I had to stop and like fucking almost dropped the one day.

373
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.310
I have never heard that before.
It was dark.
There were pit bulls out.

374
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.440
I didn't give a fuck.
I just dropped.
I had never heard.
That's your marketing.

375
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.700
Could you imagine someone died from Tylenol?
You know,
people don't.

376
00:21:11.701 --> 00:21:13.940
People are doing it when they were,
when people were poisoning it.

377
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.310
That's what that was,
bro.
This is what they put the Tylenol challengers imagined.

378
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.990
Tylenol was saying that.
That's my point.

379
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.470
That the edge of the Tylenol was sound Yodas and shit to kill them.
20 people.

380
00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:26.310
Can you hang,
can you hang dog and sell it?

381
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.860
We can't even sell it inside cvs.
We gotta beat in the parking lot.

382
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.670
This is the shit that we gave that dude when he got shot in the head and he

383
00:21:33.671 --> 00:21:36.490
drove us up to the hospital or shit like that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

384
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.590
Fucking bullying and stuff like that.
Why is it always that?

385
00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:43.750
It's always the shit that killed the latest guy.

386
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.620
Kadafi Kadafi his ass.

387
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.920
Did you watch it and then getting off your footage a little bit?
Little bit.

388
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:53.380
Holy Shit.
That's strange.
That's a,
could you imagine?

389
00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:55.930
We have footage like that of Hitler Hitler's last day.

390
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.470
You know Kadafi went out hard,
dude.
He went out,
asshole dude.
He,

391
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.760
yeah,
he went out to animals.

392
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.600
They ripped him apart and shot him basically close.

393
00:22:07.601 --> 00:22:11.350
People were screaming Allah Akbar and they were shoving sticks up his ass.

394
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.670
You can find photos online of them shoving us,
stick right up his ass.

395
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:18.860
They got a still frame.
It was real hard to see what the,
what exactly,
what,

396
00:22:18.861 --> 00:22:22.470
what's going on in the video.
They still use the Motorola razor.

397
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:24.670
It look like the looking at something along those lines.

398
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.690
It was not a good camera.

399
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:29.200
It was a shitty camera and there was so much movement on the screen.

400
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:32.800
There's so much action that the camera would like made things almost like stop

401
00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:36.850
motion.
It was like it was missing frames,
you know,
look terrible.

402
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.930
Very artsy.
There's some guy who they're going to do it.

403
00:22:38.931 --> 00:22:41.860
You should see how they edited it.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's obvious.

404
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.740
But what a miserable way to die would have fucked it.
Sticking your ass.

405
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.960
You well they shot him.
Well the coalition forces,

406
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:52.810
we're going to come and get him and take him away and one of the guys shot him

407
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.340
now even after your shot,

408
00:22:54.341 --> 00:22:57.460
I mean you breathe and you have a couple of minutes of whatever right there.

409
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:00.130
They're pulling your pants down and sticking a broom handle up your ass.

410
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.910
You guys a knife and it was a nine.
It was a knife.

411
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.910
I just read a thing the other day,
that website,

412
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.170
it was like a news website and they were saying that David went frame by frame.

413
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.790
You can see,
you can see where it's taking a little blood stain too.

414
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:17.580
Like he was spotting,
you know,

415
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.390
period Gadhafi period.
Brian.
No,
I'm not going to do that.
My cookies,

416
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.020
rebel shoves knife of Qaddafi's but for killing him.
Wow.
Yup.

417
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.460
Exactly.
But it's a,
what's crazy dude is the,
how,

418
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.030
how nutty it is like to watch this guys last moments,

419
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.690
there's only screaming and he's covered in blood and he's looking around

420
00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:45.691
horrified and they're screaming La and they kept taking the and putting in

421
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.040
<v 0>front of their face,
like they'd led look right at the camera and screen</v>

422
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.200
<v 2>hello walked,
Blah,
hello lockba up and then go back to chaos and blah blah,
blah,</v>

423
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.190
blah.
Being God is great.
God is great.

424
00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:02.510
<v 0>What?
Yeah,
it's pretty fucking nuts man.
That's a,</v>

425
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.160
that's a crazy part of the world.
Scary.
You know,

426
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.230
<v 2>I dressed up as a wizard and scared a bunch of people at a party and it just as</v>

427
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.500
the black wizard and uh,
I think it made people nervous cause I got,

428
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.890
I bought really realistic guns like fake guns.

429
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.790
I think Google black wizard would fucking skin we the pieces,
you understand me?

430
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.460
<v 0>I'm watching the PR,</v>

431
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.700
I'm looking at a photo of this guy's shoving a knife up his ass.
Yeah.

432
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.940
You see a little blood spot.
Yep.
He shoved a knife and cut off his ass.

433
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:36.710
Oh that guy will be talking about that forever.
That'll be like,

434
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.160
that'll look be his family's legacy.
You know the photo,

435
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.340
the photo of the guy who shoved the knife of Qaddafi's ass did is my father.

436
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.050
I was the guy.
Yeah.
I'm watching this picture that's deep.

437
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:55.490
He shoved a deepened his ass too.
It's a crazy way that guy died

438
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.090
<v 2>but he's multiple stab him or just shoves and lights up the stairs.</v>

439
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.710
Tell because in the video is really hard to tell

440
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.830
<v 0>some good photos of his dead body,</v>

441
00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:08.150
though there's a bullet in his forehead and tune his chest and some a high

442
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:12.440
quality photos of his body putting nuts,
man,
it's this,

443
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.950
we've never had that before.
You know,
I never had a,

444
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.510
the video of a guy getting attacked by a mob and killed.

445
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.240
<v 2>It's thinking it's 20 years.
It's going to be in three D and shit.</v>

446
00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:27.140
It's going to be like the best quality.
We're going to get high quality,

447
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.900
more video footage,
stuff like this.
It's going to get worse.

448
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:32.900
It's going to get to the point where we're to be able to experience what Gadhafi

449
00:25:32.901 --> 00:25:34.570
felt with a knife being repaired.

450
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.970
How fucking far have we come like that?

451
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.830
I go so many more shit going to get the tape.
Now in my hometown in North Bergen,

452
00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:43.940
they have command centers.

453
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.810
People watch videos and they have cameras controlling the city and they call

454
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:51.440
them hot spots.
You know like,
well I'm hot spots.
It booted me out.

455
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:56.160
He'll fucking taping you.
Yeah,
well creepy shit.
You've got to catch them.

456
00:25:56.161 --> 00:25:59.960
That's where from con to that,
the from New York,
I understand,

457
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.900
but the fucking tape.
It's true.
You know,

458
00:26:02.901 --> 00:26:06.530
I mean I thought there was something more of this and that they might not be the

459
00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:09.860
only people.
I mean the,
you know,
I don't walk off and fucking Vegas.

460
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.440
You don't want to go off from there.

461
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.300
Not that I even take a shower with underwear on and those mother fuckers,

462
00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.750
mother fuckers in Vegas,
we'll tape you photos.

463
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:20.750
You have to assume,

464
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.910
you have to assume that there was of Joey Diaz beaten off.
There's no dog.

465
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.940
Forget it.
I even used,
even when I a coke in Vegas,
I just,

466
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.280
that that little fucking bungalow bathroom with the lights out.

467
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.010
You know what I'm saying?
So nobody would fucking see me.
Fuck you.

468
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.750
And like flatten there.
The double check,

469
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:39.050
nobody would even pop their head out of the fire in the apartment just like

470
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.480
those motherfuckers fucking with me.
Jack,

471
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.060
you think that they video you while you're,
uh,

472
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.990
<v 0>you have to assume in Vegas there's so much liability.
I agree.
So much liability.</v>

473
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:51.120
They had to lose that,
watching everything.

474
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.520
So if someone goes in and kills a hooker,

475
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.730
they have video footage of it and they call him,
pop it up somewhere.
Hold on.

476
00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.260
They have it on camera number seven,

477
00:26:58.261 --> 00:27:01.740
which is like a camera behind a paying member.
I quarte no,

478
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.490
I quarte no,
I could be a Buchi.
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:07.800
Not like Quarte r Courtney was a lighter weight fighter.

480
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.040
I may have Bucci the president,
he called himself the president.

481
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.090
He was a killer dude.
Uh,

482
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.150
a big fucking scary dude who was on the re on the way to being the heavyweight

483
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.160
champion.
It was a crusher dude is knocking everybody out,

484
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.470
but he liked to beat the fuck out of hookers,

485
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.670
like to get hookers and beat the fuck out of them and just do creepy shit to
him,

486
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:29.130
rape them and shit.
And so,
uh,
they,
uh,

487
00:27:29.131 --> 00:27:32.940
they arrested him and he's in jail on that now the panel illegal done it a bunch

488
00:27:32.941 --> 00:27:36.870
of times,
but he did it in Vegas.
Yeah,
yeah,
I did in Vegas.

489
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.090
Yeah.
But he was a crazy,
dangerous,
scary dude.

490
00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.970
One of those big giant fucking 250 pound ultra athletes is beating the fuck out

491
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:53.910
of everybody.
Everybody's terrified.
I got bad Bucci when do,

492
00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:54.744
when he gets out of jail,

493
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:59.370
you know I have to also assume the airport bathroom at the airport.

494
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:04.670
<v 2>Yeah,
I say that too.
I have to assume that and a,
and I know when the plane would.</v>

495
00:28:04.671 --> 00:28:07.640
Yeah,
and I would want them to,
in a way,
I'm not,
you know,

496
00:28:07.641 --> 00:28:09.770
I'm not going to shoot at the fucking lamp.
That's disgusting.

497
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.090
But I'm sure they have like technology.
If you're masturbating or something,

498
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.460
it must detect something,

499
00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:20.500
a warmth that the chemicals must give off or a warmth that that's something I

500
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.380
don't,
I'm not really,
you know,
beat,

501
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:24.320
but if the chemicals and bombs and shit like that,

502
00:28:24.321 --> 00:28:27.110
I'm just saying that you have to assume when you go to Vegas.

503
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.760
I heard a story years ago about a girl going to Vegas on her honeymoon.

504
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.430
Girl I grew up with,

505
00:28:34.431 --> 00:28:38.300
went to Vegas on a honeymoon and five years later she went to the Poconos for an

506
00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:42.030
anniversary and she rented a point or with a husband that was her fucking on her

507
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.070
honeymoon in Vegas.
And they sued the casino for three or $4 million.

508
00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:49.730
This is in the eighties so if that was going on in the 80s and I have another

509
00:28:49.731 --> 00:28:54.200
friend that I spoke to when we were in Houston,
Texas.
He,
before he became a cop,

510
00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:58.370
he got busted snorting coke in the bathroom in Vegas.
And when he came out,

511
00:28:58.371 --> 00:28:59.120
they arrested him.

512
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.790
This is fucking 1981 or two so they were filming the toilets and the bathroom

513
00:29:03.791 --> 00:29:06.920
till this day.
He does shit.
They're filming you.

514
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.560
You have to assume that's incredible.

515
00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:14.561
After fucking assume that our privacy now and at places like that at Las Vegas,

516
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:18.140
this gotta be ultra fucking security.
I would,
you know,

517
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.640
I'd have to just in all areas,
casinos,
they,
I heard,
oh,

518
00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:25.190
you were with me when we were talking to Alex Jones and Houston.

519
00:29:25.191 --> 00:29:29.150
He was saying that in two years they want to have fucking the pat down people at

520
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:33.350
the malls.
It Shit.
I parks and national parks,
you know the people like Psa,

521
00:29:33.351 --> 00:29:36.810
is that what you call him?
Tsa?
Yes.

522
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.280
But you have to assume,
you know,
that is that they're watching you.

523
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.840
I don't give a fuck.
I don't do nothing wrong.

524
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.480
You want to arrest me for smoking dope scratching my nuts.
Go right ahead.

525
00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:50.310
And I mean,
that's the worst thing I bought.
I know,
you know?
Right.
You know,

526
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.153
whatever.

527
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.900
It is a interesting questions like how much is your privacy worth?

528
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.140
Is it worth people being able to do creepy shit and get away with it?

529
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.711
You know what?

530
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:03.460
If one of your friends got killed and it was in a bathroom and they could have

531
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.211
arrested the guy,

532
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:07.360
but there was no video camera because people were scared of the video footage.

533
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.440
You know,
when you can say,
well,
Hey,
a guy got free because there was no evidence.

534
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.840
But meanwhile,
if they had a camera in there,
we would have caught them.

535
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.710
I gotta be in jail.
It's the streets.
The streets would be saver.
Now,
let me,

536
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.550
let me ask you this kind of somebody,

537
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:24.880
one of our friends did get killed in the bathroom and Vegas and poured a weapon.

538
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.920
We don't want to get nobody in trouble.
Did tape it.

539
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.660
[inaudible] would it be admissible?
That's the other fucking thing.

540
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.090
I could come to you as the head detective.
Go come in for a second.

541
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.880
This a situation.
We tape everybody.

542
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:39.190
You've always known that we've got the fucking guy.

543
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.950
We just need for you to go here answering,
but we got the guy

544
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.930
chambers.
The judge's chamber.
Yeah.
You're like,
all right.

545
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:50.740
You guys have to situation.
He killed him in the bathroom.
That isn't admissible.

546
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.280
That's the fucking problem.
You don't have here,
so you have to,

547
00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.790
you'd have to find out what the laws are.
How did you,
okay,

548
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.910
I come into your house,
I think bathroom.
I'm not going to get door.

549
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.490
Mrs Rogan opens the door.
I smelled marijuana.

550
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:08.210
That gives me the right to come right in.
You smell that.
Let's go.

551
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.620
We all know why?
Because of homeland security.
Homeland Security.

552
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:12.311
They changed that.

553
00:31:12.311 --> 00:31:16.600
You know how many fucking arrests have been for a actual terrorism through

554
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.960
homeland security?
It's been like 12 or 14.

555
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.850
And the arrests for drugs have been thousands.
Thousands.

556
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:29.020
So it's,
it's,
it's ridiculous.
It's,
it's uh,
I think the,
the actual t statistic,

557
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:31.390
it's probably like 1500 to 12 or something like that.

558
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.070
So I come in here and I'm looking for,
uh,
something.
I Dunno,

559
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.230
I see that I come in for the week and when I come in here,

560
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:41.770
I see a tee shirt that you wore that you ripped off when I was chasing and you

561
00:31:41.771 --> 00:31:45.700
stabbed the guy.
Is it admissible DNA on it?

562
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.320
If I came in there without a warrant though,

563
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.570
I did have a warrant to come into your fucking house.

564
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.560
It's you and the cop against your wife's words.
I was,
you following me?

565
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.470
It's a very thin fucking line.
You know,

566
00:31:56.471 --> 00:31:59.370
you can't go looking for something and find something else.
You know,

567
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.220
if I say that I'm going to go to the house,
a 100 liberty street,

568
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.550
it's a brown house.
And when I get there,
it's a blue house.
Cause what?

569
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:11.050
My warrant is fucking null and void.
Really?
Yeah.
The color of the house.

570
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.430
It's fucking crazy dog.
It's crazy how to the teeth.

571
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.480
So even if you broke,
if you went into that house,
if the warrant was Nolan void,

572
00:32:19.481 --> 00:32:20.920
if you went into the house with the wrong color,

573
00:32:20.921 --> 00:32:25.000
but you found dead bodies and guns and the warrant is no fucking good.

574
00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:27.020
You walk my friend.
Whoa.

575
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.270
A little technicality on a warrant and wording.
You walk,

576
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.540
you fucking walk in this country.
That's,
that's how they start out.

577
00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:37.690
Charles Bronson.
Moby's that's why we're fucking right.

578
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:42.590
Wasn't that that movie we're walking Deathwish didn't,

579
00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:44.990
didn't,
wasn't one there wasn't it?
No,
that was,
it was,

580
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.860
but there was one movie where someone walked and Charles Bronson went after him.

581
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.200
The guy walked on a technicality or was it cleaning,
sweat,
whatever it was.

582
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:59.201
Michael Douglas and 81 the movies was called Star Chamber where he played the

583
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:02.780
judge in La fucking brilliant movie.

584
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.920
And two guys driving down the fucking street when they,

585
00:33:05.921 --> 00:33:09.020
and a cop pulls him off of busted headlight and the cop goes,

586
00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:11.720
I smelled marijuana.
They look into man,
they find a kid.
Shoot.

587
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:16.490
So they arrested him,
they bring the fucking guy in,
Michael Douglas,
the judge,

588
00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.560
Blah Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
boom.

589
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.130
Because it was an admissible because they pulled him over for a broken
headlight.

590
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:24.800
They didn't really have the right to look at the thing and the court,

591
00:33:24.801 --> 00:33:29.150
the kid's father shoots the fucking the cop.
It's a great story.

592
00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:33.140
It's about a team of judges who have a hitman and whenever you beat them in

593
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.890
court,
they come looking for you.
So six judges sit there and go,

594
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.580
there's the crazy road.
Brian Brian Red band,
he killed this lady,

595
00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:43.880
took the jewelry to a house,
and when they specify the color of his house,

596
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:48.860
Brown color of his house was white.
He got away with,
we'll try to get them,

597
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.280
what do you think it's going to kill him?
Guilty,
guilty,
guilty.

598
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:53.870
And the guy would go and fucking shoot you.

599
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.920
And then when they went after the kids,
who?
The cop that the people killed,

600
00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:01.390
that kid,
they found out that it was the father.
So what was it called?

601
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.540
Star Chamber.
Our chamber.

602
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:06.250
Michael Douglas went after the guy to tell him that he received,
he won.

603
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:08.080
So he just saying anyone there was,
it was on,

604
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.460
you know how I know and I didn't feel like it was the first time I had HBO was

605
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:13.240
the classic Fucking Month I got.

606
00:34:13.241 --> 00:34:17.660
It was raging bull star Chamber and Hollywood nights.
Is it good?

607
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.540
Which one starts saying hold up.
It's a nightmare.
I haven't,
it was silent.

608
00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:26.240
He TWR about two months ago and I watched it for a little while and it's one of

609
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:29.780
those chances,
you know one of those channels on cable,
you know showtime.

610
00:34:29.781 --> 00:34:33.290
They always have extra showtime.
Actually,
I don't fucking know.

611
00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:34.370
But there was on one of those ones.

612
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.160
<v 0>It is amazing when you go looking at and how many different channels there are.</v>

613
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.810
We got 500 fucking champ.

614
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.270
Why did they put all the fucking HD channels way at the top and then put it like

615
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.730
on the middle.
Oh,

616
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.930
but use those music channels.

617
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:51.600
Someone's house and they're playing music through the TV.

618
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:55.470
Only ex girlfriends use those.
I mean it's like,
I liked listening to hades.

619
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.450
This go explosion.
Ain't bad dog to get your party psychotics,
disco explosion.

620
00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.490
They have all different color names on it.
Every different though.

621
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.780
Brightwell Brooke,
Whatever.
I know there's a way to get XM radio.

622
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:11.340
How do you get XM radio in your house?
Because it has to go.
You call.

623
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.140
I think it's a subscription.
What is it?

624
00:35:13.141 --> 00:35:14.860
They have the satellite in your roof or something like that.

625
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.320
Broadcast through like a channel,
I think music channel.

626
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.150
Are you talking about through your cable company?
I'm talking about XM radio.
Oh,

627
00:35:24.151 --> 00:35:27.150
you just got to get satellite radio in your house though.
How's it picking it up?

628
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:27.331
Oh,

629
00:35:27.331 --> 00:35:30.720
you get this little a tuner that comes with it or a lot of the devices now have

630
00:35:30.721 --> 00:35:33.870
the Tinder built into the device,
but picking up from a satellite,

631
00:35:33.871 --> 00:35:36.610
like if you go into a tunnel,
it won't work.
Is that what it is?
Right,

632
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.570
but it work in your house then.
It's just how it's built.

633
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:42.630
You just point it towards the direction of the house and whatever technology

634
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:45.750
goes through the walls.
It's not the best,
but I've done it for a long time.

635
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:47.520
It's a whole satellite thing is kind of weird,
right?

636
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.950
They have to throw it into orbit.
It seems kind of archaic now.

637
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:51.960
W The internet is so powerful fast.

638
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.390
It's like why would you throw it all the way up in the space and then bring it

639
00:35:54.391 --> 00:35:56.070
back down?
You know what I mean?

640
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:58.740
Like why can't you just broadcast it through the Internet?
What do you know?

641
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.400
Cause they're trying to,
the Internet,
the bandwidth of the Internet,

642
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.660
but the backbone is getting,
even,
it's getting like a lot of loaded lately,

643
00:36:06.661 --> 00:36:09.670
you know,
so much video transfers and stuff like that.

644
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.450
Satellite radio is not ones and Zeros they're sending,

645
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:14.190
they're sending something on radio frequency.

646
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:15.930
So it's not like bandwidth intensive.

647
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:18.710
It doesn't matter how many people are downloading it.
Right,
right,
right.

648
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.340
It's like it's off the network.
It's in space or something.
I might even be wrong.

649
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:24.480
I don't know.
You might be wrong.
Right?

650
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.320
You don't get to too many listeners on satellite radio and then it doesn't work.

651
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:30.890
Right.
It's not like,
you know,
you catch a website.
I don't think so.
Yeah,

652
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.870
so it's different.
That's funny.
It's like TV broadcast.
You know?

653
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.800
It's funny that bandwidth is like a big thing.
You know that it's like,

654
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.010
you know when you see a file,
you go,
wow,
one gig it's going to take,

655
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.640
you know how many people are doing that at the same time,

656
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:49.170
there's no union people downloading the same one gig update to Mac Osx and

657
00:36:49.171 --> 00:36:52.350
you've got to look at that and go,
God damn,
how much bandwidth is that?

658
00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.610
You know what's weird is that,

659
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:57.330
I think it was spring just released a report the other day that they just got

660
00:36:57.331 --> 00:37:01.410
the new iPhone on their network and how the droid in Motorola,

661
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.040
they spend 30% or 40% more bandwidth than the iPhone.

662
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.040
They've noticed really because of the four G.
Is that what it is?

663
00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.620
I know it's just more people just online.
I think the applications,

664
00:37:10.621 --> 00:37:13.740
how they're designed,
there's more things streaming,
constantly connected,

665
00:37:13.741 --> 00:37:14.970
I'm guessing.
Oh,
that makes sense.

666
00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:18.120
It streaming because you know you were able able to get all those different

667
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.450
flash videos,
right?
You can't get on iPhone,
things like that.

668
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.570
Those four g phones are fucking fast,
man.

669
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.490
Verizon's four g I went to the store and I fucked around with that droid.
Bionic.

670
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.730
That thing is a slick.
If you have it in your area,
it's not,

671
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:34.020
I mean it's not everywhere.
You know,

672
00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:38.180
like you probably won't get it here at this house.
Uh,
no,
I barely got it.
Got It.

673
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.610
Cause I have a four g card and I can get online with it,
but barely.

674
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.110
I noticed what the,
the a four s that it's twice,

675
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.050
it's two times faster than they had before,

676
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.170
but it's two times fast through 18 and t at and t sucks dude.

677
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.100
It's always fucking up.
When you're in any place where it's high volume,

678
00:37:56.101 --> 00:37:59.760
you can't get a call.
You can't make a call or have any problems anymore.

679
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.720
The network's diluted.
I think you make as many calls as I do.

680
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.830
When I'm in my car and I'm driving in Jujitsu,
I'm driving to a comedy show.

681
00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:11.790
I'm constantly doing business in my car to a businessman.
I'm a businessman.

682
00:38:11.791 --> 00:38:15.180
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just getting,
my bend has done.
I um,
you know,

683
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:16.320
I always have to take care of shit.

684
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:20.920
I have to deal with successfully drive from my house to your house.
Uh,
hallway.

685
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.750
Really.
Is this a new thing?
Did you always were in the last three months?

686
00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:28.340
Four months got better.
It's gotten a lot better really.
And My,

687
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:33.370
my data network at my house is like six megabyte download on the new iPhone,

688
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:37.540
so that's pretty crazy.
That's pretty crazy.
Well,
when I had it,

689
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.570
I couldn't drive to Hollywood and keep a conversation.

690
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.480
There was three places where it would cut out and it would drive me fucking
nuts.

691
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:47.380
I'd be like,
this is Hollywood in 2011 you know we had Anthony Bordain on,

692
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:49.840
he was talking about you can be in China in the middle of the fucking woods and

693
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:53.030
you got four bars on your phone like they got at wired over there.
They're,

694
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.770
they're like so advanced as far as like cell phone coverage and things like
that.

695
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:59.830
Yeah.
That,
that drives me nuts.
The at and t thing would drive me nuts.

696
00:38:59.831 --> 00:39:01.180
And then when you're at the UFC,

697
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:04.060
I know this is still a fact when there's that many people in the arena,

698
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:07.180
when you're looking at an 18,000 seat arena and everyone jumps online,

699
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.570
you can't get online,
you can't get online.
It doesn't work.
It just doesn't work.

700
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.010
It shows you you got three bars and it won't get online and won't open anything.

701
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.560
You can't get on Twitter.
But then I get to Verizon,
boop,
right on.
Nope.

702
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:22.200
<v 2>Yup.
It show you just got a new phone.
You got to enjoy fun.
Right.</v>

703
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.800
You've got the,
yeah,
the spring EDV four g phone.
Uh,

704
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:30.530
what's your review on it and like why would your editorial,
listen man,

705
00:39:30.531 --> 00:39:31.760
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

706
00:39:31.761 --> 00:39:35.750
I went online and tried to look up the directions on youtube to learn how to do

707
00:39:35.751 --> 00:39:38.720
a couple things on it,
but I'm very happy.
Number one,

708
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.710
I was getting calls inside the UFC.
I've always been,
you know,

709
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.960
I don't know what a bad phone services cause I've always had spread as far as

710
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.500
the phone was concerned.
I like to,

711
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:51.410
I get emails when I do push it back button and ended up on Twitter.
I'm on it,

712
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:54.230
right.
I mean I'm a fucking Twitter.
I can't believe it.
It's something,

713
00:39:54.231 --> 00:39:58.100
my thing and I can't see this thing is fucking huge.
You know,

714
00:39:58.101 --> 00:40:01.310
if if you really need like,
and when I get texts,
I get two texts.

715
00:40:01.311 --> 00:40:02.660
I get a text regular size,

716
00:40:02.661 --> 00:40:06.650
it's going to hit it again and then I get this fucking term paper,
you know?

717
00:40:06.651 --> 00:40:08.990
So it's pretty cool for me.
It works for me.
It's the camera.

718
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:11.510
I don't know how to use it.
So I'm about to come over.

719
00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.320
That's why I called you last week.
Come over your house.
I was by Your House,
Huh?

720
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.610
How can it be hard?
It's just the camera on the phone.

721
00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.950
If I pressed the wrong button,
I'm,

722
00:40:18.951 --> 00:40:21.290
I'm fucking how Bailey at buying fucking dresses.

723
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.740
I don't know what I'm doing on the website.
And I started hitting,

724
00:40:24.741 --> 00:40:28.640
so I've been learning things.
I downloaded apps,
now I read my apps,
you know,

725
00:40:28.641 --> 00:40:31.430
I know how to do those things.
It's cool.
I say one thing for a,

726
00:40:31.431 --> 00:40:35.570
for getting online.
You can't beat that big screen.
A battery life.

727
00:40:35.571 --> 00:40:39.710
What do you think about that?
It's how I,
again,
you cannot,
I know what abusers,

728
00:40:39.711 --> 00:40:43.040
if I get a youtube video,
look at a youtube video.
When I'm in the restaurant,

729
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.190
I was going to kill any fucking battery.
10 spirits.
What do you rate it?

730
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.060
10 spirits for?
For Joey Diaz.
For anybody else?

731
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.730
I'm very content with the service.
I don't know.

732
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.660
I'm going to have to get my wife's a iPhone and try her out and see where it

733
00:40:56.661 --> 00:41:00.350
gets stuck and shit like that.
That's the sprint EVD for g something,
but no,

734
00:41:00.351 --> 00:41:03.550
this is,
I got the shitty one.
I got the galaxy s Alex.
Yes,

735
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.040
but it's still the forecast.
Yes,
a great phone,
Bro.

736
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.720
I can't even tell you the numbers.
I get this foot,

737
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.850
$80 a month with the whole fucking plan.

738
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.600
Just a few months ago it was the best Troy phone.

739
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:16.490
Are you fucking crazy guys still call me.
I'm,
you know,

740
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:20.530
a galaxy s two is supposed to be the shit that galaxy s two,

741
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.920
I suppose this one now there's another one,
right?
Yeah,
that's what I've heard.

742
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.890
Am I allowed to a text to yet?
Because

743
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.883
your family

744
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.190
<v 0>bothering me.
Fucking just call me.
I've got some,</v>

745
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.410
you know the funny thing is I Guess Tomorrow Redman fill me in.
I know.

746
00:41:39.411 --> 00:41:42.050
What do you guys know what happens tomorrow with direct TV?

747
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:46.600
They loose Fox and everything.
Usually.
Uh,

748
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.410
I read the UFC wasn't in jeopardy then.
They didn't have to worry about it.

749
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.190
Don't know why you're fucking around with this direct TV's.
It's got a universe.

750
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:00.530
Yeah.
I think I'm going to,
I think it's great man.
Now what's the other?

751
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:04.970
Isn't the other one better than universe that I could go viral horizon?

752
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.930
No bias files.
No.
There's another warning cable.
The cable.
That's what I know.
No,

753
00:42:09.931 --> 00:42:13.080
no.
Shoot yourself in the mouth.
Let it slowly.
Kelly.

754
00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.000
This is a problem.
It,
it goes off.
Sometimes it goes off.

755
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.460
I have to reboot it and we lose the podcast sometimes.

756
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.490
I mean I have the highest level of cable they sell and you know,

757
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.580
a lot of times when we're uploading they'll say low bandwidth and I'll just kick

758
00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:28.430
us off line and then we have to reboot.

759
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.100
We have to reboot it by Warner brothers,
you know,

760
00:42:31.101 --> 00:42:33.650
and everyone would look at movies you're not supposed to.
It's not that good.

761
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.860
It's not the best.
Maybe it's my connection.

762
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.350
Maybe I don't have a good connection up here cause I'm kinda in the middle of

763
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:41.570
nowhere.
I don't know what it is,
but they told me I would get,
you know,

764
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.880
x amount of downloads speeds.

765
00:42:42.881 --> 00:42:45.980
It's just not that good because I seen the shows that they lose if you have,

766
00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:46.671
like the other day,

767
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:50.240
email emailed me like the shows I lose one of these shows is sons of anarchy.

768
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:53.330
Chuck's eat almost be jumping up and down,
get him saying you lose it if a,

769
00:42:53.331 --> 00:42:57.160
if this goes
the fight.
Well Chuck Tito isn't,

770
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.330
he's suing sons of anarchy I guess.
I don't know.

771
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:03.230
What it says is that was like his idea.
I told her,
I came up to him,
I got a bike,

772
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:07.050
I got a fucking camera.
Come on.
Yeah,

773
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:10.640
I never watched that show.
Do you watch that show?

774
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.580
I started watching it this year because a buddy of mine's on the show and I

775
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:16.280
bumped into him after a few years.
I liked that guy,
Ron Perlman's,

776
00:43:16.281 --> 00:43:20.540
those names everybody.
My friend was on it.
She says he was fucking great now.

777
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:24.320
He was just a really good guy that heard.
I bet he is.
He's hilarious.

778
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.060
Like guy's good.
He's getting a lot of movies.

779
00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:28.880
He was good and drive [inaudible] drive drive yet.
No,

780
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:33.810
very violent but good movies guys.
I've done 30 years.

781
00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.820
I still like a good car.
Chase a weld done car chase,
you know,

782
00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.030
drive at some wild car chases.
If you watched the preview,

783
00:43:41.031 --> 00:43:45.310
apparently it looks like that.
It was like a car chase movie,

784
00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.190
like real action movie.

785
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:51.080
And some woman went to see it and sued because she felt like the uh,

786
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.660
the,
the previews misrepresented the film.

787
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.910
She didn't know it was going to be this weird,

788
00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.960
moody sort of a dude with add or whatever.
The hell he's got.
You know,

789
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:00.680
it looks like he's,

790
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.700
he's got like a mild autism or Asperger's or something like that and he's out

791
00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:09.410
there killing people.
Stoically cars two comes out on video.
You'll like that.

792
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:13.750
Then cars too.
What does that new Pixar movie that came out of that?

793
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.410
I would like the worst.
This lady suit.

794
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.290
She sued because she thought that the movie was not what she went to say.
Like,

795
00:44:20.291 --> 00:44:23.960
oh,
how hilarious is that?
What a dumb bitch.
Does she really have money?

796
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.040
I don't know.
I don't think so.

797
00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.920
I don't think they've settled because they pay the fucking dumb bitch.

798
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.150
I don't think they've settled.

799
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.670
I think it's just one of those things you hear about in the news and you get

800
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:35.730
sued for anything now.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
Like fucking with anything.
Well,

801
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:40.731
are you got sued by like crazy skitzo guy for being a bad lawyer is Ari wasn't,

802
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.800
you know our who's pretended he was a lawyer to a crazy person.
You know,

803
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:44.730
looking back at it,

804
00:44:44.731 --> 00:44:48.300
that was a really bad idea to saying that you're a lawyer and you know,

805
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:50.510
that's probably against the law.
I'm sure there's a law somewhere.

806
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.260
Like he can't tell people you're a lawyer.
There is always a comic.

807
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.510
These guy comes to a comedy club,

808
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.380
talks to Ari at Acom and club after Ari gets off stage or he tells him he's a

809
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:05.370
lawyer and he'll represent him as he's suing.
I mean,
come on man.

810
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:10.350
The real problem was the guy was crazy.
Yeah.
Just to the bone crazy.

811
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:15.150
That place,
that comedy store is a fucking magnet.
There's,
there's a vortex there.

812
00:45:15.151 --> 00:45:15.660
I'm not,

813
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.010
I don't believe in hippy shit like crystals and this is the sacred part of the

814
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:23.760
universe.
This one area,
let's huddle and together like where I lived in boulder,

815
00:45:23.761 --> 00:45:27.270
there was a,
a circle of rocks and this lady was like,

816
00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:30.420
this Yoga Lady was into this rock circle and she was telling me that,
you know,

817
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.250
you have to stand in true north and accept the universe and this is a sacred,

818
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.530
this is sacred land.
I don't believe in that.

819
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.140
But I do believe there's something about the comedy store.

820
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.590
There is something about that place where there's crazy people walking down

821
00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:46.470
sunset and they,
they,
they stop at that place and they just,

822
00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:48.750
they just start walking,

823
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.710
start walking in that place we met more crazy place,

824
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.470
more crazy people at that place in any other place in Hollywood.

825
00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.220
Like if you have a compare between the nuts that go to the improv and then not

826
00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:02.040
to go to the comedy store,
there's no comparison.
Right?

827
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.970
It's two different fucking worlds.
Two different worlds,
two different worlds.

828
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.180
I know I will be a regular at the store and how people would say,

829
00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:11.490
how do you go up there?
People are scared of that.

830
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.070
People are fucking scared of them.

831
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.700
Super dark playground versus treehouse playground versus treehouse commies.

832
00:46:20.161 --> 00:46:22.610
There's like a playground.
Like any shit will happen,
you know,

833
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:25.650
it's out in the open tree house.
Like you're kind of like with the same people,

834
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:29.160
but you're kind of protected and it's more like,
you know,
chill for comics.

835
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.780
<v 2>Nick Diaz would hang up in the Improv is a GSP.
Yeah.</v>

836
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:40.060
GSP.
He's just a gentleman.
He's calm,
calmly store.

837
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.140
Look at the fucking we got and they were talking about Freddie Prinze.

838
00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.280
Freddie prince goes back to the comedy store,
and that was the 70s you know,

839
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:50.240
21 shooting the fucking gun when they were coked up the fucking hill with that

840
00:46:50.241 --> 00:46:54.380
crazy guy.
And you know,
this was a,
a home of dysfunction.

841
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.510
The owner was fucking the comics,
you know,
sucking their dicks Twitter time.

842
00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.630
You know,
they had a house where they did blow and Louisiana,
Dyson,

843
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.290
Roseanne all lived through this fucking same house at one time.

844
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.380
Listen to the talent and that fucking room.
I mean,
you know,

845
00:47:09.381 --> 00:47:11.840
when you have that intensity of talent,
you're going,

846
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.550
it has to go the opposite way.

847
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.800
You got to have that intensity because you're right on,

848
00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.950
you're teetering right on that fucking fine line of brilliance and fucking

849
00:47:18.951 --> 00:47:21.080
craziness.
It's somewhere in there.

850
00:47:21.081 --> 00:47:25.580
It's the fucking commonly is that humor and that all that energy got sucked into

851
00:47:25.581 --> 00:47:28.610
the walls.
It's something that,

852
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:33.730
that building has a feel to it.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

853
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:35.050
there's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake.

854
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:38.770
He's an evolutionary biologist who believes that everything has a memory,

855
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.340
that everything has some sort of,
uh,
like,
uh,
some,

856
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:46.600
some capability of a recording the past and that even furniture.

857
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.850
It's why people love antiques.
You know,

858
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:51.910
there's something not just about the fact that this character to it,

859
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:55.840
but it really gives off a feeling to it because it has so many memories in it.

860
00:47:55.841 --> 00:47:59.410
If people using it,
you know,
that has a rich,
ancient feeling to it.

861
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.350
And people believe that that's the case with buildings.
You know,

862
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:05.580
that building's almost have a built in memory.
You know,

863
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.730
that they have something where,
you know,
if you like,
here's a perfect example.

864
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:13.120
When I was in boulder,
the Jonbenet Ramsey house was for sale,

865
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.650
or Jon Benet Ramsey.
Dot.
And it's a big,
beautiful house.
But it was cheap.

866
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.360
It was way cheaper than it would have ordinarily been.
And,
uh,
I remember,
uh,

867
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.880
talking about it with some friends and then what?

868
00:48:24.881 --> 00:48:28.140
Fuck that I wouldn't fucking live there,
you know?

869
00:48:28.141 --> 00:48:30.500
And why wouldn't you live there?
It's not like the,

870
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.080
the kid's going to come back to life.

871
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.170
It's not like the guy's gonna fuck you in the ass and knock you over the head

872
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:38.470
with a rock and kill you.
No,
it's,
it's already over.
The crime's been committed.

873
00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:41.380
Now it's just a house.
Like why?
Why would you avoid that house?

874
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:46.030
Because that house has got a memory in it,
man.
There's a man we know inherently.

875
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:49.720
We know.
You know you would never do that.
You'd never be able to live there.
No.

876
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:54.600
It's like,
look,
I have gone in the water in places where people drowned,
you know?

877
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.420
Do you know what the Indians underneath this house somewhere,
that's my point.

878
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:03.340
I have walked on ground where I'm sure someone has died,
but a building,

879
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.460
a building where someone died,
you'd have to,

880
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.070
you got to plow that motherfucker over and start from scratch.

881
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.980
You've got to get rid of that building.
I'm very,

882
00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:16.240
very fucking happy you had this conversation.
I am fucking,

883
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:20.050
cause I had something in my heart the last three weeks that has blown me the

884
00:49:20.051 --> 00:49:22.870
fuck away.
And I know I'm not retarded.
I don't know.
Fucking crazy.

885
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.570
I went to New York to shoot the documentary about my life.

886
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:30.250
Right when my mother bought that house to deal was he went back to the house.

887
00:49:30.251 --> 00:49:33.910
You grew up?
My mom had uncle,
so we had an option we could live in Fort Lee.

888
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:36.070
I don't know if,
forget that house was from George Washington.

889
00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:39.640
Can fucking bridge or delete.
We had to fucking leopards in front of the house.

890
00:49:39.641 --> 00:49:42.970
White statues.
I'm like,
Ma,
this is the house was,

891
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.040
we couldn't explain where the cash is coming from.

892
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.320
If we took the house in North Bergen,

893
00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:51.270
the guy would work out some deal with the bank and we had no about the down

894
00:49:51.271 --> 00:49:53.320
payment problem with the house in North Bergen.

895
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.170
They didn't tell us when we got the house,
after we moved in,

896
00:49:56.171 --> 00:50:00.260
somebody had hung himself well downstairs and the block is on offer.

897
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.340
They just a dead end.
The fucking street,
which is bad luck.

898
00:50:03.341 --> 00:50:05.620
Right fucking that dead in the streets.
That's just bad.

899
00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:10.130
As the end of that board was an orff sprints,
a fucking orphanage?
No,

900
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:14.470
I lived in that house.
I seen,
uh,
I find my mom on the floor of that house.
I mean,

901
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:15.304
I grew up in the house.

902
00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:19.810
Had on your mom died when you were on [inaudible] acid.

903
00:50:19.811 --> 00:50:23.020
1415.
It's tested and it's just so weird now.

904
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.630
I had great times in that house as a kid.
I can't lie.
The low last people came.

905
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:30.260
I got my sucked.
I seen my first point.
Oh,
in the attic.
I smoked dope.

906
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.770
I remember after my mom died,
my dad came over to me on the street and he goes,

907
00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:34.940
committed to cough for a second.

908
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.680
You had a box like this and he lifted the box up and he goes,

909
00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:43.790
look in this box and it was three inches of roaches,
not cockroaches.

910
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:47.000
We'd roaches and he looked me straight in the eye because you got to stop this

911
00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:50.180
today.
This is bad.
We would go upstairs and those days

912
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.640
we would go upstairs and we were 13 five of us and we buy half ounce of weed and

913
00:50:55.641 --> 00:50:58.980
that when those days we wasn't that strong.
So you bought a half hour,

914
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.620
$25 we wrote 30 joints.

915
00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:03.680
That's a good deal because you could still sell 25 joints.

916
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:08.150
Get your money back inside and smoke five.
We'd smoke them all five guys.

917
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:11.420
We'd sit there with an eight pack of Budweiser cans and we wouldn't go home to

918
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.880
every joint.
That bag was pumped and gone.

919
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.780
If the only way he'd go home with there was five of us and we said we'd take a

920
00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:21.710
joint for the morning.
So you've been getting high steady since you were how old?

921
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:28.390
Steady steady's Freddy Steady Freddy that he 16 since you were 16 but when I was

922
00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.000
18 and 30 plus years dirty,

923
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:37.940
I used to be an athlete and with wage run to the George Washington bridge,

924
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.890
but on Fridays I had my little freak crew.
I used to do karate with Mario Diaz.

925
00:51:42.891 --> 00:51:44.530
Week we do homework and people don't know.

926
00:51:44.531 --> 00:51:47.240
This is a picture of you right behind you,
over to your right shoulder.

927
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.990
That's when you were like a fucking fit athlete.
Look at you.
You animal fucking,

928
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.600
what are you talking about?
You're guide them football player there.

929
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:55.400
You were huge.
Don't fucking football player.

930
00:51:55.401 --> 00:51:58.160
That's how you were when I first met you.
So people don't know.

931
00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.140
It was just really weird,
Joe,
that I would,

932
00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.150
I would lift weights and eat carrots and,

933
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.020
and then on the weekends I had my little fucking Guinea crew and they,
we get,

934
00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:10.070
you know,
a case of Budweiser that we rub off a beer truck and we wouldn't tell,

935
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:12.800
nobody would had magazine and Cologne,
you know,

936
00:52:12.801 --> 00:52:14.300
like nobody knew that we got high,

937
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.500
but we were jocks and then my mother died and they're not even really like

938
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:20.840
drinking.
So I had to do something when I went out with these kids.

939
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:23.750
So I smoked up.
I love drinking.
You know what?

940
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:27.020
I don't love the day after drinking fucker.

941
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:31.610
I love getting a little lit though.
It's fun,
Dude.
We went to a,

942
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.760
Joey and I after the fights we went,
oh,
you didn't come up to the,

943
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:39.600
you went to club mixer mix and we went up with my boy Justin from the action

944
00:52:39.601 --> 00:52:44.060
report,
the guy who does the pool gambling videos and the holy shit.

945
00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:48.380
We got hammered.
Woo.
We kept coming.
We just kept those drinks.
Comment.

946
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:52.310
Where's that one of those?
Wake up.
Go to the airport.
Three sleep for three hours.

947
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:56.510
Go to the outdoor.
No,
it was good.
Joe.
He got me a coffee though.
I kept me up,

948
00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:00.020
but I was telling you that we went to my mother's house,
that same house and I,

949
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:01.370
whenever I go to North Bergen,

950
00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:04.070
I was go to the cemetery and put flowers and I take a ride by the house,

951
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:07.640
but I never get out of the fucking car.
That's a complete different story.

952
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.170
Taking a ride and getting out of the car.

953
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.890
This time I actually got out of the car and went in front of the fucking garage

954
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.061
and talked.

955
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:17.480
It was like somebody was kicking my knees out like that was just like,

956
00:53:17.481 --> 00:53:20.720
it was like I was getting wheezy,
like I was feeling bad.

957
00:53:20.721 --> 00:53:23.560
I was feeling all those emotions because I never carry my keys on.

958
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.940
I'd always hide them in the back under the condition to pull out and open the

959
00:53:26.941 --> 00:53:29.400
garage and the garage.
I was one of those kids.

960
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.660
And then the Cuban guy came up and we started talking and I told him that my mom

961
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:35.700
died in the house and he goes to people live there.

962
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:38.640
I'm watching the house there away.
You want to go on the back of the house?

963
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:42.870
And I went to the back when I played,
I was a basketball and it was over anxiety.

964
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.840
It wasn't even an anxiety,
but I could feel the walls,

965
00:53:45.841 --> 00:53:48.870
I could feel the brick walls.
Like they knew,
you know,

966
00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:52.230
like I had been there before and she goes,
if you want,
I could open up the place.

967
00:53:52.231 --> 00:53:56.040
And that was too real for me.
I was like,
fuck that.
None.
I'm good.
Well,

968
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.110
even just the emotions of being around it,

969
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.330
even if there was no memory in the building,

970
00:54:00.331 --> 00:54:03.360
just to the retreat occurring of your past,
you know,

971
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:06.630
old places like you ever been around your old high school,
please.

972
00:54:06.631 --> 00:54:09.270
I wanted that when I went back all the songs,
grammar school,

973
00:54:09.271 --> 00:54:11.530
and then did everything when I was a kid.
Um,

974
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.890
I used to have a problem when I was like,

975
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:18.150
it was when I was just starting to do stand up and I was like just starting to

976
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:22.890
move forward with my life.
I would go back to like where my high school was,

977
00:54:22.891 --> 00:54:27.060
go back to Newton and I drove around and I would feel like I felt when I was

978
00:54:27.061 --> 00:54:29.250
going to school there,
it would make me insecure.

979
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:33.600
I would feel like I felt like when I was in high school and didn't know what my

980
00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:38.220
future was going to hold and was just really confused and I felt like a loser

981
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:39.530
and I would go back to high school.

982
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.880
It didn't matter how well I had done since high school.

983
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:45.240
How many taekwondo tournament side won or how many,
you know,

984
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:46.740
standup comedy shows I had done,

985
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.290
I still felt like a loser when I was around my high school.

986
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:51.480
It made me feel like it's still like I was illegitimate.

987
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:54.640
I wasn't confident enough yet.
You know,
there's definitely memory to it.
And like,

988
00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.030
there's definitely like,
like if you got raped in the basement,

989
00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:01.770
every time you go into the basement,
you'd probably be like basements.
Yes,
Brian.

990
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.080
But it's the main thing that,
this is how I justified it,

991
00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:07.530
failing on the plane the next day.

992
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:11.100
Cause I even felt that the next day on the plate I felt really bad.
And I said,

993
00:55:11.101 --> 00:55:11.934
you know what,

994
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.870
even if you had a childhood that was the president's son when you moved out of

995
00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:17.720
the White House,
if you go back through the White House,

996
00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:20.910
you still gonna get some chills.
Your souls are in those walls.

997
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:25.100
You talked to those wall.
He went to bed quiet one night.
You cried.
Oh,

998
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.930
I went back to the house where I grew up for the first time at 20 years.

999
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:32.730
Last week,
not last week,
last month I was in Boston.
And uh,
I went back and,

1000
00:55:32.731 --> 00:55:35.400
uh,
I stood in front of the house.
It was a real bizarre,

1001
00:55:35.401 --> 00:55:39.680
I lived in a weird section of a Newton upper falls.
I lived,
um,

1002
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.580
it was pretty rural for where I lived.

1003
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.050
I lived right in front of the Charles River.

1004
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:45.360
There was like a big park in front of my house in the Charles River.

1005
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.960
And then essentially there was a lot of woods behind there.
There's a lot,

1006
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.100
lot of woods in that area.
But uh,

1007
00:55:50.101 --> 00:55:52.890
that's where I used to hang out when I was a kid and I went back there and was

1008
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:53.760
walking around.

1009
00:55:53.761 --> 00:55:57.360
There's a spot called echo bridge in my house was the house right on echo

1010
00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.640
bridges,
38 Ellis Street.
And uh,
I went back there.

1011
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:06.420
It was so fucking strange.
Everything about it.
Like you could just,

1012
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.680
you just read all these flashbacks start popping into my head of,
you know,

1013
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:11.850
of walking nothing in these,

1014
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.150
on these same streets and standing in front of the same house.

1015
00:56:15.151 --> 00:56:18.450
The house looks exactly the same.
My father built that house,
so it was,

1016
00:56:18.451 --> 00:56:19.380
it was all real weird.

1017
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:24.070
It was a stood in the exact parking spot or I caught my friend Adam

1018
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.570
<v 0>fingering this girl that I was dating.</v>

1019
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.800
I was dating this girl I dated,

1020
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:34.390
I dated a lot of sluts and you know,
look,
no offense to them.

1021
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:37.690
I'm sure there were good girls and I'm sure it's probably they're probably

1022
00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:38.201
fucked up,

1023
00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:40.720
which is why they were attracted to me in the first place because I was fucked

1024
00:56:40.721 --> 00:56:44.860
up.
But uh,
I did a lot of girls that cheated on me.
Holy Shit.

1025
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:48.940
They were just horse.
I did this one girl,
she literally,

1026
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:53.890
everybody that tried to fucker fucked her,
she could not pass,
she could not pass.

1027
00:56:53.891 --> 00:56:54.350
It was just,

1028
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:57.910
she was just one of those crazy Catholic girls that was like suppressed her

1029
00:56:57.911 --> 00:56:58.570
whole life.

1030
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:01.930
And all you had to do was try and you are banging her and everybody I know

1031
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:06.610
banker and then when I was,
I was just sort of starting to dater and uh,

1032
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:11.670
I got up early because I had a newspaper route and she was parked in front of my

1033
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:13.290
house.
It's so crazy.
Fucking people are,

1034
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.600
and they're both in front of my house and he's fingering her right in the right

1035
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:20.420
on the front seat.
And I slammed my hand down on the hood and I'm like,

1036
00:57:20.421 --> 00:57:24.580
good morning,
I go,
you fucking crazy assholes.

1037
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.550
And then I just got my car and I drove off and then,
but you know,

1038
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.490
I fucked her a bunch of times after that,
but it never took her seriously again.

1039
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:33.370
And it was one of those like,
okay,
now I see.
But that happened.

1040
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:36.970
That was like an overwhelming pattern over and over again where a chick would do

1041
00:57:36.971 --> 00:57:39.940
something fucked up.
And then I never take you seriously again.
You know,

1042
00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:43.300
a couple of times it was girls who went on spring break one time a girl went on

1043
00:57:43.301 --> 00:57:46.300
spring bag,
girl I was living with this girl and she came back,

1044
00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:48.340
she was acting real weird.
I'm like,
what the fuck is up with you?

1045
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:51.230
Like why are you acting so weird?
And then she had confessed that she,

1046
00:57:51.231 --> 00:57:52.660
she kissed some guy,
she said,

1047
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:56.560
you tell me kiss some guy and you're on spring break and you fuck some dude,

1048
00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:00.430
period.
You come back all weird and say you kiss some guy,
you fuck some dude.

1049
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.940
And you know,
we had a talk about it,
but we wanted up staying together,

1050
00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:07.510
but I never took it seriously again.
You know,
and it never bothered me again.

1051
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:09.990
Like so like if I had the opportunity to cheat a bit,
like

1052
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.820
I would,
I wouldn't even,
there was no,
it was like I was single.

1053
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.520
It was like I had a girlfriend,
but I was single,
you know,

1054
00:58:18.521 --> 00:58:21.130
like the opportunity to,
she came up.
Yeah,
of course I would.

1055
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:24.610
This pitch came back from spring break and she was fucking some other dude and

1056
00:58:24.611 --> 00:58:27.160
one girl with the spring break.
This is my best one.

1057
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.060
She came back with fucking rug burn on her back.

1058
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:36.280
Her whole back was like her whole lower back,
you know,
was just fucked up.

1059
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:38.320
This dude just lit her up.

1060
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:42.370
She went to Florida with her cousins or some shit and she came back and when I

1061
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:45.190
asked her about it,
she told me that she was leaning up against the fence.

1062
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:48.310
She was drinking and she was leaning up against a fence and there was like a

1063
00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:51.820
nail in the fence,
which is so ridiculous.

1064
00:58:51.821 --> 00:58:54.490
It's such a bad lie and again,

1065
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.020
I couldn't prove anything so I stayed with her,

1066
00:58:57.021 --> 00:58:59.110
but I never took it seriously again.
I was always like a,

1067
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:03.010
eventually this is going to end,
this cannot go anywhere.
This was the,

1068
00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.570
this is never going to be my wife.

1069
00:59:04.571 --> 00:59:06.190
This is never going to be the mother of my children.

1070
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.520
This is just some crazy bitch.
That all right.
That's what happened.

1071
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:13.450
Oh you had a nail and you scratch it up and down your back and big six inch

1072
00:59:13.451 --> 00:59:17.390
swaths.
Like whoever that guy was,
he fucked the shit out of her.
Go.

1073
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.750
I like to talk to him about that.
He chicks in Jersey when I was growing up,

1074
00:59:20.751 --> 00:59:22.100
but beat that dirty

1075
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.490
<v 2>or I used to day from Michigan,</v>

1076
00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:27.350
the one that threw me out when I first met you took my clothes and leather

1077
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:29.150
jacket.
That's the crazy bitch.

1078
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:31.970
I was fucking in the ass and Seattle when I felt something hit and my deck.

1079
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.120
So I looked at her asshole like stuck like two fingers,

1080
00:59:35.121 --> 00:59:37.010
like something was hitting the top of my unit.
I'm like,

1081
00:59:37.011 --> 00:59:38.490
what the fuck is this sharp thing?
It.

1082
00:59:38.491 --> 00:59:43.020
And so I took my dick and I just put two fingers in.

1083
00:59:43.021 --> 00:59:47.930
They searched around her asshole and it felt like a fucking little like a a,

1084
00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:48.751
you know what you need to hurt?

1085
00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:52.490
She's balling aluminum foil that's inside the Hershey like half of it.

1086
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:56.060
And I took it out but it was all wrinkled up and it was like this was pointing

1087
00:59:56.061 --> 00:59:58.370
over here and I just took it out,
look at it.

1088
00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:00.740
It was like kind of brownish and put on the table or something.

1089
01:00:00.741 --> 01:00:05.360
My dig back in there and finished up.
What?
Oh,
I came,

1090
01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:08.210
I just got up with toilet paper and picking up.
I never said man,
it was,

1091
01:00:08.211 --> 01:00:09.880
how do you tell somebody to have an aluminum foil?
And

1092
01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.190
I can say you have STD or something,
but aluminum foil that get that about.

1093
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.320
Well why would you ask?
You know,
it was just a little piece where machine,

1094
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:22.000
a piece of chewing gum.
She was a crazy fucking strip it,
check the logs.

1095
01:00:22.001 --> 01:00:25.340
You will remember that I was the one when I first met you.
Well,

1096
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:29.090
that was some of the craziest shit I had been with crazy women.

1097
01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:30.380
I've been about people.

1098
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.500
That's the first time I ever found out about sugar daddies.

1099
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:37.630
Like she's the one that filled me and she's like,
well okay,

1100
01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:40.880
let me tell you this story.
I have this guy that pays my bills and I'm like,

1101
01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:45.150
bitch,
I'm getting a piece of that.
Fuck y'all getting the color.
That shit.

1102
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.950
If he's paying and he's fucking you and I'm,
I'm again a peaceful.

1103
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.150
You were her boyfriend towards the end.

1104
01:00:50.151 --> 01:00:54.950
She was my sugar daddy was the end like towards the end,
like in Seattle,

1105
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:57.620
cause after Seattle was the same thing.
Like you,
you don't take him serious.

1106
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.490
I didn't take it serious no more.
So you were just getting a piece.
Yeah,

1107
01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.460
it was getting a piece,
you know.
So you would tell her,
all right,

1108
01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:07.550
you could fuck this guy,
but I got to get some money.
I wouldn't say nothing.
Yeah.

1109
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:09.800
I would say I'm taking a piece of,
and she goes,
you're fucking crazy.

1110
01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:12.230
I'm getting a fucking piece of that.
I mean this bitch,
listen.

1111
01:01:12.231 --> 01:01:13.590
She would say you're fucking him.
And I had,

1112
01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:16.860
I had fucked people before I had fucking come on people,

1113
01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.440
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
But this was a different level.
Like she,

1114
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.180
this was just a different level of retardation.

1115
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:27.380
She would take pictures of my deck and shit.
I mean,
she was fucking nuts.

1116
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:28.214
This chair,

1117
01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.560
like I don't know if she would bring strippers or was she brought up this one

1118
01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:31.940
girl over.
I just remembered this.

1119
01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.330
She brought this one girl over one day that was playing that I have a boyfriend

1120
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:37.550
routine.
So this girl putting together,

1121
01:01:37.551 --> 01:01:40.730
eat her pussy and for me to fuck her from behind while she was eating her pussy.

1122
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:44.750
But the girl wouldn't let me see your pussy because he had a boyfriend.
I'm like,

1123
01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:47.840
only a stripper would do that.
She's like,
she could see my titties.

1124
01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:49.940
Cause if he comes to the club,
you can see where it says,
but I have a boyfriend.

1125
01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.320
I don't want them to really see my pussy.

1126
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.500
So my girlfriend's eating her fucking monkey and I'm pumping my girlfriend from

1127
01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:57.140
behind.
I'm trying to catch a piece of this fucking monkey.

1128
01:01:57.141 --> 01:01:59.270
She was a hot little job girl.
That was pretty fucking,

1129
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:02.550
I couldn't catch a fucking monkey.
Like that's what people know.

1130
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.460
That's the people she brought over like crazy shit,

1131
01:02:05.461 --> 01:02:07.880
like they was just crazy.

1132
01:02:07.881 --> 01:02:11.200
Then I got to duck the shooting that he came to Michigan.
He hand dirty crazy.

1133
01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:16.060
The Michigan the fist fight me.
So at the time I got,
that's the deal.

1134
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.290
I didn't beat her up.
I was beating him up.
She jumped in.

1135
01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:22.230
I pushed her out the next day.
I'm not,
I'm beating up this fucking broad.

1136
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:25.700
But once you had that shit on you,
you can't get rid of that.
Right.

1137
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:29.310
Everything you do involves that domestic domestic violence thing every in the

1138
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:31.620
fuck you doing.
So the sugar daddy showed up,

1139
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.600
showed up at this comedy underground and was like coked up and drunk.

1140
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.480
He looked like Anthony Bourdain,
the sugar that he fucked up.

1141
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:42.210
I'm gonna fuck you up.

at the time I'm like,

1142
01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:44.730

Take his money.

1145
01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.930

They thought they were in love.

1149
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:10.560
We pleased until this day.

1157
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:40.280

Every time she sees me on TV or something,

1159
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:50.110

So she called you and she just gives you the flow.
I just laughed my ass off.

This is like the craziest thing in my life and I play with sound sick con,

1161

Oh my God.

1164
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:14.220
Wasn't she dating some black karate guy or something like that?

1165
01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.650
That's the guy that tied her up and held a shot gun to her head.

1166
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.660
This motherfucker shot,

1167
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.370
this motherfucker found out she was sucking 10,000 decks and said,

1168
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.900
I'm going out for it back and cigarettes.
He came back with a sick God,

1169
01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.370
a bottle of Tequila and a rope.
Oh No.
And he tied her up.

1170
01:04:36.371 --> 01:04:39.450
Man looked at the bench and he goes with his and tequilas gun,
um,

1171
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.930
fucking shooting yet.
I'm slitting my wrists.
Whoa.

1172
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.740
So he had her by Eddie's old school.
All right.

1173
01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.120
Ted Planet libray

1174
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.220
down that block and right there if you make the left is the Chinese theater

1175
01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.300
right there.
So some cop was driving by and he sees him in the window.

1176
01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.720
This is a true story with a gun through the window is opened.
He's like,

1177
01:05:00.721 --> 01:05:03.590
I'm gonna kill you.
I love you.
He was pulling the same thing.
Well,

1178
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:08.160
what's that movie?
Playboy 21 that they shot her with the fucking,

1179
01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:11.880
the best role is like fuck God.
Fuck the one with Mickey Rourke.

1180
01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:15.900
What was the one that the chick,
the playmate Roberts.
Eric Roberts.

1181
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:19.780
That's his best fucking movie.
Yeah,
he puts a shotgun and a pussy and shit.

1182
01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:21.790
And then when she's dead he flux on the machine.
Or wait,

1183
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.990
you never watched already tam?
I don't think so.
Oh my God was she was dead.

1184
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.690
That's a true story.
After he killed million,
what's her name?

1185
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:32.140
He built machines to weight lift,
but he also built machines to fuck women on.

1186
01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:36.010
So he made this bench and he cut the back of the bench down and he would,

1187
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.550
so he could put your legs on your knees and he could fuck you from behind.

1188
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:43.030
So it would just open.
Then he would strap your legs and not do as a sick cause.

1189
01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:44.560
That's what he was trying to do.
Well for her.

1190
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.160
He was trying to sell the star ratings sex machine.
Whoa.

1191
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:51.360
That's what the movie was about.
It's about Eric Robertson,
that chick.

1192
01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.370
He was fucking creepy in that.
And then I did some looking up into it.

1193
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.590
That guy was fucking nuts over that bitch.
The real guy.
And the real story,

1194
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:01.510
the real guy was Craig.
They wouldn't let them in the playboy mansion.

1195
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:05.230
And then she was fucking somebody famous like a director.
You know,

1196
01:06:05.231 --> 01:06:07.480
this is the plot of the movie start rating.
No,

1197
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:10.570
this is the real story in real life.
If you look it up,
wherever she was fucking,

1198
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:14.520
she was fucking a famous director.
Who was it based on?
It was based on,
uh,

1199
01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.220
check it out.
Brian,
the girl from Canada that he was dry.
He was doing what?

1200
01:06:18.221 --> 01:06:21.870
Teacher contests and he signed the toll.
They got some pictures of it.

1201
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.010
Got Her in playboy,
moved to La.
They were living the fucking dream,
you know,

1202
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:29.220
and then he married,
you know,
he was a fucking mooch.
He married,

1203
01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.680
but he was trying to marry.
And every week you come to work,
I got to know why.

1204
01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:36.490
I did Joe Rogan,
I bought,
we do the Joe Rogan Test,
a pad,
you know,

1205
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.310
every week he came to a new school and these are the scans he was doing.

1206
01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:41.830
Then when she divorced him,
she gave him money and said,

1207
01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.420
you could keep doing this dumb shit.

1208
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.230
Then he invited her over something and that's when he fucking nice stuff.
Really?

1209
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.230
But he banged her after she was dead and then he shot himself duck.

1210
01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.260
That's a sick motherfucker right there.

1211
01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.740
This is a lot of people that are like dat close to killing themselves on

1212
01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:59.920
Hollywood
clubs.
There's a lot.

1213
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:03.480
Think of how many people lose it over women.
You know?

1214
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.420
Really fucking lose it like that.
That's a,
yeah,
a lot.
Well,
a lot.
You know,
it's,

1215
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.333
you know what it's like.

1216
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.650
It's like if you only have a dollar and someone takes your dollar,

1217
01:07:11.651 --> 01:07:14.830
it's got damn devastating.
But if you,
you know,

1218
01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.410
make $100 an hour and somebody takes your dollar,
you're like,

1219
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.290
I can make another hundred dollars in an hour.
What's the big deal?

1220
01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:23.110
You know what I mean?
It's like when you have a,
for most guys,

1221
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:27.760
the currency of Pussy is just overwhelmingly expensive.

1222
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:29.740
It's overwhelming.
It's really hard,

1223
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:33.760
really hard to get laid for the average cart for the average guy.

1224
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:35.980
So you get a good one,
you get a hot piece of ass,

1225
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.640
you get a hot bench that you're really attracted to and you love her and then

1226
01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:42.610
your emotions get tied up in her and then she wants a dump you and she wants to

1227
01:07:42.611 --> 01:07:44.770
leave you and that's your everything.
That's everything.

1228
01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:47.440
You got everything you got in the world.
The world is this chick.

1229
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.710
That's the best thing you got going for you.
We've all met guys like that.

1230
01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.740
You ever met that one guy who's like not so good looking,

1231
01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:58.480
but he's got this hot bitch and she's just one of those girls that wants a guy

1232
01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:02.440
who's not going anywhere but just,
yeah,
she's one of those girls who wants to,

1233
01:08:02.441 --> 01:08:05.500
God that she knows that she can wrap her tapped out.
She said,

1234
01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:08.380
I'm not playing games with them.
More my age.
I don't want this shit no more.

1235
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.140
Brian,
what are you doing over there buddy?
I was trying to look up that maybe,

1236
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.550
what is it a story about who was the other girl?
Eric and who was the girl?

1237
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:19.910
I haven't found it yet.
There's so many stories like that.
Right.

1238
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:22.560
If a guy going nuts over a check,
hey in the sixth grade by,

1239
01:08:22.561 --> 01:08:25.330
that's why I got left back over New Yorker reasons,
pussy dog,

1240
01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:28.310
that pussy sent me for a loop with the sixth grade and sixth grade.

1241
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.230
Cause you know when you were a kid you always see,

1242
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.630
you always see pussy in playboy pictures and shit.

1243
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:35.750
When you see that shit up close and personal.
That's the real deal though.

1244
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:38.420
I couldn't even fly,
couldn't even think I had quit karate.

1245
01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:42.770
I just stopped talking to my friends,
just banging her just bag of dry humping.

1246
01:08:42.771 --> 01:08:46.340
It started drying up and I was sucking a little funnel teddies and then once I

1247
01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:47.510
got,
she told me she wouldn't give him.

1248
01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:49.990
She told me she wouldn't give me a piece of pussy till the day,

1249
01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.290
first day after school.

1250
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.470
I couldn't wait till that last day of fucking sixth grade.

1251
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.920
But my grades were so low,
like I always had great grades.

1252
01:08:57.930 --> 01:09:00.560
You just go in there and listen.
I don't even have to fucking study.

1253
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:04.580
But all that was on my mind was banging this chick for three months.
Why?

1254
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.430
My parents caught me with her in the closet at that house.

1255
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.760
They was fucking horrible.

1256
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:12.380
They don't make me go to the bar after with my own mom,

1257
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:15.470
cock blocked me and they finally had to go to summer school.

1258
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:18.950
If if you miss some school,
three days,
they leave your back.

1259
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:22.280
I fucking even cut summer school.
Fuck it,
this pussy.

1260
01:09:22.281 --> 01:09:24.890
So by that time she was giving me the push.
I didn't know what I was doing.

1261
01:09:24.891 --> 01:09:28.620
I was just looking at it and looking at what the fuck was going on.

1262
01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:31.090
I was just doing little luck salad.
I was hoping it would meet me.

1263
01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:33.770
Do you remember when you first started actually having sex?

1264
01:09:33.771 --> 01:09:37.930
How often you would have sex?
Who was ridiculous?
And when you met a woman,

1265
01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:39.470
you didn't care about conversation.

1266
01:09:39.471 --> 01:09:41.400
When I was 18 I didn't even want you to talk to them.

1267
01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.570
I just wanted to fuck sucked.
And throw you the fuck out.
It was,

1268
01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:47.030
you got barely had anything in common.

1269
01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:51.560
No class mail communicate about any nothing,
nothing.
It was horrible.

1270
01:09:51.561 --> 01:09:54.770
What a horrible fucking way to live as a fucking man.
Horrible.
Yeah.

1271
01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:59.210
It's devastating,
right?
A fucking the weirdest places.
When I was young,

1272
01:09:59.211 --> 01:10:01.670
I fucked behind the Capitol School.
Oh my God.

1273
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:05.270
I got in trouble all the time over dumb shit like that.
I don't know.

1274
01:10:05.271 --> 01:10:07.880
The one time I bang her frank behind Mike Mckinley school.

1275
01:10:07.881 --> 01:10:11.150
I was in the eighth grade.
She was a sophomore,
but I fucked the backwards.

1276
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.270
I fucked her and then they ate her monkey.
I didn't know she was a virgin.

1277
01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:17.630
You fucked her and then you ate it.
I didn't know what I was doing,
dog.

1278
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:21.080
I didn't know the fucking progress.
I,
I fucked that and they had a pussy,

1279
01:10:21.081 --> 01:10:24.710
but it was cold out so the blood flows out of my face.
You know what I'm saying?

1280
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:27.860
I had done,
I went home,
my mother was like,
what are you the wolf man?

1281
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.980
But then her fucking family hated specs.

1282
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:33.530
They would chairman a fucking,
the aid,

1283
01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.950
its specs with a passion or brother wouldn't even talk to me in the court.

1284
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:40.940
And One night I got her on her balcony cause after I fucked her,
she loves specs.

1285
01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.640
You don't understand me.
I was looking at that bloody monkey.

1286
01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:47.120
She fell in love with the Cuban and I had her outside when they finger banging

1287
01:10:47.121 --> 01:10:50.150
her heart and all of a sudden,
you know when you look,
I had to run the stairs.

1288
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:52.880
I'm finger banging,
but I'm looking at people on the street.

1289
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:56.630
Her father was right by watching you finger.

1290
01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:01.100
Fuck Joe Rogan coming out the hook and papers and she goes,
are you through yet?

1291
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:06.180
Oh my God,
you walked off the balcony and I'd never seen her.
And she slapped her.

1292
01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.320
Are you fucking kidding home though?

1293
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:11.870
She had three brothers that were fucking gorillas.
I'm surprised I'm still here.

1294
01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.600
God the father caught all by goddess.

1295
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:18.090
You have no,

1296
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:21.780
and then when I quite caught playing hooky with that girl that the sixth grade,

1297
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.290
cause we used to go to school and then take off in the afternoons,
I go to shop.

1298
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:28.560
Right.
I'd still like a bottle of blackberry brandy.
You know what I'm saying?

1299
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:32.150
We'd drink a Q few swigs.
She'd let me suck a little teddies they called.

1300
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.860
My mother was never home in the daytime,
but one day my mother's home,

1301
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:37.950
they fucking call.
So me and this girl lived caddy house,

1302
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.370
like there was a house behind mine next to her so I could just jump the fence

1303
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:42.630
and on the corner of being in the house,

1304
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.870
the windows were open and my mom's a fucking Spec fuck.

1305
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.730
She's out there yelling and screaming

1306
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.430
at the mother's next door and she's like,
Ooh.
That's what happens.

1307
01:11:53.431 --> 01:11:55.650
Ever since your daughter's been hanging out with my son,

1308
01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.010
they stay up in that sucker room and they fuck all afternoon.

1309
01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:03.750
Taught them how to Suck Dick,
who was killing my mother.
It was killing her.

1310
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.370
It was killing us so much.

1311
01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:08.850
Even brought my uncle from California one day because they couldn't figure out

1312
01:12:08.851 --> 01:12:10.830
what I was doing in the room.
So he,
my uncle put,

1313
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:13.230
they couldn't figure it out and all,
they were like,
what the fuck she doing?

1314
01:12:13.231 --> 01:12:14.280
Let's go see what he's doing.

1315
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.280
So my stepfather and my mother and my uncle came to my house.

1316
01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:20.940
My uncle put a ladder in the back of the house.
He tried to climb up and shit.

1317
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:23.850
Meanwhile,
I'm driving home.
I think I'm rocking her fucking world.

1318
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:27.120
The ladder fell.
He's done that.
He goes meal,

1319
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:29.430
I ain't Yo Smeal his legs fucking bro.

1320
01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:32.820
Don't take him to the house when I come I was going out but like we're fixing

1321
01:12:32.821 --> 01:12:35.460
pain.
Like I busted them write out like a week later my mother is like,

1322
01:12:35.461 --> 01:12:37.920
we're going to get you and get done my brother,

1323
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:41.130
we're going to get you a little money to your brother because you did some ball.

1324
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.720
My mother blamed on me cause they were going
to climb a ladder.

1325
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:47.850
Fucking hysterical.
You understand me?

1326
01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:49.830
What I went through with this New Yorker or a razor girl.

1327
01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.050
Now she's on Facebook and she won't talk to me.

1328
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:57.450
Here's the fucked up thing,
right?
Like two years after that

1329
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:04.940
I messaged the twice I even fucking Farmville Farmville's I could sit and talk

1330
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:07.740
to you,
but here's the deal.

1331
01:13:07.741 --> 01:13:10.950
What happened was when I was in the age when she was in the eighth grade,

1332
01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:13.350
I was just saying we weren't dating him,
but when we were friends,

1333
01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:17.130
we all played together on the street and I had this kid,
Valentine Pharaoh,

1334
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:20.850
he was the mechanic on the block,
or I had this kid,
this kid was brilliant.

1335
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.050
You brought them a stolen bicycle.
Within 10 minutes it was all duped up banana,

1336
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:28.200
but you couldn't find that fucking serial number on that,
even if he wanted to.

1337
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:31.050
But everyday when I come out,
he'd go cook or write this bike,

1338
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:33.840
tell me if it needs any help.
They cook it right this.

1339
01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:35.810
But you know what I'm saying?
So I would get on the bike riding go bro,

1340
01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:38.700
the pedals,
you got to be more on the fucking pedals that don't maneuver.
Right.

1341
01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.430
So I wanted him to Charles Court and we were playing football and I put the

1342
01:13:41.431 --> 01:13:44.710
bicycle on the fucking floor.
So we're playing football,
basketball,

1343
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:47.580
and she's on the block with her girlfriend.
She picks up the bicycle,

1344
01:13:47.581 --> 01:13:50.730
dog gets on and start driving the bicycle down the block.

1345
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.430
Charles court was a loop,
a complete loop.

1346
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:55.230
You know those streets that it's not a cult de sac.

1347
01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:58.470
And so you go in and have the island in the middle.
It was a loop.

1348
01:13:58.471 --> 01:14:01.350
So she went out in this way and we were going to catch her on this way.

1349
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:04.800
So me and my buddies were going to capture over here and as we're gone for the

1350
01:14:04.801 --> 01:14:09.150
bikes,
you twist the handle bars and went over and fell.
She fell.
She got up.

1351
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.900
She said she was okay.
She goes,
I'm fine.
We said,
you show it.
Yeah,

1352
01:14:12.901 --> 01:14:14.340
we were like giggling.
You know you'd,

1353
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.690
somebody falls when you're the fucking seventh grade,
you giggle.

1354
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:19.960
She went inside the next day,
went to school and they pulled me out and they go,

1355
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:22.390
you hear what?
I'm [inaudible] girl.
He's got a blood clot.
I fucking brain.

1356
01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:26.920
Because when she hit the thing,
so I went to the hospital,
whatever.
What happened?

1357
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:29.770
They were like,
Nah,
she got blood clot.
A couple of days later,

1358
01:14:29.771 --> 01:14:33.760
the brother hurt that,
you know,
something happened.
So he came to me and he goes,

1359
01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:35.860
Bro,
what happened that day?
I just want to know.
And it was me and my,

1360
01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:38.830
all my buddies were there,
my girlfriend,
we were all that.

1361
01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:42.220
She went away from the bicycle and went over into like weeds and shit.

1362
01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:45.730
But you must,
she wasn't bleeding or nothing,
bro.
She hit her hat.

1363
01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:50.170
She just hit that head.
So he always had like this.
Me and him never got along.

1364
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:52.930
I mean he knew I was banging his fucking sister.
He heard all the stories.

1365
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:56.170
So it was the weirdest Cuban house.
These motherfuckers are real specs.

1366
01:14:56.171 --> 01:14:59.350
The father and the mother had broken up,
but he was Cuban.

1367
01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:01.780
He ain't leaving nowhere.
You've got to take me out with bazookas.

1368
01:15:01.781 --> 01:15:03.040
This is my fucking house.

1369
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.800
So he stayed in the house in the basement and built his own fucking apartment.

1370
01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.220
The basement won't even talk to them,
even a little hood.

1371
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:12.370
So when he walked in and he'd have to look at their faces,
this is my house,

1372
01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:15.790
me out your [inaudible] sorry.
[inaudible] House.

1373
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:18.790
I don't go no where my house and he wouldn't talk to her family.

1374
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:22.480
We probably didn't talk to the family and talk to the girl who just talked to

1375
01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:23.950
the board for a vet,

1376
01:15:23.951 --> 01:15:26.140
you know the whole fucking did it cause it was bad to the bone.

1377
01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:30.460
So did the wife date,
new guys know the guy would go fucking crazy.

1378
01:15:30.461 --> 01:15:33.280
He'd stabbed motherfuckers,
the mother lived there,
the whole family was there.

1379
01:15:33.281 --> 01:15:36.160
A Nice House.
She was like a doctor Bro.
They had money.
These people might adult.

1380
01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.350
That's hilarious.

1381
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:40.990
The funny thing was that I had gotten punished at that time and me and just get

1382
01:15:40.991 --> 01:15:43.060
out.
We were at war.
Like I kept hearing,

1383
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:45.490
I'll be wanting to give you a hard time and shit.
So I told him,

1384
01:15:45.491 --> 01:15:48.940
my Stepdad one day I go,
dad,
this is what's going on in those people,
that girl.

1385
01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:51.160
And he goes,
fuck them.
Don't worry about it.
Right.

1386
01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.890
So one day me and my dad and that's the,

1387
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.450
that's the first vision I got when I went in front of the house.

1388
01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:59.370
I had a shoot and I was explaining to people about the house.
And uh,

1389
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.110
we had like a little garden in the front and the stairs.

1390
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.650
And my dad would never hide guns in the house.
He would always hide them around.

1391
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.010
Like if he came here to visit you,

1392
01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.840
he would come a day early and put a gun outside just in case something happened.

1393
01:16:10.841 --> 01:16:13.950
Like he was lonely.
Jack,
he's a bad mother for Swiss guy.

1394
01:16:13.951 --> 01:16:18.070
He used to hide all of guns and this and you know like a up the block and then

1395
01:16:18.071 --> 01:16:21.430
his fucking plants under the plants.
But he had a gun hidden.
No,

1396
01:16:21.431 --> 01:16:23.380
I never do this growing up.
I would mow that lawn.

1397
01:16:23.381 --> 01:16:25.360
That's how good of a idea he was.
He was brilliant.

1398
01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:28.330
He was just all night long and he had dones tucked away guns tucked under the

1399
01:16:28.331 --> 01:16:29.800
fucking law and I couldn't even see him.

1400
01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:32.980
So when they were out there with the fucking law and he's out there all specked

1401
01:16:32.981 --> 01:16:36.790
up with his white tee shirt and this big gold chain and white shorts and white

1402
01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:40.540
shoes and I'm,
I'm getting low and sweating and he wouldn't even do the long bag.

1403
01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.570
He would make me open the bag like this and he would pull the fucking shit in.

1404
01:16:43.571 --> 01:16:47.560
You know,
like,
like the tour met me,
so I see the white corvette pull up and it's,

1405
01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:50.920
I am,
I'll be in his father and I'm like that.

1406
01:16:50.921 --> 01:16:54.300
This is the fucking guy that was busting my balls about New Yorker.
You know,

1407
01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.230
he came out of my,
I never forget that.

1408
01:16:56.231 --> 01:16:59.290
My Dad just looked at him walking into the garden,

1409
01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.190
came out with the fucking 45 and he didn't even pointed out.

1410
01:17:02.191 --> 01:17:05.470
I mean there was people outside barbecue and people up there playing,
talking.

1411
01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.170
Nobody's seen the gun.
He just had an insight.
Anyway,
what's up?

1412
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:13.190
They looked at him,
they walked three steps back with him.
He turned to them,

1413
01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:15.770
they got back in that corvette and I never seen that motherfucker.
Yeah,

1414
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:18.950
I seen him in [inaudible] 93 at a Superbowl party.

1415
01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:24.620
How many different times have you seen people putting down his [inaudible]?
15

1416
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.620
how many shoot?
Three.
Four,
three or four.
Wow.

1417
01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:35.600
It's a fucked up feeling when you see a gun pull up because even if it's not

1418
01:17:35.601 --> 01:17:38.240
pointed at you dog,
you think that's it?
That's the end of the park.

1419
01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:39.730
Anything can happen.
Anything can happen.

1420
01:17:39.731 --> 01:17:42.540
It's the end of the party because it's not the guy with the gun is people are

1421
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:46.410
charging and how easy or trigger is half the time you said dog,

1422
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:49.580
I hear gun unless the dude standing in front of it and got something to do with

1423
01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:52.250
me.
You never see these fat little legs move that fast.

1424
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.540
You ever seen those videos online where dudes are Brolin and like a hip hop

1425
01:17:56.541 --> 01:18:01.541
party and then someone just yells gun to scatter and you hear,

1426
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.810
you hear the gunshots and see the flash white towels everywhere.

1427
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.520
I got nothing against shooting somebody.

1428
01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:10.700
If they're the person that it's unnecessary people that go down and that's what

1429
01:18:10.701 --> 01:18:12.290
kills me.
A kid playing on the street.

1430
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.140
Well shoot somebody you have fucking house and shoot him if that's what you

1431
01:18:15.141 --> 01:18:18.800
would think.
Wait for nine one one do what you need to do.
I ain't mad at you.

1432
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.400
It's the people that fucking like dog in life.
Sometimes people,

1433
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:23.960
you know people lose that fucking man.

1434
01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:26.690
I know a kid one time that some guy in the street here,
Kipp New Orleans,

1435
01:18:26.691 --> 01:18:29.360
he went to his house,
got a gun,
and shot the mother and waited for the cops,

1436
01:18:29.361 --> 01:18:30.590
but they ain't going to do this.

1437
01:18:30.591 --> 01:18:32.810
People that feel that way about why if you don't in the south.

1438
01:18:32.811 --> 01:18:35.840
That's why I love the fucking south.
That's why I love it.

1439
01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:39.290
Did you see that thing with,
with Bj Penn and Matt Hughes?

1440
01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:41.930
He was shooting a 50 millimeter Smith and Wesson.

1441
01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:46.010
If I could have a 50 millimeter Smith and Wesson and my fucking car,

1442
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.790
I'd walk around the south though.
He lives in Illinois.

1443
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:51.850
That's the south as good as that.

1444
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:56.210
That's of Fuck Chicago in Chicago,

1445
01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.780
Illinois.
This rule is,
fuck.
Yeah,
it's country.
It's country.

1446
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:01.100
You know what I'm saying?
Like it's country,

1447
01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:03.840
so it's still kind of the south that has that flavor.

1448
01:19:03.841 --> 01:19:07.580
Do you know what has a 50 caliber gun?
Cool.
Anthony from opie and Anthony.

1449
01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:11.450
He's got a 50 caliber fucking gun that he has to go to specific places to shoot

1450
01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:13.940
because you can't shoot it most places,
but the round,

1451
01:19:13.941 --> 01:19:17.720
it's like you're fucking fist man.
It's got damn cat crazy.
You don't need that,

1452
01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:20.650
but you do need it.
You don't need it,
but you do need,

1453
01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:25.310
it just goes down knowing that you can get one of those just shooing person with

1454
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:29.090
that holy fuck.
I fucking right to bear arms.

1455
01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:32.570
It's just fucking people were ruined it.
I believe.
I believe in that.
Right.

1456
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:36.330
I love Colorado,
but make my day law.
I'm sitting here talking to Brian,

1457
01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.300
hit my window one.
Can I see that light coming through the window?

1458
01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:45.170
Watch this.
Boom.
And I called nine one one.
What happened?

1459
01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:47.630
You're going to have a chance to put them.
Why would I?
It's a make my day law.

1460
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:50.360
I'm inviting motherfuckers.
I'll put a person the window.

1461
01:19:50.361 --> 01:19:53.060
You know what I'm saying?
I don't get no,
I don't give a fuck.

1462
01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.060
[inaudible] make my day law.
Big Carrot.
Yeah.

1463
01:19:56.061 --> 01:19:58.880
You know you should have the right to protect you as write the fucking bear
arms.

1464
01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:01.610
You hear that?
What's going on with the ATF now that they're trying to pee?

1465
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:03.680
People with medical marijuana licenses.

1466
01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.890
You're not allowed to buy new guns anymore.
That's why you quit,
right?
Yes.

1467
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:14.220
Yeah.
I get so many messages.
The fucking pro and con for that.

1468
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:17.820
Again,
I got an argument.
They don't feel that I don't have an argument at all.

1469
01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:19.930
There's no argument there.

1470
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:23.580
Just trying to slowly choke out medical marijuana and the only reason to try and

1471
01:20:23.581 --> 01:20:26.910
do it just because of the fucking pharmaceutical companies,
those comments,

1472
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.460
you know this is,
this is a not a representative government anymore.

1473
01:20:29.461 --> 01:20:32.100
They represent pharmaceutical companies and giant corporations.

1474
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:32.911
That's who they represent.

1475
01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:36.240
They don't represent the people anymore and people have inalienable rights and

1476
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:39.720
one of them is the right to bear arms and a lot of people associate that with

1477
01:20:39.721 --> 01:20:42.270
right wing Wackos and this and that.
You know what?

1478
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:44.700
That's a lot of it is because you never had your ass kicked.
Okay.

1479
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.220
He never met crazy people.
You know,
you don't,

1480
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:52.200
you don't respect the idea of hunting.
You know,
for whatever reason,
all of those,

1481
01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:54.690
all those readings are invalid.
Okay?

1482
01:20:54.691 --> 01:20:58.200
Because I know a lot of crazy motherfuckers and you would want to have a gun if

1483
01:20:58.201 --> 01:21:01.080
you knew some of the people that I knew and I've met,
you'd want to have a gun.

1484
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:02.790
And if you knew some of the people that you met,

1485
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.170
you'd want to have a fucking gun.
There's nothing wrong.

1486
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.650
You can't fix the whole world all at once.

1487
01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:12.660
And until that he gotta be able to defend yourself.
Handguns,
well made,
fuck,

1488
01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:17.610
kill.
The ain't no good for nothing but data.

1489
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:22.650
And if you like to drink whiskey,
you mad,

1490
01:21:22.651 --> 01:21:27.510
even shoot,
show,
sell,
good googly Moodley and again,

1491
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:30.530
the guy says,
if you drink whiskey,
when was the last time you smoked a joint?

1492
01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:34.070
The said,
you know what?
I feel like shooting Brian.
Yeah,

1493
01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.570
that would only happen if you drank Tequila and shit like that.

1494
01:21:36.571 --> 01:21:39.550
A whisk and I cried argument.
They said that I'm wrong with that.

1495
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:43.530
Who the fuck was it on this podcast?
I,
yeah,

1496
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:47.940
I was talking about how Tequila makes me evil.
An angel different.
It will.

1497
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:51.350
It's a stimulant.
The,
the,
you know,
that's really cute.
Well,
some people get up,

1498
01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:54.360
believe some people have this,
a feeling that alcohol is alcohol.

1499
01:21:54.690 --> 01:21:58.830
I think that there's different effects.
For me,
when I drink wine,

1500
01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.640
I have like a more relaxed sort of a feeling.
Wine relaxes me.

1501
01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:04.880
It might be horseshit.
It might be my head.
Um,

1502
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:06.900
because it's not that strong of a difference.

1503
01:22:06.901 --> 01:22:11.190
When I drink Tequila or I drank Jack Daniels,
I get fired off.
I,

1504
01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:14.970
you see me when,
when we do jack shots before a show,
I'm like,
God damn,

1505
01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.550
I don't get like that.
When I drink a glass of wine.

1506
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:18.610
I was drinking a glass of wine.
Don't,

1507
01:22:18.611 --> 01:22:21.840
I don't get to where I want to fucking just grab somebody and hug them and

1508
01:22:21.841 --> 01:22:24.510
squeeze them when I come at your mother Fucker,
you know,

1509
01:22:24.511 --> 01:22:26.190
but you have a shot of Jack.
You want to,

1510
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:30.360
you want to squeeze people sometimes too hard.
I'm like Tequila for me,
I just,

1511
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:35.070
I get evil and dark.
It forget,
like blackout very fast.

1512
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:39.300
Really.
You black out and say creepy shit.
Tequila nights are the worst.

1513
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.000
That's why I do.
What did you,
what?
Did you get some sort of a,

1514
01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:47.590
an argument recently?
Which a girl when you drop,
would you have that?
Uh,

1515
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.710
no,
no.
Just natural.
Hey,
did you see these,
um,
uh,
to change the subject?

1516
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:56.190
Did you see these photos of the,
uh,
the heads on Easter island.

1517
01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.510
They have bodies there.
Just look at this.
Check this out,
Joey.
You're just,

1518
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.580
they're just digging these things out.
Yeah.
Look at this.

1519
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:08.920
They always thought the were incredible because it's this deeper.
Nope,
no,

1520
01:23:08.921 --> 01:23:10.580
they're just trying to do it.
Now look at this.

1521
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:15.640
Easter island is this crazy island that has these huge statues that they don't

1522
01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:19.870
know how the fuck they cut these things and how the fuck they move these things

1523
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:22.750
into place because they're enormous and they must weigh an incredible amount

1524
01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:26.500
will now they found that they're way bigger than they thought and they go deep,

1525
01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:27.334
deep,
deep.

1526
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:31.620
<v 3>Are you sure this is not moot movie viral video photos is real shit dude.</v>

1527
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:35.580
Because don't you think the first thing they would do is like,
wait a second,

1528
01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.590
this goes deeper down.
You know,

1529
01:23:37.591 --> 01:23:40.950
why would they ever like there's somebody that has to trim the hedges and he's

1530
01:23:40.951 --> 01:23:43.320
probably like,
do you know it goes deeper like immediately?

1531
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.580
<v 2>Well,
you know,
I don't think they bothered,</v>

1532
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.510
I don't think they bothered digging in.
Sorry,
checking on me.
Cause the,

1533
01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:49.960
they look like,
you know,

1534
01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:53.050
they look pretty cool but they looked like that was the statue.

1535
01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:57.670
And I guess they just started digging deep below.
But they have petroglyphs.

1536
01:23:57.671 --> 01:24:01.000
It seems like there's a lot of markets.
Very dumb islander.
So look at this.

1537
01:24:01.001 --> 01:24:04.300
Look where this is really cool.
You see this photo?
Look at the hands,

1538
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:05.223
see the thumbs,

1539
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:09.400
two thumbs and the fingers and they have a petroglyphs on them where you could,

1540
01:24:09.401 --> 01:24:11.680
uh,
see some of the,
uh,
the stuff that's written on them.

1541
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:15.010
It's not just one side either.
This detailing,
this is several sites,

1542
01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.860
some of them more and more detailed.
It's pretty interesting stuff.

1543
01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.740
This is another ancient civilization.

1544
01:24:19.741 --> 01:24:21.130
I don't know who the fuck belt these things.

1545
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:25.070
They're going to be finding our shit someday.
Legit websites.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1546
01:24:25.071 --> 01:24:27.580
It's on all sorts of Reps.
It's on a bunch of different websites.

1547
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:30.400
This is a legit archeological discovery,
I'm pretty sure.

1548
01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:36.640
Well,
I mean it's a,
it's a private research company.

1549
01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:38.733
I don't know

1550
01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:43.990
<v 3>Jody is,
I saw your podcast recently had an animated part on your podcast.</v>

1551
01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:47.900
I thought it was brilliant.
I they took one like a small skit on,

1552
01:24:47.901 --> 01:24:50.470
on your podcasts and so many animated and it looks really good.

1553
01:24:50.471 --> 01:24:51.370
I was really happy with it.

1554
01:24:52.110 --> 01:24:56.070
<v 2>Great fucking job with it.
Really fun polices the tiger,
right?
Like she,
she,
she,</v>

1555
01:24:56.071 --> 01:24:59.720
she set that up,
that all up.
She's an interesting lady.
She,

1556
01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:00.980
she's really good at that stuff.

1557
01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:04.760
She is specialty is and we need to get her on the pot.
Yeah,
she'll come on.

1558
01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:06.870
I called her today.
She didn't answer twice.

1559
01:25:06.871 --> 01:25:10.440
I called it twice but she was doing and she was cracking is probably getting,

1560
01:25:10.441 --> 01:25:14.410
I wonder,
does it come to Karaoke last?
She's coming this week.
This week?
Yeah.

1561
01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:15.990
Oh yeah.
It was called her up cause she wasn't,

1562
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.400
she didn't have a babysitter last week.

1563
01:25:17.401 --> 01:25:19.410
She couldn't get the girl two nights in a row.

1564
01:25:19.411 --> 01:25:23.040
So she's definitely going with you.
She spoke about on the podcast.
Oh I told her.

1565
01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:24.590
Yeah,
she's a really neat girl man.

1566
01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:27.470
We'll have her on next time you come on and have Ron.
Come on.
She's a great fuck.

1567
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:29.490
That'd be great man.
I'm really happy to have her in my life.

1568
01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:33.600
She makes me laugh cause she's so sweet to my fucking assholeishness.

1569
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:37.320
Like when she tells me to her real views,
she's sweet but she's real,

1570
01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:40.880
just super honest about everything.
About sacks,
about,

1571
01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:44.520
she was talking about and she picked up this guy and his deck was like two red

1572
01:25:44.521 --> 01:25:47.880
bull cans because they save the guy.
See The guy,
you will die.

1573
01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.270
I believe that you should have seen the guy,
nerdy guy.
Right?

1574
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:56.190
The nerdiest glasses.
Little hot on.
He was scared.

1575
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:59.580
He didn't really want to say much and he goes,
oh well fuck.
It took me home.

1576
01:25:59.581 --> 01:26:02.040
He became an enemy.
He was trying to put fingers up my ass.
And then,

1577
01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.560
well she said she finish her mouth over his cock.
God Damn that she,
she goes,

1578
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:09.380
Joey,
I got a big fucking mouth and he,
his cock was so,

1579
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:12.680
I mean she just said it right out.
She just told her and she goes,

1580
01:26:12.681 --> 01:26:14.090
you got to sit down and I got to tell you something.

1581
01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:17.320
I know she's going to tell me about the podcast.
He said,

1582
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.620
that guy was with the other day,

1583
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:22.910
that guy had the biggest dick I ever saw in my life.
So good.

1584
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.110
Fucking hilarious.
And she was telling me that they intimated that she enemy now.

1585
01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:30.940
And it's the story of fucking that guy.
That's her boyfriend.

1586
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:35.960
That's hilarious.
So,
um,
this is Halloween and um,

1587
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:40.430
this is appropriate story cause this shows you how out of touch these fucking

1588
01:26:40.431 --> 01:26:41.990
bankers are with people.

1589
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:45.710
Have you seen this story where the top US foreclosure law firm through a

1590
01:26:45.711 --> 01:26:50.660
Halloween party or the staff dressed up as foreclosed upon Americans,

1591
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.270
the staff dressed up on people who lost their home and saw the dress.

1592
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:59.150
Look at these photos.
This was their fucking party will work for food.

1593
01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:02.290
He thinks it's hilarious.
He is a big fucking lawyers.

1594
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.030
They put fake dirt on their face.
They pretend to be white.

1595
01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:09.430
It was the whole staff dressed up as this,
look at this shit.
Wow.

1596
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:15.140
Third Party squatter.
I lost my home and I was never served.
Haha.

1597
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:20.340
I think that's funny.
How fucking add a touch of day,
what kind of bad Karma,

1598
01:27:20.341 --> 01:27:22.370
unless you have just taken people's houses away,

1599
01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:24.830
kicking people's house and the houses left and right and left right,

1600
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:28.550
left and right.
Crazy.
It always thinking about what you said.

1601
01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.550
We told him over the weekend about the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical prices.

1602
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:36.530
I finally figured out why they're no fucking cause.
They got a kickback.

1603
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:40.370
Oh yeah.
That's a big one for the doctors.
The politicians.
I mean,
you know.
Yeah.

1604
01:27:40.371 --> 01:27:42.690
You're paying a lot of people.
If you go to a doctor's office and he says,

1605
01:27:42.691 --> 01:27:45.090
do you have your three is,
hey,
you're not going to take that medication.
I'm on.

1606
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.100
I got a better medication.

1607
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:49.340
They start filling it out and she got to pay for research and development to,

1608
01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:52.370
wasn't a lot of money involved in creating pharmaceutical drugs too.

1609
01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:55.550
That's amazing.
How much more that paid for fucking pharmaceuticals.

1610
01:27:55.551 --> 01:27:58.450
That remains amazing.
And you're right.
That's cause they gotta kicked back,

1611
01:27:58.451 --> 01:28:01.260
kicked back like a motherfucker.
You know the doctor sells grates,

1612
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.670
the most prescriptions of a thing gets like a cruise at the end of the fucking

1613
01:28:04.671 --> 01:28:07.550
year.
They take care of your dog.
Well they also take the whole staff out.

1614
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.360
Mrs Rogan's mom's a nurse and they take her whole staff out.
They,
they,

1615
01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:13.160
they encourage you to use,
you know,

1616
01:28:13.161 --> 01:28:14.950
Welbutrin and whatever the fuck they're pushing.

1617
01:28:15.230 --> 01:28:17.660
And then they'll take the whole staff to like a nice dinner that they can't

1618
01:28:17.661 --> 01:28:21.760
afford a nice steak house and shit.
And you know,
it sits the whole system.

1619
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:26.120
The whole situation is fucked.
It's completely ridiculous.
The fact,

1620
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:28.940
and this is the number one reason why pot's illegal,
the number one reason,

1621
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:32.630
there's a lot of money that they're throwing at all these goddamn politicians to

1622
01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:35.510
keep potter.
Lego can't stop it though at this point.

1623
01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:36.890
I don't believe he could stop it.

1624
01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.380
I believe at this point the well has been broken.

1625
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:45.740
What are you hearing?
I don't think it will.
I think people get so angry.

1626
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:46.491
You think about this,

1627
01:28:46.491 --> 01:28:50.090
occupy Wall Street shit and occupy La and occupied everywhere.

1628
01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:53.210
They're occupying fucking Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
Now they're occupying everywhere.

1629
01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.120
I could pay olive garden occupied,
don't have a card and he can't.
He can't.

1630
01:28:56.121 --> 01:28:58.310
He has to go every fucking podcast and say olive garden.

1631
01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:02.040
It's like he's a little joke.
He thinks he's cute anyway.
Um,
it's

1632
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.820
<v 0>when you,
you see how fucked up the world is and you,
you,</v>

1633
01:29:05.821 --> 01:29:08.610
you find out that they're wasting the resources going after pot.

1634
01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:10.200
People are just going to get even more angry.

1635
01:29:10.201 --> 01:29:12.150
They have to be careful at this stage,

1636
01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:15.220
the way people are so angry and people are,
you know,

1637
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.340
protesting so much and there's so much,

1638
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:20.760
there's so much tension in the streets now.
There's so much,
so much of a,

1639
01:29:20.761 --> 01:29:24.480
an organized group of protesters now.

1640
01:29:24.481 --> 01:29:27.810
They have to be real careful about how much they try to take away because the

1641
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:28.321
more they do it,

1642
01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:31.830
the more it becomes more and more crazy and more and more people join the cause.

1643
01:29:32.150 --> 01:29:33.820
This ain't going to get go anyway.
This,

1644
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:35.360
this ain't going to be going away anytime soon.

1645
01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:40.200
The shits only going to get bigger.
Weird.
You know?
It's like you wonder what is,

1646
01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:41.610
what is exactly going to happen?

1647
01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:47.040
What is going to happen with the world because it's going in right now.

1648
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.310
Things are going in the craziest direction that they've ever gone.
The the,

1649
01:29:50.311 --> 01:29:54.390
the biggest,
the most amount of change,
the most amount of fear,

1650
01:29:54.391 --> 01:29:56.940
the most amount of people that are upset and,

1651
01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.970
and the most technological discoveries,

1652
01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:03.090
the most amount of technological progress,
the most,

1653
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:06.290
the craziest things like they have this new fucking laser that they're,

1654
01:30:06.291 --> 01:30:08.820
they're creating.
If you read about this world's most powerful.

1655
01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:13.560
This is the the headline,
powerful laser to tear apart the vacuum of space,

1656
01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.460
a laser powerful enough to tear apart the fabric of space could be built in

1657
01:30:17.461 --> 01:30:21.810
Britain as a major part of a major new scientific project that aims to answer

1658
01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:24.270
some of the most fundamental questions about the universe.

1659
01:30:24.271 --> 01:30:28.740
So some fucking crazy ass,
super powerful laser that,

1660
01:30:28.741 --> 01:30:32.100
what does that even mean?
It's going to tear apart the fabric fabric of space.

1661
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:37.800
You know what the fuck does that mean?
Mild headaches?

1662
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:43.800
I mean,
what are they doing?
What the,
what the fuck?
What is this?
I mean,

1663
01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:44.850
what's going to get there first?

1664
01:30:44.851 --> 01:30:47.680
Is it going to be people decide to blow up the earth because they're fucking mad

1665
01:30:47.681 --> 01:30:50.970
that the banker stole all the money or is it going to be some asshole pulls the

1666
01:30:50.971 --> 01:30:55.350
switch on this laser that you know that tears apart the fabric of the universe

1667
01:30:55.351 --> 01:30:58.710
and the whole universe becomes like a balloon with a hole in it and spins around

1668
01:30:58.711 --> 01:31:02.820
in a circle and fucking collapses in itself.
What is going on,
man?

1669
01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:05.820
Every day there's something new.
Every day there's something.

1670
01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:09.510
<v 2>They were hustling,
hustling,
hustling,
dude,
dude,
dude,
dude,</v>

1671
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:14.160
I my feed it and I give thanks to the fucking,
the day woke up.

1672
01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:17.880
I don't know what's going to happen.
You know,
it's getting scary out there.
It is.

1673
01:31:17.881 --> 01:31:20.640
Right.
It's fucking scary.
Guy That didn't know until I went to Houston.

1674
01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:23.490
I usually from the last time I went down and this time,

1675
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:27.210
even when I went down there three years ago,
the oil was still booming and shit.

1676
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.410
Oil is still booming.
Well,
whatever you would,
you notice that was a difference.

1677
01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:34.770
Couple empty fucking stores,
you know,
it was,
uh,
it was,

1678
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:36.630
when I seen that I was,

1679
01:31:36.631 --> 01:31:41.631
when I go places that I went to in Houston now closed a couple of more than

1680
01:31:41.701 --> 01:31:46.020
usual,
more than usual.
And I think it's crazy as I,
that Brendan Walsh,

1681
01:31:46.021 --> 01:31:49.260
we did that podcast with them yesterday and the other two gay comics that he had

1682
01:31:49.261 --> 01:31:53.640
on,
they were talking and then like three out of four of us had been robbed by

1683
01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:56.650
gunpoint and we're like,
that's crazy.

1684
01:31:56.651 --> 01:32:00.010
In La [inaudible] la I Brendan.

1685
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:02.740
<v 0>Wow.
He got robbed in Cleveland,
right?
Yeah,</v>

1686
01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:05.350
I mean in Ohio I know that that's the next move.

1687
01:32:05.351 --> 01:32:09.550
I know that burglaries are going to go of course what they have to unemployment.

1688
01:32:09.551 --> 01:32:13.270
That's the next fucking move.
Yeah,
they have to.
That's what happens.
You know,

1689
01:32:13.271 --> 01:32:16.240
people start robbing people because they're broke and they're fucking scared.

1690
01:32:16.241 --> 01:32:20.170
They need something.
Fuck.
That's amazing.

1691
01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:23.760
People getting robbed and stuff at gunpoint.
The damage.
That's it.
That's it.

1692
01:32:23.761 --> 01:32:24.680
That's it.
That's why you get out.

1693
01:32:24.681 --> 01:32:28.400
I have a fucking piece in your house at night because it's like anything,

1694
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:31.240
a horse in a sword.
That's what I want.
A horse and a sword.

1695
01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.520
You unable to carry a sword.
If you wrote a horse,

1696
01:32:33.521 --> 01:32:37.960
he gets scared fucking fall off like I do.
I just jump off a fucking awesome.

1697
01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:41.350
So skin.
Yeah,
I got bucked off a horse last time by squeezing too hard.

1698
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:43.990
I guess if you squeeze too hard when you're on there and you get scared.

1699
01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:47.860
I was scared cause I was a kid and I squeezed a hard bucked right off.

1700
01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:51.040
And then that same day my sister touched an electric fence and she was like

1701
01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:52.350
seven.
And he's like,

1702
01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:55.990
and I think we should stuck on the farms which are touching electric fence.

1703
01:32:56.140 --> 01:33:01.060
She was seven and she shot back.
Holy Fuck.
A bad day at the farm.

1704
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:04.720
How does that not kill her?
Cause there's not that strong.
Yeah.

1705
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:09.370
It's kind of like shock,
but nothing you've touched one Joey.

1706
01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:14.320
I touched something similar where they shock you with Shit fucking yeah,

1707
01:33:14.321 --> 01:33:18.470
it's definitely wakes you up.
Yeah.
That's scary as fuck dude.

1708
01:33:18.471 --> 01:33:22.900
An electric fence and s six.
How old was she?
It's like seven.
Fuck yeah.

1709
01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:26.990
You would think that would tell a kid electric fences and nuts studio of my own

1710
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.900
way and
kill you.
Is it mostly for animals?

1711
01:33:32.110 --> 01:33:32.891
For the farms?
Yeah.

1712
01:33:32.891 --> 01:33:37.390
So like animals won't sneak in or sneak out real and they get kind of trained
to,

1713
01:33:37.391 --> 01:33:40.420
uh,
to avoid it.
To avoid it.
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1714
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.380
I guess you want to keep your fucking animals.
Uh,
I love how some people,
like,

1715
01:33:44.381 --> 01:33:46.120
especially Texas,
this is real common.

1716
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:50.500
They have what's called a high fence compound and they have all their animals

1717
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.940
like wild animals on this compound and they just run around and shoot him all

1718
01:33:54.941 --> 01:33:56.230
year round.
Shoot whenever.

1719
01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:59.770
Like Ted Nugent has a spotlight that he has probably done in Michigan and now

1720
01:33:59.771 --> 01:34:01.600
he's got a spot like that in Texas.
I love it.

1721
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:04.060
He lives on his fucking giant piece of property.

1722
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:07.510
He's got like a thousand acres and he's got all these fucking animals running

1723
01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:10.480
around his property,
so he gets in his fucking four wheel drive.

1724
01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:14.650
It goes out to a spot,
waits in a tree,
sees a deer walk by,
shoots a hole in it.

1725
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:18.970
It takes it home and eats it.
That's fucking beautiful.
Fuck a supermarket,

1726
01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:22.810
you know,
fucking supermarket.
When you got your own ecosystem in your backyard,

1727
01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.010
that's the shit,
dude.

1728
01:34:24.011 --> 01:34:27.100
If you could have a spot like that where you got your own lake in the backyard

1729
01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:30.850
and your own like hunting spot,
how cool would that be?
Would you not love that?

1730
01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:34.390
Why doesn't let me for me,
I can't kill a fucking animal.
Even if I wanted to.

1731
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:38.680
You couldn't tell him that I'm,
but you love a good steak.
I listen,
listen.

1732
01:34:38.681 --> 01:34:41.460
I know the little world was covered.
Just don't tell me.
Listen,

1733
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:44.890
you find you couldn't kill cows or you couldn't kill cats.

1734
01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:49.870
You couldn't kill dogs,
but you couldn't kill a cow.
I need that.

1735
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:52.850
Did you hear about that guy that lived off?
I need that.

1736
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:56.950
My life to look at it as all on the floor.
Yeah,
every level at every.

1737
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:58.130
It's unfortunate,

1738
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:00.260
<v 2>but that's how they have to die.
That's the only way.
I mean,</v>

1739
01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:01.880
it's not even going to live forever if you don't do that,

1740
01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.670
but the ecosystem is the way I've seen.

1741
01:35:04.671 --> 01:35:09.290
I've been with people when they shot a deer,
just drag them.
You know what?

1742
01:35:09.291 --> 01:35:13.510
That's great,
man.
I got nothing against you.
I can't do it.
Can't do it.

1743
01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:16.290
I can't see it early.
I don't think I'd have any problem.

1744
01:35:16.291 --> 01:35:20.380
I tell people when I'm driving down the street and I see a bag on the road from

1745
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:24.070
a mile away,
I crank up thinking that it's a puppy or something like that.
Yeah.

1746
01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.600
<v 0>Then those are the stories that drive me the most fucking nuts.</v>

1747
01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:29.670
When you hear about someone throwing a puppy out of a car,
fucking critical.

1748
01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.200
<v 2>Well,
I just tickles me the fucked up.
You know what I mean?
Horses,</v>

1749
01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:36.570
you know I don't,
I'm scared of horses.
I don't want to hear about you.

1750
01:35:36.571 --> 01:35:39.120
Shoot the fucking horse.
You know what?
I want to fucking see it.

1751
01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:44.370
The most disturbing thing ever to me was when I watched that Dang on 20 Hbo

1752
01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:47.190
sports when they were doing a dog fight and the guy goes,
you know what?

1753
01:35:47.191 --> 01:35:49.420
The dog's a piece of shit or whatever.

1754
01:35:49.421 --> 01:35:53.670
He got to put them on and they walked them into the weeds and you heard that he

1755
01:35:53.671 --> 01:35:57.120
walked by giggling.
Now I had to turn it off.
It was really a fucking puke man.

1756
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.990
<v 0>It's horrible.</v>

1757
01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:01.460
You hear about that guy that lived off of road kill for 30 years and need from

1758
01:36:01.461 --> 01:36:03.890
the UK,
40 44 year old guy,

1759
01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:08.410
lived only off road kale for 30 years and he would cook like Badger,
sube,

1760
01:36:08.411 --> 01:36:12.230
raccoons stew,
like whatever he can find every day is what he ate offer ago.

1761
01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:14.960
Did you get an article on this guy?
Yeah,
it's on CNN.

1762
01:36:14.961 --> 01:36:17.030
Huffington post was roadkill.

1763
01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:21.740
His name is Jonathan Cohen.
Really

1764
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:28.400
boiled it.
Yup.
Rats.
Fox's house pigeons.
Mold snakes.

1765
01:36:28.401 --> 01:36:32.630
Peasants.
Yep.
He eat roadkill for 30 years.
Oh my God.

1766
01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:36.350
And there's like a picture of him or video of him on CNN and you just the back

1767
01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:36.891
of his car.

1768
01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:40.370
He has like this little Saturn with this deer hanging out at the back of his car

1769
01:36:40.371 --> 01:36:41.760
that he found on the side of the road.
Well,

1770
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:45.650
I know that a lot of people will find a dealer that got hit by a car and
they'll,

1771
01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.500
they'll shoot that or they're rather they're cooked that they'll take a deer

1772
01:36:48.501 --> 01:36:49.420
that got hit by a car.
No,

1773
01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.030
they'll gut it and take it home because you know that is as long as you know

1774
01:36:53.031 --> 01:36:56.570
when that thing got hit,
as long as you can go to it and it's not,

1775
01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:58.120
it has been sitting in the sun for a couple of,

1776
01:36:58.380 --> 01:36:58.621
<v 2>it's not,</v>

1777
01:36:58.621 --> 01:37:01.860
what's the deal with it when you go hug then Colorado cause this is why it got

1778
01:37:01.861 --> 01:37:02.221
everything.

1779
01:37:02.221 --> 01:37:06.120
All the knowledge I got behind him was in Colorado and people say that when you

1780
01:37:06.121 --> 01:37:08.790
come up on a deer,
if you shock them,

1781
01:37:08.791 --> 01:37:10.950
he releases that thing and the meats tougher.

1782
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:13.710
Like I don't know what the breakdown was.

1783
01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:19.100
It again it would say dear God he died a weird death or something.

1784
01:37:19.501 --> 01:37:23.370
Like if we got a lung shot and he had a run and really quick,

1785
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:26.880
oh he released the stars,
drove the meat gets it's adrenaline.

1786
01:37:26.881 --> 01:37:29.550
Adrenaline and I'm sorry.
And then if you shoot up with a bow and Arrow,

1787
01:37:29.551 --> 01:37:32.160
cause I have friends that were born out of a little bit dangerous people.

1788
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:33.990
They would bow and Arrow guys.

1789
01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:36.660
Those are some or some of those are the most dangerous people I've met.

1790
01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:40.080
There was,
why is that?
Because they could shoot you with a bone.

1791
01:37:40.081 --> 01:37:43.590
I don't think it shows a piece.
They show up with a bone out first,
the pieces,

1792
01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:47.100
second
piece of seconds.

1793
01:37:47.101 --> 01:37:50.400
So that'll get your 30 yards.
They're going to get you at 50.

1794
01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:53.460
So does that supposedly make the meat tastes less good?
The bow and Arrow?

1795
01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:56.820
You know what,
I don't want my to get pissed at me.

1796
01:37:56.821 --> 01:37:58.330
I don't know the exact specific,

1797
01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:01.500
somebody from the south or somebody who knows what's going with Matt Hughes.

1798
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:02.390
If you're fucking listen,

1799
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:06.600
I guarantee you there's a bunch of people on Twitter that know about,
uh,

1800
01:38:06.601 --> 01:38:10.220
about hunting with,
uh,
with now,
you know,
I love poker.

1801
01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:14.280
I Love Boulder and you love boulder.
You love the people of Boulder.
Loved it.

1802
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:17.370
I lived in boulder and 85 and I moved up to the hill.

1803
01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.560
I didn't even think I told you about these stories.

1804
01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.900
And I met these guys up on the hill that were Vietnam vets.

1805
01:38:21.901 --> 01:38:23.880
They sold weed or whatever.
And,
you know,

1806
01:38:23.881 --> 01:38:26.280
some of them were hippies and some of them are guys that look like,
Gosh,

1807
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:27.150
you know,
straight up.

1808
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:31.290
And I became friends and when the guy's name was that we would go to Vietnam,

1809
01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:32.310
you know,
we became friends.

1810
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:36.470
I was lonely out there was 85 I was 21 and he got would go with him to the,

1811
01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:38.610
to the vet center and get his meds,
you know.

1812
01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:42.300
And then after awhile he introduced me to another event.
I would meet them.

1813
01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:45.660
And you know how you,
when I had a problem with my ex wife and her husband,

1814
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:48.960
you know,
these are my friends just because they were crazy or whatever.

1815
01:38:48.961 --> 01:38:50.430
That guns where I respected them bro.

1816
01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:53.070
They went over there fucking 16 you know what I'm saying?

1817
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:55.140
They were there 12 or 24 bodies.

1818
01:38:55.141 --> 01:38:58.230
They were telling me the stories and these guys were living in hell.
I knew it,

1819
01:38:58.231 --> 01:39:02.360
but I couldn't turn my back on them with my friends.
You know?
And it's funny,

1820
01:39:02.361 --> 01:39:04.590
you know,
you used to encourage me,
Joe,
you got to get healthy.

1821
01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:07.800
These guys were encouraging me to kill this mother fucker.

1822
01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.441
You understand me?

1823
01:39:10.441 --> 01:39:12.960
You know I don't like when you see somebody go Joey manual look like they were

1824
01:39:12.961 --> 01:39:15.510
like dog.
Did you think about when I told you you like I couldn't shake them.

1825
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:20.520
That one guy,
the one,
not ads,
but his partner,
that guy specialized.

1826
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:25.550
He used to show me after we meditate I take him up to the fucking uh,

1827
01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:30.600
uh,
the one canyon,
I'm sorry with the words sunshine,
one of those canyons.

1828
01:39:30.601 --> 01:39:32.910
And that's why I fucker one of those fucking canyon.

1829
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:35.850
This motherfucker was hitting targets with a bow and arrow.

1830
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:38.850
You would dream about even seeing well,

1831
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:41.030
and he was telling me to do it whenever you want to kill his mother.

1832
01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:42.600
But he told me,
I go,
well how are you going to kill him?

1833
01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.510
I don't know about no bone arrow.
She's got,
you're going to have to kill him.

1834
01:39:45.511 --> 01:39:48.570
And I don't know.
I go,
I don't want to kill him and no gun.
He goes in boulder,

1835
01:39:48.571 --> 01:39:50.680
we don't need guns.
That's what I told you.

1836
01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:51.950
Cause we're taking them to the mountains.

1837
01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:55.440
We'll slice is fucking time we rub me that would make a syrup and peanut butter

1838
01:39:56.250 --> 01:40:00.180
and two days of bear.
Don't the only find the elbow cause the best,

1839
01:40:00.181 --> 01:40:03.630
only the elbow joint and be a tooth if he's sick of eating.

1840
01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:06.960
These guys were serious and every time I'd see him they're like dog,

1841
01:40:06.961 --> 01:40:08.640
did you think about that motherfucker right now?

1842
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.250
He's fucking your ex wife right now.
He's hugging your door.

1843
01:40:11.251 --> 01:40:14.190
I mean they were like whoa.
And I love these guys.
Cause they were right.

1844
01:40:14.191 --> 01:40:14.660
They were like,

1845
01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.740
you know these guys would buy the book but there were Vietnam vets they stay

1846
01:40:17.741 --> 01:40:19.290
with.
You know,
so they didn't want you to kill him.

1847
01:40:19.291 --> 01:40:23.190
They wanted you to let them bleed out.
Oh these mother fuckers.
But that one guy,

1848
01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:26.080
Joe,
when you seen this guy with an Arrow,
your heart,
what's,

1849
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.510
you're like this is a dangerous cause.

1850
01:40:27.511 --> 01:40:32.310
This was army train green baret army fucking hand to hand.

1851
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:36.540
When he was a Rambo,
he was a modern day.
When they got hot,

1852
01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:40.380
that's who they let him in a helicopter.
He was missing two fingers,
you know,

1853
01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:44.580
the back of his calf.
Got Blown up,
you know the whole fucking deal.

1854
01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:47.100
But his face was throwing a lot of those guys back.

1855
01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:50.890
Now we're getting a lot of those guys now from Iraq and Afghanistan because I

1856
01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.530
been,
I've been meeting a lot of those guys after shows,
man.

1857
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:56.380
A lot of guys that are limping on canes and Shit.
Dude,

1858
01:40:56.381 --> 01:40:58.270
the other day at the Ontario Improv,

1859
01:40:58.271 --> 01:41:01.940
show me this giant hole that was taken out of his leg.
Holy Fuck.

1860
01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:05.260
Blue bagged with you.
Imagine how lucky we are man.
And I'll tell you,

1861
01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.110
I was thinking about it this morning.
What?
He's a podcast fan by the way.

1862
01:41:08.170 --> 01:41:12.990
That dude,
whatever you name,
dog bad motherfucker.
That was one of my mistakes.

1863
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.780
Not join the service.
Really.
One of your mistakes.
Look at you.

1864
01:41:16.781 --> 01:41:17.920
You turned out Joey Diaz,

1865
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:21.550
she wouldn't have turned out Joey Diaz if you went and disciplined.

1866
01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:24.310
I would've been a 40 year old Joey Diaz on a nice pension.

1867
01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:26.830
I would have learned how to blow fucking people up.

1868
01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.580
I would've had a passport instead of not having a fucking passport.

1869
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.620
I would have been just it bother you.
The passport thing.
Fuck.
Yeah,

1870
01:41:33.621 --> 01:41:34.870
I would've been in Japan right now.

1871
01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:39.020
You're going to England this weekend with a donkey up my ass haul routes and

1872
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:41.760
routes to go stab somebody.
Like if I knew I had a blown head,

1873
01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:43.480
motherfuckers up like man on fire.

1874
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:48.160
I go for the last bathhouse of the fucking year.
20 chicks look at my toes.

1875
01:41:48.161 --> 01:41:51.640
My ass also have seven Vietnamese kids who gives a fuck.

1876
01:41:51.641 --> 01:41:53.410
I'm born to kill somebody.
You understand that?

1877
01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:56.530
That dropped me out of a fucking helicopter.
You would want to do that.

1878
01:41:56.531 --> 01:41:58.780
What are you talking about?
You know why they said,
you know,

1879
01:41:58.870 --> 01:42:01.510
I didn't go to the service brokers.
I didn't want to take the blood test.

1880
01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.760
You didn't want to take,
I got the paperwork and everything.

1881
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:05.710
How come you don't want to take the bullets?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1882
01:42:05.710 --> 01:42:09.670
At that age,
I wouldn't even allow you to fucking touch it with a needle.
Once.

1883
01:42:09.671 --> 01:42:11.900
I had no supervision.
I didn't go back to the doctor two,

1884
01:42:11.901 --> 01:42:16.360
I was fairly something dog.
Really?
Yeah.
I did all my own dental work.

1885
01:42:16.361 --> 01:42:19.480
I did every time I used to.
All your feet.
I care.

1886
01:42:19.481 --> 01:42:23.170
I ripped out with a fucking wrench with Jack Daniels or what?

1887
01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:26.390
I don't like needles dog.
You didn't know about that.

1888
01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:32.440
Why do you think I went back to acupuncture?
I want to eliminate,
I want to live.

1889
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:33.880
Why do you think I started going to acupuncture?

1890
01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.530
Because I want to eliminate my fear of needles.

1891
01:42:35.531 --> 01:42:39.200
I was telling you that I'm going to have to go for a cortisone shot you had had

1892
01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:42.880
you had cavities cause you weren't brushing your teeth?
No I wouldn't.

1893
01:42:42.881 --> 01:42:45.990
I've never had it.
I always brushed my teeth.
So why didn't you ever been out?

1894
01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:47.560
Cause I wouldn't go to the dentist.

1895
01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:50.860
I just left the cavity go cause I wouldn't want to go to the dentist because of

1896
01:42:50.861 --> 01:42:55.050
my fear for me.
Ooh.
So you pulled it out with applier and I didn't get,

1897
01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:57.100
I didn't get a blood test at the time.

1898
01:42:57.101 --> 01:43:02.020
I was 14 she was baby sitting there with a pair of pliers.

1899
01:43:02.021 --> 01:43:06.230
Pull in your fucking time.
I was four.
I walked around for a year with an abscess.

1900
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:10.150
The tooth was missing and I go up to people at him at the comedy store and it

1901
01:43:10.151 --> 01:43:12.600
would swell and like the press had that shoot out that people like,
Hey,

1902
01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:16.300
at the comedy store,
you know you can die from that shit for a year.

1903
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:20.470
So that's why you can't drive without driver's license either.

1904
01:43:20.590 --> 01:43:24.380
They go in and sometimes it,
your brain isn't to me,

1905
01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:28.660
it got this big and then went up to that Cedar Sinai and the doctor just opened.

1906
01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:32.620
One of my friend went in his fucking face,
like the exorcist and never came back.

1907
01:43:32.621 --> 01:43:35.440
And then little by little I became friends with Dr Waxler.

1908
01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.210
A little by little he talked me into,

1909
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:40.420
do you know how it was a process that goes into when I get a blood test,
what?

1910
01:43:40.530 --> 01:43:43.330
There's a process,
but it's ain't just Joey Diaz whipping up his arm.

1911
01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:46.990
What's the process?
It's fucking hard.
[inaudible]

1912
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.430
he knows it's three days a horrible,
oh,
it fucking kills me.

1913
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:56.480
It's his snake.
Here's Indiana Jones.
It's,
I don't like fucking needles.

1914
01:43:56.481 --> 01:43:59.870
I don't want to buy me.
And I went for a year.
The acupuncture,

1915
01:43:59.871 --> 01:44:03.230
I was faith every two times.
Really?
God,
yeah.

1916
01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:07.220
Especially when I'd see her put the truck and Neil and Mike Chester,
I dropped.

1917
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:11.930
I hurt my knee because it doesn't do anything.
Nothing.
Look,
there's some people,

1918
01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.020
there was a girl I dated though her.

1919
01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:19.060
Her Dad was a dentist and her dad would faint when he saw anything bloody like

1920
01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.000
her.
His daughter came back from the beach there were at the beach and they got

1921
01:44:23.001 --> 01:44:27.380
Suntan Sunburn and they get sun burnt to the point where the kid had blisters.

1922
01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:30.020
She had blisters on her head.
Dad sees it,
falls down,

1923
01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.830
unconscious fucking falls down at the beach unconscious.
He was a dentist.

1924
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:37.160
He couldn't see anyone get a needle and her and I were in the movies once and

1925
01:44:37.161 --> 01:44:38.690
she was watching him in the movie.

1926
01:44:38.691 --> 01:44:41.450
The guy shot himself up with heroin and she blacked out.

1927
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.550
I faked that both fixture was,
she stuck with me.

1928
01:44:44.670 --> 01:44:49.460
I had to put a book that in my mouth.
I faked with Joe Daddy's.
Steven said,
well,

1929
01:44:49.461 --> 01:44:50.510
Gee,
Bj Penn,

1930
01:44:51.450 --> 01:44:56.430
my house at my house and woke up two hours later,
fucking,
oh,
it was hard.

1931
01:44:56.431 --> 01:45:01.431
Wife fainted at the Pearl at the palm and Ralphie May and somebody shot a bloody

1932
01:45:02.511 --> 01:45:06.710
towel stitch with the bully Tyler.
That's all I had to say.
Really?
I went down,

1933
01:45:06.711 --> 01:45:09.770
thank God there was a doctor next to me.
They picked me up a little bit.

1934
01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.750
The USA was embarrassed,
we will get you.

1935
01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:16.250
And they picked me up a little bit and they gave me water and that was fucking

1936
01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:20.390
fine.
What evolutionary reason would there be for you to black out when you see

1937
01:45:20.391 --> 01:45:25.130
something shocking that the best one was when I got locked up and went to
prison.

1938
01:45:25.131 --> 01:45:27.860
I'm like,
good,
I'm in a tube with 80 guys and they're like,
go,

1939
01:45:27.861 --> 01:45:31.340
you know you have to go get a blood test today.
And I'm like,
that's it.

1940
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:34.350
I'm going to fucking get my blood.
This wake up with a Dick in my ass.

1941
01:45:35.850 --> 01:45:37.940
So I fucking thought about it.
I didn't talk to nobody,

1942
01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:41.870
but I just worked myself up the way I do before said I can't face your day as

1943
01:45:41.871 --> 01:45:44.930
you can't fake your Coco.
You're from North Bergen.
Get your shit together.

1944
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:46.730
Did they let you lay down?

1945
01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.190
I had to go with one of those school chairs is stood up,

1946
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:53.930
sat down with the school change.
I looked the other way.

1947
01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:57.920
Boom.
I willing to the tube.
All of these black dudes.
What up?
What up?
What up,

1948
01:45:57.921 --> 01:46:02.060
what up?
I didn't faith.
I was like,
fuck.
I evolved.
I got her man.

1949
01:46:02.061 --> 01:46:03.950
I put my arm down.
I picked up the cotton wall,

1950
01:46:03.951 --> 01:46:08.240
the little red.blue down like a bad fucking habit though.

1951
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.960
I went through the dentist Terry three years ago to get a fucking root canal.

1952
01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:15.530
All of a sudden you're here.
Tell her he's like,
that's my husband.

1953
01:46:15.531 --> 01:46:18.200
He's going to come in with the oxygen and shit and they didn't see the needle.

1954
01:46:18.201 --> 01:46:20.690
I just tasted the blood and you blacked out.
Just the deal.

1955
01:46:21.130 --> 01:46:25.130
So why aren't you like like periods when goes down periods it just

1956
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:32.760
listen to me.
When I was 16 I took,
we can carry it home or not.

1957
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:34.830
I was best Keller cute girl.

1958
01:46:34.831 --> 01:46:37.610
She's sucking my Dick at a picnic and we were like 16 and I was in love.

1959
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:40.640
I took her home one night.
I took her panties off,

1960
01:46:40.641 --> 01:46:44.300
she had a Kotex up and then went like this,
blah.
You know,
like when a,

1961
01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:46.620
when a tongue comes out,
when you go to a haunted house,
right.

1962
01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.570
When I pulled the the call to actions on it,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1963
01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.310
I seen this thing with that line of blood and I fainted.
She woke up,

1964
01:46:56.550 --> 01:47:00.690
she woke me up a little while later,
a little while,
like what happened?
She put,

1965
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.690
that's the time they had the day.
When you go to the first aid kit,

1966
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:07.500
you know those correlaries and things,
she put one of each nostril.
I had one

1967
01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:14.400
a first day.
Oh my.
Did she put one of these fucking nostrils?

1968
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.490
I was telling these guys the story the other day when I was in Seattle,

1969
01:47:17.491 --> 01:47:19.890
one time of the stripper.
I was with her at the beach,

1970
01:47:19.891 --> 01:47:23.220
at this little lake and I was working her monkey with a wine cooler.

1971
01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:28.500
I'm working her money,
she's going for the hips of moving and I got that.

1972
01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:32.940
I'm working in with the month and I'm working that little monkey and I'm getting

1973
01:47:32.941 --> 01:47:35.790
all excited and when you see a bottle of the chick's pussy,
I don't care.

1974
01:47:35.791 --> 01:47:37.530
Even if you're a Catholic,
even if you're a Christian,

1975
01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:40.410
you're is going to get hard and that's a complete different animal and I'm just

1976
01:47:40.411 --> 01:47:44.600
working the clit with the bottle.
The suction got ahold of the Pussy and awesome.

1977
01:47:44.610 --> 01:47:49.610
The period came out of it like a string and I just felt like like a cutter.

1978
01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:53.220
So I dropped,
I dropped Jack.
Let me tell you something.

1979
01:47:53.250 --> 01:47:54.690
That's two times I fucked a women.

1980
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:57.930
That was the one time and that girl when I was 16 never again.

1981
01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:02.330
When a woman says that's her area,
I don't even look that your store is closed.

1982
01:48:02.331 --> 01:48:05.640
Don't worry about it.
Only so no periods,
no,
I don't even have a gun.

1983
01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:10.200
The older I get,
the more,
I don't know.
I used to be the same way now.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1984
01:48:10.201 --> 01:48:13.100
That's disgusting.
I don't want to pick a glides out from my time.

1985
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:14.460
You picked up a chicken Boston.

1986
01:48:14.461 --> 01:48:17.970
One time I started at Google 93 I think of back to the wholesale.

1987
01:48:17.971 --> 01:48:20.790
Started nailing.
I fucking turn the lights on.
There was blood everywhere.

1988
01:48:20.791 --> 01:48:23.130
I went down and she was a soldier.
She was home.

1989
01:48:23.131 --> 01:48:25.530
I leave this bitch with stem like myth.

1990
01:48:25.531 --> 01:48:28.890
Let's go into combat zone and he was asleep.
I black the black,

1991
01:48:28.891 --> 01:48:33.891
the fuck I always black and he's the one who has think like if I could be next

1992
01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:34.870
to you,

1993
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:39.840
you can fight somebody and you could bleed a little bit and I could see gross

1994
01:48:39.841 --> 01:48:43.230
shit.
It's as soon as I see a little bit of blood on my shirt,

1995
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:48.100
it's that thing with Bj Penn,
Daddy Stevenson.
That was part of the other day.

1996
01:48:48.101 --> 01:48:50.760
I had to turn the TV off and Nate Marquardt hit uh,

1997
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:52.980
channel center with an upward elbow.

1998
01:48:52.981 --> 01:48:56.850
At one point you could see the blood drop Chels somethings.
I can't see that.

1999
01:48:56.851 --> 01:49:00.570
That's the shit that kills me.
Like that night.
I took the asset to UFC.
I'm wait,

2000
01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.440
please,
Lord,
don't let nobody get beat up bad tonight.

2001
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:08.000
[inaudible] out of here by ambulance.

2002
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:13.440
I took it.
I remember like,
oh no,
it's crazy.

2003
01:49:13.441 --> 01:49:16.500
You could put your finger in a girl's ass hole.
Pull out aluminum foil,

2004
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:20.970
stick you dig back in there.
No problem.
But there's any period blood.

2005
01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:24.540
If I would've pulled it a little bit farther,
Ras,
a little bloke came out,

2006
01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:25.530
I would've dropped right there.

2007
01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:27.740
They don't have no fucking wake me up in the aluminum,

2008
01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:32.610
but also explains why he always gets his steaks.
Well done.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2009
01:49:32.611 --> 01:49:34.710
You get your steak.
Well done.
Nothing like that.
Well,

2010
01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:37.870
I just don't like the taste of blood on my dish when I was a kid that's broke.

2011
01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:42.470
My mom made a dish.
More wealth,
more or less done than you added.

2012
01:49:43.090 --> 01:49:46.440
Cuba's call it with though with,
what's that?
What that means?

2013
01:49:47.210 --> 01:49:52.210
S s done with that word.

2014
01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:56.410
What does the word mean?
Turn.
Turn with that means spending time.

2015
01:49:56.470 --> 01:50:00.760
That's it went that way.
So just brace it on the wayside.
Yeah.
Two minutes done.

2016
01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:02.890
Pink.
Red,
disgusting.
Wow.

2017
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:06.590
Like what they call bow and they call it now and you're probably like $80 for it

2018
01:50:06.591 --> 01:50:11.190
and that's a sheep.
Oh yeah.
Todd Todd,
Todd,
Todd.
That shit,

2019
01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.000
by the way,
don't go to a bad place to get it.

2020
01:50:13.001 --> 01:50:16.720
That's easily the one of the most weight.
The easiest way to get a few points.

2021
01:50:16.721 --> 01:50:18.370
That ain't shit.
Oh Shit.

2022
01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.360
I got it the other day for me to her tire from any tartare.

2023
01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:23.680
How do you know you got it from that though?

2024
01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.280
Immediately me and my girlfriend got sick and like two hours a fucking,

2025
01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:36.370
I forget the name of firefly from Ohio.
You're not supposed to be drunk.
I don't.

2026
01:50:36.371 --> 01:50:38.380
Let me tell you again.
I never heard about it.

2027
01:50:38.381 --> 01:50:40.160
I didn't even know what it was before I've had,

2028
01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:44.470
it doesn't taste that good steak tastes good when the outside is cooked,

2029
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.540
you know that's what it tastes good.
I like medium rare.
That's to me is perfect.

2030
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:53.550
That's around and you see and you slice into it and that's how a stakes was be

2031
01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:58.000
cooked.
You get plenty of rare meat in the middle,

2032
01:50:58.150 --> 01:51:01.870
but the outside cook is what gives it that fucking delicious flavor steak

2033
01:51:01.871 --> 01:51:05.350
tartare is like very mild.
There's like not that much flavor to it,

2034
01:51:05.610 --> 01:51:08.050
like really rare steak,
like a piece of Philemon Yawn.

2035
01:51:08.051 --> 01:51:10.870
If you cut out the outside of it and just had the red park,

2036
01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:12.040
it's not that flavorful.

2037
01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:15.550
You know the real flavor comes from the outside being cooked and all the fat

2038
01:51:15.551 --> 01:51:16.830
melting and all that shit.
You know?

2039
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:18.670
That's where the real flavor of the meat comes in.

2040
01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:22.120
Can you imagine Joe Rogan music?
You a sci fi that beat you up,

2041
01:51:22.410 --> 01:51:23.950
you get cut and he's black.
Oh,

2042
01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:27.880
if he cuts and I'm on the bottom that he bleeds out.
Just a little bit of drugs.

2043
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:32.080
Now I know if I get it,
if I would kill ideas,

2044
01:51:32.081 --> 01:51:34.230
I'm just going to pick my nose really hard to start to bleed.

2045
01:51:34.231 --> 01:51:37.630
You know what I'm saying?
Punch yourself in the nose.
How fucking weird is that?

2046
01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:40.750
It's those little,
and I should correct myself,
it's those drops.

2047
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:44.890
When you watch the Gipsy,
which ditch has a town,
they throw it to the side.
Oh,

2048
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.971
you know what you should do?

2049
01:51:45.971 --> 01:51:49.350
Punch yourself in the nose and then blow your nose on them.
It'd be like amazing.

2050
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:53.710
I would just faith,
I would just puke probably.

2051
01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:56.650
I have no problem with blood and I'd sent,
well obviously I don't,

2052
01:51:56.651 --> 01:51:59.650
otherwise I couldn't be doing what I do and I have no problem with period blood.

2053
01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:04.120
That's never bothered though.
Would you eat mostly with
I don't give a fuck.

2054
01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:07.630
I had a gentleman swallows.
You're calm.
And then once the kitchen,

2055
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:10.300
I don't give a fuck.
She swelled up closer.
Say it doesn't matter.

2056
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:15.100
Even if it's been my body.
What's my Dick is hard.
I'm crazy man.

2057
01:52:15.130 --> 01:52:19.220
Let's go back at time.
So I got to ask you guys questions.
Okay,
so girl wants a,

2058
01:52:19.221 --> 01:52:22.000
Miami told me until they could quit.
When I pulled it off,

2059
01:52:22.001 --> 01:52:26.710
I seen the little fuse and I put the pants,
tampon.
She goes,
no,
go,
go,
go.

2060
01:52:26.711 --> 01:52:30.010
It's really different.
It's really different.
She goes,
it's the third day,

2061
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:36.070
the third day,
and I'm like,
I don't even know what she was talking about going.

2062
01:52:36.090 --> 01:52:37.380
She doesn't mean,
I don't know,

2063
01:52:37.381 --> 01:52:40.020
like damn if for a period so that the third day means it's,

2064
01:52:40.021 --> 01:52:43.330
it's probably not as thick,
but it's more of an oil base period.

2065
01:52:45.150 --> 01:52:45.980
A fucking

2066
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:49.490
<v 4>fake.
Just listen to that.
Oh good.
Greg dressing.</v>

2067
01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:52.370
<v 2>It's like that black blood that comes on.
You know what?</v>

2068
01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:56.100
Sometimes it's really dark when you go to wood ranch to the back.
French salad.

2069
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:59.790
Oh,
it's from the staff in the back of the corner that's now just falling off the

2070
01:52:59.791 --> 01:53:02.310
walls of the vagina or weird situation.

2071
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:07.290
You know the whole thing just bleeds every 28 days.
What the hell doesn't die?

2072
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:10.170
What a shitty.
Whoa.
We've got to back this up guys.
Okay,

2073
01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:14.310
so the third day you take the underwear off and they've got a cigar sticking my

2074
01:53:14.311 --> 01:53:18.290
lip.
Boosie you fit pussy with this fuse is sticking up.
Let's get back to this.

2075
01:53:18.570 --> 01:53:22.880
You pull it out on the side.
Brian,
I'll fucking strangle you.
Right.

2076
01:53:23.610 --> 01:53:25.980
Killing me with that shit.
Just tell me the truth.

2077
01:53:25.981 --> 01:53:29.700
I need this knowledge and don't to take it out.
I lick her pussy or either clip.

2078
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:32.680
But do you leave the cigar it?
No,
no,
no,
no.
You want it.
I'll pull it out.

2079
01:53:32.681 --> 01:53:36.690
I'll take it in and don't give a never working with cigar.
A little play with it.

2080
01:53:36.691 --> 01:53:38.720
I don't use it as my,
that I get sick.

2081
01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:46.420
Oh God.
Yeah.
Oh you pop it out it out.
It's usually,
you know,

2082
01:53:46.421 --> 01:53:48.370
honestly,
it's usually not that bad.

2083
01:53:48.371 --> 01:53:51.310
Like it's like if you fuck her then it starts to come out on your Dick a little.

2084
01:53:51.311 --> 01:53:54.370
But it's not like you take it out and it just,
blood starts going everywhere.

2085
01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:58.030
It's more like,
it's just deep in there.
Have you ever tasted monkey?
Yeah.

2086
01:53:58.031 --> 01:54:00.580
It just tastes like a joints.
Yeah,
sure.

2087
01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:04.480
Oh cause I coins to go suck on the corridor.
That's,
it tastes very copper.
Like,

2088
01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:08.230
yeah,
it's not that bad.
But what's the difference in blood and Pussy?

2089
01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:13.330
Pussy liquid,
you know,
it's all liquids.
You Saliva,
you're swapping spit,

2090
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:16.990
you shoot loads of nerve and blood.
That's the nucleus and the nucleus.

2091
01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:22.030
The nucleus of the new head.
That's the whole patois liquid of life.

2092
01:54:22.090 --> 01:54:23.470
It doesn't matter.
But what does it feel like?

2093
01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:26.640
This girl was telling me that when you fucker on it period.
It's tremendous.
Yeah,

2094
01:54:26.641 --> 01:54:28.480
they love it.
Feels good.
Does it feel good for us?

2095
01:54:28.481 --> 01:54:32.590
Well that's why you see here it's warmer too.
It's more of like a warm juice.

2096
01:54:32.591 --> 01:54:35.650
You get sloppy.
Yeah.
Sometimes you get sloppy sometimes blood everywhere.

2097
01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:37.500
Like Goddamn fucking crabs here.
Yeah.

2098
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:40.870
See my mom would keep the sheets every year for Halloween that she accidentally

2099
01:54:40.871 --> 01:54:42.790
spotted on and that would be the ghost outfit.

2100
01:54:42.970 --> 01:54:45.490
So like I always looked like a ghost.
I got shot.

2101
01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:48.280
Look good Joe Terry Lowe

2102
01:54:48.450 --> 01:54:52.480
<v 4>again.
Motherfucker wrote that you can tell when he works materials,</v>

2103
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:55.630
his lips quiver and he's like please get this out.

2104
01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.860
I just want to make sure I get this out.
Good.

2105
01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:00.980
Just have a tear that's actually true and its material

2106
01:55:01.450 --> 01:55:04.170
<v 2>and would always be like the ghost.
It was like yellow on one side.</v>

2107
01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.930
Right on the other side.
At least in you've told me that.
But these guys,

2108
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.890
yes you would have said Japanese flag able to fucking close up Madam.

2109
01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:13.920
Cause everybody the Japanese flag.
What's a white flag with a red.in the middle?

2110
01:55:14.250 --> 01:55:15.830
People saying,
welcome to my bathroom.

2111
01:55:15.831 --> 01:55:18.750
My wife was in there and look like a Japanese flag.
I've never heard that.

2112
01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:24.170
Steve McGrew does it.
Oh,
it's a bit,
it's a,
it's a joke.
Okay,

2113
01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:25.950
then I've heard other people do it,
isn't he?

2114
01:55:25.951 --> 01:55:28.380
I'm one of those guys that went to England,
became an English comedian.

2115
01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.140
Is he one of those?
Steve.
Steve One.
I'm like funny guy though.

2116
01:55:31.141 --> 01:55:33.810
Denver guy originally does.
Yeah.
A lot of guys do that though,
right?

2117
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:37.350
You go to England.
Always mister boasting.
Macgruber he's very funny.

2118
01:55:37.351 --> 01:55:41.010
He writes a lot.
He's the real deal.
I always missed the boat.
Huh?
In what way?

2119
01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:43.920
He moved to Houston.
This of stuff was going to la,

2120
01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.800
just to Denver as blue collar comedy was blown up,
so he's always been,

2121
01:55:49.801 --> 01:55:51.940
I thought he was always the original guy.
I haven't been one student.

2122
01:55:51.941 --> 01:55:56.280
When I first got into economy,
Steve was the king of Denver.
Hands down.

2123
01:55:56.281 --> 01:55:58.920
Roseann had left and Steve was the next big thing.

2124
01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:03.330
Then was you had to go see him.
They would go see him,

2125
01:56:03.331 --> 01:56:05.690
they would go watch him,
you know,
uh,

2126
01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:09.390
all the Roseanne's people that have been Roseanne became a big comic out of
that.

2127
01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:12.800
But there were two other people that followed that became huge writers.

2128
01:56:12.801 --> 01:56:16.800
Now Holly,
yes.
Big Deals at Disney.
Created a bunch of shows.

2129
01:56:16.801 --> 01:56:21.240
A lot of them didn't stick around.
I forget what their names are,
but uh,

2130
01:56:21.450 --> 01:56:22.860
that was a great scene back then.

2131
01:56:22.890 --> 01:56:26.670
And then all the underlings were great writers because that was what the guy

2132
01:56:26.671 --> 01:56:30.930
with the hooks is from Denver.
Yeah.
What that was his name,
one hook,
one hook.

2133
01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:35.070
Goddammit aren't members.
And he's a great writer.
George from Denver,

2134
01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:38.760
great writer.
You know,
it was just so Rickards.
Great.

2135
01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.640
These guys were great fucking writers,
man.
You know.

2136
01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:44.400
<v 0>Well,
Denver was a great scene.
It's still a great scene.</v>

2137
01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:47.130
There's not that many scenes,
man.
There's not that many comedy scenes.

2138
01:56:47.131 --> 01:56:50.700
And this is,
Austin has a scene.
San Francisco as a scene.

2139
01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:55.500
Denver as a nice scene.
Boston,
I guess,
still has a little bit of a scene,

2140
01:56:55.501 --> 01:56:56.400
but not really.
Yeah.

2141
01:56:56.450 --> 01:57:01.220
<v 2>Holding on took deal.
I feel so bad because it was the right place.</v>

2142
01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:02.340
One of the best

2143
01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:06.630
<v 0>time when I was there in the 1980s EITs to this day,</v>

2144
01:57:06.631 --> 01:57:10.320
state is one of the best comedy club communities in the history of standup

2145
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:14.730
comedy.
It,
the 19,
late 1980s in Boston.
It was a monster scene.

2146
01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:17.970
It was monsters.
Here's the deal that the comics should take over.

2147
01:57:17.971 --> 01:57:22.450
That city been tried,
just set up tarred.
It's hard that,
you know,
they,
they,

2148
01:57:22.451 --> 01:57:25.100
they need a leader,
you know,
they need that.
They need a,

2149
01:57:25.101 --> 01:57:27.750
a whole new movement down there,
I guess.
You know,
there,

2150
01:57:27.751 --> 01:57:30.420
there's some guys putting it together,
you know,
I know.
Um,

2151
01:57:30.930 --> 01:57:34.110
I think they got some new club in Faneuil hall.
Didn't he hear about that?

2152
01:57:34.111 --> 01:57:38.230
I know rich Vos was playing out it.
Tim Macintyre's club,
I believe.
Uh,
it's,

2153
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:42.300
there's still talented guys there.
There's a few guys.
But man,

2154
01:57:42.301 --> 01:57:45.140
it's just not what it used to be.
Anything about Patrice O'Neal?
Anybody?

2155
01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:50.060
I haven't heard anything.
I just heard it's bad.
It's bad stroke.
It's,
I don't,

2156
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:53.370
I don't know any details.
And what about Ralphie may is rounding out there.

2157
01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:56.690
<v 2>Here the hospital is fully,
I heard my prayers go out to him and his family.</v>

2158
01:57:56.691 --> 01:58:00.980
I just heard that a,
he's an ICU in Tampa.
His wife was dead.

2159
01:58:00.981 --> 01:58:05.750
Was Nicola [inaudible] pneumonia,
the Boleo the ship on his Twitter,

2160
01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:09.200
the pneumonia for a long time.
Like every time I looked at it as Twitter is like,

2161
01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:11.520
he still has pneumonia.
What the fuck?
He was in the,

2162
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:13.820
he was in the infirmary on the ship,

2163
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:18.440
so he will have shipped to do comedy with this guy that's a big radio.

2164
01:58:18.441 --> 01:58:23.060
He's like the how it started at Tampa has that area,
what's the guy's name?

2165
01:58:23.150 --> 01:58:26.900
I forgot.
Bullhead Kao Callahan.
Cow Head count.
Heads radio.

2166
01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:32.080
They do a cruise like your c got sick on the group's.
Wow Man.
Cow,
cow,

2167
01:58:32.490 --> 01:58:35.230
cow.
There's a lot of Chicago man,
man,

2168
01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:37.810
<v 0>cow uh,
is not on Chicago anymore,
I don't think.</v>

2169
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:40.600
I think he was on the Internet and he had some sort of internet thing going on.

2170
01:58:40.601 --> 01:58:42.190
Now I don't know what's going on with that guy.

2171
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.160
<v 2>I used to follow him on Twitter,
but I haven't seen any of his shit in a while.</v>

2172
01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:50.370
So they said that,
uh,
he had a blood clot in his leg this morning.
That's it.

2173
01:58:50.371 --> 01:58:53.560
The last thing they told me about how dangerous is it be?
Like I said,

2174
01:58:53.561 --> 01:58:58.280
I got it from three horses,
so I got it from messages.
So once I get it from her,

2175
01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:01.350
say what's wrong or what's wrong?
Well,

2176
01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:02.830
you look at a guy like Patrice and you know,

2177
01:59:02.831 --> 01:59:07.630
he's obviously physically really big and definitely overweight and not healthy.

2178
01:59:07.631 --> 01:59:10.630
But Ralph,
he's bigger than him.
You know,
it's Robert bigger than him then.

2179
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:15.780
Oh yeah.
Ralphie's Patrice never got as big as Ralphy Patrice,

2180
01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:19.390
a big fucking guy.
He put Patrice was locked Paula.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2181
01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:23.790
But Theresa is a lot taller.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
From Boston originally.
Yup.

2182
01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:26.650
Him and Bill Burr,
the last wave.

2183
01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:30.220
There's the last wave of talented guys to leave Boston.
I mean,

2184
01:59:30.270 --> 01:59:33.460
I'm not saying this guys couldn't come out of there and right now still and may

2185
01:59:33.461 --> 01:59:37.000
get,
but Patrice and bill bird,
we're the last guys that I was hearing them out.

2186
01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:40.330
They were like a little bit after me,
you know,
I've tried,
I left,

2187
01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.460
let's,
you know,
we're all gonna go jelly.

2188
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:50.030
So the two matter of prolonging this experience and staying as healthy as

2189
01:59:50.041 --> 01:59:54.200
possible while you're enjoying this experience,
but the way Patrice has gone,

2190
01:59:54.210 --> 01:59:59.020
we're all going to go eventually.
You ready to go?
Not yet.

2191
01:59:59.110 --> 02:00:02.500
No,
I have ready yet.
I,
I have work to do.

2192
02:00:02.890 --> 02:00:04.150
I have a lot of shit to do here.

2193
02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:06.940
I'm still not done and I have kids and I like them.

2194
02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:08.260
I like hanging around with them.

2195
02:00:09.450 --> 02:00:13.690
That's the only like I though you or you've always been pretty open about your

2196
02:00:13.691 --> 02:00:17.950
opinions about space and satellites and all the other stuff.
And it's weird,

2197
02:00:17.951 --> 02:00:21.100
like as I was growing up,
I didn't have time to think of a lot of things.

2198
02:00:21.101 --> 02:00:21.760
You know,

2199
02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:25.160
I had my mind focused on how to fucking rock and roll every day have to survive.

2200
02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:29.350
But there's one thing that's always intrigued me and that's the day before,

2201
02:00:30.190 --> 02:00:32.320
you know,
what do you feel that the week before?

2202
02:00:32.321 --> 02:00:36.330
Like when you know you're going to die?
Yeah.
Like you just feel that,
uh,
yeah.

2203
02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:40.880
I just want to know that.
You know,
you're always talking about time machines.
My,

2204
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:44.920
my actually all this technology.
Yeah.
I wish I had a time machine for one day.

2205
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:47.890
You always heard that people said,
I wish I had 10 years back.

2206
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:51.310
I wish I had it for one day just to be a kid again.
Just to have that feeling,

2207
02:00:51.311 --> 02:00:53.410
to run around,
to see those people.

2208
02:00:53.411 --> 02:00:56.490
I come right back and probably fucking mice myself as well.
And that's the only,

2209
02:00:57.010 --> 02:00:59.440
but I always wanted it.
What happens when you close your eyes?

2210
02:00:59.441 --> 02:01:04.300
Like what the fuck do you go?
So that always intrigues the fuck out of me.

2211
02:01:04.301 --> 02:01:07.300
Right.
While,
while,
while I was with Steve Jobs said before,

2212
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:10.960
those were his last words.
Oh Wow.
It's when the DMT kicked in.

2213
02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:15.700
<v 5>Oh,
it's</v>

2214
02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:19.620
<v 2>crazy because it's so weird how the DMT works.
You ever hear stories?</v>

2215
02:01:20.050 --> 02:01:22.630
Like I heard a friend of mine,
Oh,
his mom was dying.
She goes,

2216
02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.390
open the curtains and let me go join my grandfather.
You know?

2217
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:29.200
And people always say,
well,
you had a spiritual experience done.
That's a BMT.

2218
02:01:29.201 --> 02:01:32.620
You dumb motherfucker.
You've known about these people all your fucking life.

2219
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:34.030
You know,
they're out there.

2220
02:01:34.031 --> 02:01:38.320
So now that's a DMT taken yet what we know your brain makes the craziest shit

2221
02:01:38.321 --> 02:01:42.770
that you could take.
That's,
that's pretty weird.
That your own human body great.

2222
02:01:42.771 --> 02:01:46.850
Makes the strongest psychedelic drug known to man and your own body makes it

2223
02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.810
like,
what purpose is that?
What,
why does,
why would your body make that?
Well,

2224
02:01:50.811 --> 02:01:53.840
it's crazy because I'm a little doorway though.
Somebody was telling me,

2225
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:55.130
I think it's rabbits.

2226
02:01:55.860 --> 02:02:00.800
The rabbits have something naturally that before they get attacked by a hawk or

2227
02:02:00.801 --> 02:02:02.000
an animal crackers,

2228
02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:07.060
that body goes into some thing that puts him in like a euphoric state really?

2229
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:10.160
So they know they're going to go if they have it.

2230
02:02:10.610 --> 02:02:13.880
I feel that all animals and even us,
we have to have it in a way.

2231
02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:16.550
It's probably part of life.
It's probably,
you know,

2232
02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:21.050
one day we'll probably find out that what life is,
is just,

2233
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:21.840
uh,

2234
02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.840
a brief experience and an infinite number of experiences that this one type of d

2235
02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:30.530
reality.
There's one dimension,
life,

2236
02:02:30.531 --> 02:02:34.880
human life as we exist in right now on this planet,
in this solar system.

2237
02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:39.710
It's really just a part of an infinite number of different experiences and then

2238
02:02:39.711 --> 02:02:43.760
this is just one of them and the next one might be something completely outside

2239
02:02:43.761 --> 02:02:45.110
of your body.
It might be some,

2240
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:50.270
some crazy dimension of infinite geometric patterns,

2241
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:53.150
and then the next one,
it might be something different.

2242
02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:57.380
It might be a constant cycle.
We don't know.
Did you ever feel something like,

2243
02:02:57.381 --> 02:03:01.160
did you think about something and feel something that was strong about you?

2244
02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:06.260
Did you ever think you were here before?
It's possible.

2245
02:03:06.261 --> 02:03:08.480
It's possible that you live your life over and over and over again,

2246
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:10.370
just as possible as it is to live your life.

2247
02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:13.490
It's just as possible that you might live the exact same life over and over

2248
02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:14.570
again.
Who knows?

2249
02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:17.810
We literally might live it over and over again until we get it right.

2250
02:03:17.811 --> 02:03:20.570
You think you were like,
I always think of the back of my mind,
seriously,

2251
02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:24.140
three guys in the fucking room and telling you what I thought I was before this.

2252
02:03:24.141 --> 02:03:26.320
I think it was a room and fucking soldier real.

2253
02:03:26.630 --> 02:03:31.130
Just something about that time that's always fucking made me weak whenever

2254
02:03:31.530 --> 02:03:35.720
either one of them going to church.
Why?
I like religion,
you know?
It's something,

2255
02:03:35.721 --> 02:03:39.110
it's a door.
I like when I lived in Boulder,
I went to the rope institute.

2256
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:42.200
I enjoyed all those readings.
I enjoyed the Buddhist religion.

2257
02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.100
It's very interesting.

2258
02:03:43.610 --> 02:03:48.410
The thing that's always killed me as the 12 stations in to crush that thing or a

2259
02:03:48.411 --> 02:03:51.590
church always just killed me.
I don't know what that is.
It's,
it's the,

2260
02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:55.240
the last steps of Jesus,
how he got fucking beat up and he started,

2261
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:59.570
Mary Magdalen wiped his face and they hit him with a stick.
And you know,

2262
02:03:59.571 --> 02:04:01.160
that's always really,
I don't know why.

2263
02:04:02.230 --> 02:04:06.020
That's all that feeling has always made me feel like I could say I was a cowboy

2264
02:04:06.021 --> 02:04:06.621
and a previous,

2265
02:04:06.621 --> 02:04:10.380
so you really feel like at one point in time you lived in the Roman empire,

2266
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:14.360
the Roman Empire.
I don't know.
Like whenever I hear that I worked with Caligula,

2267
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:17.720
I don't like it.
It means [inaudible] whatever the fuck it meant,
that movie,

2268
02:04:17.721 --> 02:04:21.320
whatever.
But it's like I heard it before when I heard it didn't the,
well,

2269
02:04:21.321 --> 02:04:21.531
you know,

2270
02:04:21.531 --> 02:04:24.650
there's a lot of people that believe that memories passed down through genetics

2271
02:04:24.651 --> 02:04:27.290
and that's why you're afraid of certain things as a kid.
Like you know,

2272
02:04:27.291 --> 02:04:29.180
like a little kids are always scared of monsters.

2273
02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:32.420
And the reason there isn't a long time ago,
you know,
when we were monkeys,

2274
02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:35.140
you were,
people were getting eat and left and right by Jaguar.

2275
02:04:35.141 --> 02:04:36.000
So what are you scared of?

2276
02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:40.410
You're scared of something in a night that has big teeth.
Why?
Cause it's cats,

2277
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.771
you know?

2278
02:04:40.771 --> 02:04:44.070
And some people would get away from those big cats and survive and then they

2279
02:04:44.071 --> 02:04:47.100
would retain those memories and those memories literally would be transferred

2280
02:04:47.101 --> 02:04:51.600
from their DNA into the next generation.
You're on fire today.
It makes sense,

2281
02:04:51.601 --> 02:04:55.440
right?
I saved and goes,
I talked to somebody who said,
I know why this is.

2282
02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:59.610
I always thought I was a Roman soldier,
but this was what sealed it.

2283
02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:03.330
Somebody said to me that that thing you have with blood as a mechanism,

2284
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.153
I looked it up,

2285
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:10.310
a mechanism mechanism my body used because my ancestors were warriors and that

2286
02:05:11.731 --> 02:05:14.460
was a mechanism they use when people came and slayed them,

2287
02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:17.280
they would make believe that from the blood they would pass out.

2288
02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:20.430
It was a bachelor of soldiers thought they were dead.
I fucking sweat.

2289
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:23.170
Get the name of it.
I will look that up.
Hilarious.

2290
02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:27.750
So many people around you were killed by sword.
When you see blood blood,

2291
02:05:27.751 --> 02:05:31.650
the lockout lock,
the fucking held.
A few people would survive.
They would survive.

2292
02:05:31.651 --> 02:05:35.510
What a fucked up thing for somebody to say to me.
I was like wow,
wow.

2293
02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.350
And I went home going,
holy fuck,

2294
02:05:37.351 --> 02:05:41.550
I definitely got a smoke weed by two o'clock cause that was big for this shit.

2295
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:45.810
Cause I tell people I always want,
no,
you want to overcome your fears.
We all do.

2296
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:48.780
You know I hated heights.
I became a fucking roof or in college,

2297
02:05:48.781 --> 02:05:51.390
I don't give a fuck.
Give me,
you know,
the only way to on purpose,

2298
02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:54.030
the only way to fucking be scared of heights is to look at,

2299
02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.580
I don't even look at a lot of what do I got to bring up the saliva,

2300
02:05:56.700 --> 02:06:00.390
put that motherfucker on your thing or walk up with one hand and the thing

2301
02:06:00.391 --> 02:06:03.000
wasn't walking up.
It was getting back on the ladder off that room.

2302
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:06.480
That's the confidence.
I did that for 18 months just to fucking,

2303
02:06:06.481 --> 02:06:11.481
I'm one of those guys on a ladder from a roof to a lot of these very off left

2304
02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:16.110
and right and
windows

2305
02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:22.880
broken windows in fucking big skyscrapers and they have those,

2306
02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:27.990
those fucking guys slowly work their way down the skyscraper.

2307
02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:32.910
Carrie must not be molested by ground.
Steve Burke,

2308
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.510
one of my good friends was a window Washer at the World Trade Center.

2309
02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:40.920
Oh my buddy was like a Kansan dining was the guy who was a supervisor.

2310
02:06:40.921 --> 02:06:45.030
He ran the crews that and they had 16 my hands are sweating.

2311
02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.021
You're talking about that.

2312
02:06:46.021 --> 02:06:49.140
My hands just started sweating or thinking about being a windshield Washer,

2313
02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:52.560
the washer and the day he was an outlet in the day they got hit.

2314
02:06:52.561 --> 02:06:55.740
He was at the bar across the street banging it.
Oh my God.
It was a,
yeah,

2315
02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:58.710
it was a Monday or Tuesday.
He couldn't,
the first time they got back there was,

2316
02:06:58.720 --> 02:06:59.461
it was a Friday.

2317
02:06:59.461 --> 02:07:02.090
He was across the street bank and drinks too and I'm all nervous.

2318
02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:05.310
The second time he got banged,
they got the tower was hit.

2319
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:09.000
He was still down in the Jersey shore.
That was just vacation week,
two times.

2320
02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:12.140
That's incredible.
He was,
he don't say much.

2321
02:07:12.141 --> 02:07:14.610
I mean Steve was always the wheel and he's the one that stopped drinking.

2322
02:07:14.611 --> 02:07:18.330
He was the one that drank every day in the 80s when the Iran captains,

2323
02:07:18.331 --> 02:07:21.630
the 144 days,
he didn't take a shower,
drink real.

2324
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:24.960
We would play football with the mud from the summer.
It was fucking hard,

2325
02:07:24.961 --> 02:07:27.240
but that was his,
he was crazy.
He was always crazy,

2326
02:07:27.241 --> 02:07:31.110
but so we did it out of solidarity for at one point of his life.

2327
02:07:31.730 --> 02:07:33.540
Do they have like windshield washers.

2328
02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:37.060
They had them all the way up to like the hundredth and all your job is windows.

2329
02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:39.340
You know by the time you get to this one you got to do that one.

2330
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:43.730
So you just go up.
So it's every day.
That's a day because there's so many.

2331
02:07:44.110 --> 02:07:49.060
And then you know,
sometimes
I need to change the scenery.
What?

2332
02:07:49.090 --> 02:07:51.670
70 88th street.
He know.
Does anything you go to AVH streets,

2333
02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:54.110
they probably got like a,
you know,
44 buildings.

2334
02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:56.710
You probably don't even get paid that well.
Oh Fuck No.
Yeah,

2335
02:07:56.711 --> 02:08:00.190
you do your union dirty and $40 an hour benefit.

2336
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:03.910
Why don't they just think dirty five hour weeks,
you know any bad,

2337
02:08:03.911 --> 02:08:07.870
I mean for working fucking stiff with balls and neighborhood,

2338
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:10.090
it's not a bad fucking job.
You know,

2339
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:12.730
he would have just like self washing windows,

2340
02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:18.330
copies of water hose.
Now you would think they would have a,
yeah,
you were there.

2341
02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:21.880
It would be open a little bit so you can replace the blade,
put it back on.

2342
02:08:21.881 --> 02:08:26.080
I don't exactly know,
but I bet the union probably of avoids that.

2343
02:08:26.081 --> 02:08:29.080
They probably have a contrast with the construction unions to make sure that

2344
02:08:29.081 --> 02:08:33.680
they have the window washers union in the city.
All right.

2345
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:38.870
Does the end of this podcast motherfucking treating her as a pirate?

2346

pussy now that I wouldn't have,
would understand why she wouldn't do that.

2380
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:46.050
The best idea ever.
She's just do it.

2381

Probably will keep her at a Disney movies for life.
That's not what the fuck.

A rubber to go that deep and that fucking dead snatch.

The Washington deepest point.

You think of the fucking Marlboro man.

2389

Have you ever scratched your balls and anyway,

2390
02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:20.300
it's too bad and you had to wake up,
go up and like wash him.
I did.

2391
02:11:20.301 --> 02:11:21.860
This podcast is over Brian.

2392
02:11:21.861 --> 02:11:25.390
It's just Brian [inaudible] with the time when were rubber rocks every

Hopefully we'll deal with him.

2396
02:11:33.110 --> 02:11:36.320
Shane Smith is unfortunately in New York,

We'll figure out how to do it.
We might try Skype.
