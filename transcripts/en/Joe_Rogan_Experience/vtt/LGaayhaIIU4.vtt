4
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:06.691
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo.</v>

5
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Fresh out of fucking surgeries here looking good.</v>

6
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Too gangster as fuck.</v>

7
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Very few people would do that.</v>

8
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:13.644
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in bed.</v>

9
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>My feet up filled out of my mind.</v>

10
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Just spine surgeries.</v>

11
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

12
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>

14
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.111
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

15
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Got a disc replacement,</v>

16
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>titanium disk.</v>

17
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>The incredible Brian Count of course is here popping wine as we speak.</v>

18
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>That's not organic.</v>

19
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

20
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't orchestrated,</v>

21
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>although if it like Brian Cowen had a character and his opening in a sitcom,</v>

22
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like a Kramer slide.</v>

23
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Then Brian would have a nice bottle of wine.</v>

24
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>He would pop it and then he would explain the vineyard and Fros and grows.</v>

25
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.383
<v Speaker 1>This is about</v>

26
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>telling me I had him because he's so good.</v>

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I realized as I was pulling into the driveway,</v>

33
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>but Brendan motherfucking job is here with a powerful young Chamie tee shirt</v>

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.473
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

44
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.001
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>

45
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to buy it,</v>

46
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>but it is a dope shirt.</v>

47
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.933
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with you?</v>

48
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>How could you not?</v>

49
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>How could you not at the throw it on.</v>

50
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I had a nice stylish shirt.</v>

51
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:28.831
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

52
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.191
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

53
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.024
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

54
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Jellies.</v>

55
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

56
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>he's got his own shirt on,</v>

57
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>which is a strong move.</v>

58
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>That's like a bold,</v>

59
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>that's almost when a rapping,</v>

60
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost a wrap.</v>

61
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.720
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotta shirt with your name up good and fit good and all that.</v>

63
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>That is one thing a standup comic cannot pull off.</v>

64
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>You cannot walk around with shirt with your own face on.</v>

65
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It literally cannot be done.</v>

66
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Now in Jujitsu,</v>

67
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

68
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

69
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing too because it's very,</v>

70
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>like there was one shirt that was like an Eddie Bravo scramble shirt.</v>

71
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I could never wear it.</v>

72
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't wear,</v>

73
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I can wear a 10th planet shit all day.</v>

74
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:05.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>But something that says Eddie Bravo,</v>

77
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu or some,</v>

78
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

79
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get Jiu Jitsu shirts made with my name.</v>

80
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Just says he used to be a blue belt of definitely wore run jre shirts before,</v>

81
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>but it was almost like nobody knew what the fuck it meant.</v>

82
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 1>it's also a Bray and it's not like,</v>

84
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>you know like you don't say Joe Rogan,</v>

85
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>but my all time that it feel like when you get to a certain amount of fame and</v>

86
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>then you'd like see anyone doing it,</v>

87
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

88
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

89
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I wore a finding the kid's shirt for some picture and Whitney Kelvin's let,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

97
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

98
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.790

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

114
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>If I design something cool,</v>

115
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:14.410

<v Speaker 2>his look,</v>

119
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.240

120
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking sneakers.</v>

00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>He's got a good mind for things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He sets the trends for fashion,</v>

126
00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:27.780
<v Speaker 2>but he's an interesting cat and a lot of ways.</v>

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.631
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about it.</v>

146
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:50.464
<v Speaker 2>Kanye West,</v>

159
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.251
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

160
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:06.941
<v Speaker 2>speaking of,</v>

161
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 2>speaking of someone who makes me feel lazy,</v>

162
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 2>my friend Cameron Hanes is in a 24 hour race right now.</v>

163
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 2>He called,</v>

164
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 2>he texted me seven hours in.</v>

165
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 2>He had already ran 50 miles.</v>

166
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

167
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.471
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

168
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 2>but he's hurting.</v>

169
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 2>He's going to keep hammering.</v>

170
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 2>So at that pace,</v>

171
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 2>just stop and think about this.</v>

172
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 2>He's not gonna be able to keep up that pace.</v>

173
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Cause that paces is insane.</v>

174
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Seven hours for 50 miles.</v>

175
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a hundred miles in 14 hours.</v>

176
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Nobody does that.</v>

177
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 2>It's usually like 24 hours.</v>

178
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:31.331
<v Speaker 2>Like the law.</v>

179
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 2>He did 106 last time in 24 hours and he came in,</v>

180
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I wanna say like fifth place and that's a crazy thing.</v>

181
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a woman in front of them.</v>

182
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>There was a woman who was just a monster.</v>

183
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.820
<v Speaker 2>What's the east of a woman I can't read.</v>

184
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

185
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 2>you're rolling camera and 106 miles I believe.</v>

186
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 2>And I think the guy who won,</v>

187
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I do not remember his name,</v>

188
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:59.041
<v Speaker 2>but I believe he was north of one 13 [inaudible] 14 his build like was he skinny</v>

189
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 2>or was he like a fucking well cam was too big at the time.</v>

190
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:09.271
<v Speaker 2>Cam was up to like one 80 he lifts a lot of weights and he's up to like one huge</v>

191
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 2>for a long distance for a guy who runs a hundred it's real crazy.</v>

192
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.350
<v Speaker 2>But he runs a half a marathon literally every day cause he's preparing for the</v>

193
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 2>big foot 200 in August.</v>

194
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.390
<v Speaker 2>So this hundred mile race that he's doing,</v>

195
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:26.391
<v Speaker 2>his 24 hour race is just to prepare him for a 200 mile race in August.</v>

196
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Like dude fucking relapsed the on this guy and he's got a full time job.</v>

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I got to start up in my,</v>

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Species exhausted.</v>

225
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about the first fight.</v>

226
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:16.761
<v Speaker 2>This fight,</v>

<v Speaker 2>These chicks are down.</v>

229
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Valerie Laterno.</v>

230
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 2>So this is a flyweight fight.</v>

231
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 2>This is the first,</v>

232
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

233
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Is this the first UFC flyweight fight?</v>

234
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

235
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>

236
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 2>It's 25 what does sw a straw weight.</v>

237
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 2>She's the number five strawweight contender.</v>

238
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 2>But this is not a strong way to fight.</v>

239
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 2>This is a flyweight fight.</v>

240
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.743
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

241
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 2>If I'm not,</v>

242

00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:06.410
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

293
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 2>It was real close.</v>

294
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Really close.</v>

295
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 2>She dropped her though with a big fucking uppercut a little,</v>

296
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 2>little while ago though.</v>

297
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.960
<v Speaker 2>That little while the code should be,</v>

298
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.133
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>

299
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 2>The Claudia is a straight 200 dime piece.</v>

300
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:20.241
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it.</v>

301
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 2>So I started watching the ultimate fighter.</v>

302
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 2>She's very pretty.</v>

303
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 2>She react to,</v>

304
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.720
<v Speaker 2>she's so strong.</v>

305
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.933
<v Speaker 2>She's so strong.</v>

306
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Double digits.</v>

307
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.011
<v Speaker 2>Who's nasty man?</v>

308
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Her like top pressure.</v>

309
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>She's very tough to escape from really strong technical,</v>

310
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and her,</v>

311
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 2>her kickboxing.</v>

312
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Not bad either,</v>

313
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:36.351
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

314
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:36.641
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

315
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:36.831
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

316
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 2>she's very all rounded.</v>

317
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Very well rounded.</v>

318
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>If anyone's going to beat you on,</v>

319
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>it's her.</v>

320
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>If you watch the ultimate fighter,</v>

321
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I thought she came off better than y'all on a shoot.</v>

322
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:44.931
<v Speaker 2>One more fans.</v>

323
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:48.530
<v Speaker 2>You know they had a full on fist fight while taping that they were throwing head</v>

324
00:08:48.531 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 2>kicks at each other and everything.</v>

325
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Who throws head kicks and look at this.</v>

326
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile Calderwood he's about to get caught in this valley with</v>

327
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.851
<v Speaker 3>the Toronto Armbar.</v>

328
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 3>Her arms are in a good position.</v>

329
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Her left arm is not in a good position.</v>

330
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 3>She didn't have good grades.</v>

331
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 3>She just kind of holding on that big right hand.</v>

332
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 3>Calderwood's nasty man.</v>

333
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 3>She fights hard,</v>

334
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 3>real aggressive.</v>

335
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.261
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

336
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Valerie goes for it again.</v>

337
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:08.611
<v Speaker 3>But this time,</v>

338
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:11.930
<v Speaker 3>not even close edge to care to comment on the control,</v>

339
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:12.783
<v Speaker 3>the posture.</v>

340
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 3>It's old school style.</v>

341
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

342
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 3>doing Jujitsu against that fence.</v>

343
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:17.491
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

344
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 3>it's tough.</v>

345
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Squashed and Jujitsu practitioners generally aren't used to that.</v>

346
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

347
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 3>You're really kind of have to fight or train with one of those,</v>

348
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

349
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 3>You got to learn how to use the fence to your benefit and that takes a lot of</v>

350
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.234
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>

351
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that good at that.</v>

352
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.741
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

353
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:35.041
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

354
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I was really surprised when we used to roll a legends.</v>

355
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 3>How much it hurts the case for it.</v>

356
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

357
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 3>The first thing that drives me,</v>

358
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.731
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

359
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:42.564
<v Speaker 3>your head,</v>

360
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.021
<v Speaker 3>the word,</v>

361
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 3>like when your head gets banged into it and your head gets pushed into it,</v>

362
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 3>fucking hurt doesn't give that much and you need your fingers.</v>

363
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:49.201
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel good.</v>

364
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:50.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun if they rub up.</v>

365
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:50.821
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

366
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're going to do like straight Jujitsu and you just want to do</v>

367
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and never get involved in MMA,</v>

368
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 3>you really should have like a padded wall.</v>

369
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Hell yeah.</v>

370
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.231
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

371
00:09:58.231 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Because the cake,</v>

372
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 3>but the cage looks good.</v>

373
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:02.690
<v Speaker 3>If someone's going to sign up walking,</v>

374
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.660
<v Speaker 3>do you want to be like Brennan jump?</v>

375
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:06.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

376
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:06.511
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

377
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 3>We got a cage full cage.</v>

378
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:07.971
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

379
00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 3>To man train and replaced with a full cage,</v>

380
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:12.230
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

381
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.750
<v Speaker 3>I used to,</v>

382
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious as a fucking total poser.</v>

383
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I used to like to walk into that cage.</v>

384
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

385
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 3>called the wind.</v>

386
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

387
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:21.803
<v Speaker 3>All over.</v>

388
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.340
<v Speaker 3>The maternal is hurting.</v>

389
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:23.791
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

390
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.410
<v Speaker 3>you're a bad bitch if you got a shaved head turns.</v>

391
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.600
<v Speaker 3>She's scrambling.</v>

392
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 3>They could easily stop that.</v>

393
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh.</v>

394
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

395
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Thank God they didn't see,</v>

396
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:33.691
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

397
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 3>they didn't,</v>

398
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 3>she got that spinning elbow right in the writing the old jaw and looking at the</v>

399
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 3>whole card.</v>

400
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.463
<v Speaker 3>She got tagged again.</v>

401
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Valley of the turn.</v>

402
00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 3>It was so tough,</v>

403
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

404
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.933
<v Speaker 3>Beaus</v>

405
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 3>you know she has a good striking background.</v>

406
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I think she's just used to getting hit man,</v>

407
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 3>but she's just tough to,</v>

408
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

409
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it with a big elbow.</v>

410
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.501
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

411
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:58.620
<v Speaker 3>we should tell you guys one 13 if you want to sync up.</v>

412
00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:03.621
<v Speaker 3>It's 1110 nine eight seven six five.</v>

413
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the best way to do it,</v>

414
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:05.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

415
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.733
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

416
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.670
<v Speaker 3>A first round.</v>

417
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Joanna Calderwood.</v>

418
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.960
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] hard though,</v>

419
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:13.201
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

420
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:14.034
<v Speaker 3>It is a very good car.</v>

421
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the Tam to Mcroy fight earlier?</v>

422
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.551
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

423
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Which was when I was talking to him to see that Tim didn't got starched with one</v>

424
00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 3>straight left hand.</v>

425
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.431
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

426
00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:23.821
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it.</v>

427
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I saw a homeboy or easy Joe Soto.</v>

428
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Damn Squirrel.</v>

429
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.781
<v Speaker 3>Oh Damn.</v>

430
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:30.780
<v Speaker 3>I see a little Damien Maia and mad pressure too.</v>

431
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 3>He was leaning that fight.</v>

432
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.910
<v Speaker 3>He was losing that fight,</v>

433
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:36.390
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't giving him enough credit for the pressure that he was putting</v>

434
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:36.871
<v Speaker 3>on his cause.</v>

435
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:37.591
<v Speaker 3>He's getting tagged.</v>

436
00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I think he's getting lit up.</v>

437
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was getting up getting hit.</v>

438
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

439
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I thought the second round he won,</v>

440
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.630
<v Speaker 3>so we wanted,</v>

441
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 3>the second record was this guys look at this fight.</v>

442
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 3>When Kenny was saying that he was down two rounds to one,</v>

443
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

444
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

445
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.760
<v Speaker 3>not see how it could have lost one one,</v>

446
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

447
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

448
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 2>this girl was taking shot at one one and then third was up in the air until we</v>

449
00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:57.821
<v Speaker 2>took him down.</v>

450
00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

451
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.280
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

452
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.840
<v Speaker 2>what I was seeing though is a lot of pressure control.</v>

453
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Soto Christian.</v>

454
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Chris was definitely hitting him,</v>

455
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.490
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't have them hurt in any point though,</v>

456
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.510
<v Speaker 2>and soda was constantly doing this.</v>

457
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Constantly pressure.</v>

458
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Now what a fight.</v>

459
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Very good fight and then in the third Sodo started tag him.</v>

460
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Soto started to really put that pressure on them.</v>

461
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:16.781
<v Speaker 2>In public.</v>

462
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard as hell.</v>

463
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 2>They want us to tell you to back up while you're striking.</v>

464
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Backing up and striking is so much harder.</v>

465
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:24.810
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean backing on?</v>

466
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.200
<v Speaker 2>I ever move backwards.</v>

467
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I never moves backwards.</v>

468
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:27.581
<v Speaker 2>Your real life,</v>

469
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 2>you run forward,</v>

470
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:28.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

471
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 2>So wanting to run backwards all the time like that,</v>

472
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 2>it's exhausting.</v>

473
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.570
<v Speaker 2>It's way harder to move backwards.</v>

474
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 2>That's why Thompson so special and who the ODA,</v>

475
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 2>when the auto was at its best,</v>

476
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.060
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't even get near him.</v>

477
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 2>But that's just a,</v>

478
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing that you could get good at in Muhammad Ali's to run miles</v>

479
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>

480
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.983
<v Speaker 2>It's over years.</v>

481
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.670
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing it since.</v>

482
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:48.901
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

483
00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

484
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.170
<v Speaker 2>you got to do it.</v>

485
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 2>You got to do it.</v>

486
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

487
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a really important part of footwork.</v>

488
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 2>The backing up thing can't be exhausting queue because the moving forward things</v>

489
00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:58.000
<v Speaker 2>easy for everybody.</v>

490
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 2>So if a guy has just sort of walking you down,</v>

491
00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:01.234
<v Speaker 2>you can't hurt him.</v>

492
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 2>His walking forward is relaxed and easy.</v>

493
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Natural.</v>

494
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

495
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Especially if he has good blocking,</v>

496
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 2>but you're constantly springing your body backwards.</v>

497
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Springy body backwards.</v>

498
00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Different muscles for openings.</v>

499
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:11.884
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting.</v>

500
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.500
<v Speaker 2>It takes like 30% more.</v>

501
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.961
<v Speaker 2>Watch this,</v>

502
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:14.341
<v Speaker 2>watch this,</v>

503
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:14.521
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

504
00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

505
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:15.991
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

506
00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:16.824
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

507
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

508
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 2>it's perfect.</v>

509
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.153
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

510
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 2>she's out.</v>

511
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>She's hurting for sure.</v>

512
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 2>She definitely wasn't out.</v>

513
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.001
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Joe.</v>

514
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Think about the guys and girl,</v>

515
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 2>that group successful are some of the,</v>

516
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

517
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.191
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

518
00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 2>The worst to deal with.</v>

519
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 2>They're hard because you can't mimic it.</v>

520
00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:32.651
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

521
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things interesting about this fight tonight is that Rory</v>

522
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 2>brought in one of the best guys in the world at it.</v>

523
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 2>He brought in Raymond Daniels,</v>

524
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.291
<v Speaker 2>Raymond Daniels,</v>

525
00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:43.150
<v Speaker 2>that bad ass karate guy,</v>

526
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.570
<v Speaker 2>glory who throws those three 60 turning side kicks and his dad's face with them.</v>

527
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 2>He's wild.</v>

528
00:13:50.021 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Man is kicking is insane.</v>

529
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 2>So Rory is going to be working with a guy who can kick arguably as good as</v>

530
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy or in the neighborhood.</v>

531
00:13:57.731 --> 00:13:58.580
<v Speaker 2>At least God,</v>

532
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I would say better at his level,</v>

533
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 2>especially professionally.</v>

534
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

535
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.920
<v Speaker 2>as a kickboxer kickbox it's,</v>

536
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.600
<v Speaker 2>it's good to make that argument.</v>

537
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

538
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing is Wonderboy has a kickboxer was absolutely perfect.</v>

539
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.951
<v Speaker 2>57 no.</v>

540
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

541
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.640
<v Speaker 2>And Raymond's loss.</v>

542
00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Some tough fights.</v>

543
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 2>But did Raymond lose to guys like val to lean and did,</v>

544
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:18.371
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

545
00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 2>did he lose to those guys?</v>

546
00:14:19.241 --> 00:14:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Cause they were just so worldclass for competition.</v>

547
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy,</v>

548
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd never faced something like that.</v>

549
00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Is that the case?</v>

550
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn.</v>

551
00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 2>She's tagging or the turnout was so tough when talks about so much shit through</v>

552
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:29.374
<v Speaker 2>this awesome fight.</v>

553
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Such a good fight.</v>

554
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 2>The watch the Turner,</v>

555
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.550
<v Speaker 2>she's just jacking off to this way.</v>

556
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.851
<v Speaker 2>This is a very good fight.</v>

557
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

558
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a good fight and she's,</v>

559

560
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Just throwing and and connecting every time.</v>

561
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Will it turn out like you see her striking?</v>

562
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 2>It's real tactical.</v>

563
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

564
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Right upper cut and you saw that in the UN j check fight.</v>

565
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way you could survive striking with you and Jay check.</v>

566
00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 2>But I do to say,</v>

567
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>do you want to</v>

568
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.150
<v Speaker 1>broke her hand in that fight?</v>

569
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.060
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

570
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's a big factor way.</v>

571
00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Still throwing bombs.</v>

572
00:14:59.211 --> 00:14:59.941
<v Speaker 1>Hit the tone bum,</v>

573
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 1>throw him bonds are broken when they say she would don't the golden glory and</v>

574
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 1>just do work against Duke.</v>

575
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

576
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I could use just some monster.</v>

577
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine.</v>

578
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine thinking on intimidating this being plus size,</v>

579
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.780
<v Speaker 1>you don't a golden glory.</v>

580
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Super impressed with her background.</v>

581
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:15.141
<v Speaker 1>Is She a striker?</v>

582
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 1>First to striker?</v>

583
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>She's an att girl.</v>

584
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Trains at American top team,</v>

585
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 1>which she cannot wear shorts.</v>

586
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.573
<v Speaker 1>And then weird.</v>

587
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.391
<v Speaker 1>Even in boxing,</v>

588
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:24.680
<v Speaker 1>you'd have Cronk on your shorts.</v>

589
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.280
<v Speaker 1>They should have their fucking gym on the shore.</v>

590
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>She got out of your gym in the short one on top of Reebok.</v>

591
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 1>You should definitely have your gym and your shorts and respect.</v>

592
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

593
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

594
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Why don't Laura firefighters practice running backwards?</v>

595
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.490
<v Speaker 1>It's because it takes too long.</v>

596
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.323
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

597
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I've ever heard of this.</v>

598
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:41.271
<v Speaker 1>Well Eddie,</v>

599
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 1>you know how a lot of dudes don't like to be on the bottom.</v>

600
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:44.563
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

601
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:44.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

602
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:45.801
<v Speaker 1>but things people don't,</v>

603
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 1>they want it.</v>

604
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

605
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do things that they don't like to do in training.</v>

606
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 1>And especially like running backwards.</v>

607
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun.</v>

608
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun.</v>

609
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.600
<v Speaker 1>It's also going to take a while to get a good stretch out,</v>

610
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.081
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

611
00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:01.370
<v Speaker 1>We now run backwards just for your cardio.</v>

612
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I realized real early,</v>

613
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.151
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

614
00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 1>in doing taekwondo,</v>

615
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:07.610
<v Speaker 1>how exhausting it is to try to move backwards.</v>

616
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Cause I used to spar with this kid.</v>

617
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:11.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a really good boxer and he used to beat my ass,</v>

618
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Speaker 1>but I was always moving backwards from him.</v>

619
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I was always moving backwards and I would get exhausted.</v>

620
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:17.001
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

621
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:18.530
<v Speaker 1>why am I getting so fucking tired?</v>

622
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 1>And then after a while I realize like it's gotta be connected,</v>

623
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 1>not just to his pressure,</v>

624
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 1>but also the fact that I'm moving backwards so much.</v>

625
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a physical thing.</v>

626
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And then as I get better at boxing,</v>

627
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I definitely found it.</v>

628
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:31.871
<v Speaker 1>That was the kid.</v>

629
00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:32.990
<v Speaker 1>He's like a lot more energy.</v>

630
00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Like your shit.</v>

631
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Like when I move forward,</v>

632
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.480
<v Speaker 1>if I move forward near the counter punch and you're going backwards,</v>

633
00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:42.170
<v Speaker 1>you're taking way more steps than I am deaf for doing way more work.</v>

634
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Definite of Muhammad Ali was doing it.</v>

635
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that everybody would do that,</v>

636
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:45.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

637
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.493
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

638
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.383
<v Speaker 1>and he used to run,</v>

639
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:47.601
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

640
00:16:47.601 --> 00:16:48.600
<v Speaker 1>the running backwards thing.</v>

641
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Men turn.</v>

642
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.570
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of coaches,</v>

643
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 1>a lot of coaches work on that stuff now.</v>

644
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 1>They even do it on treadmills.</v>

645
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.010
<v Speaker 1>They do like sprints on treadmills running backwards.</v>

646
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Also less,</v>

647
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

648
00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.580
<v Speaker 1>wear and tear on your knees.</v>

649
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:59.563
<v Speaker 1>Is it really backwards?</v>

650
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

651
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I guess you kind of have to go on your balls of your foot.</v>

652
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Run it backwards.</v>

653
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

654
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Can you can't go heal.</v>

655
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Speaker 1>You'll fucking go flipping backwards.</v>

656
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Football players practice running back.</v>

657
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:08.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

658
00:17:08.901 --> 00:17:09.670
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

659
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Cornerback certain positions.</v>

660
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:11.624
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:12.600
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask you,</v>

662
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.570
<v Speaker 1>you want to ask this question before I forget it.</v>

663
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.000
<v Speaker 1>You trained at Jake Glaser's place,</v>

664
00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

665
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:17.851
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

666
00:17:17.851 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>that was watching Instagram of that today.</v>

667
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:20.540
<v Speaker 1>This is a joint.</v>

668
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Did Jay Glazer just set that up all himself?</v>

669
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

670
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's definitely the captain of that ship to what a fucking huge move that</v>

671
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:28.581
<v Speaker 1>is for him.</v>

672
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:29.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fifth.</v>

673
00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:30.171
<v Speaker 1>Spell it too.</v>

674
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Right off sunset there.</v>

675
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 1>But Pink Taco reason I brought it up.</v>

676
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:35.510
<v Speaker 1>They had these football players doing these exact same drills.</v>

677
00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:38.960
<v Speaker 1>They were running forwards and backwards and doing all this crazy sprinting shit</v>

678
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 1>where it's all like,</v>

679
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:40.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

681
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:40.721
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

682
00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 1>the coach could tell you backwards.</v>

683
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Go forward,</v>

684
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.330
<v Speaker 1>back and they working on this stuff out.</v>

685
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm all reaction stuff.</v>

686
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

687
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:47.350
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

688
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>This is heavy duty Shit.</v>

689
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

690
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

691
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 3>guys obviously didn't see that there's a trail,</v>

692
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.404
<v Speaker 3>almost,</v>

693
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 3>almost all of their sports practice going backwards.</v>

694
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

695
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Well now that I think of the quarter,</v>

696
00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:58.940
<v Speaker 3>lots of a lot of fighters do.</v>

697
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Obviously Connor does.</v>

698
00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Connor is really good at moving backwards and moving forward,</v>

699
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.200
<v Speaker 3>but there's no doubt as we both nice moving backwards costs more energy.</v>

700
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:09.750
<v Speaker 3>And Connor,</v>

701
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:10.321
<v Speaker 3>Connor Five,</v>

702
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 3>that movement coach.</v>

703
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

704
00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.693
<v Speaker 3>Did he?</v>

705
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

706
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:13.580
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

707
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

708
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 3>looking back on it,</v>

709
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 3>I think any of you born in the gym instead of climbing fucking law</v>

710
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.990
<v Speaker 3>from what I heard that you know what?</v>

711
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm good on climbing trees and shit cause you to defense the other guys,</v>

712
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 3>the law guy or woman,</v>

713
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:29.814
<v Speaker 3>the core</v>

714
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Hula hoops and okay,</v>

715
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.973
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>

716
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of merit in the movement movement.</v>

717
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying the guy who was the head of this movement movement was like,</v>

718
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.673
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

719
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 3>I got some shit to folks site.</v>

720
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:45.601
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>

721
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some merit to it.</v>

722
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:47.971
<v Speaker 3>Two reasons.</v>

723
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 3>One break dancers.</v>

724
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.530
<v Speaker 3>One of the things in Jujitsu and Eddie Bravo old test to this.</v>

725
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 3>We had a bunch of breakdancers start training and uh,</v>

726
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Eddie was like the first to comment on it.</v>

727
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Like how crazy strongly are and weird way they can move their body so well</v>

728
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.570
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't just one or two of them.</v>

729
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.240

730
00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 3>they'd come in and they're really good right away.</v>

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Those guys were ridiculous like this.</v>

740
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.063
<v Speaker 3>You guys have met,</v>

741
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 3>they're doing back flips.</v>

742
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 3>They're doing one hand to hand sand.</v>

743
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:39.330
<v Speaker 3>They're jumping on one hand.</v>

744
00:19:39.331 --> 00:19:39.660
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

745
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean have you ever seen his black belt?</v>

746
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Richard Martinez?</v>

747
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.470

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>

752
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know as an instructor,</v>

753
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:57.540
<v Speaker 3>no instructor wants to give black belts early.</v>

754
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.070
<v Speaker 3>Nobody does.</v>

755
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.640
<v Speaker 3>It isn't something that you wanted to because that's a reflection on you.</v>

756
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

757
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 3>And if you give it too early and they get crushed,</v>

758
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.280
<v Speaker 3>you look back,</v>

759
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:06.571
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

760
00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to give you a black belt until I could make sure that you don't</v>

761
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:10.644
<v Speaker 3>embarrass me.</v>

762

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.810
<v Speaker 3>she's going to stop this and she comes erection to the thigh.</v>

877
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:20.980

884
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Why would she try spinning back jacked?</v>

885
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.300

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.580
<v Speaker 3>She started drop to the ground.</v>

889
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Can't turn your back.</v>

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.230
<v Speaker 3>She got,</v>

891
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 3>she got hurt with a bad shot to the body earlier in that round.</v>

892
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 3>I think she was really hurt.</v>

893
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

894
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 3>I think she's so fucking tough.</v>

895
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I think she was really,</v>

896
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.940
<v Speaker 1>really her son.</v>

897

902
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 1>open with a need of the thigh and then a spinning back.</v>

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.130

907
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:05.300
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have a gun fight.</v>

908
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>very much in the game.</v>

940
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:50.541
<v Speaker 1>He's been real quiet.</v>

941
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I just announced the fight.</v>

942
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.533
<v Speaker 1>One of the best.</v>

943
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.540
<v Speaker 1>He's right up there.</v>

944
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:53.751
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

945
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 1>you went five hard rounds of John Jones.</v>

946
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Five hard rounds of DC.</v>

947
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.171
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

948
00:24:57.171 --> 00:24:58.210
<v Speaker 1>He's seeing the world for sure.</v>

949
00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.450
<v Speaker 1>He lost to rumble,</v>

950
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:00.284
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

951
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who rumbled hits like that goes night night,</v>

952
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 1>but do you,</v>

953
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 1>did you see that they played it over and over?</v>

954
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.870
<v Speaker 1>He did get headbutted two magazines.</v>

955
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.733
<v Speaker 1>What looks like it?</v>

956
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

957
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:08.984
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it.</v>

958
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.913
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it.</v>

959
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.611
<v Speaker 1>It's sorry.</v>

960
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:11.211
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see.</v>

961
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I've looked at it and thought that it didn't look like a head,</v>

962
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but then I've looked at it.</v>

963
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I said the punch land at first for sure,</v>

964
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.860
<v Speaker 1>but it looked like definitely collided.</v>

965
00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

966
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

967
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It's just weapon thing touches.</v>

968
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Anyone like that though I think they fight 10 times.</v>

969
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>You're going a different result each time.</v>

970
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's a good breakdown of it in slow mo,</v>

971
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:30.450
<v Speaker 1>but it was hard to see like if the right hand landed first or the the head</v>

972
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:31.323
<v Speaker 1>Butler,</v>

973
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.561
<v Speaker 1>what did we think?</v>

974
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:34.340
<v Speaker 1>What did we do?</v>

975
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Headbutt and you didn't and but the more replayed,</v>

976
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it almost starts siding with you.</v>

977
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

978
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was a headbutt.</v>

979
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I got so high once I watched the big foot footage,</v>

980
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:42.794
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was real.</v>

981
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:44.803
<v Speaker 1>I was so hot.</v>

982
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:45.891
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

983
00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've been making fun of me all the time.</v>

984
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So she just took some shots in my stomach,</v>

985
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 1>but I am wow.</v>

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.791
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1023
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:41.510
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

1024
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.901
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1025
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:42.734
<v Speaker 1>And then that.</v>

1026
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.230
<v Speaker 3>But there was another one to the stomach that was that,</v>

1027
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 3>that she buckled.</v>

1028
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.600
<v Speaker 3>There was another shot and to the stomach before that,</v>

1029
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:52.421
<v Speaker 3>that made her buckle.</v>

1030
00:26:52.421 --> 00:26:56.070
<v Speaker 3>So there was more than one shot to the stomach that had Valerie and trouble.</v>

1031
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:59.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure me and her have the exact same fade.</v>

1032
00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.653
<v Speaker 3>Not Weird.</v>

1033
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.470
<v Speaker 3>Had the same year,</v>

1034
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:04.303
<v Speaker 3>same year above</v>

1035
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 3>c getting good at this.</v>

1036
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's nothing.</v>

1037
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes better to say nothing.</v>

1038
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan.</v>

1039
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 3>I think she's cute.</v>

1040
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:21.991
<v Speaker 3>She's gangsters.</v>

1041
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Fucked with a spinning back fist off the cage.</v>

1042
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Back door.</v>

1043
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 3>It would look unrealistic.</v>

1044
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.671
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1045
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1046
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Her combinations were beautiful too.</v>

1047
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:36.690
<v Speaker 3>So technical needed the butt and then she threw a right and a left elbow and</v>

1048
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:40.140
<v Speaker 3>then a spinning back to stay close as a thigh.</v>

1049
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.010
<v Speaker 3>It was a knee to the thigh,</v>

1050
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.570
<v Speaker 3>so she tees off in her.</v>

1051
00:27:43.571 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 3>This is the first one,</v>

1052
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.061
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1053
00:27:45.061 --> 00:27:46.290
<v Speaker 3>This is the first knocked out.</v>

1054
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Now watch his shot to the bike.</v>

1055
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.980
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that's the one turned around.</v>

1056
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>

1057
00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>

1058
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 3>That's fight club.</v>

1059
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 3>What a combination.</v>

1060
00:27:59.791 --> 00:27:59.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1061

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.400
<v Speaker 3>She had people get hurt all the time.</v>

1064
00:28:03.401 --> 00:28:04.790
<v Speaker 3>You never turn your back and run.</v>

1074
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:17.140
<v Speaker 3>She got hurt bad then fade or melodyne.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean they would have stopped it if it was here.</v>

1085
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Federal loses that fight was kidding with the Bella Donna.</v>

1086
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

1087
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Maldonado was a good boxer man.</v>

1088
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.900
<v Speaker 3>He caught him with that right hand,</v>

1089
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 3>caught him with a nice short right hand and beat him up on the ground.</v>

1090
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.350
<v Speaker 3>He was out there,</v>

1091
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.260
<v Speaker 3>was out on the Ct.</v>

1092
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:49.740
<v Speaker 3>He looked bad and then he got up at one point in time and Fabio hit him with a</v>

1093
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:54.390
<v Speaker 3>bomb and had his legs wobbling and he did the chicken dance across the octagon</v>

1094
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 3>and he still lost a decision.</v>

1095
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1096
00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:57.840
<v Speaker 3>It's the rush.</v>

1097
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1098
00:28:58.141 --> 00:28:59.970
<v Speaker 3>but does the second two rounds?</v>

1099
00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do a lot,</v>

1100
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.310
<v Speaker 3>but still that first rounds,</v>

1101
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.660
<v Speaker 3>ten eight if not,</v>

1102
00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:04.690
<v Speaker 3>can I give a head for,</v>

1103
00:29:04.691 --> 00:29:08.460
<v Speaker 3>it might be ten seven it might be ten seven at least tense because he,</v>

1104
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:09.350
<v Speaker 3>he had him like,</v>

1105
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:09.490
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1106
00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.111
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

1107
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:13.500
<v Speaker 3>When did someone get a ten seven that would be so close to a stop.</v>

1108
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 3>If that's in the u s that fight stops.</v>

1109
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:15.840
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1110
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.160
<v Speaker 3>well just say that,</v>

1111

1153
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.620

00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to stake their territory for the hot grill.</v>

1158
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.660

00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Those things are just way too big.</v>

1163
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea of an 800 pound human is terrifying,</v>

1164
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.900
<v Speaker 1>but an 800 pound gorilla.</v>

1165
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.050
<v Speaker 1>What's the like,</v>

1166
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.060
<v Speaker 1>is that like the biggest thing yet?</v>

1167
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:34.781
<v Speaker 1>We've gone over this.</v>

1168
00:30:34.781 --> 00:30:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 500 I think we decided about five 606 six 30 that was the</v>

1169
00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:39.971
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

1170
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:40.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1171
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:41.340
<v Speaker 1>There was quite a few different nations.</v>

1172
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Like one of them said 801 of them said 500 or a couple of big ones I think are</v>

1173
00:30:45.481 --> 00:30:46.314
<v Speaker 1>like that big</v>

1174
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:48.971
<v Speaker 1>fucking average.</v>

1175
00:30:48.971 --> 00:30:49.900
<v Speaker 1>What's the outlier though?</v>

1176
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Like the mountain,</v>

1177
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Speaker 1>but who was the mountain back,</v>

1178
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:53.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1179
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1180
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.660
<v Speaker 1>the King Kong out there in this bitch.</v>

1181
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch game of Thrones?</v>

1182
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.311
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1183
00:30:57.311 --> 00:30:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm 33 there's Dragon Mountain.</v>

1184
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.110
<v Speaker 1>You get to a certain age and dragons no longer become fun</v>

1185
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.120
<v Speaker 1>and cool and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I never missed.</v>

1188
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I've never missed an episode.</v>

1189
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I never miss an episode bearish.</v>

1194
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Like I shut everything down and by the way,</v>

1234
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I used to be into alligators.</v>

1235
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>

1236
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.680
<v Speaker 1>What we were talking about that that thing,</v>

1237
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.501
<v Speaker 1>shoulders,</v>

1238
00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 1>two year old kid that got sucked into the water and Orlando.</v>

1239
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I blame the parents a little bit.</v>

1240
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It's Florida Sun.</v>

1241
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1242
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.450
<v Speaker 1>just maybe they're not from Florida,</v>

1243
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska,</v>

1244
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.973
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska.</v>

1245
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.313
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

1246
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.771
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1247
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:33.131
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>

1248
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:34.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're not around those goddamn monsters,</v>

1249
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

1250
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Hey Disney,</v>

1251
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.330
<v Speaker 1>let's go ahead and put up some crocodiles side and just be safe.</v>

1252
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.550
<v Speaker 1>If they had signs that said don't know swimming,</v>

1253
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have signs that said,</v>

1254
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.500
<v Speaker 1>beware of alligators.</v>

1255
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:43.821
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1256
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 1>in one of my more retarded moments on the show,</v>

1257
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 1>we were trying to figure out a how a crocodile is not the biggest lizard when</v>

1258
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:52.520
<v Speaker 1>there's so much bigger than Komodo dragons were like,</v>

1259
00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:57.170
<v Speaker 1>why is a Komodo dragon not nearly as big as a crocodile,</v>

1260
00:32:57.171 --> 00:32:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but they called the biggest loser is crocodiles,</v>

1261
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 1>arm reptiles,</v>

1262
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:00.973
<v Speaker 1>reptiles.</v>

1263
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Lizards,</v>

1264
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.150
<v Speaker 1>but lizard is a very specific testing.</v>

1265
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth.</v>

1266
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.630
<v Speaker 1>It is a little bit,</v>

1267
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.503
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1268
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I definitely did when we were doing that.</v>

1269
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Those are on board.</v>

1270
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.203
<v Speaker 1>Raise a reptile.</v>

1271
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:11.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh listen,</v>

1272
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:12.644
<v Speaker 1>I definitely,</v>

1273
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.200
<v Speaker 1>definitely got cropped out.</v>

1274
00:33:14.201 --> 00:33:15.034
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

1275
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even think that.</v>

1276
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1277
00:33:17.001 --> 00:33:17.451
<v Speaker 1>it lizards,</v>

1278
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:18.284
<v Speaker 1>definitely reptile.</v>

1279
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1280
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.390
<v Speaker 1>crocodile is not a lizard,</v>

1281
00:33:20.391 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 1>which is the sales rep.</v>

1282
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

1283
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:22.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're saying.</v>

1284
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.691
<v Speaker 1>Different species,</v>

1285
00:33:23.691 --> 00:33:24.410
<v Speaker 1>different species.</v>

1286
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1288
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's like one of those things like monkeys,</v>

1289
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:28.730
<v Speaker 1>like saying monkeys or chimps.</v>

1290
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1292
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I just got it wrong.</v>

1293
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1294
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:31.540
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1295
00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 1>they're obviously the same kind of thing,</v>

1296
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1297
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:35.781
<v Speaker 1>classification.</v>

1298
00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:36.051
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1299
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:38.210
<v Speaker 1>So apes don't have tails,</v>

1300
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1301
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.673
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

1302
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 1>you have baboons,</v>

1303
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:41.743
<v Speaker 1>Gibbons.</v>

1304
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:43.400
<v Speaker 1>He's not real though.</v>

1305
00:33:43.401 --> 00:33:45.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a real word that the issue is like monkeys,</v>

1306
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:47.790
<v Speaker 1>not a scientific term to chip it to Sydney.</v>

1307
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Simeon's there's all sorts of different primates.</v>

1308
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1309
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1310

1311
00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 1>like the way it's being accepted,</v>

1312
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:56.470
<v Speaker 1>there was an article about it mean maybe you could find it,</v>

1313
00:33:56.471 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

1314
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.540
<v Speaker 1>that all apes or monkeys,</v>

1315
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:00.800
<v Speaker 1>but not all monkeys or apes.</v>

1316
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 1>All apes or monkeys.</v>

1317
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:02.831
<v Speaker 1>Not all.</v>

1318
00:34:02.831 --> 00:34:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Not all marketers,</v>

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.720
<v Speaker 1>so you could call it makes sense.</v>

1320
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 1>This is in the classification.</v>

1321
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.793
<v Speaker 1>This is the way there.</v>

1322
00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.360
<v Speaker 1>They were going off in this article.</v>

1323
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you could call a chimp or a person.</v>

1324
00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.660
<v Speaker 1>You can call it a monkey,</v>

1325
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.620
<v Speaker 1>but you can never call like one of those spider monkeys.</v>

1326
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.250
<v Speaker 1>You can never call that an eight test.</v>

1327
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Not An ape.</v>

1565
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:15.460
<v Speaker 2>I had a pit bull that was 90 pounds and he was a giant problem.</v>

1566
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:19.540
<v Speaker 2>This job he wanted to get at this dog.</v>

1567
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So he bent the bars on my house,</v>

1568
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:22.930
<v Speaker 2>the wrought iron bars.</v>

1569
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I had to get a bar welded across the perimeter of my fence because he realized</v>

1570
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.730
<v Speaker 2>that if he slams his fucking fire hydrant head</v>

1571
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 2>in between the bars,</v>

1572
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:37.330
<v Speaker 2>he can get them like that watch fucking head.</v>

1573
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1574
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.371
<v Speaker 2>So with dog,</v>

1575
00:40:38.371 --> 00:40:39.250
<v Speaker 2>like that's all head.</v>

1576
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.420
<v Speaker 2>So once they get their head through his</v>

1577
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.130
<v Speaker 2>and his body got through,</v>

1578
00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:48.220
<v Speaker 2>he bent the fucking bars like the hook.</v>

1579
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.270
<v Speaker 2>So I had this,</v>

1580
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:50.500
<v Speaker 2>why did you ask that thing?</v>

<v Speaker 2>His name was frank.</v>

1583
00:40:52.571 --> 00:40:54.040
<v Speaker 2>He was a great name.</v>

1584
00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Frank Sinatra.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Frankie.</v>

1586
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.710
<v Speaker 2>He was a beast.</v>

1587
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I had to have a bar installed all around the perimeter of my yard and a,</v>

1588
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.520
<v Speaker 2>this Israeli guy comes over to install it.</v>

1589
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:03.701
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1590
00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:04.534
<v Speaker 2>what happened here?</v>

1591
00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1592
00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 2>the dog did it.</v>

1593
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:07.190
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1594
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.023
<v Speaker 2>the dog.</v>

1595
00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:08.621
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1596
00:41:08.621 --> 00:41:09.454
<v Speaker 2>how do they do?</v>

1597

00:41:09.911 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 2>he did it with his head.</v>

1599
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:11.491

1600
00:41:11.491 --> 00:41:12.324
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>

1601
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.900
<v Speaker 2>He looks over the dog,</v>

1602
00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 2>loose over the pellet.</v>

1603
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:15.091
<v Speaker 2>What the fund?</v>

1604
00:41:15.091 --> 00:41:15.940
<v Speaker 2>The dog just sitting there.</v>

1605
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:17.651
<v Speaker 2>He would hunt.</v>

1606
00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Lizards passed away.</v>

1607
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.220
<v Speaker 2>He would just hunting lizard bees all God damn day on it.</v>

1608
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:21.651
<v Speaker 2>On the map.</v>

1609
00:41:21.651 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 2>It was a beast is,</v>

1610
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:23.050
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1611
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I am not a fan of dog fighting.</v>

1612
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a terrible,</v>

1613
00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:26.500
<v Speaker 2>horrible thing.</v>

1614
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.010
<v Speaker 2>But what they did is they engineered a super dog.</v>

1615
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1616
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.300
<v Speaker 2>and that's what those things are.</v>

1617
00:41:31.301 --> 00:41:32.620
<v Speaker 2>They are not like regular dogs.</v>

1618
00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.813
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1619
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I got him from a breeder.</v>

1620
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.460
<v Speaker 1>We like him creatine all times.</v>

1621
00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1622
00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1623
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to do anything with him,</v>

1624
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:38.361
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1625
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 1>He was a super genetic freak.</v>

1626
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Those dogs are,</v>

1627
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.120
<v Speaker 1>those dogs are different than any income,</v>

1628
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.293
<v Speaker 1>any other dog,</v>

1629
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Speaker 1>a manmade dog.</v>

1630

1636
00:41:56.751 --> 00:41:57.291
<v Speaker 1>Dogs fight.</v>

1637
00:41:57.291 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Cause they literally enjoy it.</v>

1638
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 1>They're covered in blood,</v>

1639
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 1>ripping each other apart and they're wagging their tails.</v>

1640
00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1646
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I've come home to dead dogs before God damn.</v>

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Well they fought to the death killing things to female and female named squeaky</v>

1651
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.330

1652
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a la shelter that does not kill dogs.</v>

1653
00:42:26.271 --> 00:42:27.021
<v Speaker 1>They try not to.</v>

1654

<v Speaker 1>I'll be right over and do the minute you saw her.</v>

1664
00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:38.000

1665
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 1>went down to the shelter,</v>

1666
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:39.921
<v Speaker 1>Olivier,</v>

1667
00:42:39.921 --> 00:42:40.281

<v Speaker 1>RCA with the takedown.</v>

1669
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Real close.</v>

1670
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Good defense.</v>

1671
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:44.660
<v Speaker 1>This is that.</v>

1672
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.070
<v Speaker 1>This is another rough,</v>

1673
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:48.190
<v Speaker 1>why the Dow?</v>

1674
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.910
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1675
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I go there and she's,</v>

1676
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 1>she's so sweet.</v>

1677
00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 1>She's such a sweet dog and she's literally chewed most of her bottom teeth out</v>

1678
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 1>because she was trying to get out of this cage and had around him and she didn't</v>

1679
00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 1>have any or very little teeth at the bottom of her mouth.</v>

1680
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:04.161
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

1681
00:43:04.161 --> 00:43:04.791
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

1682

1684
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.090
<v Speaker 1>She was about eight months old.</v>

1685
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.230
<v Speaker 1>She was a beautiful dog.</v>

1686
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 1>We were like an alligator with,</v>

1687
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:10.791
<v Speaker 1>with legs.</v>

1688
00:43:10.791 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 1>She was so sweet,</v>

1689
00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:12.620
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1690
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 1>She was such a sweet,</v>

1691
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:14.571
<v Speaker 1>sweet dog.</v>

1692
00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Like she was so kind to people,</v>

1693
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.520
<v Speaker 1>but she killed two dogs.</v>

1694
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.571
<v Speaker 1>Kills,</v>

1695
00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:20.871
<v Speaker 1>kills,</v>

1696
00:43:20.871 --> 00:43:21.441
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1697
00:43:21.441 --> 00:43:22.151
<v Speaker 1>That kind of dog.</v>

1698
00:43:22.151 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 1>You never hear about a female killing a male dog.</v>

1699
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:25.371
<v Speaker 1>That never happens.</v>

1700
00:43:25.371 --> 00:43:28.850
<v Speaker 1>But I can't go to the dog pen and away with 17.</v>

1701
00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

1702
00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:29.631
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1703
00:43:29.631 --> 00:43:34.631
<v Speaker 1>I love today and I went to one those puppy mills with your kids at the mall.</v>

1704
00:43:35.061 --> 00:43:35.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1705
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:36.440
<v Speaker 1>We walked in and you buy one?</v>

1706
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:37.423
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1707
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1708
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to buy one.</v>

1709
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:39.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's disturbing,</v>

1710
00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:39.921
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1711

1713
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe like 20 yards away from the puppy mill.</v>

1714
00:43:42.861 --> 00:43:47.861
<v Speaker 1>They had a protest sign and a table set up to not buy puppies from puppy mills.</v>

1715
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1716

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.741
<v Speaker 1>How does that help?</v>

1718
00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:52.790

<v Speaker 2>Think about him from this movie.</v>

1930
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.251
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1931
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:51.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

1932
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:53.320
<v Speaker 2>he gets to this crazy place,</v>

1933
00:48:53.321 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 2>this edge of reality that you go,</v>

1934
00:48:55.511 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1935
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:56.291
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1936
00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:56.891
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch it.</v>

1937
00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:57.191
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

1938
00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:57.790
<v Speaker 2>he's so,</v>

1939
00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:59.440
<v Speaker 2>he seems so crazy that you like,</v>

1940
00:48:59.441 --> 00:48:59.950
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1941
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.740
<v Speaker 2>you have to really be craziest.</v>

1942
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.593
<v Speaker 2>This crazy.</v>

1943
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:03.520
<v Speaker 2>This guy's ever,</v>

1944
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.170
<v Speaker 2>he's felt those thoughts in his head.</v>

1945
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1946
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.161
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1947
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue with that Brad Pitt,</v>

1948
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:08.980
<v Speaker 2>like he plays like bad guys,</v>

1949
00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think he has a bad thought in his head.</v>

1950
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 2>John Goodman does.</v>

1951
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Johnny Depp too.</v>

1952
00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we all,</v>

1953
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:20.650
<v Speaker 2>we should all hope that John Goodman does very well in life and never fails.</v>

1954
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:24.700
<v Speaker 2>It never gets to the point because it's going to be in a position where he's in</v>

1955
00:49:24.701 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 2>a position where he's got nothing to lose and he decides he wants to kill you.</v>

1956
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:27.700
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1957
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Because here's a thing that that guy knows about and he puts it in these</v>

1958
00:49:30.671 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 2>characters that exists in his head.</v>

1959
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>He has has to water it.</v>

1960
00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:34.780
<v Speaker 2>He's got,</v>

1961
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 2>he's got a spree spree shooter just dying to get size.</v>

1962
00:49:37.571 --> 00:49:38.404
<v Speaker 2>I'll just run.</v>

1963
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Unless he's got a gun.</v>

1964
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.660
<v Speaker 2>You gotta see this movie,</v>

1965
00:49:43.661 --> 00:49:44.130
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1966
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:44.621
<v Speaker 2>He's still,</v>

1967
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm posting it now.</v>

1968
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm still marveling over Obama nfcs body.</v>

1969
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't that thrilled about the ending though,</v>

1970
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:51.221
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1971
00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:52.000
<v Speaker 2>That was what?</v>

1972
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Out of nowhere.</v>

1973
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Let's not say a word about it because I don't want it yet.</v>

1974
00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:55.361
<v Speaker 2>I'll thank you,</v>

1975

1977
00:49:56.261 --> 00:49:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I want to see the [inaudible] worried about this.</v>

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.210
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1983
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I just saw Prometheans for the first time.</v>

1984
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.150
<v Speaker 2>The movie's fucking dealt.</v>

1985
00:50:09.151 --> 00:50:09.581
<v Speaker 2>It's been out for,</v>

1986
00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:10.414
<v Speaker 2>so she</v>

1987
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:14.560
<v Speaker 2>left me feeling like,</v>

1988
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

1989
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.810
<v Speaker 2>The movie was so good.</v>

1990
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Alien was so good.</v>

1991
00:50:17.831 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 2>The first one with Ridley Scott and Tim Work of art.</v>

1992
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.393
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1994
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.920
<v Speaker 2>but aliens the best.</v>

1995
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:25.180
<v Speaker 2>One of the best movies of all time.</v>

1996
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.201
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I'm saying.</v>

1997
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Set a high standard.</v>

1998
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:27.830
<v Speaker 2>My man,</v>

1999

<v Speaker 2>I'd be entertained.</v>

2001
00:50:29.161 --> 00:50:30.170
<v Speaker 2>It was so good.</v>

2002
00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 2>It was so good that like if you think of this one as being like the prologue to</v>

2003
00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:34.100
<v Speaker 2>aliens,</v>

00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I was so scared.</v>

2034
00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.471
<v Speaker 2>I was horrified.</v>

2035
00:51:15.471 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 2>My kids are screaming,</v>

2036
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:19.783
<v Speaker 2>pull up,</v>

2037
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.230
<v Speaker 2>pull up the Japanese,</v>

2038
00:51:21.231 --> 00:51:22.064
<v Speaker 2>yellow wasp.</v>

2039
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Brian told me about some wasp Pepsi walls,</v>

2040
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:25.833
<v Speaker 2>but Pepsis</v>

2041
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.200
<v Speaker 2>melt your face off the hawk,</v>

2042
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.073
<v Speaker 2>the traditional hawk.</v>

2043
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.830
<v Speaker 2>It's to trench the heart.</v>

2044
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 2>It's called the trash in the Hawk because they,</v>

2045
00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:35.470
<v Speaker 2>they kill any trash.</v>

2046
00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.650
<v Speaker 2>If you get stung,</v>

2047
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:37.693
<v Speaker 2>it is the most,</v>

2048
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 2>it's the most painful sting in the animal kingdom.</v>

2049
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2050
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.960
<v Speaker 2>full down.</v>

2051
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:42.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2052
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:43.040
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fall down.</v>

2053
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:45.363
<v Speaker 2>You'll fall down.</v>

2054
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.200
<v Speaker 2>You'll fall down that night.</v>

2055
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like getting shot with a 45 I heard a Guy Tarantula Hawk [inaudible] going</v>

2056
00:51:52.111 --> 00:51:56.360
<v Speaker 2>to be and they go back to that form there in La and they're in Los Angeles.</v>

2057
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.571
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

2058
00:51:56.571 --> 00:51:56.781

2059
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:57.350
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2060
00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:57.710
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2061
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:58.430
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

2062
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2063
00:51:58.780 --> 00:51:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Aha.</v>

2064
00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Brian talk about the guy died.</v>

2065
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.850
<v Speaker 2>They're indigenous to la.</v>

2066
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:02.810
<v Speaker 2>To Arizona.</v>

2067
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.531
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

2068
00:52:03.531 --> 00:52:04.191
<v Speaker 2>To Utah.</v>

2069
00:52:04.191 --> 00:52:07.460
<v Speaker 2>They're all over the Americas in the trenches here</v>

2070
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:09.860
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2071
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.080
<v Speaker 2>That killed the trench on my yard once accidentally.</v>

2072
00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.290
<v Speaker 2>I got out of my house once is at nighttime.</v>

2073
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I was walking towards my car and I heard a crunch and I looked down and I had a</v>

2074
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:23.390
<v Speaker 2>torrential this size of a fucking blue crab under my foot.</v>

2075
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.321
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2076
00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:25.154

<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2078
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.610
<v Speaker 2>It was a huge tranche and I'm barely exaggerate.</v>

2079
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:35.030
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere.</v>

2080
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm barely exactly Laurie.</v>

2081
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.833
<v Speaker 2>A little bit</v>

2082
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.510
<v Speaker 2>bring up Japanese yellow wasp.</v>

2083
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you dog,</v>

2084
00:52:43.431 --> 00:52:47.710
<v Speaker 2>like some guy died from a Pepsi was Pepsis Pepsi Cola,</v>

2085
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.490

2086
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.323
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

2087
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.840
<v Speaker 2>He's allowed to change it.</v>

2088
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:51.261
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2089
00:52:51.261 --> 00:52:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Junk on it.</v>

2090
00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Who Decides?</v>

2091
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:53.463
<v Speaker 2>Here's names.</v>

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.820
<v Speaker 2>The fuck that's a Japanese yellow moss.</v>

2095
00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.560
<v Speaker 2>We get the syringes off their APP.</v>

2096
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:01.700
<v Speaker 2>They'll melt your face.</v>

2097
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:02.361
<v Speaker 2>Chappy knees,</v>

2098
00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:02.661
<v Speaker 2>yellow.</v>

2099
00:53:02.661 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2100
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.030
<v Speaker 2>The guy was doing a weed whacker off walks.</v>

2101
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.210
<v Speaker 2>A guy was using a weed wacker.</v>

2102
00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:08.890
<v Speaker 2>They thought he,</v>

2103
00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:09.321
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

2104
00:53:09.321 --> 00:53:10.220
<v Speaker 2>that guy's a threat.</v>

2105
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Six of them landed on his face,</v>

2106
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:12.801
<v Speaker 2>melted.</v>

2107
00:53:12.801 --> 00:53:13.940
<v Speaker 2>His old face is fat.</v>

2108
00:53:13.941 --> 00:53:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Jay and he died.</v>

2109
00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:15.531
<v Speaker 2>He died.</v>

2110
00:53:15.531 --> 00:53:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Melted.</v>

2111
00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I went to heaven.</v>

2112
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:18.350
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by melted?</v>

2113
00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:18.921
<v Speaker 2>That melted.</v>

2114
00:53:18.921 --> 00:53:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Apparently the look what it does to your it.</v>

2115
00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Each year.</v>

2116
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Flesh.</v>

2117
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.113
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have</v>

2118
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.710
<v Speaker 2>any more questions.</v>

2119
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:25.531
<v Speaker 2>Let's read this.</v>

2120
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 2>The Asian Horn</v>

2121
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 1>is nearly two inches long with a three inch wingspan,</v>

2122
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>slightly smaller than the European Hornet,</v>

2123
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 1>but much more aggressive can kill 40 bees in a minute.</v>

2124
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2125
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 1>One Asian Hornet can kill 40 bees in a minute.</v>

2126
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:43.770
<v Speaker 1>A handful can destroy a hive of 30,000 bees in a couple of hours.</v>

2127
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Any more questions by the way?</v>

2128
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

2129
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.510
<v Speaker 1>five Hundo.</v>

2130
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:48.811
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2131
00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Thalie five Hondo to a nest.</v>

2132
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:51.841
<v Speaker 1>Fuck these things.</v>

2133
00:53:51.841 --> 00:53:53.380
<v Speaker 1>They only live 55 days.</v>

2134
00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen if you ever seen the video of them going through a bee colony</v>

2135
00:53:57.031 --> 00:53:58.140
<v Speaker 1>and chopping off all their heads?</v>

2136
00:53:58.141 --> 00:53:58.741
<v Speaker 1>You know what's weird?</v>

2137
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I have to look at this.</v>

2138
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say they scare up intruders by sending a lone worker horn to warn</v>

2139
00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:04.740
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2140
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Speaker 1>If that fails,</v>

2141
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.610
<v Speaker 1>the workers attack on Mohs,</v>

2142
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.400
<v Speaker 1>which is French for as masking group.</v>

2143
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how bees figured out how to kill them?</v>

2144
00:54:13.231 --> 00:54:13.951
<v Speaker 1>When one of those,</v>

2145
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:14.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2146
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:18.210
<v Speaker 1>one of those workers gets into their nest with bees will do.</v>

2147
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Because now they know what's going to happen.</v>

2148
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.990
<v Speaker 1>They cover them and they overheat them.</v>

2149
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2150
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.080
<v Speaker 1>They cover him and they beat their wings.</v>

2151
00:54:25.081 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Smart little basket until they die.</v>

2152
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh fucker.</v>

2153
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:28.614
<v Speaker 1>They cook him.</v>

2154
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2155
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Look at that poor person right there.</v>

2156
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:31.380
<v Speaker 1>You can stylize that.</v>

2157
00:54:31.381 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 1>They have to do it.</v>

2158
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.870
<v Speaker 1>They realize that that's the only way to them to stop the assault.</v>

2159
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:37.171
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2160
00:54:37.171 --> 00:54:37.411
<v Speaker 1>look at her.</v>

2161
00:54:37.411 --> 00:54:38.244
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

2162
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Like somehow they got that information that one of these fuckers comes in here.</v>

2163
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to cover it and heated up some iron man.</v>

2164
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Three Shit.</v>

2165
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2166
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.010
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts man.</v>

2167
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they fit?</v>

2168
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:48.421
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2169
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy Marcy with the rear naked.</v>

2170
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they figured that out?</v>

2171
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:53.933
<v Speaker 1>Barely paid it.</v>

2172
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2173
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you think or figure that out?</v>

2174
00:54:56.521 --> 00:54:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Because they just know that that's their natural enemy and they just kill in</v>

2175
00:54:59.191 --> 00:54:59.740
<v Speaker 1>when they see him.</v>

2176
00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 1>And if there's not a bunch of them,</v>

2177
00:55:00.691 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 1>they just do what they have to do to try to kill it.</v>

2178
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Or do you think they need to?</v>

2179
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2180
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they know well?</v>

2181
00:55:05.071 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they know that if they don't kill it more coming?</v>

2182
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:08.603
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

2183
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.560
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did they have to have learned?</v>

2184
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.850
<v Speaker 1>They learned that.</v>

2185
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2186
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:12.661
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2187
00:55:12.661 --> 00:55:14.100
<v Speaker 1>so when you kill crocodiles,</v>

2188
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:15.030
<v Speaker 1>if they want to clear an area,</v>

2189
00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles,</v>

2190
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2191
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:16.943
<v Speaker 1>this is really weird.</v>

2192
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:20.760
<v Speaker 1>If you kill a crocodile and you kill every crocodile that comes in that area,</v>

2193
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.850
<v Speaker 1>after awhile crocodiles will avoid that area.</v>

2194
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:24.600
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2195
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.980
<v Speaker 1>they will pass it down.</v>

2196
00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:28.650
<v Speaker 1>They'll pass that information down to their brethren.</v>

2197
00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2198
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.590
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know.</v>

2199
00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:30.423
<v Speaker 1>They communicate.</v>

2200
00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.351
<v Speaker 1>They communicate well.</v>

2201
00:55:31.351 --> 00:55:32.340
<v Speaker 1>There's something going on.</v>

2202
00:55:32.341 --> 00:55:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Genetically passed elephants.</v>

2203
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Elephants will remember watering holes and droughts that they were exposed to</v>

2204
00:55:39.331 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 1>his babies 60 years ago.</v>

2205
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.150
<v Speaker 1>So they'll,</v>

2206
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:47.150
<v Speaker 1>they'll lead the entire herd to a watering hole some 20 miles away.</v>

2207
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.083
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2208
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys hear?</v>

2209
00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 1>They're saying octopus of the smartest animal now on earth more than us.</v>

2210

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2218
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.930
<v Speaker 1>If they're smarter than Donald,</v>

2219
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm really proud of we are.</v>

2225
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 1>But I did say to dad about how,</v>

2227
00:56:16.411 --> 00:56:17.310
<v Speaker 1>they're almost alien.</v>

2228
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.910
<v Speaker 1>They have more chromosomes in any other animal that we've ever read.</v>

2229

2230
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.050

2231
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 1>like what they're trying to do</v>

<v Speaker 3>Their eyeballs are like ours.</v>

2236
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 3>And the truth is,</v>

2237
00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I know they can read faces on the podcast before know?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that the smartest animal.</v>

2247
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:53.530
<v Speaker 3>I was watching a video of a guy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was watching video of a guy draining a cauliflower ear and I was oppressed up</v>

2250
00:56:58.301 --> 00:57:01.620
<v Speaker 3>until I saw the syringe that they pull that Eddie Bravo's body.</v>

2321
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.191
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what,</v>

2322
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:46.560
<v Speaker 3>so you added every day and it made its</v>

2323
00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:49.510
<v Speaker 3>way to do it for comedy.</v>

2324
00:58:49.511 --> 00:58:50.344
<v Speaker 3>It's the way to do it.</v>

2325
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.880
<v Speaker 3>I like to exaggerate.</v>

2326
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>

2329
00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:54.821
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely,</v>

2330
00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:57.730
<v Speaker 3>for some people it's obviously like a biological thing.</v>

2331
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Like when you can't sleep at night because you can't get comfortable because you</v>

<v Speaker 3>got back surgery and you can't get,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You want to take whatever the fuck I was taking.</v>

2336
00:59:06.851 --> 00:59:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Stars a death.</v>

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.111
<v Speaker 3>Joey came by,</v>

2340
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:14.350
<v Speaker 3>dropped me off a bag and it doesn't kill the pain.</v>

2341
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I never thought we'd kill pain for me.</v>

2342
00:59:16.061 --> 00:59:16.540
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>

2343
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:16.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2344
00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:19.480
<v Speaker 3>people say that all the time for me and like it doesn't kill painting makes me</v>

2345
00:59:19.481 --> 00:59:20.314
<v Speaker 3>focus on the pain,</v>

2346
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:22.700
<v Speaker 3>but then holy shit,</v>

2347
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 3>what happens is the pain still there,</v>

2348
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.333
<v Speaker 3>but you're so,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You just want to nap.</v>

2351
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:34.023
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2352
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.790

2353
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:35.660
<v Speaker 3>Then I started thinking,</v>

2354
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck am I complaining about?</v>

2355
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:41.800
<v Speaker 3>There's refugees that are sleeping on cement and asphalt and fucking Ecuador and</v>

2356
00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:42.470

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:43.140

2358
00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2364
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:52.453
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2365
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Weed makes me feel super thankful.</v>

2366
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.341

<v Speaker 3>This is never going to work.</v>

2375
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:12.270
<v Speaker 3>I like when I get into a warm bed and I and I,</v>

2376
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 3>I know that nobody's going to be knocking on my door to take me for a walk</v>

2377
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.640
<v Speaker 3>because of my political point of view.</v>

2378
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 3>I feel lucky that I get to sleep and then fuck.</v>

2379
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.330
<v Speaker 3>This is what happens when you grow up with like a super conservative family.</v>

2380
01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:30.810
<v Speaker 3>I ain't go night night Fox News on right by your bed.</v>

2464
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:28.321
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2465
01:02:28.321 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>He's absolutely going to get tested,</v>

2466
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a four week.</v>

2467
01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2468
01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:31.091
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2469
01:02:31.091 --> 01:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2470
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:31.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2471
01:02:31.531 --> 01:02:31.681
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2472
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:31.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2473
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:31.981
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2474
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2475
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.210
<v Speaker 1>He's exempt from the four months in advance rule,</v>

2476
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>which means you have to be tested up until four months in advance.</v>

2477
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>This deal came together so quickly that they didn't make the,</v>

2478
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:44.151
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

2479
01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>just no way they could have that because they weren't even talking to him four</v>

2480
01:02:47.401 --> 01:02:48.234
<v Speaker 1>months ago.</v>

2481
01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:48.481
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2482
01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:48.931
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

2483
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:51.570
<v Speaker 1>They weren't talking to them for doing this fight for a month and you think</v>

2484
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Brock literally went from zero saying that zero chain didn't think he was in a</v>

2485
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>fight at all until four weeks before we were like,</v>

2486
01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>

2487
01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm ta.</v>

2488
01:02:58.770 --> 01:02:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that this deal,</v>

2489
01:02:59.971 --> 01:03:04.050
<v Speaker 1>like him getting signed to fight did not happen until recently.</v>

2490
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.910
<v Speaker 1>It was a very recent thing.</v>

2491
01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to make UFC 200 crazier after Connor and Nate fell off.</v>

2492
01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.070
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

2493
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:11.610
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

2494
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:12.990
<v Speaker 1>This is where all this came from,</v>

2495
01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:14.280
<v Speaker 1>so they had to make this look.</v>

2496
01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk about it because I know too much of the inside stuff of what they</v>

2497
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 1>had to do to make it work out,</v>

2498
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>but it was an ordeal.</v>

2499
01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 1>This was an ordeal to pull off the Nate Connor thing,</v>

2500
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>this Brock Lesnar thing,</v>

2501
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.470
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>

2502
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Because he's still,</v>

2503
01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>he's still wrestling for the WWE.</v>

2504
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:30.930
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

2505
01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:32.400
<v Speaker 1>this is a crazy deal.</v>

2506
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.170
<v Speaker 1>It was not an easy thing to pull off,</v>

2507
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>so he's not going to get tested.</v>

2508
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2509
01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.313
<v Speaker 1>He's tested,</v>

2510
01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:37.853
<v Speaker 1>tested now,</v>

2511
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:38.940
<v Speaker 1>like they're not going to test.</v>

2512
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 1>They weren't testing for months ago.</v>

2513
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>He's had like every other person in the Zack,</v>

2514
01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>he hadn't,</v>

2515
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 1>he's the exception.</v>

2516
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.000
<v Speaker 1>But why did,</v>

2517
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:45.541
<v Speaker 1>can I ask you,</v>

2518
01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:46.610
<v Speaker 1>why did Bryan,</v>

2519
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I feel good point.</v>

2520
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:49.430
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to make exceptions for him,</v>

2521
01:03:49.431 --> 01:03:50.370
<v Speaker 1>he has to do it for other guys.</v>

2522
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2523
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:51.091
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal,</v>

2524
01:03:51.091 --> 01:03:51.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2525
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Here's the,</v>

2526
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:52.561
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2527
01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:54.150
<v Speaker 1>this is the argument against it.</v>

2528
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.710
<v Speaker 1>The argument against it is you got to say,</v>

2529
01:03:55.711 --> 01:03:56.430
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2530
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:58.020
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make this legitimate,</v>

2531
01:03:58.021 --> 01:04:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you should have no question whatsoever that your athletes are clean and</v>

2532
01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:02.370
<v Speaker 1>compliant,</v>

2533
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 1>and that means four months out.</v>

2534
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 1>But how are you not going to make this fight?</v>

2535
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were a promoter and there's no way you can test the guy from four</v>

2536
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:11.911
<v Speaker 1>months ago,</v>

2537
01:04:11.911 --> 01:04:12.331
<v Speaker 1>but you say,</v>

2538
01:04:12.331 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2539
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.220
<v Speaker 1>we can test them right now.</v>

2540
01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:15.120
<v Speaker 1>We tested right now,</v>

2541
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>do we have an exemption queen?</v>

2542
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:16.651
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2543
01:04:16.651 --> 01:04:17.790
<v Speaker 1>if he's on steroids right now,</v>

2544
01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:18.900
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked and we're done.</v>

2545
01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And his deals over,</v>

2546
01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:20.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2547
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:20.911
<v Speaker 1>But if he's clean,</v>

2548
01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:21.241
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

2549
01:04:21.241 --> 01:04:22.074
<v Speaker 1>he's clean.</v>

2550
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's fucking do it.</v>

2551
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I get it for for entertainment and pay per view,</v>

2552
01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.410
<v Speaker 1>it makes 100% but if you're going to say,</v>

2553
01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:28.950
<v Speaker 1>are you saying,</v>

2554
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 1>hey Connor,</v>

2555
01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:31.080
<v Speaker 1>we don't make it summons for anyone.</v>

2556
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:31.711
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar,</v>

2557
01:04:31.711 --> 01:04:32.700
<v Speaker 1>here's when exception and brother,</v>

2558
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.670
<v Speaker 1>well that's it for the WWE battery,</v>

2559
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different kind of essential,</v>

2560
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:37.830
<v Speaker 1>make an exception though because you're doing,</v>

2561
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 1>you're making an exception to what happened in the past before the deal.</v>

2562
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:45.660
<v Speaker 1>You're not making an exception as far as like what you have to do from here on</v>

2563
01:04:45.661 --> 01:04:50.640
<v Speaker 1>out in terms of promotion and in terms of what's agreed upon by the promoter and</v>

2564
01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:51.271
<v Speaker 1>the AF true.</v>

2565
01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>But if every other what's agreed to put buses just talking to him,</v>

2566
01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:54.660
<v Speaker 1>tell her what,</v>

2567
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>let's say I want to come back right now,</v>

2568
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I have to give them a four month advanced and they have to test me.</v>

2569
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Or you are a big enough star where they use their exemption.</v>

2570
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:05.730
<v Speaker 1>So then so then the fighter in the keynote,</v>

2571
01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2572
01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.410
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know that you're going to fight until right before you're going to</v>

2573
01:05:09.411 --> 01:05:09.571
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2574
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>like let's put it this way.</v>

2575
01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't think I would know before.</v>

2576
01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily in favor.</v>

2577
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 1>You might be an impulsive person.</v>

2578
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2579
01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:15.841
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2580
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

2581
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>let's just say you're like Brendan Schaub.</v>

2582
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2583
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you're a pretty crazy guy.</v>

2584
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2585
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>If someone came along and maybe a year and a half from now,</v>

2586
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking still Quito it up and you,</v>

2587
01:05:24.441 --> 01:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>you and Tony Jeffries or hitting the pads every day and you're feeling frisky</v>

2588
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:32.360
<v Speaker 1>when you're rolling with Hanan Barao and Gracie Hanan Barao that'd be fun.</v>

2589
01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Fuck mixing up my Brazilian.</v>

2590
01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Awesome dude.</v>

2591
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So if you did that and you just said,</v>

2592
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:37.661
<v Speaker 1>fuck it man,</v>

2593
01:05:37.661 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to come back.</v>

2594
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>If the fighter and the kid blows up and you're getting 20 million downloads a</v>

2595
01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>month and everything is,</v>

2596
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:43.181
<v Speaker 1>everything is,</v>

2597
01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>everything is happy and fascinating and you just go,</v>

2598
01:05:45.671 --> 01:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I need something else I need,</v>

2599
01:05:46.841 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I need a fucking challenge.</v>

2600
01:05:47.771 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight.</v>

2601
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And then Dana white calls you up and he's smoking a cigar.</v>

2602
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:51.303
<v Speaker 1>The phone,</v>

2603
01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:52.170
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2604
01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:53.003

2611
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they would if you were famous as Brock Lesnar.</v>

2612
01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got to make it.</v>

2617
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you are batshit crazy.</v>

2618
01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:08.890
<v Speaker 1>If you think Brockton,</v>

2619
01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:08.981
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2620
01:06:08.981 --> 01:06:09.940
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna fight for it.</v>

2621
01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>You might be correct also and also Wue were guys on the torso.</v>

2622
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:16.930
<v Speaker 1>He known for taking steroids.</v>

2623
01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:17.793
<v Speaker 1>It's a little fishy.</v>

2624
01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2625
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2626
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.540
<v Speaker 1>prove this.</v>

2627
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not ideal when you're trying to promote this sport as being</v>

2628
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.010
<v Speaker 1>absolutely tested,</v>

2629
01:06:27.011 --> 01:06:27.281
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2630
01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>because you have this little weird gray area that you'd introduced.</v>

2631
01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It's when I say entertainment and sport as a fan,</v>

2632
01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.560
<v Speaker 1>it's all door.</v>

2633
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2634
01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.700
<v Speaker 1>to not make this fight.</v>

2635
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:37.840
<v Speaker 1>It is criminal.</v>

2636
01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it,</v>

2637
01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.320
<v Speaker 1>but I feel you my concern and tested,</v>

2638
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.333
<v Speaker 1>yes he has.</v>

2639
01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I understand you for and I agree with you and not mad at certain exceptions.</v>

2640
01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Then we it.</v>

2641
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:50.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird gray area,</v>

2642
01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.970
<v Speaker 1>but why would Brock Lesnar,</v>

2643
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean we all do have to diverse specs.</v>

2644
01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a moment aside.</v>

2645
01:06:57.221 --> 01:06:58.840
<v Speaker 1>How about a fucking round maybe log.</v>

2646

<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have a real life.</v>

2647
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.410
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2648
01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 1>There was a real man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got the script and he was a real good dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Great Guy.</v>

2651
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I always enjoy talking Kimbo.</v>

2652
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to play Kimbo?</v>

2656
01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:19.590
<v Speaker 1>You just get a computer to make images of Kimbo and you get some duties were</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's press thing and he grabbed me around my torso and I said,</v>

2750
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.161
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2751
01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:37.521
<v Speaker 2>my back,</v>

2752
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:38.331
<v Speaker 2>my back please.</v>

2753
01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:40.310
<v Speaker 2>And I tapped immediately and then I said,</v>

2754
01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I got something happened.</v>

2755
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was too much coffee,</v>

2756
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.240
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's too much coffee.</v>

2757
01:09:44.241 --> 01:09:45.074
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2758
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.280
<v Speaker 2>and I was half serious,</v>

2759
01:09:46.281 --> 01:09:49.610
<v Speaker 2>maybe even 70% of years ago I was a wrestler.</v>

2760
01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:50.683
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way,</v>

2761
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:52.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't want like the way it came out in the middle of the [inaudible] the way</v>

2762
01:09:52.681 --> 01:09:53.361
<v Speaker 2>it came out to me,</v>

2763
01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:53.790
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

2764
01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2765
01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm a man and by the way,</v>

2766
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.870
<v Speaker 2>who's shaped my box.</v>

2767
01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:57.704
<v Speaker 2>I played tennis.</v>

2768
01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2769
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:59.750
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't want you to,</v>

2770
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:00.740
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting me in a,</v>

2771
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:01.700
<v Speaker 2>in a body lock.</v>

2772
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.533
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2773
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2774
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2776
01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.730

2777
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2778
01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.880

2779
01:10:10.881 --> 01:10:11.714
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>

2780
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I put my phone on my wallet on top of the car,</v>

2781
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2782
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.370
<v Speaker 2>And then we engage,</v>

2783
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.233
<v Speaker 2>we engage.</v>

2784
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I tried a couple of arm drags.</v>

2785
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.820
<v Speaker 2>I I get some risks.</v>

2786
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Control,</v>

2787
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I get some risk control.</v>

2788
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2789
01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2790
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.081
<v Speaker 2>he tries to,</v>

2791
01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:25.460
<v Speaker 2>he tries to head head me.</v>

2792
01:10:25.461 --> 01:10:27.800
<v Speaker 2>He tries to kind of throw a headlock.</v>

2793
01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Ami.</v>

2794
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I pull my neck,</v>

2795
01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.370
<v Speaker 2>I bowl my neck and then,</v>

2796
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.440
<v Speaker 2>and then he got two on one on my wrist.</v>

2797
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:34.200
<v Speaker 2>He got both his hands.</v>

2798
01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:34.731
<v Speaker 2>And when I say look,</v>

2799
01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>

2800
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 2>cause he goes,</v>

2801
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2802
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:37.300
<v Speaker 2>let me get to I one.</v>

2803
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 2>That's a big mistake.</v>

2804
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.093
<v Speaker 2>He whispered.</v>

2805
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.330
<v Speaker 2>And then I felt,</v>

2806
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I felt his explosive power and he put me into a body and then I began to</v>

2807
01:10:47.211 --> 01:10:49.400
<v Speaker 2>immediately squeal like a pig.</v>

2808
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:50.690
<v Speaker 2>This is the best part.</v>

2809
01:10:50.691 --> 01:10:51.501
<v Speaker 2>And then I go light bro,</v>

2810
01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll meet you at the lunch place.</v>

2811
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:53.430
<v Speaker 2>He drives off,</v>

2812
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:56.720
<v Speaker 2>leaves his phone and on top of his car and he ran over to his IFO.</v>

2813
01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:01.130
<v Speaker 2>See this thing I sure did it as an objective person.</v>

2814
01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 2>This is why this is so disturbing to me.</v>

2815
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I know what I can do to you and then I know what he can do to me.</v>

2816
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:07.340
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't,</v>

2817
01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.610
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make sense to me.</v>

2818
01:11:08.611 --> 01:11:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2819
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:09.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good,</v>

2820
01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2821
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten a hold of you before.</v>

2822
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Relatively helpless.</v>

2823
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Good rest</v>

2824
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.040
<v Speaker 2>the apple and they charge them a thousand dollar mistake.</v>

2825
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:29.521
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2826
01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

2827
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:32.550
<v Speaker 2>it's worth $1,000 worth five grand.</v>

2828
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:37.830
<v Speaker 2>You got hustled and iPhone.</v>

2829
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2830
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.110
<v Speaker 2>how could you really think to you who grapple with it?</v>

2831
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:40.944
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm a good cause I'm,</v>

2832
01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm good on my feet and this is weird.</v>

2833
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I know it is sad.</v>

2834
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:47.123
<v Speaker 2>Do this.</v>

2835
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stick to my guns and I'm going to say a time when you tried to pull</v>

2836
01:11:51.991 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 2>my bow back</v>

2837
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:54.990
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

2838
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:57.020
<v Speaker 2>you know that bow that I shoot a hundred arrows.</v>

2839
01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:58.591
<v Speaker 2>Who is that?</v>

2840
01:11:58.591 --> 01:12:00.690
<v Speaker 2>There was a brick wall that like,</v>

2841
01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:01.524
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2842
01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

2843
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.330
<v Speaker 2>it just was not moving it.</v>

2844
01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:07.261
<v Speaker 2>But listen,</v>

2845
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:07.471
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

2846
01:12:07.471 --> 01:12:07.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't matter.</v>

2847
01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:08.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a line.</v>

2848
01:12:08.611 --> 01:12:09.061
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

2849
01:12:09.061 --> 01:12:09.894
<v Speaker 2>What you're talking about</v>

2850
01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.180
<v Speaker 2>is a strangeness to this humor because I know part of it is humorous,</v>

2851
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.840
<v Speaker 2>but the strangeness is There's a Whisper of truth.</v>

2852
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Like this one,</v>

2853
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I am 100% convinced that shop is too big and too strong for me to grapple with</v>

2854
01:12:25.411 --> 01:12:26.220
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2855
01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:27.053
<v Speaker 2>But you're not.</v>

2856
01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:27.311
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2857
01:12:27.311 --> 01:12:27.351
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2858
01:12:27.351 --> 01:12:27.600
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2859
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.433
<v Speaker 2>I have</v>

2860
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:34.030
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>

2861
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.480
<v Speaker 2>see if me and Shabazz,</v>

2862
01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Roland,</v>

2863
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking how long can I,</v>

2864
01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:37.520
<v Speaker 2>your phone?</v>

2865
01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2866
01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:39.280
<v Speaker 2>And whether or not I can,</v>

2867
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 2>if it's impossible to get him so tired and to survive long enough that I could</v>

2868
01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:43.490
<v Speaker 2>catch him.</v>

2869
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2870
01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:44.851
<v Speaker 2>So getting him to get,</v>

2871
01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm so tired because he's so much bigger.</v>

2872
01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2873
01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 2>And he's so strong.</v>

2874
01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:48.923
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2875
01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I like to stick my finger in the cage and poke the bear.</v>

2876
01:12:51.151 --> 01:12:51.721
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what,</v>

2877
01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:52.554
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

2878
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:54.390
<v Speaker 2>But that's the weird thing is like,</v>

2879
01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:59.391
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're totally aware and I am what you can and can't.</v>

2880
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2881
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm very well might be like,</v>

2882
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.473
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2883
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:05.003
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>

2884
01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:05.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2885
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2886
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2887
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:06.330
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

2888
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm very aware of how badly I could get beat up and I felt it.</v>

2889
01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I felt that I'd been putting bad positions by him,</v>

2890
01:13:11.251 --> 01:13:11.911
<v Speaker 2>by other guys,</v>

2891
01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:12.721
<v Speaker 2>by boxing,</v>

2892
01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:13.160
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So funny that you say that.</v>

2899
01:13:20.851 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what Ryan Parson who trained him forever said,</v>

2900
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.870
<v Speaker 2>he said he would have to do like deep tissue on like rub them down after a</v>

2901
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.420
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2902
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.570
<v Speaker 2>He said he'd beaks hostage.</v>

2903
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.831
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2904
01:13:28.831 --> 01:13:30.180
<v Speaker 2>he's made out of a different thing.</v>

2905
01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:31.110
<v Speaker 2>He's got a semi,</v>

2906
01:13:31.111 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 2>he's got a simian strength.</v>

2907
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.233
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody more.</v>

2908
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2909
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:34.441
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

2910
01:13:34.441 --> 01:13:35.520
<v Speaker 2>he's got his head,</v>

2911
01:13:35.521 --> 01:13:36.380
<v Speaker 2>everything about him before.</v>

2912
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Hector Lumbar,</v>

2913
01:13:37.711 --> 01:13:37.981
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>

2914
01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.880
<v Speaker 2>he just fought that guy at hand.</v>

2915
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I actually think Dan Henderson,</v>

2916
01:13:41.731 --> 01:13:42.564
<v Speaker 2>you get a title shot.</v>

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.150

<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to hype this thing up.</v>

2936
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:04.140
<v Speaker 2>What could be a better,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's not easy to do.</v>

3133
01:18:46.701 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 3>That's how the timing,</v>

3134
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.700
<v Speaker 3>his tattoo artist might want to call up Aaron dove,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Adobo Guru Tattoo San Diego.</v>

<v Speaker 3>More colored dog.</v>

3138
01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Like a Crayola box on that bites skin.</v>

3139
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.250
<v Speaker 3>That's one good thing that white people have.</v>

3140
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I know I can't do color.</v>

3141
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:09.680
<v Speaker 3>White people could do some amazing people like look,</v>

3142
01:19:09.681 --> 01:19:11.540
<v Speaker 3>if you are working a serious albino,</v>

3143
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:14.580
<v Speaker 3>you could have some beautiful colors and I know I have no cure.</v>

3144
01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.620
<v Speaker 3>A white piece of paper,</v>

3145
01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3146
01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.630
<v Speaker 3>like blank canvas,</v>

3147
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:18.493
<v Speaker 3>black twos.</v>

3148
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:19.703
<v Speaker 3>They could,</v>

3149
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:21.770
<v Speaker 3>well they can put tattoos everywhere though.</v>

3150
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:25.120
<v Speaker 3>And around somehow or another it's,</v>

3151
01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 3>it's like a subtle thing.</v>

3152
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.740
<v Speaker 3>They should do white ink though.</v>

3153
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.480
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't take the skin and it doesn't work.</v>

3154
01:19:29.481 --> 01:19:30.314
<v Speaker 3>Now it looks sick.</v>

3155
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:31.183
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3156
01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I see what he asked you left hands to the body.</v>

3157
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.770
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3158
01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that the black guy covered in tattoos is a fairly new thing</v>

3159
01:19:40.851 --> 01:19:42.080
<v Speaker 3>culturally in this country,</v>

3160
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:42.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3161
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.861
<v Speaker 3>Rappers.</v>

3162
01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Athletes.</v>

3163
01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3164
01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:44.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3165
01:19:44.391 --> 01:19:45.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's so common now.</v>

3166
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.110
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting how it took off.</v>

3167
01:19:48.111 --> 01:19:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Like if you looked at black guys from like Muhammad Ali's error,</v>

3168
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:52.063
<v Speaker 3>Joe Frazier,</v>

3169
01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.500
<v Speaker 3>but then look at like Deontay wilder.</v>

3170
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3171
01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:55.191
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

3172
01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:56.210
<v Speaker 3>So many guys like that.</v>

3173
01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.690
<v Speaker 3>How many gang tattoos were subversive up until really the nineties saint?</v>

3174
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:01.091
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3175
01:20:01.091 --> 01:20:01.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3176
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:01.941
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3177
01:20:01.941 --> 01:20:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Body art was always considered subversive and weird decoration and you had to</v>

3178
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:07.260
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

3179
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:07.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3180
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:12.080
<v Speaker 3>kind of on and you had to be a criminal or like something or something.</v>

3181
01:20:12.081 --> 01:20:12.301
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3182
01:20:12.301 --> 01:20:16.650
<v Speaker 3>you had to be on the outskirts of society to have a tattoo.</v>

3191
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.260
<v Speaker 3>If one person's right,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I used to train with some professional hockey players.</v>

3230
01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:33.360
<v Speaker 3>They are fucking gangster.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

3261
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:27.360
<v Speaker 3>he looked at shots not good for his head.</v>

3262
01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:28.523
<v Speaker 3>Please don't go to them.</v>

3263

3264
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.760
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting when you see a guy come back while he's hurt because like</v>

3265
01:22:35.761 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 3>that's what you find out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're really correct.</v>

3268
01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:40.640
<v Speaker 3>How quickly can you come back while you're hurt?</v>

3269
01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:41.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3271
01:22:46.230 --> 01:22:46.381
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3272
01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:51.150
<v Speaker 3>He would fly around in circles like use punch and then spar or do running and</v>

3273
01:22:51.151 --> 01:22:51.950
<v Speaker 3>shook.</v>

3280
01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:03.090
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like the way he approached that fight.</v>

3281
01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.590
<v Speaker 3>This is a guy who went toe to toe with cop.</v>

3282
01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:06.453
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:17.560
<v Speaker 3>it's like Novitsky likes it called the smell test.</v>

3291
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:18.280
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>

3292
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.370
<v Speaker 3>he smelled like Beo and kettle bells to me.</v>

3293
01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I still like cabbage and potatoes.</v>

3296
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:26.710

3298
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:31.691
<v Speaker 3>He's so close.</v>

3299
01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 3>Come to the UFC.</v>

3300

3302
01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.260
<v Speaker 3>I would have argued with you or no.</v>

3303
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Maldonado exposed him in in a bit of a way,</v>

3304
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:45.270
<v Speaker 3>but it also could be that he hasn't.</v>

3305
01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.330
<v Speaker 3>What was the last time you competed?</v>

3306
01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.680
<v Speaker 3>How long ago was his last fight?</v>

3307
01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:48.543
<v Speaker 3>Not that far.</v>

3311
01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:54.701
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3312
01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:56.800
<v Speaker 3>So was it a scrub you thought make you work in,</v>

3313
01:23:56.801 --> 01:23:57.634
<v Speaker 3>in Russia,</v>

3314
01:24:00.710 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 3>but he got paid to go down the line in the show.</v>

3315
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.943
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3316
01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:06.913

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.071
<v Speaker 3>Before that is old.</v>

3320
01:24:10.071 --> 01:24:10.870
<v Speaker 3>But he should know.</v>

3321
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:13.240
<v Speaker 3>He took that guy down and punched him until he tapped.</v>

3322
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:14.051
<v Speaker 3>It was in December.</v>

3323
01:24:14.051 --> 01:24:14.171

<v Speaker 3>That was a year ago.</v>

3615
01:31:20.881 --> 01:31:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I think this fights like this.</v>

3616
01:31:22.531 --> 01:31:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I think we should all have a button at home that we can press.</v>

3617
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 3>We just say no decision.</v>

3618
01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:27.830
<v Speaker 3>No one can lose.</v>

3619
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:31.320
<v Speaker 3>This can lose this fight we're going to make America just spoke.</v>

3620
01:31:31.321 --> 01:31:32.154
<v Speaker 3>Neither one of you guys.</v>

3621
01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:33.923
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

3622
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:37.190
<v Speaker 3>The night bonus for sure.</v>

3623
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Unless someone stops someone.</v>

3624
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.330
<v Speaker 3>If this fight ends right now,</v>

3625
01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.320
<v Speaker 3>the way this is going,</v>

3626
01:31:43.321 --> 01:31:44.700
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck do you pick a winner?</v>

3627
01:31:44.701 --> 01:31:45.600
<v Speaker 3>This God damn fight.</v>

3628
01:31:45.601 --> 01:31:46.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair.</v>

3629
01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how easy life within fair.</v>

3630
01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:49.650
<v Speaker 3>It's a draw.</v>

3631
01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.120
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel that he</v>

3632
01:31:53.210 --> 01:31:54.043
<v Speaker 3>cut?</v>

3633
01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.533
<v Speaker 3>It's easy.</v>

3634
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.511
<v Speaker 3>You've got to do any money,</v>

3635
01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:57.741
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3641
01:32:00.611 --> 01:32:01.444
<v Speaker 3>Don't bring it.</v>

3642
01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Don't put his mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Put his name in your mouth cause you just mind your p's and q's.</v>

3644
01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.050
<v Speaker 3>Throw strikes.</v>

3645
01:32:08.051 --> 01:32:09.250
<v Speaker 3>You could look at total strikes,</v>

3646
01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

3647
01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Round one and round two.</v>

3648
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.831
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

3649
01:32:11.831 --> 01:32:12.010

3653
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:16.600

3654
01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:17.503

<v Speaker 3>I got by say too,</v>

3698
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:28.330
<v Speaker 3>cause I cause the peer pressure back to Kimball.</v>

3699
01:33:28.331 --> 01:33:31.870
<v Speaker 3>All I was saying is what he did because he brought in the average fan from</v>

3700
01:33:31.871 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Speaker 3>youtube to mixed martial arts.</v>

3701
01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:34.960
<v Speaker 3>That's why he's a big deal.</v>

3702
01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Even when I fight,</v>

3703
01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.430
<v Speaker 3>my mom knew who Kimbo was from the youtube videos.</v>

3704
01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:40.443
<v Speaker 3>I definitely see that.</v>

3705
01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:41.170
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm saying.</v>

3706
01:33:41.170 --> 01:33:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I definitely see he's an important figure.</v>

3707
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I just wouldn't say it's only like four or five.</v>

01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:51.343
<v Speaker 2>He's so tough.</v>

3832
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:52.390
<v Speaker 2>He's so tough.</v>

3833
01:36:52.391 --> 01:36:53.560
<v Speaker 2>And so he said,</v>

3834
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.310
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be ten eight it has to be attending.</v>

3835
01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:55.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

01:36:57.561 --> 01:36:57.831
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

01:36:57.831 --> 01:36:58.011
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

01:36:58.011 --> 01:37:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what these fucking rafts judges,</v>

3840
01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:00.951
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3841
01:37:00.951 --> 01:37:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's done.</v>

3842
01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's done the right way.</v>

3843
01:37:03.471 --> 01:37:05.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we should have a 10 point system.</v>

3844
01:37:05.211 --> 01:37:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be like a hundred points or something like that,</v>

3845
01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:13.780
<v Speaker 2>or 30 points or this should be a bunch of points where it's not ten nine and</v>

3846
01:37:14.130 --> 01:37:14.271
<v Speaker 2>half,</v>

3847
01:37:14.271 --> 01:37:14.631
<v Speaker 2>10 at night.</v>

3848
01:37:14.631 --> 01:37:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Especially with the grappling and the submission,</v>

3849
01:37:16.881 --> 01:37:17.720
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make sense.</v>

3850
01:37:17.721 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Especially if I'm get off my back and I'm constantly having the guy in danger,</v>

3851
01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:25.520
<v Speaker 2>or if I'm a counter restaurant is not saying we disagree with this decision.</v>

3852
01:37:25.521 --> 01:37:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3853
01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to disagree with it.</v>

3854
01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:27.530
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3855
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3856
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:29.180
<v Speaker 2>it was an awesome fight.</v>

3857
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:30.381
<v Speaker 2>Winds deep.</v>

3858
01:37:30.381 --> 01:37:31.214
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3859
01:37:33.490 --> 01:37:35.870
<v Speaker 2>could easily finish only MMA.</v>

3860
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:39.583
<v Speaker 2>There's no submission.</v>

3861
01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel wait,</v>

3862

01:37:42.711 --> 01:37:46.520
<v Speaker 2>what if you had grappling judges and striking Joe?</v>

3865
01:37:46.521 --> 01:37:48.500
<v Speaker 2>How much of MMA judges fuck all that.</v>

3866
01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3867
01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.890
<v Speaker 2>but what if you had x fighters as judges?</v>

3868
01:37:51.891 --> 01:37:53.820
<v Speaker 2>That's what you have.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking that [inaudible] is a crafty guy that doesn't sit still</v>

3902
01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:04.440
<v Speaker 2>fighting a long time,</v>

3903
01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.730
<v Speaker 2>but he keeps getting better.</v>

3904
01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.290
<v Speaker 2>That's hard as fuck.</v>

3905
01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.153
<v Speaker 2>Definitely does.</v>

3906
01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.450
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't rest on his laurels.</v>

3907
01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you watch him fight now he fights much more technical.</v>

3908
01:39:12.181 --> 01:39:14.400
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't unload like big bombs.</v>

3909
01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:15.323
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>

3910
01:39:15.570 --> 01:39:16.021
<v Speaker 2>well he does.</v>

3911
01:39:16.021 --> 01:39:17.520
<v Speaker 2>We'll still has that with Ben.</v>

3912
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:19.500
<v Speaker 2>He caught Ben and he hit him with like a sauna.</v>

3913
01:39:19.501 --> 01:39:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Upper cuts.</v>

3914
01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3915
01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:24.930
<v Speaker 2>but he's been fighting more technical but then he's harnessing that tower.</v>

3916
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3917
01:39:25.150 --> 01:39:25.810
<v Speaker 2>he's getting,</v>

3918
01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:26.830
<v Speaker 2>he's up that trend now.</v>

3919
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Fought for title Anderson in his prime fun was my boyfriend so he can squat shut</v>

3920
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.153
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3921
01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:36.920
<v Speaker 2>It is a tough really is.</v>

3922
01:39:37.890 --> 01:39:39.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough fight for both guys.</v>

3923
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Donald is no joke at one 70 like him has more tools.</v>

3924
01:39:44.370 --> 01:39:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3925
01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.071
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3926
01:39:45.071 --> 01:39:47.130
<v Speaker 2>he's nasty off of his back.</v>

3927
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.410
<v Speaker 2>His kickboxing is legit as fuck.</v>

3928
01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.900
<v Speaker 2>He wants to see what steers kicks.</v>

3929
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:52.470
<v Speaker 2>You know what scares me is Donald,</v>

3930
01:39:52.471 --> 01:39:53.760
<v Speaker 2>when he fights good boxers,</v>

3931
01:39:53.761 --> 01:39:56.850
<v Speaker 2>struggles cause cause and even Donald,</v>

3932
01:39:56.851 --> 01:39:57.141
<v Speaker 2>Mitzi,</v>

3933
01:39:57.141 --> 01:39:57.391
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3934
01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:58.680
<v Speaker 2>I go forward or backwards.</v>

3935
01:39:58.681 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't take any angles.</v>

3936
01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.890
<v Speaker 2>And when you're facing a guy who has good boxing,</v>

3937
01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:02.491
<v Speaker 2>you're in trouble,</v>

3938
01:40:02.491 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3939
01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I hear a guy like him say that and I got to assume that he's working on that.</v>

3940
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I've got a suit hope telling you that,</v>

3941
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:10.470
<v Speaker 2>that he's trying to get better at it,</v>

3942
01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.200
<v Speaker 2>but you always got to,</v>

3943
01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 2>you got to kind of guess where a guys that based on his previous performances.</v>

3944
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.480
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at his previous performance,</v>

3945
01:40:18.481 --> 01:40:20.610
<v Speaker 2>like Nate Diaz was a really troublesome fight for him.</v>

3946
01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:21.480
<v Speaker 2>He had a really hard time,</v>

3947
01:40:21.481 --> 01:40:22.530
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the first round.</v>

3948
01:40:22.531 --> 01:40:23.460
<v Speaker 2>What can they do?</v>

3949
01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Bosses actually well,</v>

3950
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:28.950
<v Speaker 2>but I also think there was some emotional stuff going on in that because Nate</v>

3951
01:40:28.951 --> 01:40:32.930
<v Speaker 2>talked him into a coma a hundred percent Nate knocked his hat off and cow,</v>

3952
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:33.783
<v Speaker 2>he's a nice guy.</v>

3953
01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see cowboy when he was lining up to fight Kobe,</v>

3954
01:40:36.901 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 2>like the weigh ins,</v>

3955
01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:38.610
<v Speaker 2>they're real friendly.</v>

3956
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Cowboy's a real friendly guy.</v>

3957
01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:41.820
<v Speaker 2>He's a really,</v>

3958
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:43.050
<v Speaker 2>really good guy.</v>

3959
01:40:43.051 --> 01:40:43.920
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good guy.</v>

3960
01:40:43.921 --> 01:40:44.820
<v Speaker 2>So he doesn't want,</v>

3961
01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:46.560
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't need or want to hate.</v>

3962
01:40:46.561 --> 01:40:47.510
<v Speaker 2>You didn't need animosity.</v>

3963
01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:49.650
<v Speaker 2>But I think Nate,</v>

3964
01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Nate really got in his head with that shit and it was like,</v>

3965
01:40:52.531 --> 01:40:52.850
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3966
01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:53.683
<v Speaker 2>a lot emotional.</v>

3967
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

3968
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:54.873
<v Speaker 1>mean this guy was like,</v>

3969
01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Nate,</v>

3970
01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Nate's super disrespectful when he's gonna fight you.</v>

3971
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of the strategy.</v>

3972
01:41:00.210 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 1>It makes it personal.</v>

3973
01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3974
01:41:01.630 --> 01:41:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And to make you think about it because it makes your emotions ramp up and makes</v>

3975
01:41:04.721 --> 01:41:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you tight.</v>

3976
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Mentioned me making mistakes.</v>

3977
01:41:06.571 --> 01:41:07.404
<v Speaker 1>It makes you make mistakes.</v>

3978
01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

3979
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Very smart.</v>

3980
01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:09.363
<v Speaker 1>They're brilliant at it.</v>

3981
01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Well it Connor,</v>

3982
01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:10.900
<v Speaker 1>we get caught that,</v>

3983
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:11.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3984
01:41:11.141 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 1>he's great at that.</v>

3985
01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you like that?</v>

3986
01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>

3987
01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I go back and forth man,</v>

3988
01:41:15.401 --> 01:41:17.920
<v Speaker 1>because I've seen you like do I like well Joe's a Aldo.</v>

3989
01:41:17.921 --> 01:41:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I love shit talking when it's done really well.</v>

3990
01:41:20.021 --> 01:41:23.230
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I don't like is it seems like a lot of people are trying to do</v>

3991
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 1>that now that weren't doing or you know why though?</v>

3992
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Because the guys who do it or make it more money and they're getting more fame.</v>

3993
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:30.310
<v Speaker 1>So now guys,</v>

3994
01:41:30.311 --> 01:41:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the personality.</v>

3995
01:41:31.561 --> 01:41:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It's on their demeanor and their trying to do it.</v>

3996
01:41:33.611 --> 01:41:35.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like God damn that is fake.</v>

3997
01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:35.943
<v Speaker 1>This is not good.</v>

3998
01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:36.813
<v Speaker 1>But that's what you,</v>

3999
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what you get when you award that.</v>

4000
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4001
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Cause everyone mimics the same as NFL mimics.</v>

4002
01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Everyone mimics willing to trade off like the Tan,</v>

4003
01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:45.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4004
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.730
<v Speaker 1>support for,</v>

4005
01:41:46.770 --> 01:41:47.531
<v Speaker 1>for cash.</v>

4006
01:41:47.531 --> 01:41:48.281
<v Speaker 1>That's what it really is.</v>

4007
01:41:48.281 --> 01:41:48.431
<v Speaker 1>Cause,</v>

4008
01:41:48.431 --> 01:41:49.051
<v Speaker 1>why don't you start talking,</v>

4009
01:41:49.051 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 1>but if it's not your channel,</v>

4010
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:51.760
<v Speaker 1>generally guys,</v>

4011
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:52.660
<v Speaker 1>people aren't into that.</v>

4012
01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Generally it turns people off and they generally like it makes it,</v>

4013
01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:56.990
<v Speaker 1>makes headlines about that headache.</v>

4014
01:41:57.550 --> 01:42:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Conor never turned anybody off nail named the most famous fighters in the world.</v>

4015
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:01.804
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather,</v>

4016
01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:03.040
<v Speaker 1>the most biggest shit.</v>

4017
01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:03.874
<v Speaker 1>Talk about time.</v>

4018
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Conor Mcgregor Shit talker Brock Lesnar Shit Tacos and think about it.</v>

4019
01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Connor put everything together.</v>

4020
01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 1>He had incredible performances and he talked match combination on who's great at</v>

4021
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:14.860
<v Speaker 1>talking shit.</v>

4022
01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Not that great of a fighter,</v>

4023
01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 1>a good fighter,</v>

4024
01:42:17.561 --> 01:42:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't good enough to be a world champion.</v>

4025
01:42:22.181 --> 01:42:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Came so close against Anderson.</v>

4026
01:42:23.771 --> 01:42:24.181
<v Speaker 1>I know Joe,</v>

4027
01:42:24.181 --> 01:42:25.240
<v Speaker 1>but what got me to the point,</v>

4028
01:42:25.241 --> 01:42:28.640
<v Speaker 1>that shit talking the shit talking but also the performance is getting Nate,</v>

4029
01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:29.471
<v Speaker 1>Nate Marquardt,</v>

4030
01:42:29.471 --> 01:42:30.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

4031
01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:30.810
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that.</v>

4032
01:42:30.810 --> 01:42:33.760
<v Speaker 1>That was [inaudible] with his shit.</v>

4033
01:42:33.761 --> 01:42:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Talking bout some dudes.</v>

4034
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Definitely no chills.</v>

4035
01:42:37.091 --> 01:42:37.924
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal.</v>

4036
01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal athlete.</v>

4037
01:42:38.970 --> 01:42:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Great fighter.</v>

4038
01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that with his personnel and his shit talking,</v>

4039
01:42:42.670 --> 01:42:43.690
<v Speaker 1>it elevated him.</v>

4040
01:42:43.691 --> 01:42:44.290
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4041
01:42:44.290 --> 01:42:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I think when a guy like Conor does something that he did knock out Josie Aldo in</v>

4042
01:42:48.701 --> 01:42:49.421
<v Speaker 1>13 seconds,</v>

4043
01:42:49.421 --> 01:42:49.870
<v Speaker 1>hold it.</v>

4044
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:50.703
<v Speaker 1>He's a different,</v>

4045
01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:51.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing.</v>

4046
01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:52.241
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

4047
01:42:52.241 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Like his performances,</v>

4048
01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:54.670
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4049
01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:55.060
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

4050
01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:57.010
<v Speaker 1>his wins were a different thing,</v>

4051
01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:59.080
<v Speaker 1>but then it backfires because when you lose,</v>

4052
01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:01.810
<v Speaker 1>he'll get look at Rhonda and full.</v>

4053
01:43:01.811 --> 01:43:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4054
01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:04.030
<v Speaker 1>So that brightened up,</v>

4055
01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the price.</v>

4056
01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:05.711
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

4057
01:43:05.711 --> 01:43:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

4058
01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 1>You make that money in your bank account.</v>

4059
01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Guys like Randy couture,</v>

4060
01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.050
<v Speaker 1>when he loses,</v>

4061
01:43:11.050 --> 01:43:11.471
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

4062
01:43:11.471 --> 01:43:11.771
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

4063
01:43:11.771 --> 01:43:13.010
<v Speaker 1>you're still a bad motherfucker.</v>

4064
01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Like no one true.</v>

4065
01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:14.680
<v Speaker 1>No one hates him.</v>

4066
01:43:14.710 --> 01:43:14.980
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

4067
01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Those Randy couture days are over.</v>

4068
01:43:16.391 --> 01:43:18.410
<v Speaker 1>My brother Connor changed the entire game.</v>

4069
01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:20.253
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys</v>

4070
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.720
<v Speaker 1>fighting anymore.</v>

4071
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:26.583
<v Speaker 1>But if he was,</v>

4072
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:30.650
<v Speaker 1>but do you understand that if George St Jersey appears is a beautiful man who's</v>

4073
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 1>a great fighter,</v>

4074
01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.160
<v Speaker 1>doesn't catch so much spot on,</v>

4075
01:43:33.161 --> 01:43:33.731
<v Speaker 1>he's respectful,</v>

4076
01:43:33.731 --> 01:43:34.564
<v Speaker 1>he wears nice suits.</v>

4077
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:36.370
<v Speaker 1>He would still sell like crazy today.</v>

4078
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I still sell like crazy.</v>

4079
01:43:37.841 --> 01:43:39.010
<v Speaker 1>He came up today and he was,</v>

4080
01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:42.970
<v Speaker 1>cause he was a huge star before onsite named someone right now who's currently</v>

4081
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.730
<v Speaker 1>fighting UFC who's quiet and as a superstar.</v>

4082
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:47.140
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

4083
01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:47.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4084
01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:48.460
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

4085
01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:53.330
<v Speaker 1>there's the superstars are Randa Kahn and tough.</v>

4086
01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones is like on the brink of superstardom.</v>

4087
01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:01.460
<v Speaker 1>If Jon Jones can you get past [inaudible] and they get record numbers for UFC</v>

4088
01:44:01.461 --> 01:44:03.680
<v Speaker 1>200 and becomes a gigantic event.</v>

4089
01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:06.140
<v Speaker 1>John Jones at the door because he,</v>

4090
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:09.830
<v Speaker 1>because he has great talent but he's also in the headlines for bat shit.</v>

4091
01:44:09.930 --> 01:44:10.880
<v Speaker 1>He's making headlines.</v>

4092
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes that,</v>

4093
01:44:12.650 --> 01:44:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want to talk about like what makes someone a famous person,</v>

4094
01:44:16.071 --> 01:44:19.940
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's almost as important and it's goofy societal agree as someone</v>

4095
01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:22.430
<v Speaker 1>being a shit talker or look at a guy like couldn't remake your headline.</v>

4096
01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Is Uriah Faber Shit talker or not?</v>

4097
01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:25.701
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he is.</v>

4098
01:44:25.701 --> 01:44:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I think he's super honest.</v>

4099
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.720
<v Speaker 1>He's an old school.</v>

4100
01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.553
<v Speaker 1>He's an old school guy.</v>

4101
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Uriah faber talking about an upcoming fight.</v>

4102
01:44:31.281 --> 01:44:31.700
<v Speaker 1>He never,</v>

4103
01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:32.660
<v Speaker 1>he's an old school guy.</v>

4104
01:44:32.661 --> 01:44:33.980
<v Speaker 1>That's not huge drawl anymore.</v>

4105
01:44:33.981 --> 01:44:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

4106
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:35.360
<v Speaker 1>he's an old school guy.</v>

4107
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:38.900
<v Speaker 1>He's from the old [inaudible] right favors still right up there and there's a</v>

4108
01:44:38.901 --> 01:44:42.080
<v Speaker 1>reason why they had Uriah versus Dominick Cruz and it wasn't just cause your</v>

4109
01:44:42.081 --> 01:44:43.400
<v Speaker 1>rise been doing really well.</v>

4110
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.610
<v Speaker 1>It was also because they know you're Ryan can sell some fucking hundred percent</v>

4111
01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.453
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

4112
01:44:47.890 --> 01:44:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Super Nice.</v>

4113
01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:51.050
<v Speaker 1>His name or a superstar who doesn't talk shit.</v>

4114
01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:52.700
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm saying is your I have favorites.</v>

4115
01:44:52.710 --> 01:44:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4116
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but he's old now.</v>

4117
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:55.580
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing it.</v>

4118
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You're out of favor.</v>

4119
01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:59.090
<v Speaker 1>And let's define superstar.</v>

4120
01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it a UFC champion paper?</v>

4121
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Paper paper.</v>

4122
01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.001
<v Speaker 1>Who's been a paper?</v>

4123
01:45:05.001 --> 01:45:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Could you draw besides your riot?</v>

4124
01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.180
<v Speaker 1>That's not a world champion in the UFC.</v>

4125
01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva don't talk shit.</v>

4126
01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:10.251
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4127
01:45:10.251 --> 01:45:12.950
<v Speaker 1>but everybody who was ever been a paper view star,</v>

4128
01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:16.010
<v Speaker 1>that's never been a world champion in the UFC.</v>

4129
01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Is there one McGregor?</v>

4130
01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:17.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4131
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Conor McGregor knocked out.</v>

4132
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:19.743
<v Speaker 1>Although he's,</v>

4133
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:22.850
<v Speaker 1>but when he fought in the ideas in the world champ at one 70 but it doesn't</v>

4134
01:45:22.851 --> 01:45:23.121
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

4135
01:45:23.121 --> 01:45:23.901
<v Speaker 1>He's a world champion.</v>

4136
01:45:23.901 --> 01:45:24.980
<v Speaker 1>One 45 he was,</v>

4137
01:45:24.981 --> 01:45:26.240
<v Speaker 1>he had beaten Josie.</v>

4138
01:45:26.241 --> 01:45:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4139
01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:27.320
<v Speaker 1>there's one of the best,</v>

4140
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:32.830
<v Speaker 1>say one 70 was all but 170170170 that's the waterworld chat the answer.</v>

4141
01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.040
<v Speaker 1>But he won the world championship.</v>

4142
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:40.911
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong answer.</v>

4143
01:45:40.911 --> 01:45:41.920
<v Speaker 1>But here's the co,</v>

4144
01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:42.860
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter Bro.</v>

4145
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:44.300
<v Speaker 1>He won the heavyweight title.</v>

4146
01:45:44.301 --> 01:45:45.770
<v Speaker 1>St currently hasn't been,</v>

4147
01:45:45.771 --> 01:45:46.160
<v Speaker 1>hasn't,</v>

4148
01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:46.993
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been.</v>

4149
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.930
<v Speaker 1>There's not one.</v>

4150
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:50.780
<v Speaker 1>So you're wife favors the only guy in consideration.</v>

4151
01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:55.730
<v Speaker 1>If you think about a guy who like a legit star who's never won a UFC title,</v>

4152
01:45:55.731 --> 01:45:56.960
<v Speaker 1>who can sell paper views,</v>

4153
01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you're Ryan might be the only guy here.</v>

4154
01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I want to WEC title it.</v>

4155
01:46:00.561 --> 01:46:01.394
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4156
01:46:01.610 --> 01:46:01.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4157
01:46:01.791 --> 01:46:02.690
<v Speaker 1>but never the UFC.</v>

4158
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in the UFC that like has come along in these years who's not like a giant</v>

4159
01:46:08.211 --> 01:46:10.840
<v Speaker 1>crazy fight pass fan has likely seen those.</v>

4160
01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:11.990
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

4161
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.823
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

4162
01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:13.870
<v Speaker 1>it's hard because you,</v>

4163
01:46:13.871 --> 01:46:17.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't see those when they show those a UFC countdown shows,</v>

4164
01:46:17.631 --> 01:46:19.040
<v Speaker 1>you see highlights from him and shit.</v>

4165
01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:21.170
<v Speaker 1>But you don't really see w he sees on TV.</v>

4166
01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:22.180
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

4167
01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:22.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4168
01:46:22.581 --> 01:46:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of dudes do talk shit,</v>

4169
01:46:25.461 --> 01:46:26.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's fighting.</v>

4170
01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:27.053
<v Speaker 1>It's natural.</v>

4171
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a puddle.</v>

4172
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:29.030
<v Speaker 1>The drawl,</v>

4173
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.863
<v Speaker 1>not a wheelchair.</v>

4174
01:46:30.170 --> 01:46:31.010
<v Speaker 1>So Ronnie's a good,</v>

4175
01:46:31.190 --> 01:46:31.820
<v Speaker 1>good call.</v>

4176
01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:32.870
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really talk shit.</v>

4177
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:36.680
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten close a couple of times this fighting shit.</v>

4178
01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:37.370
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4179
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:40.670
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't get the kind of like numbers he's actually talking about that.</v>

4180
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:45.440
<v Speaker 1>He did an interview recently where he's talking about how he'd rather fight Nate</v>

4181
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Diaz,</v>

4182
01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz rather than Conor because it doesn't matter to whether</v>

4183
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:50.980
<v Speaker 2>it's for the world title.</v>

4184
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

4185
01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:52.290
<v Speaker 2>So I gets the same amount of money,</v>

4186
01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:53.730
<v Speaker 2>like whether he's fighting,</v>

4187
01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.980
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't get paper view because they're a piece of paper champion.</v>

4188
01:46:55.981 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Just wants to fight the best guy and wants a fight.</v>

4189
01:46:58.321 --> 01:46:58.601
<v Speaker 2>Like who?</v>

4190
01:46:58.601 --> 01:47:02.040
<v Speaker 2>A guy who he wants to fight and I guess he wants to get back at Nate because he</v>

4191
01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:03.150
<v Speaker 2>fought day before.</v>

4192
01:47:03.230 --> 01:47:03.831
<v Speaker 2>It makes it neat,</v>

4193
01:47:03.831 --> 01:47:05.610
<v Speaker 2>beat him and he doesn't feel like he fought his best.</v>

4194
01:47:06.150 --> 01:47:10.920
<v Speaker 2>That's also why cowboys such a bad ass because he just wants challenges.</v>

4195
01:47:10.921 --> 01:47:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what he gravitates towards.</v>

4196
01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:13.770
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

4197
01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a small one 70 dude.</v>

4198
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Paul Felder looked bigger than him the other day.</v>

4199
01:47:18.121 --> 01:47:19.320
<v Speaker 2>We were hanging out at the comedy store.</v>

4200
01:47:19.690 --> 01:47:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I like by like a few pounds.</v>

4201
01:47:23.130 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

4202
01:47:23.850 --> 01:47:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 10 well he was,</v>

4203
01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:26.160
<v Speaker 2>it fell.</v>

4204
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Felder was not high eighties when we saw him and Donald was Max Holloway.</v>

4205
01:47:31.441 --> 01:47:34.230
<v Speaker 2>When nine in a row doesn't talk an ounce of Shit.</v>

4206
01:47:34.231 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

4207
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows who he is.</v>

4208
01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:36.330
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4209
01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:36.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4210
01:47:36.571 --> 01:47:38.550
<v Speaker 2>But he also is the bad part to it.</v>

4211
01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:40.350
<v Speaker 2>But he also is the UK.</v>

4212
01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:40.651
<v Speaker 2>He could,</v>

4213
01:47:40.651 --> 01:47:42.270
<v Speaker 2>he could headline a UK show.</v>

4214
01:47:42.271 --> 01:47:42.451
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4215
01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Max Holloway.</v>

4216
01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:43.481
<v Speaker 2>Thoughts?</v>

01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:46.770

4223
01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.011
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4224
01:47:47.011 --> 01:47:47.680
<v Speaker 2>John Holloway.</v>

4225
01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:48.513
<v Speaker 2>Thinking of John Hallway.</v>

4226
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4227
01:47:49.330 --> 01:47:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Filming give John Hathaway.</v>

4228
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:51.743
<v Speaker 2>John Hathaway.</v>

4229
01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I made up one of those [inaudible] fuck and he's won nine in a row.</v>

4230
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Give him a fucking total shock to Max Holloway.</v>

4231
01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:09.420
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucking good.</v>

4232
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:10.051
<v Speaker 2>Max Holloway.</v>

4233
01:48:10.051 --> 01:48:14.790
<v Speaker 2>So Ghanaian and they'll fucking row and beat the WHO's who is Hawaiian accent is</v>

4234
01:48:14.791 --> 01:48:18.560
<v Speaker 2>so fucking pick out there that no,</v>

4235
01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:20.390
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here though.</v>

4236
01:48:21.010 --> 01:48:22.320
<v Speaker 2>If you pay attention to flags,</v>

4237
01:48:22.321 --> 01:48:25.190
<v Speaker 2>they're confusing because a lot of people don't realize Hawaii is all fuck</v>

4238
01:48:25.210 --> 01:48:25.590
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

4239
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Hawaiian Hawaii comes into the frag flag.</v>

4240
01:48:28.051 --> 01:48:30.800
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a British flag flag,</v>

4241
01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:34.940
<v Speaker 2>which in a weird way because like no one in South Dakota comes in with the</v>

4242
01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:39.450
<v Speaker 2>fucking South Dakota flag because that is one of the promote more proof positive</v>

4243
01:48:39.451 --> 01:48:42.750
<v Speaker 2>things that Hawaii is like an occupied country.</v>

4244
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:44.670
<v Speaker 2>We have taken over Hawaii and decided,</v>

4245
01:48:44.671 --> 01:48:45.031
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

4246
01:48:45.031 --> 01:48:46.890
<v Speaker 2>you motherfuckers are just a little too close.</v>

4247
01:48:46.891 --> 01:48:49.950
<v Speaker 2>We would like to control you since you're in the middle of the ocean.</v>

4248
01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:50.910
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

4249
01:48:50.970 --> 01:48:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4250
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good idea to let an enemy tribe live here five hours by plane from</v>

4251
01:48:56.131 --> 01:48:57.030
<v Speaker 2>fucking Los Angeles.</v>

4252
01:48:57.031 --> 01:48:58.380
<v Speaker 2>So we're just going to own you.</v>

4253
01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:00.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's what Hawaii is,</v>

4254
01:49:00.271 --> 01:49:00.511
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4255
01:49:00.511 --> 01:49:05.160
<v Speaker 2>That's how I know there's a lot of Hawaiians that want Hawaiian independence to</v>

4256
01:49:05.161 --> 01:49:05.730
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4257
01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I would say settle down.</v>

4258
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:08.423
<v Speaker 2>Settle down.</v>

4259
01:49:08.490 --> 01:49:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Everyone said Max Holloway will respect you deeply as your own nation.</v>

4260
01:49:13.861 --> 01:49:14.251
<v Speaker 2>Just wait.</v>

4261
01:49:14.251 --> 01:49:14.431
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

4262
01:49:14.431 --> 01:49:15.264
<v Speaker 2>the new,</v>

4263
01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.030
<v Speaker 2>let's just keep this one to you.</v>

4264
01:49:18.031 --> 01:49:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Love yourself from Hawaii.</v>

4265
01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I Love Hawaii.</v>

4266
01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.053
<v Speaker 2>I Love Hawaii.</v>

4267
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go on vacation.</v>

4268
01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably going to die.</v>

4269
01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:27.420
<v Speaker 2>There it in the sense that like when I'm an old man,</v>

4270
01:49:27.421 --> 01:49:28.254
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to move there.</v>

4271
01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:29.423
<v Speaker 2>I never been there.</v>

4272
01:49:29.690 --> 01:49:30.523
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

4273
01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I love it best.</v>

4274
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:33.130
<v Speaker 2>And you know what tells me,</v>

4275
01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:36.510
<v Speaker 2>why don't we all go to tell me that they go there and the Hawaiians treat them</v>

4276
01:49:36.511 --> 01:49:38.010
<v Speaker 2>bad and that the Hawaiians are racist.</v>

4277
01:49:38.130 --> 01:49:39.020
<v Speaker 2>They're all cash back.</v>

4278
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I've never had that issue.</v>

4279
01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.850
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't be any friends.</v>

4280
01:49:41.851 --> 01:49:42.720

4283
01:49:44.881 --> 01:49:46.080
<v Speaker 2>And did you ever heard it's the best?</v>

4284
01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:46.740

<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

4361
01:51:59.590 --> 01:52:00.910
<v Speaker 2>all the fights in the WEC,</v>

4366
01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Cause he didn't give a fuck if you took him down.</v>

4367
01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:15.790
<v Speaker 2>So he would throw these nasty as head kicks and if you took him down,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's pretty good.</v>

4469
01:55:18.490 --> 01:55:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Ah Nah.</v>

4470
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:23.390

4471
01:55:23.391 --> 01:55:24.250
<v Speaker 3>He's not bossy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's like abroad.</v>

4476
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:31.280
<v Speaker 3>He's relaxed.</v>

4477
01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:32.960
<v Speaker 3>He's got his back just like a thick,</v>

4478
01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:34.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shut up.</v>

4479

<v Speaker 3>Looking for it again.</v>

4486
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:41.720
<v Speaker 3>It's special peppers and onions.</v>

4487
01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fucking hungry now.</v>

4488
01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.513
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

4489
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:45.563
<v Speaker 2>Let's go get it.</v>

4490
01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I was eating cheese and pickles in the back room.</v>

4491
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:49.291
<v Speaker 2>That's not good enough.</v>

4492
01:55:49.291 --> 01:55:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean I need meat.</v>

4493
01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.413
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>

4495
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we got some buffalo.</v>

4496
01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:55.553
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

4497
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Stand up Dan.</v>

4498
01:56:02.490 --> 01:56:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Patrick coattails.</v>

4499
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:04.650
<v Speaker 2>So game man.</v>

4500
01:56:04.651 --> 01:56:06.060
<v Speaker 2>He's so God damn game.</v>

4501
01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:13.020
<v Speaker 2>God Eddie in inside that shell hole.</v>

4502
01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:13.873
<v Speaker 2>I don't know</v>

4503
01:56:15.410 --> 01:56:19.980
<v Speaker 2>why he's kicking the fuck out of homeboy from San Diego on the ground.</v>

4504
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:21.163
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

4505
01:56:22.230 --> 01:56:22.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4506
01:56:22.590 --> 01:56:23.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4507
01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:24.153
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4508
01:56:24.450 --> 01:56:25.040
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

4509
01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:25.561
<v Speaker 2>That kid's name?</v>

4510
01:56:25.561 --> 01:56:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Black belt from Syria Jujitsu.</v>

4511
01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:32.800
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

4512
01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:32.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4513
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I know it's weird.</v>

4514
01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:33.721
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4515
01:56:33.721 --> 01:56:34.471
<v Speaker 2>we sent Jerry,</v>

4516
01:56:34.471 --> 01:56:35.304
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anymore.</v>

4517
01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:39.030
<v Speaker 2>He'd sent Jerry [inaudible] media.</v>

4518
01:56:39.031 --> 01:56:39.864
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to bait</v>

4519
01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:45.360
<v Speaker 2>everything we say because some God damn fake news title story.</v>

4520
01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.433
<v Speaker 2>Can they do.</v>

4521
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:49.501
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

4522
01:56:49.501 --> 01:56:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hating though.</v>

4523
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm friends with a lot of them are really good guys.</v>

4524
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:54.210
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them that are good.</v>

4525
01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:55.290
<v Speaker 2>Got Them Suck Dick.</v>

4526
01:56:55.291 --> 01:56:56.280
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are pretty cool.</v>

4527
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:59.160
<v Speaker 2>But you know when I feel like I really do feel like,</v>

4528
01:56:59.161 --> 01:57:00.270
<v Speaker 2>but I really do feel like this,</v>

4529
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:01.290
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the,</v>

4530
01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:06.070
<v Speaker 2>the animosity between MMA media and you and I and,</v>

4531
01:57:06.071 --> 01:57:10.620
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of other people would probably be solved if we were actually talking,</v>

4532
01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:15.300
<v Speaker 2>cause we would probably have a conversation that wasn't as one side of is</v>

4533
01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.280
<v Speaker 2>someone writing something shitty about you,</v>

4534
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:18.990
<v Speaker 2>you responding in a shitty way.</v>

4535
01:57:19.110 --> 01:57:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Someone writes something to you on Twitter or they was baseless communication.</v>

4536
01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.151
<v Speaker 2>It's face.</v>

4537
01:57:23.151 --> 01:57:23.984
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4538
01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also like you're not reading people's faces.</v>

4539
01:57:26.611 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 2>And so an issue with writing something,</v>

4540
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:28.851
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4541
01:57:28.851 --> 01:57:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Cause you write something about someone's opinion and there's a lot of</v>

4542
01:57:31.471 --> 01:57:32.220
<v Speaker 2>assumptions.</v>

4543
01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.240
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of you,</v>

4544
01:57:33.370 --> 01:57:33.661
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4545
01:57:33.661 --> 01:57:35.040
<v Speaker 2>you're not communicating with them.</v>

4546
01:57:35.041 --> 01:57:37.080
<v Speaker 2>But like if you and I have a dispute about something,</v>

4547
01:57:37.081 --> 01:57:37.231
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

4548
01:57:37.231 --> 01:57:37.711
<v Speaker 2>oh we've,</v>

4549
01:57:37.711 --> 01:57:39.000
<v Speaker 2>we've had arguments before,</v>

4550
01:57:39.001 --> 01:57:42.540
<v Speaker 2>but we are always resolved them cause we're both reasonable and we're friends</v>

4551
01:57:42.541 --> 01:57:43.950
<v Speaker 2>and we'd talk and we'd be friendly.</v>

4552
01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:47.790
<v Speaker 2>But if you just wrote a blog about me and I responded with a blog about you</v>

4553
01:57:47.791 --> 01:57:48.090
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

4554
01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:49.680
<v Speaker 2>we know each other forever and I love you,</v>

4555
01:57:49.681 --> 01:57:50.700
<v Speaker 2>but we'd probably be managed.</v>

4556
01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.860
<v Speaker 2>But the issue becomes if</v>

4557
01:57:58.170 --> 01:57:59.003
<v Speaker 2>Serrano,</v>

4558
01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:00.240
<v Speaker 2>he's not playing around,</v>

4559
01:58:00.241 --> 01:58:01.074
<v Speaker 2>he's not here and fun.</v>

4560
01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4561
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:02.700
<v Speaker 2>he's not hearing it.</v>

4562
01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Who he's ever about defense.</v>

4563
01:58:03.841 --> 01:58:04.081
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

4564
01:58:04.081 --> 01:58:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Kick to the bigger than he normally does.</v>

4565
01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:07.890
<v Speaker 2>He was very good with the articles.</v>

4566
01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

4567
01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:11.010
<v Speaker 2>what gets clicks is negativity or headlights.</v>

4568
01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:16.020
<v Speaker 2>He is point,</v>

4569
01:58:16.021 --> 01:58:16.854
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4570
01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:18.750
<v Speaker 2>But it's not,</v>

4571
01:58:18.810 --> 01:58:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I understand in some ways,</v>

4572
01:58:21.001 --> 01:58:22.350
<v Speaker 2>but because it's their job,</v>

4573
01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:27.440
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like it does as much damage to them as it does to the person they're</v>

4574
01:58:27.661 --> 01:58:28.500
<v Speaker 2>misrepresenting.</v>

4575
01:58:28.710 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 2>So if they write a story about you and they just,</v>

4576
01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:32.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

4577
01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:37.071
<v Speaker 2>those kicks are o and p Co Tej has to come back with one of his own man.</v>

4578
01:58:38.011 --> 01:58:38.790
<v Speaker 2>That's him.</v>

4579
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:39.361
<v Speaker 2>You know he's,</v>

4580
01:58:39.361 --> 01:58:41.950
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking game dues super game.</v>

4581
01:58:42.210 --> 01:58:43.043

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:45.760
<v Speaker 2>said Donald loves his size.</v>

4583

4585
01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:51.580
<v Speaker 2>It's the angle of fucking camera.</v>

4586
01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:53.020
<v Speaker 2>He can put her on these cameras.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>

02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:38.491
<v Speaker 2>I got sharp guys,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Come on down.</v>

4820
02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I like how Donald Switches stances too.</v>

4821
02:04:47.550 --> 02:04:49.170
<v Speaker 2>There are men and there's Donald's,</v>

4822
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Donald's Serone switches stances and it's not because he's injured.</v>

4823
02:04:52.621 --> 02:04:52.981
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

4824
02:04:52.981 --> 02:04:55.840
<v Speaker 2>because he's got so many variables in is a task.</v>

4825
02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Look at this kid can do all kinds of shit as attack.</v>

4826
02:04:58.590 --> 02:05:00.020
<v Speaker 2>He's a bass drum,</v>

4827
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:00.690
<v Speaker 2>head hunting.</v>

4828
02:05:00.690 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

4829
02:05:01.410 --> 02:05:01.561
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4830
02:05:01.561 --> 02:05:02.311
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely right.</v>

4831
02:05:02.311 --> 02:05:07.311
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting seeing him do that at 70 I think this is a good example of</v>

4832
02:05:07.351 --> 02:05:08.184
<v Speaker 2>a guy.</v>

4833
02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:08.821
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

4834
02:05:08.821 --> 02:05:10.530
<v Speaker 2>let's bring up Patrick Otay fought Tito,</v>

4835
02:05:10.531 --> 02:05:15.100
<v Speaker 2>would tease at two oh five and his UFC light heavyweight yen dropped him and</v>

4836
02:05:15.110 --> 02:05:18.660
<v Speaker 2>dropped an all time great light heavyweight in Chemo rts.</v>

4837
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:19.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4838
02:05:19.410 --> 02:05:20.340
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

4839
02:05:20.341 --> 02:05:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Donald Donald's Serone looks this is an argument for the point of diminishing</v>

4840
02:05:24.691 --> 02:05:26.220
<v Speaker 2>returns and weight cutting.</v>

4841
02:05:26.221 --> 02:05:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

4842
02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:26.880

02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:30.320
<v Speaker 2>We'll also drop them twice.</v>

4846
02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Argument for Donald's Raleigh being a bad mother fucker,</v>

4847
02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:35.250
<v Speaker 2>but we already knew that that was bad at anyway.</v>

4848
02:05:36.250 --> 02:05:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I think he's at home.</v>

4849
02:05:37.650 --> 02:05:38.560
<v Speaker 2>He's both from the looks.</v>

4850
02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4851
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:40.220

<v Speaker 2>He's healthy.</v>

4856
02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:50.430
<v Speaker 2>He was one 76 when I was talking to him.</v>

4857
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:50.661
<v Speaker 2>He's saying,</v>

4858
02:05:50.661 --> 02:05:52.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only six pound weight cut.</v>

4859

4862
02:05:55.050 --> 02:05:55.883
<v Speaker 2>It really hurts them.</v>

4863

<v Speaker 2>Connor can't make 45 anymore.</v>

4864

<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>

4898
02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

4899
02:06:56.611 --> 02:06:57.780
<v Speaker 2>He has a granite chin.</v>

4900
02:06:57.781 --> 02:06:59.010
<v Speaker 2>He's known for his chin,</v>

4901
02:06:59.040 --> 02:06:59.873
<v Speaker 2>known for his chin.</v>

4902
02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Got Damn Donald's running.</v>

4903
02:07:01.461 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Look good.</v>

4904
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:02.371

4905
02:07:02.371 --> 02:07:03.204
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad man.</v>

4906
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Look at that left hook.</v>

4907
02:07:04.651 --> 02:07:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Left Hook was landing in the pocket and not taking any shots.</v>

4908
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:10.830
<v Speaker 2>What hard punches did he take in this fight?</v>

4909
02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:11.730
<v Speaker 2>He's just too quick.</v>

4910
02:07:12.630 --> 02:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Too quick for these candidates.</v>

4911
02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Not just two quick fucking healthy bro.</v>

4912
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:17.690
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking hell.</v>

4913
02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:20.040
<v Speaker 2>I am going to be that fucking form guy.</v>

4914
02:07:20.190 --> 02:07:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine Donald versus Wonderboy and Donald's?</v>

4915
02:07:23.190 --> 02:07:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Donald's our friends.</v>

4916
02:07:24.121 --> 02:07:24.954
<v Speaker 2>So it's fucking</v>

4917
02:07:28.230 --> 02:07:29.070
<v Speaker 2>jacking off to him.</v>

4918
02:07:29.071 --> 02:07:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Brian has sent him the way you yet there.</v>

4919
02:07:31.561 --> 02:07:32.750
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not in your best interest.</v>

4920
02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I just like no did.</v>

4921
02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:36.393
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the,</v>

4922
02:07:36.570 --> 02:07:38.500
<v Speaker 2>what's that guy that Howard Dean's like the Howard Dean?</v>

4923
02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:39.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4924
02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:46.023
<v Speaker 2>What did I do?</v>

4925
02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.390
<v Speaker 2>One drink.</v>

4926
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Too many mistakes.</v>

4927
02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:02.110
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like he's watching somebody fucking going.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4929
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4930
02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:07.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's got an audition and he's never had an audition before and they go</v>

4931
02:08:07.361 --> 02:08:08.194
<v Speaker 2>action and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4933
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:12.730
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy goes a great stuff.</v>

4934
02:08:12.731 --> 02:08:13.564

<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones.</v>

4944
02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of high as fuck John Fucking Jones was pulled up better.</v>

4945
02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4946

<v Speaker 2>here's the thing for the main event,</v>

4947
02:08:37.781 --> 02:08:38.031
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 2>here's a out of respect.</v>

4950
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about this.</v>

4951
02:08:41.411 --> 02:08:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4952
02:08:41.770 --> 02:08:43.360
<v Speaker 2>this UFC 200 things,</v>

4953
02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:44.740
<v Speaker 2>the mock lesson or thing,</v>

4954
02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:45.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4955
02:08:45.581 --> 02:08:46.061
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing,</v>

4956
02:08:46.061 --> 02:08:48.790
<v Speaker 2>because MMA media loves to write stories about this stuff.</v>

4957
02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of aerial.</v>

4958
02:08:50.561 --> 02:08:51.131
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii's,</v>

4959
02:08:51.131 --> 02:08:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I'd like Ariel Helwani when I was telling him that,</v>

4960
02:08:53.230 --> 02:08:55.270
<v Speaker 2>what was told to me about the UFC,</v>

4961
02:08:55.271 --> 02:08:56.104
<v Speaker 2>about the leak,</v>

4962
02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:57.003
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4963
02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>

4964
02:08:58.390 --> 02:09:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't not like Ariel Helwani.</v>

4965
02:09:00.610 --> 02:09:01.780
<v Speaker 2>He's always been a nice guy to me.</v>

4966
02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:02.943
<v Speaker 2>I liked him.</v>

4967
02:09:03.190 --> 02:09:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I was just simply stating what I was told,</v>

4968
02:09:06.150 --> 02:09:06.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4969
02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:07.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4970
02:09:07.091 --> 02:09:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4971
02:09:07.690 --> 02:09:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about these big promos.</v>

4972
02:09:10.061 --> 02:09:13.540
<v Speaker 2>You know what I care that Brock Lesnar is gonna Fight Mark Hunt.</v>

4973
02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if I heard it from my mom.</v>

4974
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:16.570
<v Speaker 2>My mom called me up,</v>

4975
02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:17.860
<v Speaker 2>but I worked for the UFC.</v>

4976
02:09:17.861 --> 02:09:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't find out until I was sitting there doing commentary and I didn't give a</v>

4977
02:09:21.971 --> 02:09:22.360
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

4978
02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:26.110
<v Speaker 2>If I had found out because of Ariel Helwani story instead of the UFC,</v>

4979
02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have given a fuck.</v>

4980
02:09:28.001 --> 02:09:30.610
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't have been any less valuable to me.</v>

4981
02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you something as a,</v>

4982
02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:34.630
<v Speaker 2>as a guy who's on the inside,</v>

4983
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:39.870
<v Speaker 2>why would Brock Lesnar take a guy like Mark Hunt on his first fight?</v>

4984
02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll think get a choice.</v>

4985
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make any sense.</v>

4986
02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:43.373
<v Speaker 2>Choice.</v>

4987
02:09:43.450 --> 02:09:44.283
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

4988
02:09:44.570 --> 02:09:48.730
<v Speaker 2>In some going to give them Josh Barnett won the fight and you'd fucking wrap</v>

4989
02:09:48.731 --> 02:09:49.510
<v Speaker 2>them into could,</v>

4990
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:50.770
<v Speaker 2>it could be that,</v>

4991
02:09:51.010 --> 02:09:52.060
<v Speaker 2>well Jesus Christ,</v>

4992
02:09:52.061 --> 02:09:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

4993
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I would almost like to see Josh Barnett more pro wrestling that barn.</v>

4994
02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:59.260
<v Speaker 2>It wanted to fight,</v>

4995
02:09:59.261 --> 02:10:00.160
<v Speaker 2>promoted for the fight.</v>

4996
02:10:00.161 --> 02:10:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Did he give it to it?</v>

4997
02:10:00.890 --> 02:10:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Is the many of reasons.</v>

4998
02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

4999
02:10:02.410 --> 02:10:02.771
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5000
02:10:02.771 --> 02:10:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

5001
02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

5002
02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:05.740
<v Speaker 2>if I'm talking to Dana has pressed,</v>

5003
02:10:05.741 --> 02:10:06.574
<v Speaker 2>I'd be hard pressed.</v>

5004
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I'd be hard pressed to pass.</v>

5005
02:10:08.231 --> 02:10:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett's offer hunt is going to like,</v>

5006
02:10:10.331 --> 02:10:10.990
<v Speaker 2>hey bitch,</v>

5007

5009
02:10:14.711 --> 02:10:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something,</v>

5010
02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:15.821
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5011
02:10:15.821 --> 02:10:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett is not a fucking easy fight for saying he is Barnett's a fucking</v>

5012
02:10:19.721 --> 02:10:20.351
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>

5013
02:10:20.351 --> 02:10:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying hunt isn't a cakewalk.</v>

5014
02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:23.801
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5015
02:10:23.801 --> 02:10:24.041
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5016
02:10:24.041 --> 02:10:24.251
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5017
02:10:24.251 --> 02:10:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Neither guy that can wrestle.</v>

5018
02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:26.853
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

5019
02:10:26.890 --> 02:10:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what cut can't.</v>

5020
02:10:28.090 --> 02:10:28.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5021
02:10:28.301 --> 02:10:33.301
<v Speaker 2>but Bob Brock Lesnar is a fucking genuine NCAA two times 96 but he's still a</v>

5022
02:10:36.111 --> 02:10:38.240
<v Speaker 2>fucking gorilla wrestler.</v>

5023
02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:39.950
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't fought and how long?</v>

5024
02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:40.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>

5025
02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:41.960
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge point.</v>

5026
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5027

5034
02:10:58.210 --> 02:11:02.390
<v Speaker 2>You never see passionate about take turns to 70 think about the cool fight to 70</v>

02:12:44.301 --> 02:12:48.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a famous thing and I don't believe I've ever listened to a whole one.</v>

02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:49.341

<v Speaker 2>let's break this down.</v>

5130
02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Brendan Shop,</v>

5131
02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo and Brian.</v>

5132
02:13:01.791 --> 02:13:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Model Oregon crone.</v>

5133
02:13:03.190 --> 02:13:04.130
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys think?</v>

5134
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with Brian.</v>

5135
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.451
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

5136
02:13:05.451 --> 02:13:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Maine,</v>

5137
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:06.591
<v Speaker 2>what do I say?</v>

5138
02:13:06.591 --> 02:13:07.424
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

5139
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:08.263
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5140
02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:09.740
<v Speaker 2>look it.</v>

5141
02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

5142
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:12.853
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

5143
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:13.730
<v Speaker 2>There's no problems.</v>

5144
02:13:13.730 --> 02:13:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Rory.</v>

5145
02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:15.050
<v Speaker 2>He's trained,</v>

5146
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:16.940
<v Speaker 2>trained with Wonderboy.</v>

5147
02:13:17.970 --> 02:13:18.850
<v Speaker 2>He alive.</v>

5148
02:13:19.260 --> 02:13:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not [inaudible] let me finish.</v>

5149
02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:31.530
<v Speaker 2>If Rory Rory gives him space,</v>

5150
02:13:31.531 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a</v>

5151
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:32.843
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>

5152
02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:36.120
<v Speaker 1>If Rory stays in boxing wrestling distance,</v>

5153
02:13:36.150 --> 02:13:36.931
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be,</v>

5154
02:13:36.931 --> 02:13:38.010
<v Speaker 1>he's going to win this fight.</v>

5155
02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:40.230
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if you can do that now.</v>

5156
02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can do that with Kevin,</v>

5157
02:13:41.650 --> 02:13:42.483
<v Speaker 1>with Wonderboy.</v>

5158
02:13:42.630 --> 02:13:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy may have figured out distance you want to be,</v>

5159
02:13:45.001 --> 02:13:49.010
<v Speaker 1>may have figured out how to keep a gun in a way to close to close back here.</v>

5160
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Let me hear what Brendan,</v>

5161
02:13:51.331 --> 02:13:51.790
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

5162
02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll take here what,</v>

5163
02:13:53.221 --> 02:13:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Brendan,</v>

5164
02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:53.760
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

5165
02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll get to you next.</v>

5166
02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear what your employee has too many tools.</v>

5167
02:13:56.611 --> 02:13:58.640
<v Speaker 1>He's too smart and he's a,</v>

5168
02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:01.280
<v Speaker 1>they've trained together before it Tristar and for us help,</v>

5169
02:14:01.550 --> 02:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5170
02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy out a bunch.</v>

5171
02:14:02.851 --> 02:14:06.570
<v Speaker 1>So they know his tricks and I think Roy wins this fight and it's good for the</v>

5172
02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:10.170
<v Speaker 1>sport because he's a free agent and he'd go test the free market waters.</v>

5173
02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:11.880
<v Speaker 1>So it changes the sport for the good.</v>

5174
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

5175
02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:12.721
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

5176
02:14:12.721 --> 02:14:15.900
<v Speaker 1>probably you think it's too close to call?</v>

5177
02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:16.913
<v Speaker 1>That's why we should bet.</v>

5178
02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:18.320
<v Speaker 1>But if I had a,</v>

5179
02:14:18.321 --> 02:14:19.650
<v Speaker 1>if I had a gun to my head,</v>

5180
02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I would go with,</v>

5181
02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you're right on paper.</v>

5182
02:14:24.061 --> 02:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>You're right Roy,</v>

5183
02:14:25.241 --> 02:14:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you make too many tools,</v>

5184
02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:29.460
<v Speaker 1>but because he can just strike in Russell,</v>

5185
02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Thompson,</v>

5186
02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:33.510
<v Speaker 1>he's just so quick coming in and out.</v>

5187
02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:34.793
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna just,</v>

5188
02:14:35.190 --> 02:14:36.420
<v Speaker 1>just with that kind of shit,</v>

5189
02:14:36.421 --> 02:14:37.350
<v Speaker 1>this is explosive.</v>

5190
02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So difficult cause [inaudible] go with that just for a goof.</v>

5191
02:14:40.051 --> 02:14:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Volta analysts picked Wonderboy on UFC tonight.</v>

5192
02:14:43.081 --> 02:14:43.470
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

5193
02:14:43.470 --> 02:14:44.210
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

5194
02:14:44.210 --> 02:14:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like wonder boy has been hit before.</v>

5195
02:14:46.831 --> 02:14:48.270
<v Speaker 1>It didn't Ellenberger tag him.</v>

5196
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes he did.</v>

5197
02:14:49.531 --> 02:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5198
02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:49.721
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

5199
02:14:49.721 --> 02:14:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Matt Brown.</v>

5200
02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:51.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5201
02:14:51.151 --> 02:14:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Matt Brown.</v>

5202
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Well Matt Brown was a,</v>

5203
02:14:54.110 --> 02:14:54.780
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

5204
02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but in his words,</v>

5205
02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:59.040
<v Speaker 1>he said that he was overtrained going into that fight and then he made some</v>

5206
02:14:59.041 --> 02:15:00.710
<v Speaker 1>mistakes or we all and uh,</v>

5207
02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

5208
02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:02.730
<v Speaker 1>it's totally possible that's truth.</v>

5209
02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:07.730
<v Speaker 1>But he also fought Matt motherfucking Brown and you might feel like you got</v>

5210
02:15:08.130 --> 02:15:10.860
<v Speaker 1>overtrained if you fight Matt Motherfuck,</v>

5211
02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:12.420
<v Speaker 1>that pressure son Matt Brown,</v>

5212
02:15:12.421 --> 02:15:15.270
<v Speaker 1>we'll put some pressure on you and you'd be looking for solutions is a mortal.</v>

5213
02:15:15.271 --> 02:15:20.010
<v Speaker 1>He takes you to a dark place and dark place before you might think,</v>

5214
02:15:20.011 --> 02:15:20.211
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5215
02:15:20.211 --> 02:15:20.320
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5216
02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to poison my fucking soup 100% not bitch.</v>

5217
02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:28.200
<v Speaker 1>That's not Matt Brown Cardio Cardio,</v>

5218
02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:33.860
<v Speaker 1>beating that ass and draining in a way that only a dude who's died and been</v>

5219
02:15:33.931 --> 02:15:38.670
<v Speaker 1>brought back to life by emps can do for Ruby size clothes because to him and</v>

5220
02:15:38.671 --> 02:15:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Donald came that pain.</v>

5221
02:15:39.721 --> 02:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Besides Carl's comment,</v>

5222
02:15:40.650 --> 02:15:41.820
<v Speaker 1>when he was really young,</v>

5223
02:15:41.970 --> 02:15:46.600
<v Speaker 1>the only person Rory Macdonald's lost who I believe is Robbie Lawler.</v>

5224
02:15:46.650 --> 02:15:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Am I right?</v>

5225
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Call callers conduct you list Robbie Lawler.</v>

5226
02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:50.153
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5227
02:15:50.190 --> 02:15:50.880
<v Speaker 1>That I can,</v>

5228
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:51.601
<v Speaker 1>and he was beating.</v>

5229
02:15:51.601 --> 02:15:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Who else can call his conduct?</v>

5230
02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Bring that kind of darkness.</v>

5231
02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Court McGee coordinate well,</v>

5232
02:15:56.671 --> 02:15:56.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5233
02:15:56.881 --> 02:15:57.714
<v Speaker 1>he brings,</v>

5234
02:15:58.620 --> 02:15:59.940
<v Speaker 1>she brings that same dark.</v>

5235
02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:02.380
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about that touch of death done was such a death.</v>

5236
02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:03.793
<v Speaker 1>There's data,</v>

5237
02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:07.530
<v Speaker 1>there's fucking this mortal Matt Brown and there's Court Mcgee.</v>

5238
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Mcgee might lose some fights and he's a very,</v>

5239
02:16:09.691 --> 02:16:10.321
<v Speaker 1>very tough guy,</v>

5240
02:16:10.321 --> 02:16:11.071
<v Speaker 1>but he's in a very,</v>

5241
02:16:11.071 --> 02:16:13.800
<v Speaker 1>very difficult division with a lot of very tough guys,</v>

5242
02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:18.510
<v Speaker 1>but there's a darkness to court brings when he starts beating that ass dark too.</v>

5243
02:16:18.650 --> 02:16:22.560
<v Speaker 1>He beats that ass in a very fucking animalistic clinical way,</v>

5244
02:16:22.561 --> 02:16:26.100
<v Speaker 1>like a technical clinical way where he's seen the edge because he has a</v>

5245
02:16:26.101 --> 02:16:27.610
<v Speaker 1>technique from the grim reaper he's got,</v>

5246
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>he's been to the edge of time for real.</v>

5247
02:16:29.711 --> 02:16:30.730
<v Speaker 1>They both have come back.</v>

5248
02:16:30.731 --> 02:16:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Him and Matt Brown.</v>

5249
02:16:31.630 --> 02:16:32.201
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

5250
02:16:32.201 --> 02:16:34.060
<v Speaker 1>they carry with them some Harry Potter Shit.</v>

5251
02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

5252
02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Frighteners in this bitch.</v>

5253
02:16:37.301 --> 02:16:39.910
<v Speaker 1>This is why this could never be on television.</v>

5254
02:16:39.911 --> 02:16:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Ever understand folks?</v>

5255
02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>

5256
02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:45.460
<v Speaker 1>I haven't made a call yet.</v>

5257
02:16:45.550 --> 02:16:46.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go.</v>

5258
02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5259
02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:48.011
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

5260
02:16:48.011 --> 02:16:48.580
<v Speaker 1>can I say,</v>

5261
02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:49.413
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5262
02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I think I agree with you guys that if you looked at it on paper,</v>

5263
02:16:53.351 --> 02:16:54.860
<v Speaker 1>brewery is a,</v>

5264
02:16:54.900 --> 02:16:59.350
<v Speaker 1>he's a more difficult challenge because he has more tools and he can knock guys</v>

5265
02:16:59.351 --> 02:17:00.041
<v Speaker 1>out that are legit.</v>

5266
02:17:00.041 --> 02:17:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Strikers like Terex happening.</v>

5267
02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:03.020
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to tech staff.</v>

5268
02:17:03.021 --> 02:17:05.800
<v Speaker 1>And he was big because Safa deans or like a very,</v>

5269
02:17:05.801 --> 02:17:09.610
<v Speaker 1>very skillful striker and Safford Dean ran a clinic on Nate Marquardt to when</v>

5270
02:17:09.611 --> 02:17:13.510
<v Speaker 1>the Strikeforce welterweight title is a clinic clinic of leg kicks and technique</v>

5271
02:17:13.511 --> 02:17:14.230
<v Speaker 1>and footwork.</v>

5272
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:15.430
<v Speaker 1>He's really good striker.</v>

5273
02:17:15.850 --> 02:17:19.570
<v Speaker 1>So for Rory did not came out the way he did is pretty stunning and it's Roy's</v>

5274
02:17:19.571 --> 02:17:22.660
<v Speaker 1>interchanges between wrestling and striking the can make a big difference in</v>

5275
02:17:22.661 --> 02:17:27.550
<v Speaker 1>this fight because Roy's fluid in that where as Stephen Wonderboy Thompson,</v>

5276
02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:31.120
<v Speaker 1>unless he figures out a way to put Roy on his back early and shake him up the</v>

5277
02:17:31.121 --> 02:17:32.200
<v Speaker 1>way boats he tried to do.</v>

5278
02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:36.190
<v Speaker 1>But the danger with that is Rory has a wicked fucking guard.</v>

5279
02:17:36.191 --> 02:17:37.900
<v Speaker 1>He's fast off of his back.</v>

5280
02:17:38.050 --> 02:17:41.530
<v Speaker 1>He moves quick and he tries to set up sweeps and all my plot this,</v>

5281
02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:42.530
<v Speaker 1>we went to draw meditech.</v>

5282
02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5283
02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:45.160
<v Speaker 1>And you might not have seen it before,</v>

5284
02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:47.920
<v Speaker 1>but it is legit as fuck.</v>

5285
02:17:47.921 --> 02:17:50.800
<v Speaker 1>He went to a draw with JT Torres.</v>

5286
02:17:51.250 --> 02:17:51.581
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

5287
02:17:51.581 --> 02:17:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

5288
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand folks?</v>

5289
02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean don't understand like this is like the top of the food chain Brazilian</v>

5290
02:17:59.081 --> 02:18:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu competitors.</v>

5291
02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:01.410
<v Speaker 1>He's a killer.</v>

5292
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:02.680
<v Speaker 1>He's in that breed.</v>

5293
02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:04.900
<v Speaker 1>So homeland,</v>

5294
02:18:05.170 --> 02:18:05.830
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

5295
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So Roy McDonald can go to the ground at that high of a level and survive without</v>

5296
02:18:10.871 --> 02:18:11.340
<v Speaker 1>getting tapped.</v>

5297
02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:11.951
<v Speaker 1>They're really close.</v>

5298
02:18:11.951 --> 02:18:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Kin tapped his arm,</v>

5299
02:18:13.071 --> 02:18:13.904
<v Speaker 1>got jacked up,</v>

5300
02:18:14.530 --> 02:18:16.960
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't get in trouble or his arm is fucked.</v>

5301
02:18:16.961 --> 02:18:19.090
<v Speaker 1>He was saying we're fucked and he had a fight like three weeks later.</v>

5302
02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:21.610
<v Speaker 1>He's a mad band.</v>

5303
02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:23.470
<v Speaker 1>He's also the Canadian serial killer.</v>

5304
02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:24.041
<v Speaker 1>But Dude,</v>

5305
02:18:24.041 --> 02:18:24.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

5306
02:18:24.551 --> 02:18:24.911
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5307
02:18:24.911 --> 02:18:29.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that came about him being on my podcast is people got to</v>

5308
02:18:29.081 --> 02:18:32.500
<v Speaker 1>really understand your only CNM in his game face.</v>

5309
02:18:32.550 --> 02:18:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5310
02:18:32.630 --> 02:18:32.850
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

5311
02:18:32.850 --> 02:18:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5312
02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:33.490
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

5313
02:18:33.490 --> 02:18:34.990
<v Speaker 1>He seems like he's a psycho.</v>

5314
02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:36.670
<v Speaker 1>But when he was on the podcast,</v>

5315
02:18:36.690 --> 02:18:37.523
<v Speaker 1>Larry's,</v>

5316
02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:39.220
<v Speaker 1>when he was on this podcast,</v>

5317
02:18:39.490 --> 02:18:43.240
<v Speaker 1>people got a chance to see him like as an actual person and they're like,</v>

5318
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.721
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5319
02:18:43.721 --> 02:18:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I've only been seeing you when you're competing now.</v>

5320
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.350
<v Speaker 1>He's the bad dude.</v>

5321
02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:49.410
<v Speaker 1>What do some great,</v>

5322
02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:50.420
<v Speaker 1>nice sense of humor.</v>

5323
02:18:52.270 --> 02:18:53.700
<v Speaker 1>This is a perfect example.</v>

5324
02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:54.910
<v Speaker 1>What we were talking about.</v>

5325
02:18:54.911 --> 02:18:56.320
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about with Connor.</v>

5326
02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:58.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy that should be applauded.</v>

5327
02:18:58.301 --> 02:19:00.640
<v Speaker 1>He is a fucking intelligent,</v>

5328
02:19:00.730 --> 02:19:01.391
<v Speaker 1>savvy.</v>

5329
02:19:01.391 --> 02:19:02.151
<v Speaker 1>There's a superstar,</v>

5330
02:19:02.151 --> 02:19:02.591
<v Speaker 1>has number one,</v>

5331
02:19:02.591 --> 02:19:02.890
<v Speaker 1>a bell,</v>

5332
02:19:02.890 --> 02:19:04.190
<v Speaker 1>exact face of cancer.</v>

5333
02:19:04.191 --> 02:19:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Exact number one close still.</v>

5334
02:19:07.050 --> 02:19:07.883
<v Speaker 1>Then when the bell</v>

5335
02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:11.320
<v Speaker 1>say dicker down,</v>

5336
02:19:11.590 --> 02:19:14.350
<v Speaker 1>that came from him at the time I was single.</v>

5337
02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:15.460
<v Speaker 1>She was single.</v>

5338
02:19:15.490 --> 02:19:16.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of girls in Vegas.</v>

5339
02:19:16.571 --> 02:19:17.260
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5340
02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:19.990
<v Speaker 1>it's time to separate that mother hand from the goose and take them down.</v>

5341
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5342
02:19:22.331 --> 02:19:23.200
<v Speaker 1>he's tall,</v>

5343
02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:24.073
<v Speaker 1>tall</v>

5344
02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 1>and I had to write it into my phone to remember the</v>

5345
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.670
<v Speaker 2>next morning.</v>

5346
02:19:28.670 --> 02:19:31.240
<v Speaker 2>He's an animal that's other hands.</v>

5347
02:19:31.270 --> 02:19:33.190
<v Speaker 2>There was one girl like taking Google.</v>

5348
02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:34.730
<v Speaker 2>That's a funny piece of advice.</v>

5349
02:19:34.731 --> 02:19:35.141
<v Speaker 2>He's good.</v>

5350
02:19:35.141 --> 02:19:35.811
<v Speaker 2>He's the best.</v>

5351
02:19:35.811 --> 02:19:37.430
<v Speaker 2>He's his nose looks different.</v>

5352
02:19:37.470 --> 02:19:37.810
<v Speaker 2>He sold,</v>

5353
02:19:37.810 --> 02:19:39.190
<v Speaker 2>he's talking to a lot of shots,</v>

5354
02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:39.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5355
02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:40.461
<v Speaker 2>Robbie Lawler fight.</v>

5356
02:19:40.461 --> 02:19:41.530
<v Speaker 2>He got his nose destroyed.</v>

5357
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:43.310
<v Speaker 2>You mean wonder man?</v>

5358
02:19:43.311 --> 02:19:45.320
<v Speaker 2>He's 33 he's a really good dude,</v>

5359
02:19:45.321 --> 02:19:45.680
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5360
02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:46.700
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good dude.</v>

5361
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan.</v>

5362
02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:48.853
<v Speaker 2>They're both great guys.</v>

5363
02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Good guys.</v>

5364
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:50.630
<v Speaker 2>You know both of them pretty well,</v>

5365
02:19:50.631 --> 02:19:50.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5366
02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:51.321
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

5367
02:19:51.321 --> 02:19:52.610
<v Speaker 2>really well trained partners for a long time,</v>

5368
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.500
<v Speaker 2>but Roy McDonald,</v>

5369
02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:56.210
<v Speaker 2>just for the good of the sport.</v>

5370
02:19:56.211 --> 02:19:57.800
<v Speaker 2>If he rent and testis free agency,</v>

5371
02:19:57.801 --> 02:19:59.240
<v Speaker 2>it helps to grow the sport.</v>

5372
02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:00.890
<v Speaker 2>But let me just say this about Wonderboy.</v>

5373
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy is extraordinary and in his ability to close the distance and land</v>

5374
02:20:05.661 --> 02:20:08.960
<v Speaker 2>these like thunderous shots out of nowhere of the best in the world.</v>

5375
02:20:08.961 --> 02:20:13.790
<v Speaker 2>These combinations are so fluid that they're enough for him to land one or two</v>

5376
02:20:13.791 --> 02:20:15.410
<v Speaker 2>hard shots every exchange.</v>

5377
02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.570
<v Speaker 2>And if he does that,</v>

5378
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:22.660
<v Speaker 2>if he somehow or another can tempt Rory into some hypnotic dance,</v>

5379
02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:23.631
<v Speaker 2>Jude,</v>

5380
02:20:23.631 --> 02:20:25.280
<v Speaker 2>some high level shit on him,</v>

5381
02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:29.150
<v Speaker 2>it's all in his ability to have stuff to take down if he feels super confident</v>

5382
02:20:29.151 --> 02:20:29.984
<v Speaker 2>in his ability stuff,</v>

5383
02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:30.650
<v Speaker 2>takedown.</v>

5384
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Cause he'd been training with Weidman so much,</v>

5385
02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:33.300
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't been training with</v>

5386
02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:36.960
<v Speaker 2>fire but it may,</v>

5387
02:20:36.961 --> 02:20:38.510
<v Speaker 2>but it made a big difference.</v>

5388
02:20:38.511 --> 02:20:39.344
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy,</v>

5389
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy is going to win this fight.</v>

5390
02:20:40.491 --> 02:20:43.790
<v Speaker 2>His understanding of how to stuff takedowns his stuff,</v>

5391
02:20:43.850 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 2>his takedowns stuffing is at a very high level.</v>

5392
02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:49.670
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely has something to do a training with Weidman.</v>

5393
02:20:49.671 --> 02:20:53.420
<v Speaker 2>But it's not saying that he's so silly that he would substitute that and not</v>

5394
02:20:53.421 --> 02:20:55.250
<v Speaker 2>have a high level wrestler test him.</v>

5395
02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:56.353
<v Speaker 2>He's not dumb.</v>

5396
02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:57.590
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy.</v>

5397
02:20:57.630 --> 02:20:58.280
<v Speaker 2>So is his dad,</v>

5398
02:20:58.280 --> 02:20:58.820
<v Speaker 2>if I can call it.</v>

5399
02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I think Roy eats his lunch.</v>

5400
02:21:00.860 --> 02:21:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I think I love 100% I am 100% 50 50 on this fight.</v>

5401
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:10.700
<v Speaker 2>100% just for just to be controversial because you know how I am guys.</v>

5402
02:21:10.970 --> 02:21:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling me.</v>

5403
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Are you a rebel Wonderboy?</v>

5404
02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy by knocked out Brian kick knock out.</v>

5405
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Well Roy and if there's any,</v>

5406
02:21:20.670 --> 02:21:22.040
<v Speaker 2>if there's anybody can knock him out.</v>

5407
02:21:22.041 --> 02:21:23.770
<v Speaker 2>It's roaring and keeps its Wonderboy.</v>

5408
02:21:23.810 --> 02:21:25.820
<v Speaker 2>If people get mad at me being noncommittal,</v>

5409
02:21:25.821 --> 02:21:29.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not because I like both of these gentlemen and it's really honestly because</v>

5410
02:21:29.271 --> 02:21:31.460
<v Speaker 2>this sport is so fucking crazy</v>

5411
02:21:35.170 --> 02:21:36.170
<v Speaker 2>being knocked out.</v>

5412
02:21:36.171 --> 02:21:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Luke Rockhold on my first,</v>

5413
02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:39.800
<v Speaker 2>my baby fell asleep.</v>

5414
02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I finally pumps it first.</v>

5415
02:21:41.901 --> 02:21:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I remember I put them asleep.</v>

5416
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Mike knocks him out.</v>

5417
02:21:44.181 --> 02:21:45.180
<v Speaker 2>I love my good buddy.</v>

5418
02:21:45.181 --> 02:21:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

5419
02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit are crying.</v>

5420
02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck mine.</v>

5421
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:51.300
<v Speaker 2>I even texted him that you woke up my kid,</v>

5422
02:21:51.301 --> 02:21:52.134
<v Speaker 2>but it's worth it.</v>

5423
02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:57.570
<v Speaker 2>That's how I fucking crying when when Bisbing one I felt like crying 10 fucking</v>

5424
02:21:58.131 --> 02:21:58.370
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

5425
02:21:58.370 --> 02:21:59.030
<v Speaker 2>It was happy for him.</v>

5426
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I wish he had.</v>

5427
02:21:59.790 --> 02:22:04.160
<v Speaker 2>I wish she hadn't gotten on on top of the fence and gotten fuck you.</v>

5428
02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:09.240
<v Speaker 2>That was whatever the guy he was on a roller coaster ride</v>

5429
02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:14.000
<v Speaker 2>him winning the fight and winning the world title like that.</v>

5430
02:22:14.001 --> 02:22:15.500
<v Speaker 2>You can't fault him for that.</v>

5431
02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Talk to him when the dust settles.</v>

5432
02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Talked to him on Monday and he's barely,</v>

5433
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:20.361
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

5434
02:22:20.361 --> 02:22:24.410
<v Speaker 2>back to Michael Bisping Dennison to UFC title.</v>

5435
02:22:24.411 --> 02:22:25.244
<v Speaker 2>They both walk.</v>

5436
02:22:25.470 --> 02:22:28.470
<v Speaker 2>It's the best story of all time.</v>

5437
02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I never seen a knockout like that.</v>

5438
02:22:30.210 --> 02:22:30.631
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

5439
02:22:30.631 --> 02:22:31.464
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

5440
02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:32.131
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

5441
02:22:32.131 --> 02:22:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

5442
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

5443
02:22:33.450 --> 02:22:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the question.</v>

5444
02:22:34.471 --> 02:22:35.101
<v Speaker 2>Here's the question.</v>

5445
02:22:35.101 --> 02:22:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Can Rory threaten him enough?</v>

5446
02:22:36.901 --> 02:22:39.770
<v Speaker 2>We'd take towns to get him off of his game of strike.</v>

5447
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:40.663
<v Speaker 2>You can kick too.</v>

5448
02:22:41.010 --> 02:22:44.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't like how course Wonderboy is coming to them or does Roy decide that all</v>

5449
02:22:44.551 --> 02:22:47.850
<v Speaker 2>that training with Raymond Daniels has made him comfortable enough with it,</v>

5450
02:22:47.851 --> 02:22:52.380
<v Speaker 2>a legit high level karate striker that he thinks he can look at the sideways.</v>

5451
02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:53.220
<v Speaker 2>He's just sideways.</v>

5452
02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:54.241
<v Speaker 2>Rory smart.</v>

5453
02:22:54.241 --> 02:22:54.731
<v Speaker 2>The haunt.</v>

5454
02:22:54.731 --> 02:22:55.260
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

5455
02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:55.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5456
02:22:55.411 --> 02:22:57.330
<v Speaker 2>he's Daniel's fight sideways too,</v>

5457
02:22:57.331 --> 02:23:00.750
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the interesting things because Thompson is one of the few guys</v>

5458
02:23:00.751 --> 02:23:02.190
<v Speaker 2>that can pull off that stance.</v>

5459
02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a total front leg side kick.</v>

5460
02:23:04.591 --> 02:23:07.170
<v Speaker 2>You know where in front of like Brown and na,</v>

5461
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:08.790
<v Speaker 2>but Liotta doesn't do it as good as him.</v>

5462
02:23:08.830 --> 02:23:09.890
<v Speaker 2>She used to back in the day.</v>

5463
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Justin Scoggins does it very well.</v>

5464
02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:13.560
<v Speaker 2>That flyway kid.</v>

5465
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5466
02:23:13.921 --> 02:23:15.060
<v Speaker 2>he does it very well.</v>

5467
02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5468
02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:16.050
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

5469
02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:17.890
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the maybe the best at it.</v>

5470
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Be the best next to him.</v>

5471
02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Better moves.</v>

5472
02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic moves like a fucking,</v>

5473
02:23:21.790 --> 02:23:23.490
<v Speaker 2>he's a high level kid.</v>

5474
02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:25.170
<v Speaker 2>That's got a lot of potential,</v>

5475
02:23:25.410 --> 02:23:29.850
<v Speaker 2>but if you can pull that stance off and control with that front leg like a jab,</v>

5476
02:23:29.970 --> 02:23:31.790
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of guys that aren't ready for that.</v>

5477
02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:36.480
<v Speaker 2>That fucking left leg is wound up for him to see when Valtellina fought Raymond</v>

5478
02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:36.481
<v Speaker 2>Daniels,</v>

5479
02:23:36.481 --> 02:23:41.060
<v Speaker 2>what do [inaudible] fuck?</v>

5480
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh my sneaky fucker.</v>

5481
02:23:45.300 --> 02:23:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Introduction of danger.</v>

5482
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Introduction with danger.</v>

5483
02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:49.920
<v Speaker 2>He's so smart.</v>

5484
02:23:49.980 --> 02:23:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I roll.</v>

5485
02:23:51.330 --> 02:23:52.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like being in the very,</v>

5486
02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:53.340
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>

5487
02:23:53.341 --> 02:23:54.240
<v Speaker 2>He's a killer man.</v>

5488
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Tristar.</v>

5489
02:23:56.250 --> 02:23:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Tristar is heavy,</v>

5490
02:23:57.391 --> 02:23:58.970
<v Speaker 2>deep into leg Rasa.</v>

5491
02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Done for us.</v>

5492
02:24:00.841 --> 02:24:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Donna Harris comes up there.</v>

5493
02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:05.040
<v Speaker 2>So those guys are all about like,</v>

5494
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:09.270
<v Speaker 2>oh guys for us a hobby apparently is not down with the ketogenic diet.</v>

5495
02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:09.960
<v Speaker 2>He feels it.</v>

5496
02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:10.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5497
02:24:10.161 --> 02:24:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5498
02:24:10.470 --> 02:24:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I would love to talk to him about that because I'm an atheist,</v>

5499
02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:14.530
<v Speaker 2>so smart and he's smarter than me.</v>

5500
02:24:14.531 --> 02:24:15.540
<v Speaker 2>It worries me.</v>

5501
02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I like you look good bro.</v>

5502
02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:20.840
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

5503
02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:23.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy with your kid or let me know about it.</v>

5504
02:24:23.161 --> 02:24:24.240
<v Speaker 2>He might not be correct.</v>

5505
02:24:24.270 --> 02:24:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's correct.</v>

5506
02:24:25.470 --> 02:24:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5507
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:27.380
<v Speaker 2>and it might not be Whoa,</v>

5508
02:24:27.390 --> 02:24:27.730
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

5509
02:24:27.730 --> 02:24:29.600
<v Speaker 2>How fast.</v>

5510
02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:31.290
<v Speaker 2>He's also so confident.</v>

5511
02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.180
<v Speaker 2>We're always throwing head kicks man and he dies,</v>

5512
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:38.760
<v Speaker 2>he can kick and also it keeps him at a distance where he can head kick Thompson</v>

5513
02:24:38.761 --> 02:24:41.610
<v Speaker 2>but Thompson has to move forward to counter with that punch.</v>

5514
02:24:41.730 --> 02:24:42.061
<v Speaker 2>So He,</v>

5515
02:24:42.061 --> 02:24:44.520
<v Speaker 2>if he can get that head kick off as quick as he just did,</v>

5516
02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:46.710
<v Speaker 2>it gives Wonderboy something to think about it.</v>

5517
02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:47.071
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>

5518
02:24:47.071 --> 02:24:47.530
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>

5519
02:24:47.530 --> 02:24:48.363
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second dude.</v>

5520
02:24:48.570 --> 02:24:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Cause Wonderboy is always used to fighting on the outside.</v>

5521
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:54.150
<v Speaker 2>So if Rory can be the guy on the outside because he threatens with that head</v>

5522
02:24:54.151 --> 02:24:54.391
<v Speaker 2>kick,</v>

5523
02:24:54.391 --> 02:24:57.880
<v Speaker 2>it changes the whole cause I ain't gonna us Zack.</v>

5524
02:24:57.970 --> 02:24:59.310
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he's fighting.</v>

5525
02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:01.230
<v Speaker 2>He's mirroring uh,</v>

5526
02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy style.</v>

5527
02:25:02.221 --> 02:25:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5528
02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:03.291
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>

5529
02:25:03.291 --> 02:25:05.250
<v Speaker 2>He also has the best job at one 70 in the world.</v>

5530
02:25:05.251 --> 02:25:05.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5531
02:25:05.371 --> 02:25:06.090
<v Speaker 2>He's got a very good job.</v>

5532
02:25:06.090 --> 02:25:08.250
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's mirroring his exact style though.</v>

5533
02:25:08.251 --> 02:25:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Stamps,</v>

5534
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:09.463
<v Speaker 2>stance,</v>

5535
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:10.343
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

5536
02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:11.433
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5537
02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:12.330
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting if he can,</v>

5538
02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:13.830
<v Speaker 2>if he can threaten more with the head kick,</v>

5539
02:25:13.831 --> 02:25:14.611
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting.</v>

5540
02:25:14.611 --> 02:25:16.230
<v Speaker 2>If he can hide it behind those punches.</v>

5541
02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

5542
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Not really right now.</v>

5543
02:25:21.430 --> 02:25:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5544
02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:22.290
<v Speaker 2>look like rocks.</v>

5545
02:25:22.290 --> 02:25:23.123
<v Speaker 2>One Guy South Park.</v>

5546
02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:23.780
<v Speaker 2>But days looks like,</v>

5547
02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:24.041
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5548
02:25:24.041 --> 02:25:24.460
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

5549
02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:25.293
<v Speaker 2>that's accurate.</v>

5550
02:25:25.370 --> 02:25:26.203
<v Speaker 2>But they look like,</v>

5551
02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:27.440
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5552
02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:27.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5553
02:25:27.690 --> 02:25:28.080
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5554
02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:28.230
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5555
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.750
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5556
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

5557
02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:29.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5558
02:25:29.831 --> 02:25:33.160
<v Speaker 2>He's mirroring him in terms of he's standing much more sideways and easily.</v>

5559
02:25:33.410 --> 02:25:33.661
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5560
02:25:33.661 --> 02:25:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5561
02:25:34.090 --> 02:25:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Well he's done a lot of sparring with Daniels and he understands how to negate</v>

5562
02:25:37.361 --> 02:25:38.230
<v Speaker 2>that front leg kick.</v>

5563
02:25:38.350 --> 02:25:41.350
<v Speaker 2>See that front leg kick is way more effective if you're slightly,</v>

5564
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:44.890
<v Speaker 2>slightly square because you fight like a tie fighter.</v>

5565
02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:47.140
<v Speaker 2>You expose that front and tie fighters.</v>

5566
02:25:47.141 --> 02:25:48.340
<v Speaker 2>They throw a lot of tips,</v>

5567
02:25:48.490 --> 02:25:52.840
<v Speaker 2>but they don't necessarily throw the same kind of sidekicks unless they have</v>

5568
02:25:52.841 --> 02:25:54.730
<v Speaker 2>some sort of other backgrounds as well.</v>

5569
02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Roy's biggest advantage.</v>

5570
02:25:55.991 --> 02:25:58.090
<v Speaker 2>He's so smart and put it all together.</v>

5571
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.280
<v Speaker 2>George Saint Pierre is,</v>

5572
02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:01.203
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man.</v>

5573
02:26:01.450 --> 02:26:01.571
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5574
02:26:01.571 --> 02:26:02.404
<v Speaker 2>he's legit.</v>

5575
02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:03.333
<v Speaker 2>He's luck.</v>

5576
02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:06.390
<v Speaker 2>The switch.</v>

5577
02:26:06.390 --> 02:26:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Some spinning back kick.</v>

5578
02:26:07.721 --> 02:26:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5579
02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:08.820
<v Speaker 2>he's got it.</v>

5580
02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:09.581
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing.</v>

5581
02:26:09.581 --> 02:26:10.890
<v Speaker 2>See Training with us.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5589
02:26:19.511 --> 02:26:20.344
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>

5590
02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:21.970

5597
02:26:32.261 --> 02:26:32.941

02:26:33.851 --> 02:26:34.684

02:26:35.310 --> 02:26:36.010

02:26:42.220 --> 02:26:43.031
<v Speaker 2>When you hit Rory,</v>

5640
02:27:46.930 --> 02:27:47.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a little tough.</v>

5701
02:29:49.430 --> 02:29:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Well I always feel like Rory brings a queasiness either guy here.</v>

5702
02:29:54.250 --> 02:29:58.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't want either go to lose worries at terrifying individual.</v>

5703
02:29:58.350 --> 02:29:59.350
<v Speaker 3>But Wonderboy,</v>

5704
02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:01.910
<v Speaker 3>he so fucking whip smart.</v>

5705
02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:02.803
<v Speaker 3>There's more pressure.</v>

5706
02:30:02.810 --> 02:30:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Sharp.</v>

5707
02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:06.020
<v Speaker 3>There's just a lot of pressure on Roy man face of Canada.</v>

5708
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:07.490
<v Speaker 3>He's going to free agency.</v>

5709
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Wonderboy is going to be fine even though he's 33 and I don't think that affects</v>

5710
02:30:11.151 --> 02:30:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Rory at the same way.</v>

5711
02:30:12.171 --> 02:30:13.430
<v Speaker 3>It affects a regular person.</v>

5712
02:30:13.431 --> 02:30:14.180
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>

5713
02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I think he fights harder.</v>

5714
02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.990
<v Speaker 3>That Robbie Lawler fight was goddamn chaos.</v>

5715
02:30:17.991 --> 02:30:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I rewatched that best fight of the fucking century.</v>

5716
02:30:21.650 --> 02:30:22.221
<v Speaker 3>Oh much shit.</v>

5718
02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:24.480
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

5719
02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:27.780
<v Speaker 3>I can't even tell high am time dressing all the fuck.</v>

5720
02:30:27.781 --> 02:30:29.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to him that we watched.</v>

5721
02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:31.250
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

5722
02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I was going through my DVR because I was running out of space and I came across,</v>

5723
02:30:35.871 --> 02:30:36.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5724

02:30:36.980 --> 02:30:39.950
<v Speaker 3>the pluck the Rory Macdonald,</v>

5726
02:30:39.951 --> 02:30:40.784
<v Speaker 3>Robbie Lawler fight,</v>

5727
02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:41.780
<v Speaker 3>and I had to watch it.</v>

5728
02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:42.740
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of it again.</v>

5729
02:30:42.741 --> 02:30:44.100
<v Speaker 3>It was just like Jesus Christ.</v>

5730
02:30:44.130 --> 02:30:45.820
<v Speaker 3>How he told me when he got hit,</v>

5731
02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:47.720
<v Speaker 3>it went white.</v>

5732
02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:48.740
<v Speaker 3>It just all went white.</v>

5733
02:30:48.741 --> 02:30:49.490
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't see.</v>

5734
02:30:49.490 --> 02:30:50.720
<v Speaker 3>So he just had to sit down.</v>

5735
02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Terrible fight was chaos.</v>

5736
02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:54.740
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

5737
02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:55.011
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

5738
02:30:55.011 --> 02:30:56.360
<v Speaker 3>my nose was jamming into,</v>

5739
02:30:57.460 --> 02:30:58.980
<v Speaker 3>it felt like it was jamming in my eye sockets.</v>

5740
02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:00.480
<v Speaker 3>She's moving just,</v>

5741
02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5742
02:31:00.810 --> 02:31:03.140
<v Speaker 3>just the right amount away from wonder boys.</v>

5743
02:31:03.150 --> 02:31:04.280
<v Speaker 3>He's so calculated.</v>

5744
02:31:04.281 --> 02:31:05.660
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

5745
02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:10.820
<v Speaker 3>And he's the first guy to give Wonderboy like real problems with his timing.</v>

5746
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5747
02:31:11.421 --> 02:31:12.231
<v Speaker 3>Cause Matt Brown said,</v>

5748
02:31:12.231 --> 02:31:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck I've been dead and just walk through it.</v>

5749
02:31:14.750 --> 02:31:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe it was a different Wonderboy too.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Matt Brown still got hit and she just walked through it.</v>

5753
02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Roy's not getting really hit.</v>

5761
02:31:33.211 --> 02:31:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Every fight to Rory comes up with a new bag of tricks.</v>

5769
02:31:43.591 --> 02:31:47.190
<v Speaker 3>if he sees the leg come up and he lets his body go with it,</v>

5770
02:31:47.430 --> 02:31:48.960
<v Speaker 3>it's not as bad.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Remember?</v>

5830
02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Remember it more one of the arms or legs or bands?</v>

5831
02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it really depends dude.</v>

5833
02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Remember when it's on the arm too.</v>

5834
02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Like if you kick someone here,</v>

5835
02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:40.111
<v Speaker 3>like right here,</v>

5836
02:33:40.111 --> 02:33:44.010
<v Speaker 3>it's significantly easier for you to absorb than if you get kicked here.</v>

5837
02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

5838
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.890

5839
02:33:44.890 --> 02:33:45.541
<v Speaker 3>who's homeboy?</v>

5840
02:33:45.541 --> 02:33:47.850
<v Speaker 3>The Dutch kickboxer and spot in the UFC.</v>

5841
02:33:47.851 --> 02:33:48.601
<v Speaker 3>Did I make sense with that?</v>

5842
02:33:48.601 --> 02:33:49.050
<v Speaker 3>No idea.</v>

5843
02:33:49.050 --> 02:33:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Anthony made a guy quit liking is here to block a kick here than it is a block</v>

5844
02:33:54.331 --> 02:33:54.511
<v Speaker 3>kick.</v>

5845
02:33:54.511 --> 02:33:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5846
02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:55.201
<v Speaker 3>As you,</v>

5847
02:33:55.201 --> 02:33:58.100
<v Speaker 3>if you're blocking the kick higher towards your hands and your arms,</v>

5848
02:33:58.200 --> 02:33:59.490
<v Speaker 3>your arm gets real weak.</v>

5849
02:33:59.550 --> 02:34:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you get kicked in the middle.</v>

5850
02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:02.160
<v Speaker 3>Like up here,</v>

5851
02:34:02.460 --> 02:34:05.280
<v Speaker 3>he's probably going to get your arm broken chains here.</v>

5852
02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:06.241
<v Speaker 3>You might be okay.</v>

5853
02:34:06.241 --> 02:34:09.330
<v Speaker 3>The same kick here like might hurt the other guy shin.</v>

5854
02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:10.441
<v Speaker 3>It's a difference.</v>

5855
02:34:10.441 --> 02:34:12.450
<v Speaker 3>A big difference between catching an elbow,</v>

5856
02:34:12.451 --> 02:34:13.860
<v Speaker 3>like catching a shin,</v>

5857
02:34:14.010 --> 02:34:16.090
<v Speaker 3>but you still don't want it now.</v>

5858
02:34:16.130 --> 02:34:16.963
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5859
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Want to,</v>

5860
02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:21.280
<v Speaker 1>you can definitely break you guys foot.</v>

5861
02:34:21.310 --> 02:34:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy throws,</v>

5862
02:34:22.390 --> 02:34:24.100
<v Speaker 1>see one of the things about wonder boys,</v>

5863
02:34:24.101 --> 02:34:25.720
<v Speaker 1>he throws in step kicks,</v>

5864
02:34:25.721 --> 02:34:29.050
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting because his distance is way better.</v>

5865
02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It's might not be like the best thing for leg kicks,</v>

5866
02:34:32.591 --> 02:34:33.221
<v Speaker 1>like leg kicks.</v>

5867
02:34:33.221 --> 02:34:34.160
<v Speaker 1>You want to use shit.</v>

5868
02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:39.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why with the leg kicks you wanna you shinbones but with he can throw in</v>

5869
02:34:39.281 --> 02:34:41.240
<v Speaker 1>step kicks that are super powerful.</v>

5870
02:34:41.530 --> 02:34:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Him Traditional Thai kicks,</v>

5871
02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:44.351
<v Speaker 1>he boy,</v>

5872
02:34:44.351 --> 02:34:45.250
<v Speaker 1>he does those two.</v>

5873
02:34:45.251 --> 02:34:46.040
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do those too.</v>

5874
02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:49.870
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is there's a difference when a guy's really good with the</v>

5875
02:34:49.871 --> 02:34:54.520
<v Speaker 1>instep that gives you almost an extra foot of area where you,</v>

5876
02:34:54.610 --> 02:34:59.490
<v Speaker 1>where you're impacting except a lot of the really good Dutch kickboxers like an</v>

5877
02:34:59.491 --> 02:34:59.801
<v Speaker 1>airshow.</v>

5878
02:34:59.801 --> 02:35:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Hoost he would wrap that foot around the back of your head.</v>

5879
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Who would blam so he would really tuck you into like,</v>

5880
02:35:06.610 --> 02:35:08.470
<v Speaker 1>like when you like flex your foot,</v>

5881
02:35:08.471 --> 02:35:12.420
<v Speaker 1>he would tuck you to sleep right in there cause it hit the back back,</v>

5882
02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:12.940
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

5883
02:35:12.940 --> 02:35:13.150
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

5884
02:35:13.150 --> 02:35:13.751
<v Speaker 1>He'd Punch,</v>

5885
02:35:13.751 --> 02:35:15.820
<v Speaker 1>hit jab paunch and then just throw it,</v>

5886
02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:19.530
<v Speaker 1>throw it over the top of your shoulder and chop.</v>

5887
02:35:19.531 --> 02:35:20.321
<v Speaker 1>How tall is he?</v>

5888
02:35:20.321 --> 02:35:20.651
<v Speaker 1>Six.</v>

5889
02:35:20.651 --> 02:35:21.484
<v Speaker 1>Four at least.</v>

5890
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:23.920
<v Speaker 1>He's a very tall man and I met up a bunch.</v>

5891
02:35:23.921 --> 02:35:24.041

02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:30.453
<v Speaker 1>right hand.</v>

5897
02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:34.900
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is like Wonderboy offers like a lot of weird shit that if</v>

5898
02:35:34.901 --> 02:35:35.950
<v Speaker 1>you don't prepare for him,</v>

5899
02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:37.840
<v Speaker 1>which Roy clearly did bring it in.</v>

5900
02:35:37.841 --> 02:35:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Daniels,</v>

5901
02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:42.150
<v Speaker 1>he could be a real problem to you because his distance is so much good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck cancer's back with speed.</v>

5912
02:35:55.810 --> 02:35:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about Wonderboy is you've got a mind.</v>

5917
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.823
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to sleep?</v>

5923

<v Speaker 1>It ends this beautiful kickback.</v>

5924
02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:27.781
<v Speaker 1>Don't get fraud.</v>

5925

02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:31.220
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

02:36:32.681 --> 02:36:32.861
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5931
02:36:32.861 --> 02:36:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm so impressed with the controlling of distance by Roy as well.</v>

5932
02:36:36.281 --> 02:36:38.750
<v Speaker 1>You should weigh uses that high left hand,</v>

5933
02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:39.201
<v Speaker 1>that guard.</v>

5934
02:36:39.201 --> 02:36:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Look how he does this.</v>

5935
02:36:40.210 --> 02:36:43.420
<v Speaker 1>He like leans forward with his arms straight up in the air on the left side,</v>

5936
02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:45.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's something he used against Tyron Woodley.</v>

5937
02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:47.560
<v Speaker 1>He shutdown Woodley's right hand.</v>

5938
02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:47.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5939

02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:49.343
<v Speaker 1>He just jumped.</v>

5941
02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:51.970
<v Speaker 1>He just jumped a half dog.</v>

5942
02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:54.273
<v Speaker 1>He's looking for that.</v>

5943
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:55.720
<v Speaker 1>They're just going right to the legs.</v>

5944
02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:59.380
<v Speaker 1>He's got a ride if he Sweetser and gets on top of this to be brilliant.</v>

5945
02:36:59.890 --> 02:37:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

5946
02:37:00.791 --> 02:37:01.420

02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

5953
02:37:09.641 --> 02:37:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Racy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:24.450
<v Speaker 3>This is no different than Steph curry versus Lebron James.</v>

5963
02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:25.430
<v Speaker 3>It's just brilliant.</v>

5964
02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:28.430
<v Speaker 3>That left hand Wonderboy just landed moving away.</v>

5965
02:37:28.431 --> 02:37:29.270
<v Speaker 3>Very slick.</v>

5966
02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:30.773
<v Speaker 3>Dammit.</v>

5967
02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:33.260
<v Speaker 3>You don't wonder why fights to total hands down,</v>

5968
02:37:33.261 --> 02:37:33.591
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5969
02:37:33.591 --> 02:37:34.140
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>

5970
02:37:34.140 --> 02:37:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Total hands down.</v>

5971
02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Total hands down in these punches are coming up from the hips.</v>

5972
02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:38.753
<v Speaker 3>Look at us.</v>

5973
02:37:39.130 --> 02:37:42.170
<v Speaker 3>You got to Mexico and he will blitzkrieg on.</v>

5974
02:37:42.171 --> 02:37:43.004
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

5975
02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:43.940
<v Speaker 3>it's not landing.</v>

5976
02:37:43.941 --> 02:37:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Notice it.</v>

5977
02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:47.720
<v Speaker 3>But Roy is doing a great job minimizing the damage.</v>

5978
02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Great shop and constant pressure.</v>

5979
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:50.630
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

02:37:50.631 --> 02:37:51.061
<v Speaker 3>wonderful.</v>

5981
02:37:51.061 --> 02:37:51.920
<v Speaker 3>As we were saying before,</v>

5982
02:37:51.921 --> 02:37:53.300
<v Speaker 3>he's got to move back more,</v>

5983
02:37:53.540 --> 02:37:54.650
<v Speaker 3>causes more.</v>

5984
02:37:54.890 --> 02:37:56.360
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit less natural.</v>

5985
02:37:56.390 --> 02:37:57.980
<v Speaker 3>The moving back and jumping in.</v>

5986
02:37:58.220 --> 02:37:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Rory Rory,</v>

5987
02:37:59.811 --> 02:38:01.340
<v Speaker 3>he's just started plotting forward.</v>

5988
02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Just keeping the distance with that long,</v>

5989
02:38:03.141 --> 02:38:06.110
<v Speaker 3>straight left hand and threatening every time they engage.</v>

02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Who's the Donald Trump who did this?</v>

6003
02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:31.413
<v Speaker 3>Ted Cruz.</v>

6004

<v Speaker 3>Come on God.</v>

6011
02:38:41.511 --> 02:38:42.640
<v Speaker 3>Good luck judging this fight.</v>

6012
02:38:42.890 --> 02:38:43.850
<v Speaker 3>God mastery.</v>

6013
02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:45.110
<v Speaker 3>It's mastery.</v>

6014
02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:47.990
<v Speaker 3>This is an interesting man.</v>

6015
02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's a bit of someone's gonna land something major.</v>

6017
02:38:51.350 --> 02:38:51.921
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not,</v>

6018
02:38:51.921 --> 02:38:52.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6019
02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:55.400
<v Speaker 3>This could be a a five round it fair.</v>

6020
02:38:55.401 --> 02:38:57.200
<v Speaker 3>That's very similar to what we're seeing right now.</v>

6021
02:38:57.470 --> 02:38:59.240
<v Speaker 3>If both guys keep their fitness,</v>

6022
02:38:59.330 --> 02:39:03.530
<v Speaker 3>they're going to realize is an imminent threat and any kind of like any opening</v>

6023
02:39:03.650 --> 02:39:04.730
<v Speaker 3>and he'd taken chances.</v>

6024
02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Roy's going to have to grapple to test the fitness at Thompson.</v>

6025
02:39:07.610 --> 02:39:08.730
<v Speaker 3>He's comfortable.</v>

6026
02:39:09.410 --> 02:39:10.460
<v Speaker 3>He's been trying to really,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I got to step up my Twitter game guys.</v>

6384
02:47:52.551 --> 02:47:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Let's watch four minutes.</v>

6385
02:47:53.541 --> 02:47:58.310
<v Speaker 3>35 second front leg side kick is nasty because when it different sheet Wonderboy</v>

6387
02:48:00.380 --> 02:48:03.780
<v Speaker 3>but between one point and a lot of guys that you'll spark,</v>

6388
02:48:04.130 --> 02:48:06.620
<v Speaker 3>he said he could hurt you with that front leg side kick to the body,</v>

6389
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:08.030
<v Speaker 3>the front lake sacks to the body.</v>

6390
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:09.680
<v Speaker 3>It's got like a real snap to it.</v>

6391
02:48:09.930 --> 02:48:11.000
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a lot of guys who just,</v>

6392
02:48:11.540 --> 02:48:14.720
<v Speaker 3>they do it a lot of times they touch you with the ball of the foot more than</v>

6393
02:48:14.721 --> 02:48:17.810
<v Speaker 3>they're hitting you with like the side blade or the heel,</v>

6394
02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:19.870
<v Speaker 3>but Wonderboy is stuffing it in there.</v>

6395
02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:20.733
<v Speaker 3>He's too hard.</v>

6396
02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Good toe.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Very nice.</v>

6398
02:48:26.001 --> 02:48:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Roary caught him with that left hand that that right arm across the face in that</v>

6399
02:48:29.721 --> 02:48:30.920
<v Speaker 3>left arm extended.</v>

6400
02:48:30.921 --> 02:48:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting.</v>

6401
02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:34.780
<v Speaker 3>Almost like the George Foreman fight.</v>

6402
02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Aren't she more style?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wonder Boys catching a horse.</v>

6405
02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:40.790
<v Speaker 3>You got to think about Octagon Control Brian.</v>

6406
02:48:40.830 --> 02:48:42.140
<v Speaker 3>It factors into it.</v>

6407
02:48:42.141 --> 02:48:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Does it matter when you're getting at he's punching him those kind of with the</v>

6408
02:48:44.940 --> 02:48:45.240
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

6417
02:48:59.331 --> 02:49:02.670
<v Speaker 3>but I know you want her to win and I love Rory and I love,</v>

6421
02:49:05.991 --> 02:49:08.310
<v Speaker 3>can I have to say that Brian was a judge?</v>

6422
02:49:08.311 --> 02:49:09.091
<v Speaker 3>We'd have to kill him.</v>

6423
02:49:09.091 --> 02:49:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Just watch the fight.</v>

6424

6432
02:49:22.350 --> 02:49:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying an octagon control and significant strikes.</v>

6433
02:49:25.111 --> 02:49:26.040

<v Speaker 3>The boy getting Tory is trying to attack him from his back.</v>

02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:24.360
<v Speaker 3>we can't pull side control.</v>

6468
02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:25.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean you want to post card?</v>

6469
02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

6470
02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Do this might lose up Roy.</v>

6471
02:50:27.601 --> 02:50:30.490
<v Speaker 3>The fight and these Wonderboy almost are pretty fucking white.</v>

6472
02:50:30.510 --> 02:50:31.350
<v Speaker 3>So close.</v>

6473
02:50:31.351 --> 02:50:33.800
<v Speaker 3>And then when you pull fucking site control,</v>

6474
02:50:33.810 --> 02:50:34.231
<v Speaker 3>you know Eddie,</v>

6475
02:50:34.231 --> 02:50:38.100
<v Speaker 3>you like one of the first guys to say that it was before one a cro,</v>

6476
02:50:38.101 --> 02:50:38.934
<v Speaker 3>cop's fights.</v>

6477
02:50:39.270 --> 02:50:42.000
<v Speaker 3>You and I were talking and you were saying like when you get a guy who's like a</v>

6478
02:50:42.001 --> 02:50:42.930
<v Speaker 3>real experience,</v>

6479
02:50:42.931 --> 02:50:43.351
<v Speaker 3>Stryker,</v>

6480
02:50:43.351 --> 02:50:47.190
<v Speaker 3>they can generate some power and like a real close area.</v>

6481
02:50:47.191 --> 02:50:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you were noticing that if there was guys who could do ground and pound from</v>

6482
02:50:51.691 --> 02:50:52.620
<v Speaker 3>inside the guard,</v>

6483
02:50:52.621 --> 02:50:55.830
<v Speaker 3>even where you see what vandalling pride back in the pride days,</v>

6484
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:57.060
<v Speaker 3>you see ventilated.</v>

6485
02:50:57.150 --> 02:50:58.200
<v Speaker 3>He wanted me to stay standing,</v>

6486
02:50:58.201 --> 02:51:00.020
<v Speaker 3>but he was rarely in the gold,</v>

6487
02:51:00.021 --> 02:51:00.720
<v Speaker 3>but Oh,</v>

6488
02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:01.553
<v Speaker 3>you heard him?</v>

6489
02:51:03.290 --> 02:51:04.123
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

6490
02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

6491
02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:05.573
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

6492
02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6493
02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:07.640
<v Speaker 3>he hurt Roy's.</v>

6494
02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

6495
02:51:08.470 --> 02:51:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6496
02:51:08.670 --> 02:51:09.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he hit him with the,</v>

6497
02:51:09.571 --> 02:51:10.500
<v Speaker 3>I think he hit him in the nose,</v>

6498
02:51:10.501 --> 02:51:12.270
<v Speaker 3>but I think he hit with the left hand nightmare.</v>

6499
02:51:12.271 --> 02:51:13.104
<v Speaker 3>He's covering up.</v>

6500
02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:14.340
<v Speaker 3>What did he hit him with?</v>

6501
02:51:14.370 --> 02:51:14.671
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

6502
02:51:14.671 --> 02:51:15.331
<v Speaker 3>he's bleeding heavy.</v>

6503
02:51:15.331 --> 02:51:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Snow.</v>

6504
02:51:15.590 --> 02:51:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Snow sucked up that same knows that he broke it to rob.</v>

6505
02:51:19.490 --> 02:51:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Look at wonder boys cardio and I really just say that's the same nose.</v>

6506
02:51:23.471 --> 02:51:24.840
<v Speaker 3>He broke in the Robbie Lawler fight.</v>

6507
02:51:32.260 --> 02:51:37.260
<v Speaker 5>2042 seconds.</v>

6508
02:51:57.130 --> 02:51:59.260
<v Speaker 5>If I was UFC had fire me,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's enough.</v>

6514
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:06.963
<v Speaker 2>That's enough.</v>

6515
02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:08.993
<v Speaker 2>We've seen enough.</v>

6516
02:52:09.010 --> 02:52:09.843
<v Speaker 2>Brian Stann,</v>

6517
02:52:10.370 --> 02:52:10.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6518
02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:11.653
<v Speaker 2>Family seven,</v>

6519
02:52:11.970 --> 02:52:12.431
<v Speaker 2>whichever.</v>

6520
02:52:12.431 --> 02:52:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Say this.</v>

6521
02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Let's say Roy,</v>

6522
02:52:14.290 --> 02:52:16.000
<v Speaker 2>he's bleeding bad or that knows man,</v>

6523
02:52:16.510 --> 02:52:17.440
<v Speaker 2>that does not look good.</v>

6524
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:18.730
<v Speaker 2>All jokes aside,</v>

6525
02:52:20.410 --> 02:52:24.470
<v Speaker 2>let's say knows that that he used to breed that up when he was fine.</v>

6526
02:52:25.880 --> 02:52:26.713
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6527
02:52:28.050 --> 02:52:28.883
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6528
02:52:29.230 --> 02:52:30.430
<v Speaker 2>no zebra out.</v>

6529
02:52:30.860 --> 02:52:32.050
<v Speaker 2>But he was too.</v>

6530
02:52:32.170 --> 02:52:33.220
<v Speaker 2>He broke that same note.</v>

6531
02:52:33.221 --> 02:52:35.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a note that knows,</v>

6532
02:52:35.050 --> 02:52:37.150
<v Speaker 2>you knows locking first.</v>

6533
02:52:37.810 --> 02:52:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy came members,</v>

6534
02:52:38.891 --> 02:52:43.490
<v Speaker 2>mamas smell the fresh sanitize area of the hospital that says he knows.</v>

6535
02:52:44.130 --> 02:52:45.160
<v Speaker 2>They know son.</v>

6536
02:52:45.310 --> 02:52:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Wah.</v>

6537
02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:46.061
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6538
02:52:46.061 --> 02:52:47.050
<v Speaker 2>so Brian,</v>

6539
02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:48.820
<v Speaker 2>since you are paying attention so closely,</v>

6540
02:52:48.821 --> 02:52:49.900
<v Speaker 2>much more than any of us,</v>

6541
02:52:51.130 --> 02:52:54.610
<v Speaker 2>you really do judge a fine 100% without a doubt.</v>

6542
02:52:54.640 --> 02:52:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy and buy without a doubt.</v>

6543
02:52:57.370 --> 02:52:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt.</v>

6544
02:52:57.970 --> 02:52:58.803
<v Speaker 2>The strengths are.</v>

6545
02:53:01.980 --> 02:53:02.360
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

6546
02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:03.840
<v Speaker 2>It definitely looks like Thompson when the phone,</v>

6547
02:53:03.850 --> 02:53:04.590
<v Speaker 2>what do you think as you,</v>

6548
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:09.130
<v Speaker 2>but you think Roy McDonald might've got the nod because of a black helicopters</v>

6549
02:53:09.131 --> 02:53:14.131
<v Speaker 2>and chem trails because the tower seven don't start with that shit again.</v>

6550
02:53:15.140 --> 02:53:16.370
<v Speaker 2>So if that's scary,</v>

6551
02:53:17.310 --> 02:53:18.143
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared.</v>

6552
02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:19.593
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>

6553
02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Were you paying attention enough to,</v>

6554
02:53:23.930 --> 02:53:27.340
<v Speaker 2>to really give an honest reading of who won the fight?</v>

6555
02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:28.433
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6556
02:53:30.100 --> 02:53:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy,</v>

6557
02:53:31.060 --> 02:53:32.260
<v Speaker 2>definitely one.</v>

6558
02:53:32.650 --> 02:53:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

6559
02:53:33.310 --> 02:53:35.620
<v Speaker 2>I have to say way too hard.</v>

6560
02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:38.373
<v Speaker 2>Too many drinks.</v>

6561
02:53:40.540 --> 02:53:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I was super impressed with two things.</v>

6562
02:53:41.831 --> 02:53:42.041
<v Speaker 2>One.</v>

6563
02:53:42.041 --> 02:53:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I was super impressed with Roy's that the weird defense is using what that high</v>

6564
02:53:45.041 --> 02:53:49.390
<v Speaker 2>left hand and that right hand almost across his face like Archie Moore Style and</v>

6565
02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:51.730
<v Speaker 2>definitely like he was really good at controlling the distance.</v>

6566
02:53:51.731 --> 02:53:54.280
<v Speaker 2>But I think like as the rounds went on,</v>

6567
02:53:54.281 --> 02:53:59.281
<v Speaker 2>you started to see Wonderboy getting a little more comfortable and relaxing into</v>

6568
02:53:59.561 --> 02:54:00.760
<v Speaker 2>that sniping,</v>

6569
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:02.230
<v Speaker 2>jumping back and forth style.</v>

6570
02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's when uh,</v>

6571
02:54:03.550 --> 02:54:04.960
<v Speaker 2>that's when the tide started to change.</v>

6572
02:54:05.020 --> 02:54:08.620
<v Speaker 2>It looked like to me where it started to establish that Wonderboy was getting</v>

6573
02:54:08.621 --> 02:54:10.300
<v Speaker 2>slightly better in each exchange.</v>

6574
02:54:10.420 --> 02:54:12.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we talked about actually before the fight started.</v>

6575
02:54:12.671 --> 02:54:16.610
<v Speaker 2>I was saying if Wonderboy can land one or more punches and eats exchange,</v>

6576
02:54:16.611 --> 02:54:18.450
<v Speaker 2>then Rory can pick it.</v>

6577
02:54:18.500 --> 02:54:19.960
<v Speaker 2>And that adds up over time.</v>

6578
02:54:20.350 --> 02:54:21.640
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what happened.</v>

6579
02:54:24.370 --> 02:54:26.050
<v Speaker 2>50 45,</v>

6580
02:54:26.890 --> 02:54:28.450
<v Speaker 2>50 45 Wonderboy,</v>

6581
02:54:28.630 --> 02:54:29.463
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy,</v>

6582
02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:33.100
<v Speaker 2>54 boys,</v>

6583
02:54:33.101 --> 02:54:34.570
<v Speaker 2>I've got to go do some standup comedy.</v>

6584
02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:36.400

6585
02:54:36.401 --> 02:54:37.240

6586
02:54:37.241 --> 02:54:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I love you and love you to see your boys later.</v>

6587
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:42.880
<v Speaker 2>And you were a hundred percent correct on the scoring Colby.</v>

6588
02:54:42.881 --> 02:54:43.690
<v Speaker 2>You nailed it.</v>

6589
02:54:43.690 --> 02:54:44.523
<v Speaker 2>And now</v>

6590
02:54:45.690 --> 02:54:47.260
<v Speaker 2>finding is my secret garden guys.</v>

6591
02:54:47.650 --> 02:54:51.010
<v Speaker 2>So please treat me really,</v>

6592
02:54:51.011 --> 02:54:52.240

02:54:52.241 --> 02:54:52.511
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6594
02:54:52.511 --> 02:54:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I think we can all agree this.</v>

6595
02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Sit down,</v>

6596
02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:55.751
<v Speaker 2>sit down,</v>

6597
02:54:55.751 --> 02:54:55.990
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

6598
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:56.531
<v Speaker 2>For one second.</v>

6599
02:54:56.531 --> 02:54:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Let's wrap this up.</v>

6600
02:54:57.340 --> 02:54:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

6601
02:54:57.700 --> 02:54:59.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a show until you have a half hour.</v>

6602
02:54:59.561 --> 02:55:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Sit down.</v>

6603
02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Sit down.</v>

6604
02:55:00.460 --> 02:55:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Have a fuck those people.</v>

6605
02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:02.793
<v Speaker 2>I know this.</v>

6606
02:55:03.090 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy,</v>

6607
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:05.623
<v Speaker 2>there's always a guy.</v>

6608
02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:06.650
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

6609
02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:08.370
<v Speaker 2>this was like a,</v>

6610
02:55:08.390 --> 02:55:11.030
<v Speaker 2>this is a super interesting style fight,</v>

6611
02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:11.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6612
02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:12.500
<v Speaker 2>As well as yes,</v>

6613
02:55:13.370 --> 02:55:14.420
<v Speaker 2>it's almost a new blood,</v>

6614
02:55:14.421 --> 02:55:14.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6615
02:55:14.661 --> 02:55:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean Wonderboy is the new blood.</v>

6616
02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:20.270
<v Speaker 2>He just is Roy Roy's younger,</v>

6617
02:55:21.540 --> 02:55:22.373
<v Speaker 2>more dynamic.</v>

6618
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:26.120
<v Speaker 2>You have to give Wonderboy the title shot here for Rory.</v>

6619
02:55:26.121 --> 02:55:28.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough road because now he goes into free agency.</v>

6620
02:55:28.250 --> 02:55:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I make a call.</v>

6621
02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:29.750
<v Speaker 2>I called Robbie.</v>

6622
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Lawler is the baddest motherfucker on the planet one.</v>

6623
02:55:31.541 --> 02:55:32.374
<v Speaker 2>A boy will beat him.</v>

6624
02:55:32.410 --> 02:55:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I beat him the same way he beat Johnny Hendricks.</v>

6625
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:36.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a very tight group.</v>

6626
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I agree 100% with Brian on that content.</v>

6627
02:55:38.210 --> 02:55:38.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6628
02:55:38.481 --> 02:55:41.690
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta you can't dismiss Tyron Woodley.</v>

6629
02:55:41.910 --> 02:55:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6630
02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:46.540
<v Speaker 2>you can buy same thing and do the same thing with giant hands,</v>

6631
02:55:48.210 --> 02:55:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Robbie and Tyron Woodley or funny.</v>

6632
02:55:50.091 --> 02:55:54.620
<v Speaker 2>You can't pretend that you know what's going to happen and I will and I will.</v>

6633
02:55:54.621 --> 02:55:56.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're doing as usual.</v>

6634
02:55:56.180 --> 02:55:58.970
<v Speaker 2>What do you think's going to happen in that fight with Tyron?</v>

6635
02:55:58.971 --> 02:55:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6636
02:55:59.630 --> 02:56:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Robbie Lawler,</v>

6637
02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you think you know what's going to happen?</v>

6638
02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

6639
02:56:03.050 --> 02:56:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I think that rock and bar,</v>

6640
02:56:04.461 --> 02:56:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I think Robbie Lawler and pills,</v>

6641
02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:06.510
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6642
02:56:06.510 --> 02:56:07.343
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

6643
02:56:08.990 --> 02:56:11.390
<v Speaker 2>one red bike thing and then I'm going to get out of here.</v>

6644
02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

6645
02:56:12.290 --> 02:56:13.123
<v Speaker 2>let me drop this.</v>

6646
02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:14.173
<v Speaker 2>I think Robbie,</v>

6647
02:56:15.170 --> 02:56:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Robbie Lawler has something that,</v>

6648
02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:20.030
<v Speaker 2>that I've never seen a fighter and that is in round five and I'm not</v>

6649
02:56:20.031 --> 02:56:20.840
<v Speaker 2>exaggerating.</v>

6650
02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:22.070
<v Speaker 2>He's more pumped,</v>

6651
02:56:22.130 --> 02:56:24.320
<v Speaker 2>has more energy than it doesn't round one.</v>

6652
02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that,</v>

6653
02:56:25.491 --> 02:56:29.780
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't hear something indestructable about that guy either major.</v>

6654
02:56:29.790 --> 02:56:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes I am.</v>

6655
02:56:31.010 --> 02:56:32.300
<v Speaker 2>And so as Paul Felder</v>

6656
02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:40.720
<v Speaker 2>off the Comedy 23rd 28 r y a n c a l l e n at Twitter,</v>

6657
02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:45.170
<v Speaker 3>that fucking such a savage.</v>

6658
02:56:45.171 --> 02:56:45.950
<v Speaker 3>So funny.</v>

6659
02:56:45.950 --> 02:56:47.330
<v Speaker 3>He's such a fucking savage.</v>

6660
02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:51.680
<v Speaker 3>So finally he called to show just stand up.</v>

6661
02:56:51.810 --> 02:56:52.643
<v Speaker 3>It's got a show.</v>

6662
02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:54.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where to show.</v>

6663
02:56:54.330 --> 02:56:56.930
<v Speaker 3>So this is like exactly what we said before the fight out.</v>

6664
02:56:57.010 --> 02:57:01.280
<v Speaker 3>You know what I was saying that if Wonderboy can just get a couple extra punches</v>

6665
02:57:01.790 --> 02:57:05.810
<v Speaker 3>in each exchange or one every now and again those are going to accumulate.</v>

6666
02:57:06.170 --> 02:57:06.711
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

6667
02:57:06.711 --> 02:57:07.544
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that.</v>

6668
02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:08.990
<v Speaker 3>That open hand shit.</v>

6669
02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:11.420
<v Speaker 3>He landed a palm to the face first.</v>

6670
02:57:11.450 --> 02:57:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Rory is young,</v>

6671
02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:14.970
<v Speaker 3>but he's had some miles on him while he's had that.</v>

6672
02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Robbie Lawler fight was absolutely brutal and this was a less brutal fight.</v>

6673
02:57:19.490 --> 02:57:20.250
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

6674
02:57:20.250 --> 02:57:21.120
<v Speaker 3>definitely took some water.</v>

6675
02:57:21.130 --> 02:57:21.841
<v Speaker 3>Boy for sure.</v>

6676
02:57:21.841 --> 02:57:22.940
<v Speaker 3>He just the next title shot.</v>

6677
02:57:23.060 --> 02:57:26.000
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing about beat the number one guy in the world watching the</v>

6678
02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Robbie Lawler fight again.</v>

6679
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6680
02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:29.120
<v Speaker 3>I almost forgot.</v>

6681
02:57:29.150 --> 02:57:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Not really forgot,</v>

6682
02:57:30.051 --> 02:57:34.040
<v Speaker 3>but I had to be reminded a little bit of how primal that fight was.</v>

6683
02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6684
02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:35.800
<v Speaker 3>barbaric.</v>

6685
02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:36.633
<v Speaker 3>Close guys,</v>

6686
02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:37.461
<v Speaker 3>Baird at all.</v>

6687
02:57:37.461 --> 02:57:37.940
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

6688
02:57:37.940 --> 02:57:42.940
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is I like wonder boys chances against Woodley or a fucking Robbie</v>

6689
02:57:44.030 --> 02:57:44.031
<v Speaker 3>Lawler.</v>

6690
02:57:44.031 --> 02:57:46.100
<v Speaker 3>He's super like his chances against both of them.</v>

6691
02:57:46.130 --> 02:57:47.180
<v Speaker 3>He's super dangerous,</v>

6692
02:57:47.210 --> 02:57:49.610
<v Speaker 3>especially if they'd take a chance to try to hurt him.</v>

6693
02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

6694
02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:51.350
<v Speaker 3>See the thing about open up,</v>

6695
02:57:51.890 --> 02:57:53.510
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to decision.</v>

6696
02:57:53.720 --> 02:57:54.830
<v Speaker 3>If you take a chance,</v>

6697
02:57:54.831 --> 02:57:55.940
<v Speaker 3>he's going to capitalize on it.</v>

6698
02:57:55.970 --> 02:57:58.220
<v Speaker 3>He can do that little slide back.</v>

6699
02:57:58.221 --> 02:58:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Counter lefthand can nasty man and he can fight from southpaw</v>

6700
02:58:02.370 --> 02:58:03.480
<v Speaker 1>or Orthodox too,</v>

6701
02:58:03.481 --> 02:58:04.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6702
02:58:04.050 --> 02:58:04.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6703
02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:05.520
<v Speaker 1>40 fights from southpaw.</v>

6704
02:58:05.550 --> 02:58:07.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is those sidekicks,</v>

6705
02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:08.550
<v Speaker 1>his front leg side case,</v>

6706
02:58:08.850 --> 02:58:09.780
<v Speaker 1>but God damn man,</v>

6707
02:58:09.781 --> 02:58:11.460
<v Speaker 1>he can do that from the left side too.</v>

6708
02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:12.700
<v Speaker 1>He get through those front legs.</v>

6709
02:58:12.810 --> 02:58:15.210
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing karate since he was three.</v>

6710
02:58:15.530 --> 02:58:17.850
<v Speaker 1>He's literally that guy that you always joke about.</v>

6711
02:58:18.210 --> 02:58:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Brown would always joke about it.</v>

6712
02:58:19.531 --> 02:58:20.040
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6713
02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:20.431
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

6714
02:58:20.431 --> 02:58:24.510
<v Speaker 1>if you took a dude who was doing like karate from the time he was three,</v>

6715
02:58:24.750 --> 02:58:26.340
<v Speaker 1>one was like Super Ninja.</v>

6716
02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:30.750
<v Speaker 1>There was like 52.0 and you taught him how to stand up and avoid take downs.</v>

6717
02:58:31.140 --> 02:58:32.970
<v Speaker 1>How good would he do against most of the strikers?</v>

6718
02:58:32.971 --> 02:58:33.350
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

6719
02:58:33.350 --> 02:58:33.850
<v Speaker 1>We used to,</v>

6720
02:58:33.850 --> 02:58:36.030
<v Speaker 1>you and I used to have these conversation title next.</v>

6721
02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you created this dude with your imagination.</v>

6722
02:58:39.271 --> 02:58:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You know what other conversations we used to have his back in the dark days of</v>

6723
02:58:42.271 --> 02:58:43.880
<v Speaker 1>the UFC when it was underground on,</v>

6724
02:58:44.040 --> 02:58:44.880
<v Speaker 1>on direct TV,</v>

6725
02:58:44.881 --> 02:58:45.271
<v Speaker 1>only,</v>

6726
02:58:45.271 --> 02:58:47.250
<v Speaker 1>only on satellite is the days are over.</v>

6727
02:58:47.250 --> 02:58:48.480
<v Speaker 1>We have shows like this,</v>

6728
02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you know what an networks with baseball scores on the bottom and they're in</v>

6729
02:58:53.131 --> 02:58:57.990
<v Speaker 1>these big ESPN type studios that like one of these days that's going to happen.</v>

6730
02:58:57.991 --> 02:58:58.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

6731
02:58:58.600 --> 02:59:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like nothing now everywhere.</v>

6732
02:59:00.460 --> 02:59:00.870
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

6733
02:59:00.870 --> 02:59:01.590
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

6734
02:59:01.590 --> 02:59:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Where does Roy McDonald go from here?</v>

6735
02:59:03.480 --> 02:59:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Starts to fray and see,</v>

6736
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6737
02:59:05.611 --> 02:59:06.061
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

6738
02:59:06.061 --> 02:59:07.380
<v Speaker 1>it was a very close fight,</v>

6739
02:59:07.381 --> 02:59:07.841
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

6740
02:59:07.841 --> 02:59:10.530
<v Speaker 1>he lost a decision to Wonderboy.</v>

6741
02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Who Right now is the best in the fucking world that standing up and doing this</v>

6742
02:59:15.151 --> 02:59:17.140
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter that slides in a outside.</v>

6743
02:59:17.290 --> 02:59:17.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6744
02:59:17.500 --> 02:59:17.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6745
02:59:17.670 --> 02:59:17.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6746
02:59:17.941 --> 02:59:18.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6747
02:59:18.121 --> 02:59:18.241
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6748
02:59:18.241 --> 02:59:18.780
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

6749
02:59:18.780 --> 02:59:22.890
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying is he still a few years younger than Wonderboy and I think he</v>

6750
02:59:22.891 --> 02:59:24.480
<v Speaker 1>learns from this fight and gets even better.</v>

6751
02:59:24.481 --> 02:59:27.480
<v Speaker 1>But I think this is a Goddamn wake up call to the rest of the division.</v>

6752
02:59:27.481 --> 02:59:29.940
<v Speaker 1>This Wonderboy dude is legit as fuck.</v>

6753
02:59:30.030 --> 02:59:31.590
<v Speaker 1>And his angles and all this shit.</v>

6754
02:59:31.620 --> 02:59:33.300
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing this creativity,</v>

6755
02:59:33.301 --> 02:59:36.150
<v Speaker 1>this ability to stay in the pocket and not get hit nearly as much.</v>

6756
02:59:36.330 --> 02:59:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Throw a lot of dangerous shit.</v>

6757
02:59:37.831 --> 02:59:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Look at these angles man,</v>

6758
02:59:39.510 --> 02:59:40.151
<v Speaker 1>and take shots.</v>

6759
02:59:40.151 --> 02:59:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Tagged him there with that left hand.</v>

6760
02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:43.790
<v Speaker 1>All all I'm saying is if you're wearing Mcdonald,</v>

6761
02:59:43.791 --> 02:59:47.250
<v Speaker 1>he lost the number one guide and I less than number two guy would go back to the</v>

6762
02:59:47.251 --> 02:59:47.851
<v Speaker 1>drawing board.</v>

6763
02:59:47.851 --> 02:59:50.430
<v Speaker 1>He keeps swaying and you're 26 years was signed with UFC game.</v>

6764
02:59:50.470 --> 02:59:51.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't test for agents.</v>

6765
02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

6766
02:59:52.920 --> 02:59:53.191
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

6767
02:59:53.191 --> 02:59:53.760
<v Speaker 1>it's no.</v>

6768
02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:55.200
<v Speaker 1>When you say free agency,</v>

6769
02:59:55.410 --> 02:59:58.260
<v Speaker 1>no one is saying that the UFC isn't going to counter the offer and they're going</v>

6770
02:59:58.261 --> 02:59:59.094
<v Speaker 1>to come to a nice,</v>

6771
02:59:59.760 --> 03:00:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if you're already just signed with the UFC and try fighting for the</v>

6772
03:00:02.561 --> 03:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

6773
03:00:03.390 --> 03:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he could absolutely be a world champion.</v>

6774
03:00:06.481 --> 03:00:11.481
<v Speaker 1>Either saying Bella tour or in the UFC world champion in any organization.</v>

6775
03:00:12.180 --> 03:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

6776
03:00:12.780 --> 03:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>he's 26 man,</v>

6777
03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>like he has like four or five years before he hits his prime.</v>

6778
03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>But what are you looking at with the,</v>

6779
03:00:19.171 --> 03:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>with Wonderboy right now it's one of the slickest sneakiest strikers,</v>

6780
03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>one of the best guys at moving back and calendaring.</v>

6781
03:00:26.971 --> 03:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anyone them and tall.</v>

6782
03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I thought Wonderboy was this toughest style.</v>

6783
03:00:31.071 --> 03:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>A style wise matchup possible.</v>

6784
03:00:33.211 --> 03:00:34.021
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be too willing.</v>

6785
03:00:34.021 --> 03:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd be to Robbie Lawler.</v>

6786
03:00:35.131 --> 03:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I think he smokes Robbie Lawler.</v>

6787
03:00:36.471 --> 03:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Be Honest.</v>

6788
03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:37.711
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

6789
03:00:37.711 --> 03:00:37.921
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

6790
03:00:37.921 --> 03:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

6791
03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:39.353
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

6792
03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>You can be so competent.</v>

6793
03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:41.753
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

6794
03:00:42.090 --> 03:00:42.901
<v Speaker 1>I just think if he,</v>

6795
03:00:42.901 --> 03:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

6796
03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>if he got past Rory,</v>

6797
03:00:44.461 --> 03:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>that was his biggest test.</v>

6798
03:00:45.421 --> 03:00:45.661
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

6799
03:00:45.661 --> 03:00:45.871
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6800
03:00:45.871 --> 03:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>there's not a worse match up guy who can grapple strike,</v>

6801
03:00:48.391 --> 03:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>do everything and he's smart.</v>

6802
03:00:49.770 --> 03:00:50.011
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>

6803
03:00:50.011 --> 03:00:50.731
<v Speaker 1>You can take chances.</v>

6804
03:00:50.731 --> 03:00:51.564
<v Speaker 1>You beat him.</v>

6805
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>You're off to the races.</v>

6806
03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler's apart burying dude straight by bearing buddy brawls and brawl</v>

6807
03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>brought with Wonderboy Thompson.</v>

6808
03:00:57.691 --> 03:00:58.524
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't end well.</v>

6809
03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe calculated maybe or maybe Robbie Cass's US seven opponents.</v>

6810
03:01:03.660 --> 03:01:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Robbie catches in the way.</v>

6811
03:01:04.841 --> 03:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Jake Ellenberger caught him and he puts them away.</v>

6812
03:01:07.210 --> 03:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>That's entirely possible.</v>

6813
03:01:08.830 --> 03:01:09.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6814
03:01:09.161 --> 03:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>but what'd he do to make a hamburger?</v>

6815
03:01:10.510 --> 03:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe catch some bad case,</v>

6816
03:01:12.220 --> 03:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the midnight totally to look totally possible as well.</v>

6817
03:01:15.370 --> 03:01:18.910
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is nobody knows what's really going to happen until they get</v>

6818
03:01:18.911 --> 03:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>into it,</v>

6819
03:01:19.540 --> 03:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>but when I see a guy like Robbie Lawler,</v>

6820
03:01:21.221 --> 03:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I see a guy that's like,</v>

6821
03:01:22.710 --> 03:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>it's less like the physical punishment that he's taken in these chaotic wars</v>

6822
03:01:28.450 --> 03:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>with Hendrix catches.</v>

6823
03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

6824
03:01:30.590 --> 03:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Unless that catches up with them.</v>

6825
03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at a God damn barbarian straight by Robbie Lawler.</v>

6826
03:01:35.731 --> 03:01:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It goes to war.</v>

6827
03:01:36.581 --> 03:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>He goes to war with every Adam in his big picture.</v>

6828
03:01:39.821 --> 03:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>He has blood on his arm for coming today and you know who's the most dangerous</v>

6829
03:01:42.791 --> 03:01:43.600
<v Speaker 1>fucking fight for him?</v>

6830
03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>That dude right to the right Maya.</v>

6831
03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

6832
03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Not fighting him though.</v>

6833
03:01:46.670 --> 03:01:47.503
<v Speaker 1>He's nothing,</v>

6834
03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>but if he ever does Damien Maia is dangerous to everybody fucker.</v>

6835
03:01:51.970 --> 03:01:53.380
<v Speaker 1>When does he get the title shot?</v>

6836
03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a well,</v>

6837
03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:54.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6838
03:01:54.521 --> 03:01:54.971
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

6839
03:01:54.971 --> 03:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6840
03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:56.193
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

6841
03:01:56.290 --> 03:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand ratings.</v>

6842
03:01:58.060 --> 03:01:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It's all subjective.</v>

6843
03:01:59.561 --> 03:02:03.790
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's some by the decisions that get B done that get done rather</v>

6844
03:02:03.791 --> 03:02:07.120
<v Speaker 1>when one guy beats another guy and this guy agreed this guy was number three and</v>

6845
03:02:07.121 --> 03:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

6846
03:02:07.410 --> 03:02:08.590
<v Speaker 1>the greasiest cards number two.</v>

6847
03:02:08.591 --> 03:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

6848
03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>you might have a different agreement than,</v>

6849
03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:14.380
<v Speaker 1>or different opinion rather than I do.</v>

6850
03:02:14.410 --> 03:02:14.921
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

6851
03:02:14.921 --> 03:02:15.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6852
03:02:15.220 --> 03:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6853
03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a subjective thing.</v>

6854
03:02:16.601 --> 03:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

6855
03:02:17.230 --> 03:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to reserve,</v>

6856
03:02:18.490 --> 03:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but the UFC also Trump's rankings cause VLC goes well.</v>

6857
03:02:21.641 --> 03:02:24.880
<v Speaker 1>We want Damien had to fight and get flight drinking him for three wheel to fight</v>

6858
03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:25.510
<v Speaker 1>to the title next.</v>

6859
03:02:25.510 --> 03:02:26.380
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make it happen.</v>

6860
03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Well Damien's an interesting guy because he's older for sure.</v>

6861
03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Fought for the title 85.</v>

6862
03:02:33.130 --> 03:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>And what he's been doing,</v>

6863
03:02:34.501 --> 03:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>the guys when he gets them on the ground is nothing short,</v>

6864
03:02:36.611 --> 03:02:36.910
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

6865
03:02:36.910 --> 03:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Mauling Gunnar Nelson,</v>

6866
03:02:38.321 --> 03:02:39.730
<v Speaker 1>they keep tossing these young lines,</v>

6867
03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:40.573
<v Speaker 1>these starches.</v>

6868
03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:41.673
<v Speaker 1>Gunnar Nelson,</v>

6869
03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Neil Magnuson,</v>

6870
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Neil Magni.</v>

6871
03:02:44.230 --> 03:02:45.063
<v Speaker 1>In that sense,</v>

6872
03:02:45.090 --> 03:02:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

6873
03:02:45.490 --> 03:02:45.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

6874
03:02:45.741 --> 03:02:46.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6875
03:02:46.030 --> 03:02:46.721
<v Speaker 1>almost like them.</v>

6876
03:02:46.721 --> 03:02:49.840
<v Speaker 1>The enemy of two different types of people here on the enemy of the people that</v>

6877
03:02:49.841 --> 03:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>want to respect the rankings because I sometimes just want to see what happens.</v>

6878
03:02:54.010 --> 03:02:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what happens when guys fight certain guys and it's one of the</v>

6879
03:02:56.441 --> 03:03:00.180
<v Speaker 1>things that I don't necessarily like about the idea titles.</v>

6880
03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh can I see a guy like Robbie Lawler?</v>

6881
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I understand that he's the world champion are specked that and it's fucking</v>

6882
03:03:05.861 --> 03:03:06.281
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

6883
03:03:06.281 --> 03:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>But really what I care is that Robbie Lawler's,</v>

6884
03:03:08.801 --> 03:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler,</v>

6885
03:03:09.880 --> 03:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>which he is exactly what she is and I want to see Robbie Lawler fight other guys</v>

6886
03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>that are intriguing.</v>

6887
03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Like in to me,</v>

6888
03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler was Thompson.</v>

6889
03:03:18.910 --> 03:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh you told you it's completely 100% a hundred percent a hundred percent I'm</v>

6890
03:03:23.171 --> 03:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>with you 100% I mean like I'd like that fight as well.</v>

6891
03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:27.821
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

6892
03:03:27.821 --> 03:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I also like Tyron Woodley.</v>

6893
03:03:29.140 --> 03:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I like Tyron Woodley for the Oh shit factor.</v>

6894
03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I like Tyrone Woodley for his ability to close the distance and restaurants and</v>

6895
03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>wrestle like a motherfucker and it's serious knockout power.</v>

6896
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I like Tyron Woodley against almost anybody.</v>

6897
03:03:41.201 --> 03:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>He's dangerous man.</v>

6898
03:03:42.370 --> 03:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Just striking to me.</v>

6899
03:03:43.241 --> 03:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Trouble against these top guys.</v>

6900
03:03:44.471 --> 03:03:49.471
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of fucking high level guys in the one 70 division.</v>

6901
03:03:49.631 --> 03:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And what interesting.</v>

6902
03:03:51.191 --> 03:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting to me about Damien Maia is I see the,</v>

6903
03:03:54.401 --> 03:03:59.401
<v Speaker 1>what he does to guys like Rick Story and I see what you guys had it does to guys</v>

6904
03:03:59.721 --> 03:04:03.560
<v Speaker 1>like Neil Howe magnate and I go with elite daily and Maya all.</v>

6905
03:04:03.561 --> 03:04:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Luckily Damien Maia,</v>

6906
03:04:05.390 --> 03:04:05.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6907
03:04:05.541 --> 03:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>we see this time and going,</v>

6908
03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:07.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6909
03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:12.560
<v Speaker 1>we see Tyron Woodley with some ridiculous Nate Marquardt asked one punch</v>

6910
03:04:12.570 --> 03:04:13.403
<v Speaker 1>knockout.</v>

6911
03:04:13.920 --> 03:04:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I want fuck knows man.</v>

6912
03:04:15.310 --> 03:04:19.250
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's a super powerful fighting a guy like Woodley ain't so fun to</v>

6913
03:04:19.251 --> 03:04:21.770
<v Speaker 1>try to take down either because he closed the distance on him.</v>

6914
03:04:21.771 --> 03:04:23.480
<v Speaker 1>He hits hard and fast</v>

6915
03:04:25.130 --> 03:04:25.911
<v Speaker 1>like Rory did here.</v>

6916
03:04:25.911 --> 03:04:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Like with doe from those legs.</v>

6917
03:04:27.051 --> 03:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>It didn't pay off really.</v>

6918
03:04:28.700 --> 03:04:29.241
<v Speaker 1>It looked good.</v>

6919
03:04:29.241 --> 03:04:30.051
<v Speaker 1>Or in the first round though,</v>

6920
03:04:30.051 --> 03:04:30.680
<v Speaker 1>didn't it?</v>

6921
03:04:30.680 --> 03:04:31.281
<v Speaker 1>It'll look cool,</v>

6922
03:04:31.281 --> 03:04:32.114
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

6923
03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:34.580
<v Speaker 1>did someone give Wonderboy the first round?</v>

6924
03:04:35.270 --> 03:04:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6925
03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6926
03:04:36.110 --> 03:04:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Fed Up to judges had it 40 40 45 what did you think about the first round?</v>

6927
03:04:40.191 --> 03:04:40.491
<v Speaker 1>A few.</v>

6928
03:04:40.491 --> 03:04:41.390
<v Speaker 1>If you had to guess,</v>

6929
03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I would have gave a sudden you're shadowing memory,</v>

6930
03:04:43.790 --> 03:04:44.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6931
03:04:44.091 --> 03:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Based on this fucking peanut Nawara amendment.</v>

6932
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I give the first round to Roy and then after it appeared that he lost the rest</v>

6933
03:04:51.351 --> 03:04:51.620
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

6934
03:04:51.620 --> 03:04:52.161
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

6935
03:04:52.161 --> 03:04:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I love the way Wonderboy slides in and out of these shots.</v>

6936
03:04:55.210 --> 03:04:55.520
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

6937
03:04:55.520 --> 03:04:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd love how he stays in the pocket to and throws all these,</v>

6938
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:59.850
<v Speaker 1>these angles there and there.</v>

6939
03:04:59.851 --> 03:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>He realized it hurt him.</v>

6940
03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Did y'all talk about a guy who realizes his standup potential but he's worked on</v>

6941
03:05:04.551 --> 03:05:06.590
<v Speaker 1>his grappling and take down the fence so much?</v>

6942
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:09.380
<v Speaker 1>He was so comfortable training out of his gym and South Carolina and went,</v>

6943
03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:09.621
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

6944
03:05:09.621 --> 03:05:10.311
<v Speaker 1>who's the best?</v>

6945
03:05:10.311 --> 03:05:10.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6946
03:05:10.491 --> 03:05:14.090
<v Speaker 1>let's go to Weidman's camp and get annihilated for months and months.</v>

6947
03:05:14.091 --> 03:05:16.760
<v Speaker 1>A month so I can get better at one 70 that's not,</v>

6948
03:05:17.090 --> 03:05:18.080
<v Speaker 1>that's how many guys do that.</v>

6949
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.521
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

6950
03:05:18.521 --> 03:05:19.341
<v Speaker 1>He figured it out.</v>

6951
03:05:19.341 --> 03:05:20.210
<v Speaker 1>It's cool man.</v>

6952
03:05:20.780 --> 03:05:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6953
03:05:21.390 --> 03:05:24.230
<v Speaker 1>and he's also trained by his dad and now it's crazy.</v>

6954
03:05:25.070 --> 03:05:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Most most of us,</v>

6955
03:05:26.391 --> 03:05:26.691
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

6956
03:05:26.691 --> 03:05:29.060
<v Speaker 1>son relationships are tough to bring someone else into men.</v>

6957
03:05:29.150 --> 03:05:30.020
<v Speaker 1>They figured it out.</v>

6958
03:05:30.620 --> 03:05:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6959
03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:31.970
<v Speaker 1>they must have figured it out.</v>

6960
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:33.321
<v Speaker 1>But he's a,</v>

6961
03:05:33.321 --> 03:05:38.321
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting thing because he brings a totally new sort of a style to the</v>

6962
03:05:39.861 --> 03:05:40.880
<v Speaker 1>top of the heap.</v>

6963
03:05:41.090 --> 03:05:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no on the top of the heap that mimics that we've had the wrestlers</v>

6964
03:05:44.271 --> 03:05:45.350
<v Speaker 1>before and you know,</v>

6965
03:05:45.351 --> 03:05:46.670
<v Speaker 1>the Matt Hughes,</v>

6966
03:05:46.671 --> 03:05:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Hunter and Johnny Hendricks,</v>

6967
03:05:48.321 --> 03:05:49.730
<v Speaker 1>like really powerful wrestlers.</v>

6968
03:05:49.731 --> 03:05:49.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6969
03:05:49.881 --> 03:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hughes would get more submissions and a lot of ground and pound victories.</v>

6970
03:05:53.031 --> 03:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>And Johnny Hendricks got a lot of standup victories,</v>

6971
03:05:55.580 --> 03:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>a lot of standup chaos like that crazy Fitch Kayo and the Martin Kampmann Kale.</v>

6972
03:06:00.170 --> 03:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Johnny had some ridiculous one lefthand the bomb Kaos Jesus.</v>

6973
03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.451
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

6974
03:06:05.451 --> 03:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>they're different in that way,</v>

6975
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:07.580
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

6976
03:06:07.640 --> 03:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6977
03:06:07.940 --> 03:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it's real interesting.</v>

6978
03:06:08.961 --> 03:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>We see a guy that you haven't seen before really,</v>

6979
03:06:12.681 --> 03:06:17.681
<v Speaker 1>and a karate guy like wonder boy with his crazy undefeated kickboxing record and</v>

6980
03:06:18.231 --> 03:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't figure it out because no one's figured it out.</v>

6981
03:06:20.751 --> 03:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

6982
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:24.430
<v Speaker 1>George Saint Pierre told me he's the best tracker that he's ever sparred one.</v>

6983
03:06:24.460 --> 03:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Ha Ha.</v>

6984
03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:25.851
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

6985
03:06:25.851 --> 03:06:26.260
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6986
03:06:26.260 --> 03:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>towards St Pier brought him to Denver and we were like,</v>

6987
03:06:28.731 --> 03:06:29.640
<v Speaker 1>who's this skinny kid?</v>

6988
03:06:29.640 --> 03:06:29.891
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

6989
03:06:29.891 --> 03:06:30.880
<v Speaker 1>oh all he's going to do.</v>

6990
03:06:31.090 --> 03:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Cause at the time he was even thinking about MMA,</v>

6991
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.943
<v Speaker 1>he's just striking.</v>

6992
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>How have you seen rush hour where Chris Tucker eats kicked in the face of guy?</v>

6993
03:06:37.940 --> 03:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

6994
03:06:38.330 --> 03:06:39.163
<v Speaker 1>Y'All did it.</v>

6995
03:06:39.530 --> 03:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you when he's sparred with us,</v>

6996
03:06:41.870 --> 03:06:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6997
03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:43.383
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

6998
03:06:43.430 --> 03:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know shit.</v>

6999
03:06:46.190 --> 03:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't the only one that felt like that.</v>

7000
03:06:47.901 --> 03:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>George St Pier,</v>

7001
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Nate,</v>

7002
03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Shane and Neymar car,</v>

7003
03:06:51.770 --> 03:06:53.460
<v Speaker 1>all of us went in and just got raw,</v>

7004
03:06:53.461 --> 03:06:54.940
<v Speaker 1>wracked,</v>

7005
03:06:55.230 --> 03:06:55.650
<v Speaker 1>wracked.</v>

7006
03:06:55.650 --> 03:06:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Well he's looked like amateurs.</v>

7007
03:06:57.090 --> 03:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>He's the best example of someone that knows that other style and implements it</v>

7008
03:07:02.160 --> 03:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>in an MMA fight because that's style is always been a question mark.</v>

7009
03:07:07.011 --> 03:07:07.261
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

7010
03:07:07.261 --> 03:07:10.370
<v Speaker 1>how come some of these national karate champion Dudes,</v>

7011
03:07:10.390 --> 03:07:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten into MMA because if they do,</v>

7012
03:07:12.931 --> 03:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>they'll sport karate guys and the sport taekwondo guys,</v>

7013
03:07:15.810 --> 03:07:19.590
<v Speaker 1>more of this poor karate guys on a lot of ways because some of their matches a</v>

7014
03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:20.910
<v Speaker 1>concentrate more on punches.</v>

7015
03:07:21.060 --> 03:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are swift punches to the face,</v>

7016
03:07:23.431 --> 03:07:25.410
<v Speaker 1>like even a sport punch.</v>

7017
03:07:25.470 --> 03:07:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7018
03:07:25.830 --> 03:07:26.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7019
03:07:26.071 --> 03:07:27.210
<v Speaker 1>one point karate guys,</v>

7020
03:07:27.211 --> 03:07:27.821
<v Speaker 1>the point crying,</v>

7021
03:07:27.821 --> 03:07:28.510
<v Speaker 1>we can tag a guy,</v>

7022
03:07:28.510 --> 03:07:29.343
<v Speaker 1>they stop,</v>

7023
03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:33.120
<v Speaker 1>they'd still concentrate more on punches to the face then the taekwondo guys.</v>

7024
03:07:33.210 --> 03:07:33.511
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

7025
03:07:33.511 --> 03:07:36.990
<v Speaker 1>but you can get like a really good combination of the two of those techniques</v>

7026
03:07:37.470 --> 03:07:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and if those guys get into MMA,</v>

7027
03:07:39.421 --> 03:07:39.901
<v Speaker 1>man they,</v>

7028
03:07:39.901 --> 03:07:43.710
<v Speaker 1>they're so hard to hit because they'll sport karate guys are used to just</v>

7029
03:07:43.950 --> 03:07:47.430
<v Speaker 1>jumping back and forth on each other and the judge Calloway.</v>

7030
03:07:47.730 --> 03:07:47.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7031
03:07:47.941 --> 03:07:48.900
<v Speaker 1>that's their whole shit.</v>

7032
03:07:48.960 --> 03:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I think waterboy is going to sit the blueprint for some of those guys because he</v>

7033
03:07:52.161 --> 03:07:55.110
<v Speaker 1>and golfed himself into grappling to Conor.</v>

7034
03:07:55.111 --> 03:07:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor is considered one of those guys.</v>

7035
03:07:56.881 --> 03:07:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7036
03:07:57.270 --> 03:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean any other background?</v>

7037
03:07:59.420 --> 03:08:00.253
<v Speaker 1>When I was,</v>

7038
03:08:00.390 --> 03:08:02.280
<v Speaker 1>when I was really good at taekwondo,</v>

7039
03:08:02.281 --> 03:08:03.810
<v Speaker 1>when I was winning state championships,</v>

7040
03:08:03.840 --> 03:08:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I had a karate match.</v>

7041
03:08:05.550 --> 03:08:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I took a fight,</v>

7042
03:08:07.180 --> 03:08:07.901
<v Speaker 1>a tournament,</v>

7043
03:08:07.901 --> 03:08:12.090
<v Speaker 1>a point karate tournament and I fought this dude named mafia Holloway who was</v>

7044
03:08:12.091 --> 03:08:16.350
<v Speaker 1>like this big time point karate guy and this guy fuck me up.</v>

7045
03:08:16.650 --> 03:08:17.483
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

7046
03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get ahold of them because I was used to like continuous style kicking</v>

7047
03:08:22.370 --> 03:08:22.770
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

7048
03:08:22.770 --> 03:08:24.060
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't used to this,</v>

7049
03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:27.510
<v Speaker 1>this Darden's smashed start in with a punch to the face.</v>

7050
03:08:27.720 --> 03:08:29.240
<v Speaker 1>They big would Darden on you.</v>

7051
03:08:29.270 --> 03:08:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Then everything would stop and you go,</v>

7052
03:08:30.540 --> 03:08:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7053
03:08:31.290 --> 03:08:31.531
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

7054
03:08:31.531 --> 03:08:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm way behind on this.</v>

7055
03:08:32.701 --> 03:08:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I should have trained for this.</v>

7056
03:08:34.250 --> 03:08:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I think I trained for like kickboxing or for taekwondo and this guy had this</v>

7057
03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:38.940
<v Speaker 1>totally different thing.</v>

7058
03:08:38.941 --> 03:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And I remember um,</v>

7059
03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:41.070
<v Speaker 1>from that one match,</v>

7060
03:08:41.310 --> 03:08:42.090
<v Speaker 1>which uh,</v>

7061
03:08:42.090 --> 03:08:42.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7062
03:08:42.301 --> 03:08:43.950
<v Speaker 1>it didn't last very long and I didn't,</v>

7063
03:08:43.980 --> 03:08:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get hurt in it,</v>

7064
03:08:44.881 --> 03:08:45.960
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely got tagged.</v>

7065
03:08:45.961 --> 03:08:48.960
<v Speaker 1>He tagged me with the front leg side kick to the body and a couple of other</v>

7066
03:08:48.961 --> 03:08:49.230
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

7067
03:08:49.230 --> 03:08:50.130
<v Speaker 1>But I remember thinking like,</v>

7068
03:08:50.131 --> 03:08:50.730
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

7069
03:08:50.730 --> 03:08:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I got to rethink my whole approach to darting in and out because they don't like</v>

7070
03:08:54.901 --> 03:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo guys don't necessarily do that to the same with the same explosion,</v>

7071
03:08:59.281 --> 03:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>the same distance covering.</v>

7072
03:09:01.020 --> 03:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember thinking those guys are really hard to catch and those guys</v>

7073
03:09:04.621 --> 03:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>to get really good at that thing.</v>

7074
03:09:06.181 --> 03:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And you've seen it with that kid in,</v>

7075
03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>in Beltour Michael Page,</v>

03:13:22.191 --> 03:13:23.210
<v Speaker 3>He beat him down.</v>

7242
03:13:23.540 --> 03:13:24.650
<v Speaker 3>That was ferocious.</v>

7243
03:13:24.860 --> 03:13:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I really liked Donald Cerrone at one seven do you remember the first fight when</v>

7244
03:13:28.131 --> 03:13:30.260
<v Speaker 3>that girl kicked the other girl in the titty and she turned around?</v>

7245
03:13:30.350 --> 03:13:31.183
<v Speaker 3>That's not what happened.</v>

7246
03:13:31.220 --> 03:13:35.150
<v Speaker 3>What she did want down and she pulled her bra or titty.</v>

7247
03:13:35.151 --> 03:13:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Got Breast.</v>

7248
03:13:38.900 --> 03:13:39.351
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal.</v>

7249
03:13:39.351 --> 03:13:39.831
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal.</v>

7250
03:13:39.831 --> 03:13:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Illegal.</v>

7251
03:13:40.310 --> 03:13:41.000
<v Speaker 3>It is illegal.</v>

7252
03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:42.200
<v Speaker 3>I think what happened was,</v>

7253
03:13:42.750 --> 03:13:45.140
<v Speaker 3>it's coming down was she kicked her in the face,</v>

7254
03:13:45.260 --> 03:13:47.090
<v Speaker 3>but as her footwork was coming down,</v>

7255
03:13:47.091 --> 03:13:48.380
<v Speaker 3>the foot caught the bra,</v>

7256
03:13:48.381 --> 03:13:51.590
<v Speaker 3>the Bra pulled down the Teddy and um,</v>

7257
03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:53.480
<v Speaker 3>you know what happened folks.</v>

7258
03:13:54.020 --> 03:13:56.440
<v Speaker 3>But then she did it again and kicked her right in the solar plex.</v>

7259
03:13:56.470 --> 03:13:56.601
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7260
03:13:56.601 --> 03:13:57.261
<v Speaker 3>that was a different one.</v>

7261
03:13:57.261 --> 03:13:58.910
<v Speaker 3>Girl turned around and ran.</v>

7262
03:13:58.911 --> 03:13:59.750
<v Speaker 3>She smashed her.</v>

7263
03:14:00.110 --> 03:14:01.280
<v Speaker 3>I still to this day,</v>

7264
03:14:01.890 --> 03:14:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I want to pretend that I remember a kick before that kick to the body.</v>

7265
03:14:06.470 --> 03:14:07.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm right or not,</v>

7266
03:14:07.611 --> 03:14:09.440
<v Speaker 3>but either way there's three kids.</v>

7267
03:14:10.370 --> 03:14:11.540
<v Speaker 3>There was a base of a fight.</v>

7268
03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:12.553
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 5>point of view.</v>

7340
03:16:10.051 --> 03:16:11.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like what one guy has to do to win,</v>

7341
03:16:11.930 --> 03:16:13.620
<v Speaker 5>but another guy has to do to win there could.</v>

03:19:47.341 --> 03:19:51.540
<v Speaker 6>he was at USC and the most interesting part,</v>

7465
03:19:51.541 --> 03:19:54.150
<v Speaker 6>Brendan shop him when fucking Muhammad,</v>

<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>

7470
03:19:58.131 --> 03:19:58.941
<v Speaker 5>I'm not black.</v>

7471
03:19:58.941 --> 03:20:01.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm Oj and separate himself on blacks.</v>

7472
03:20:02.910 --> 03:20:04.020
<v Speaker 6>You but you know,</v>

7473
03:20:04.021 --> 03:20:04.800
<v Speaker 6>grow.</v>

7474
03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:05.850
<v Speaker 6>I think John,</v>

7475
03:20:06.030 --> 03:20:06.570
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

7476
03:20:06.570 --> 03:20:06.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

7477
03:20:06.900 --> 03:20:07.560
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

7478
03:20:07.560 --> 03:20:08.393
<v Speaker 6>the uh,</v>

7479
03:20:08.700 --> 03:20:10.710
<v Speaker 6>the cop has the best analogy.</v>

7480
03:20:11.220 --> 03:20:12.053
<v Speaker 6>The old check,</v>

7481
03:20:12.300 --> 03:20:13.260
<v Speaker 6>big John McCarthy.</v>

7482
03:20:14.180 --> 03:20:16.860
<v Speaker 6>He's got the best analogy because in one of the,</v>

7483
03:20:17.050 --> 03:20:21.470
<v Speaker 6>in one of the things Mark Burman went to his house before he had a baseball bat</v>

7484
03:20:21.471 --> 03:20:25.280
<v Speaker 6>in his hand and mark for him and told him twice to put the fucking back down.</v>

7485
03:20:25.690 --> 03:20:30.150
<v Speaker 6>And the third time he had to take out his stick and that whole chain was just</v>

7486
03:20:30.151 --> 03:20:30.811
<v Speaker 6>glaring at him.</v>

7487
03:20:30.811 --> 03:20:35.070
<v Speaker 6>And then he came back and they said that when that guy dies that to take his</v>

7488
03:20:35.071 --> 03:20:38.490
<v Speaker 6>brain because he's definitely got the same shit that all these other things.</v>

7489
03:20:41.090 --> 03:20:42.380
<v Speaker 5>What CTE,</v>

7490
03:20:43.370 --> 03:20:43.920
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

7491
03:20:43.920 --> 03:20:44.753
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

7492
03:20:44.960 --> 03:20:47.520
<v Speaker 5>if the trial was today,</v>

7493
03:20:47.521 --> 03:20:49.930
<v Speaker 5>they would argue CT clinically insane.</v>

7494
03:20:54.660 --> 03:20:56.130
<v Speaker 6>That motherfucker is crazy.</v>

7495
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:58.663
<v Speaker 5>He's crazy.</v>

7497
03:20:59.420 --> 03:21:00.620
<v Speaker 5>what does CTE stands for?</v>

7498
03:21:00.621 --> 03:21:03.710
<v Speaker 5>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy or something like that.</v>

7499
03:21:03.711 --> 03:21:04.390
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

7500
03:21:04.390 --> 03:21:05.223
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

7501
03:21:08.830 --> 03:21:09.663
<v Speaker 6>they break down.</v>

7502
03:21:10.260 --> 03:21:11.180
<v Speaker 5>It's tough to</v>

7503
03:21:12.810 --> 03:21:13.950
<v Speaker 5>chronic traumatic</v>

7504

03:21:17.950 --> 03:21:18.480
<v Speaker 6>What that is,</v>

7507
03:21:18.480 --> 03:21:20.070
<v Speaker 6>and nobody could have done something.</v>

7508
03:21:20.610 --> 03:21:21.443
<v Speaker 6>Brendan shops,</v>

<v Speaker 6>They broke it down.</v>

7512
03:21:28.131 --> 03:21:28.964
<v Speaker 6>Joe Rogan.</v>

7513
03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:31.600
<v Speaker 6>How's animalistic what he did to</v>

03:22:05.300 --> 03:22:06.133
<v Speaker 5>they broke it down.</v>

7526
03:22:07.310 --> 03:22:08.210
<v Speaker 5>How do they know he did it?</v>

7527
03:22:08.211 --> 03:22:09.044
<v Speaker 5>100%</v>

7528
03:22:10.140 --> 03:22:10.351
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

7529
03:22:10.351 --> 03:22:11.400
<v Speaker 6>it's not him that he did it.</v>

7530
03:22:11.401 --> 03:22:11.890
<v Speaker 6>How,</v>

7531
03:22:11.890 --> 03:22:12.960
<v Speaker 6>how anybody would do it.</v>

7532
03:22:13.500 --> 03:22:14.460
<v Speaker 6>This is what they said.</v>

7533
03:22:14.461 --> 03:22:15.690
<v Speaker 6>How can anybody would do it?</v>

7534
03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:16.540
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

7535
03:22:16.540 --> 03:22:17.210
<v Speaker 5>No Way.</v>

7536
03:22:17.210 --> 03:22:18.830
<v Speaker 5>So they went through everything.</v>

7537
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:20.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7538
03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:20.760
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

7539
03:22:20.760 --> 03:22:22.140
<v Speaker 6>Then he went and choked him.</v>

7540
03:22:22.380 --> 03:22:23.213
<v Speaker 6>Caught him.</v>

7541
03:22:23.780 --> 03:22:24.730
<v Speaker 6>He was on the floor,</v>

7542
03:22:24.731 --> 03:22:25.830
<v Speaker 6>I guess two fences,</v>

7543
03:22:25.831 --> 03:22:26.630
<v Speaker 6>Bro.</v>

7544
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:27.463
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doubting that.</v>

7545
03:22:28.060 --> 03:22:29.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doubting that they figured this out.</v>

7546
03:22:29.810 --> 03:22:32.230
<v Speaker 5>He did it 100% I'm not downing and he can't hear me.</v>

7547
03:22:32.410 --> 03:22:34.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doubting that they figured this out.</v>

7548
03:22:34.001 --> 03:22:36.010
<v Speaker 5>But you know the one thing that perplexes me,</v>

7549
03:22:36.011 --> 03:22:37.180
<v Speaker 5>is it a dummy?</v>

7550
03:22:37.450 --> 03:22:37.780
<v Speaker 5>How do,</v>

7551
03:22:37.780 --> 03:22:41.860
<v Speaker 5>how do they figure that out by looking at where the bodies are like by the marks</v>

7552
03:22:41.861 --> 03:22:42.611
<v Speaker 5>on the ground?</v>

7553
03:22:42.611 --> 03:22:44.500
<v Speaker 5>Like how did they figure that a blood at his house.</v>

7554
03:22:44.501 --> 03:22:45.370
<v Speaker 5>At her house,</v>

7555
03:22:45.970 --> 03:22:46.803
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

7556
03:22:47.430 --> 03:22:48.263
<v Speaker 6>Joe Rogan.</v>

7557
03:22:51.200 --> 03:22:53.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

7558
03:22:53.060 --> 03:22:54.340
<v Speaker 5>his hands were all fucked.</v>

7559
03:22:58.570 --> 03:22:59.820
<v Speaker 6>Debbie cut his leg or something.</v>

7560
03:22:59.970 --> 03:23:00.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7561
03:23:00.630 --> 03:23:01.710
<v Speaker 5>And also Joey,</v>

7562
03:23:01.711 --> 03:23:05.250
<v Speaker 5>they're saying it was such a hate crime that when he hit her in the throat,</v>

7563
03:23:05.251 --> 03:23:06.840
<v Speaker 5>it basically decapitated or,</v>

7564
03:23:06.900 --> 03:23:11.490
<v Speaker 5>so they're saying that it would have to be such a passion of crime.</v>

7565
03:23:11.610 --> 03:23:16.130
<v Speaker 5>Like you had such a love for when you hit someone that hard to sever their math</v>

7566
03:23:16.140 --> 03:23:17.790
<v Speaker 5>and almost cut her head off.</v>

7567
03:23:17.910 --> 03:23:19.470
<v Speaker 5>It had to been a passion of crime.</v>

7568
03:23:19.530 --> 03:23:20.191
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine?</v>

7569
03:23:20.191 --> 03:23:20.910
<v Speaker 5>Let's assume,</v>

7570
03:23:20.910 --> 03:23:21.910
<v Speaker 5>let's assume that you did it.</v>

7571
03:23:27.730 --> 03:23:28.563
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

03:24:41.121 --> 03:24:41.930
<v Speaker 5>it's brilliant.</v>

7609
03:24:41.930 --> 03:24:44.100
<v Speaker 5>This is the best documentary ever seen to</v>

7610
03:24:44.100 --> 03:24:44.400
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

7611
03:24:44.400 --> 03:24:45.121
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

7612
03:24:45.121 --> 03:24:45.540
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

7613
03:24:45.540 --> 03:24:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It paints a different story on how how Oj Simpson,</v>

7614
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:51.210
<v Speaker 1>he went associate himself as being black.</v>

7615
03:24:51.211 --> 03:24:52.430
<v Speaker 1>He didn't view himself as black.</v>

7616
03:24:52.431 --> 03:24:53.670
<v Speaker 1>He view himself as Oj.</v>

7617
03:24:53.910 --> 03:24:56.430
<v Speaker 1>So we always thought he was bigger than the race.</v>

7618
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:59.090
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy the way they painted the picture too.</v>

7619
03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:04.160
<v Speaker 1>But is that editorial choice or is that based on his friends or family?</v>

7620
03:25:04.980 --> 03:25:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Mm,</v>

7621
03:25:05.770 --> 03:25:06.311
<v Speaker 6>but you know what,</v>

7622
03:25:06.311 --> 03:25:07.000
<v Speaker 6>they left out.</v>

7623
03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:08.520
<v Speaker 6>They only mentioned it one time,</v>

7624
03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:09.393
<v Speaker 6>guys.</v>

7625
03:25:10.330 --> 03:25:11.820
<v Speaker 6>They left doctor cocaine.</v>

7626
03:25:12.390 --> 03:25:12.830
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

7627
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

7628
03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:13.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7629
03:25:13.690 --> 03:25:14.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7630
03:25:14.400 --> 03:25:15.233
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7631
03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7632
03:25:17.330 --> 03:25:18.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a big red flag there.</v>

7633
03:25:18.620 --> 03:25:18.771
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

7634
03:25:18.771 --> 03:25:21.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a documentary you can watch on Youtube.</v>

7635
03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7636
03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Jay,</v>

7637
03:25:22.490 --> 03:25:23.960
<v Speaker 1>the untold story</v>

7638
03:25:27.190 --> 03:25:29.540
<v Speaker 1>on youtube or Netflix.</v>

7639
03:25:29.720 --> 03:25:30.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

7640
03:25:30.021 --> 03:25:30.950
<v Speaker 1>it's at the library,</v>

7641
03:25:30.951 --> 03:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

7642
03:25:31.340 --> 03:25:35.210
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in America on the tomato.</v>

7643
03:25:35.480 --> 03:25:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7644
03:25:35.950 --> 03:25:36.800
<v Speaker 1>100</v>

7645
03:25:37.070 --> 03:25:38.240
<v Speaker 6>he had CTE.</v>

7646
03:25:38.300 --> 03:25:39.890
<v Speaker 6>But then you sprinkle that cocaine.</v>

7647
03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't they talk about the cocaine?</v>

7648
03:25:43.250 --> 03:25:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

7649
03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:44.583
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

7650
03:25:44.740 --> 03:25:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Bring it up.</v>

7651
03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's a suspect.</v>

7652
03:25:47.710 --> 03:25:47.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7653
03:25:47.831 --> 03:25:48.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7654
03:25:48.040 --> 03:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting,</v>

7655
03:25:48.740 --> 03:25:49.573
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

7656
03:25:50.480 --> 03:25:51.313
<v Speaker 6>Hello?</v>

7657
03:25:51.500 --> 03:25:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I said what's interesting is,</v>

7658
03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:53.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7659
03:25:53.180 --> 03:25:57.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the doctors that was somehow involved in the case back in the day was on</v>

7660
03:25:57.891 --> 03:26:02.300
<v Speaker 1>TV recently and he was talking about the new discoveries about CTE.</v>

7661
03:26:02.301 --> 03:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>What would the new understanding about CTE.</v>

7662
03:26:04.310 --> 03:26:08.060
<v Speaker 1>And they said that it is very possible that they might have actually introduced</v>

7663
03:26:08.061 --> 03:26:11.750
<v Speaker 1>that into the trial back then if they knew what they knew now,</v>

7664
03:26:11.780 --> 03:26:12.530
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

7665
03:26:12.530 --> 03:26:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7666
03:26:13.270 --> 03:26:14.080
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

7667
03:26:14.080 --> 03:26:14.913
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

7668
03:26:15.700 --> 03:26:16.391
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

7669
03:26:16.391 --> 03:26:19.000
<v Speaker 6>It's just makes sense because John would mark me on that.</v>

7670
03:26:19.690 --> 03:26:20.341
<v Speaker 6>He goes back,</v>

7671
03:26:20.341 --> 03:26:22.210
<v Speaker 6>guy had the different CTE,</v>

7672
03:26:22.810 --> 03:26:24.700
<v Speaker 6>the shit that you know you don't fuck it.</v>

7673
03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:26.440
<v Speaker 6>It just comes and goes,</v>

7674
03:26:28.170 --> 03:26:28.961
<v Speaker 6>comes and goes.</v>

7675
03:26:28.961 --> 03:26:30.460
<v Speaker 6>It is completely different dog.</v>

7676
03:26:31.210 --> 03:26:33.890
<v Speaker 6>He was an American hero that kills a white woman.</v>

7677
03:26:34.690 --> 03:26:36.100
<v Speaker 6>You kind of see this Joe Rogan,</v>

7678
03:26:36.101 --> 03:26:37.030
<v Speaker 6>how they break it down.</v>

7679
03:26:37.290 --> 03:26:39.040
<v Speaker 6>It's just a long documentary.</v>

7680
03:26:39.041 --> 03:26:40.450
<v Speaker 6>It's 15 fucking hours.</v>

7681
03:26:41.160 --> 03:26:41.641
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joey,</v>

7682
03:26:41.641 --> 03:26:42.750
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this man.</v>

7683
03:26:42.810 --> 03:26:43.920
<v Speaker 1>How much do you know about</v>

7684
03:26:44.140 --> 03:26:44.370
<v Speaker 4>t?</v>

7685
03:26:44.370 --> 03:26:45.203
<v Speaker 4>E</v>

7686
03:26:45.770 --> 03:26:46.461
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

7687
03:26:46.461 --> 03:26:46.941
<v Speaker 6>I all,</v>

7688
03:26:46.941 --> 03:26:49.360
<v Speaker 6>I feel I saw the movie and</v>

7689
03:26:49.700 --> 03:26:50.211
<v Speaker 1>he's talking.</v>

7690
03:26:50.211 --> 03:26:51.044
<v Speaker 1>Question.</v>

7691
03:26:51.140 --> 03:26:52.010
<v Speaker 1>You saw concussion?</v>

7692
03:26:52.040 --> 03:26:52.710
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

7693
03:26:52.710 --> 03:26:52.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

7694
03:26:52.920 --> 03:26:53.753
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

7695
03:26:53.880 --> 03:26:55.950
<v Speaker 6>I showed the movie aren't you?</v>

7696
03:26:55.951 --> 03:27:00.951
<v Speaker 6>Started thinking about things and they made a lot of sense to me now saying</v>

7697
03:27:01.350 --> 03:27:01.531
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

7698
03:27:01.531 --> 03:27:04.560
<v Speaker 6>that happened over the years of people I knew who plays football.</v>

7699
03:27:05.490 --> 03:27:07.080
<v Speaker 6>It just made sense to me.</v>

7700
03:27:07.110 --> 03:27:10.470
<v Speaker 6>Like I didn't even know about the Pittsburgh Steelers,</v>

7701
03:27:10.471 --> 03:27:14.670
<v Speaker 6>all that stuff with the center and the other guy had no idea.</v>

7702
03:27:14.820 --> 03:27:15.710
<v Speaker 6>But it makes sense.</v>

7703
03:27:16.180 --> 03:27:17.390
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense available.</v>

7704
03:27:17.410 --> 03:27:19.440
<v Speaker 6>It'll happen to one of my friends when he was younger,</v>

7705
03:27:19.740 --> 03:27:20.610
<v Speaker 6>he was a senator</v>

7706
03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:25.070
<v Speaker 6>and he was also a note and he was awesome when nose guard,</v>

7707
03:27:25.350 --> 03:27:27.350
<v Speaker 6>so they get hit in the head of all the fucking time.</v>

7708
03:27:29.720 --> 03:27:30.553
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

7709
03:27:31.210 --> 03:27:34.030
<v Speaker 6>So I'm looking at the kids and how that played college ball,</v>

7710
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:37.010
<v Speaker 6>they're not that solid light.</v>

7711
03:27:37.011 --> 03:27:39.310
<v Speaker 6>The kids I grew up with that played college ball,</v>

7712
03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:40.960
<v Speaker 6>you can see that something's not,</v>

7713
03:27:41.740 --> 03:27:46.090
<v Speaker 6>I think the pro ball really puts it all to you because it puts the stress</v>

7714
03:27:46.091 --> 03:27:48.970
<v Speaker 6>combined with the hitch and now you're making money.</v>

7715
03:27:49.270 --> 03:27:50.103
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

7716
03:27:50.770 --> 03:27:53.020
<v Speaker 6>I think that really pushes it over the end.</v>

7717
03:27:53.590 --> 03:27:55.150
<v Speaker 6>That's just too many years ago.</v>

7718
03:27:55.180 --> 03:27:56.013
<v Speaker 6>They hit in the head.</v>

7719
03:27:56.150 --> 03:27:56.440
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

7720
03:27:56.440 --> 03:27:59.110
<v Speaker 6>which should become a pro when you add three or four years,</v>

7721
03:27:59.111 --> 03:27:59.944
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

7722
03:28:01.270 --> 03:28:03.070
<v Speaker 6>I don't know much about it until Joe Rogan.</v>

7723
03:28:03.460 --> 03:28:08.050
<v Speaker 6>I know that right now I could see it from the beginning is of it and some</v>

7724
03:28:08.051 --> 03:28:08.884
<v Speaker 6>fighters.</v>

7725
03:28:10.420 --> 03:28:12.070
<v Speaker 6>And if you don't see the beginning of it,</v>

7726
03:28:12.190 --> 03:28:13.900
<v Speaker 6>some fighters that you're not looking,</v>

7727
03:28:14.710 --> 03:28:16.660
<v Speaker 6>you could tell that they're a little box,</v>

7728
03:28:16.661 --> 03:28:17.494
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

7729
03:28:18.280 --> 03:28:18.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7730
03:28:18.431 --> 03:28:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because it's like when,</v>

7731
03:28:20.021 --> 03:28:23.110
<v Speaker 1>when do you make a decision when you're a fighter and Brendan,</v>

7732
03:28:23.111 --> 03:28:24.610
<v Speaker 1>you're the only one that could talk about this.</v>

7733
03:28:25.060 --> 03:28:27.220
<v Speaker 1>What do you make a decision like Gwen,</v>

7734
03:28:27.720 --> 03:28:31.380
<v Speaker 1>when your good friend Joe Rogan fucking suck.</v>

7735
03:28:33.420 --> 03:28:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I never said you suck,</v>

7736
03:28:39.550 --> 03:28:41.590
<v Speaker 6>except that once you tap that button,</v>

7737
03:28:42.100 --> 03:28:43.310
<v Speaker 6>you keep getting knocked out.</v>

7738
03:28:44.170 --> 03:28:47.740
<v Speaker 6>And I can guarantee you that those people that had more than 400 accounts over</v>

7739
03:28:47.741 --> 03:28:48.574
<v Speaker 6>the years,</v>

7740
03:28:48.730 --> 03:28:51.610
<v Speaker 6>they'll start to experience headaches or something with that vision.</v>

7741
03:28:51.760 --> 03:28:53.840
<v Speaker 1>That needs to be a way with that memory.</v>

7742
03:28:55.710 --> 03:28:56.860
<v Speaker 1>If people listening to this,</v>

7743
03:28:56.861 --> 03:28:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz is on speakerphone on Eddie Bravo,</v>

7744
03:28:59.191 --> 03:29:00.024
<v Speaker 1>his phone,</v>

7745
03:29:00.070 --> 03:29:01.660
<v Speaker 1>and he can't hear Brendan,</v>

7746
03:29:01.661 --> 03:29:02.890
<v Speaker 1>who's on the other side of the table,</v>

7747
03:29:02.891 --> 03:29:03.180
<v Speaker 1>cause ed,</v>

7748
03:29:03.180 --> 03:29:04.011
<v Speaker 1>he's got the speaker phone.</v>

7749
03:29:04.011 --> 03:29:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

7750
03:29:04.510 --> 03:29:05.530
<v Speaker 1>it's real hard to hear.</v>

7751

03:29:08.421 --> 03:29:08.591

7756
03:29:08.591 --> 03:29:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Joey,</v>

03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:09.220
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7758
03:29:09.220 --> 03:29:09.521
<v Speaker 1>Joey,</v>

7759
03:29:09.521 --> 03:29:10.181
<v Speaker 1>I think you're dead,</v>

7760
03:29:10.181 --> 03:29:10.481
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7761
03:29:10.481 --> 03:29:10.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7763
03:29:11.110 --> 03:29:11.411
<v Speaker 1>Joey.</v>

7764
03:29:11.411 --> 03:29:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd dead right.</v>

7765
03:29:12.460 --> 03:29:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I think you're dead right?</v>

7766
03:29:13.331 --> 03:29:14.050
<v Speaker 1>We all do.</v>

7767
03:29:14.050 --> 03:29:14.890
<v Speaker 1>We all agree with you.</v>

7768
03:29:15.130 --> 03:29:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I was just telling people that you couldn't hear Brendan.</v>

7769
03:29:18.050 --> 03:29:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7770
03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

7771
03:29:18.700 --> 03:29:18.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7772
03:29:18.901 --> 03:29:19.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

7773
03:29:19.120 --> 03:29:19.391
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

7774
03:29:19.391 --> 03:29:19.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7775
03:29:19.660 --> 03:29:21.820
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where you've got a wonder as a fighter.</v>

7776
03:29:21.821 --> 03:29:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Like where do you draw the line?</v>

7777
03:29:23.111 --> 03:29:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Because you'll get a guy like Alistair Overeem.</v>

7778
03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:26.740
<v Speaker 1>He's been stopped a bunch of times,</v>

7779
03:29:27.010 --> 03:29:29.260
<v Speaker 1>but Alice is about the fight for the title,</v>

7780
03:29:29.310 --> 03:29:29.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7781
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:31.030
<v Speaker 1>so when do you make that call?</v>

7782
03:29:31.030 --> 03:29:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Because Alistair's as good as he's ever been knocked out.</v>

7783
03:29:34.330 --> 03:29:34.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7784
03:29:34.811 --> 03:29:38.260
<v Speaker 1>he knocked out a junior dos Santos and a spectacular Spec type note.</v>

7785
03:29:38.261 --> 03:29:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Rothwell knocked him out.</v>

7786
03:29:39.730 --> 03:29:40.151
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

7787
03:29:40.151 --> 03:29:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Take Ben knocked him out in the first round.</v>

7788
03:29:41.930 --> 03:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

7789
03:29:42.230 --> 03:29:43.090
<v Speaker 1>here's the question,</v>

7790
03:29:43.091 --> 03:29:43.271
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

7791
03:29:43.271 --> 03:29:44.680
<v Speaker 1>What other options do they have?</v>

7792
03:29:45.220 --> 03:29:46.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why I stopped that.</v>

7793
03:29:46.370 --> 03:29:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Other options.</v>

7794
03:29:47.050 --> 03:29:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Most guys don't,</v>

7795
03:29:48.130 --> 03:29:48.910
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

7796
03:29:48.910 --> 03:29:49.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7797
03:29:49.380 --> 03:29:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

7798
03:29:49.550 --> 03:29:51.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point because people can say,</v>

7799
03:29:51.521 --> 03:29:52.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7800
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you've taken too many fights.</v>

7801
03:29:53.560 --> 03:29:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You need to stop and do what the workforce,</v>

7802
03:29:56.861 --> 03:29:57.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

7803
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.761
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7804
03:29:57.761 --> 03:29:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I make six figures fighting.</v>

7805
03:29:59.021 --> 03:30:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm get punched on shitting my pants in front of my kids.</v>

7806
03:30:02.380 --> 03:30:05.380
<v Speaker 1>But that's also don't you think that there's an important point where you have</v>

7807
03:30:05.381 --> 03:30:06.880
<v Speaker 1>to decide like whether or not it's,</v>

7808
03:30:06.881 --> 03:30:11.881
<v Speaker 1>it's what you actually want to do and you had the option to do other shit and it</v>

7809
03:30:11.951 --> 03:30:16.030
<v Speaker 1>was a perfect time for you to just step back and do other shit.</v>

7810
03:30:16.031 --> 03:30:16.870
<v Speaker 1>But some people,</v>

7811
03:30:17.020 --> 03:30:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I also have Joe Rogan,</v>

7812
03:30:18.281 --> 03:30:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Brian Cowen who helped me out and gave me a platform.</v>

7813
03:30:21.910 --> 03:30:22.990
<v Speaker 1>You're also an entertaining,</v>

7814
03:30:23.050 --> 03:30:24.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of dudes with the,</v>

7815
03:30:24.090 --> 03:30:25.090
<v Speaker 1>they would do podcasts.</v>

7816
03:30:25.091 --> 03:30:25.421

03:33:16.521 --> 03:33:17.031
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful,</v>

7922
03:33:17.031 --> 03:33:17.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7923
03:33:17.360 --> 03:33:19.850
<v Speaker 1>It's great wonder boy nasty in this fight,</v>

7924
03:33:19.851 --> 03:33:20.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7925
03:33:20.180 --> 03:33:21.500
<v Speaker 1>These highlights were watching</v>

7926
03:33:23.040 --> 03:33:25.810
<v Speaker 1>wonder boys loss was to Matt fucking bound.</v>

7927
03:33:26.720 --> 03:33:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Other than that needs starched everybody.</v>

7928
03:33:28.820 --> 03:33:29.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7929
03:33:29.001 --> 03:33:30.200
<v Speaker 1>he just fought real smart.</v>

7930
03:33:30.500 --> 03:33:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I wish were shot with stop.</v>

7931
03:33:32.960 --> 03:33:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably will eventually for sure,</v>

7932
03:33:35.961 --> 03:33:38.140
<v Speaker 1>but one of my favorite people on the planet and stuff.</v>

7933
03:33:38.430 --> 03:33:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Well that Glover fight is going to be hard for a proud former champion like him</v>

7934
03:33:42.841 --> 03:33:46.800
<v Speaker 1>to go out on if he decides to end it on the groper fight.</v>

7935
03:33:46.801 --> 03:33:47.634
<v Speaker 1>Fight for him.</v>

7936
03:33:47.700 --> 03:33:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Who's Glover fight now?</v>

7937
03:33:49.430 --> 03:33:50.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

7938
03:33:50.250 --> 03:33:52.950
<v Speaker 1>When you said Gustin in the beginning I liked Gustafson.</v>

7939
03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a great fight,</v>

7940
03:33:54.270 --> 03:33:57.930
<v Speaker 1>but Gustafson already has a fight scheduled and it might be a reason why they</v>

7941
03:33:57.931 --> 03:33:59.400
<v Speaker 1>scheduled the guy against him.</v>

7942
03:33:59.401 --> 03:34:00.234
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who it is?</v>

7943
03:34:00.270 --> 03:34:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Who is a gun?</v>

7944
03:34:01.170 --> 03:34:03.000
<v Speaker 1>They just announced it like yesterday.</v>

7945
03:34:03.001 --> 03:34:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7946
03:34:03.720 --> 03:34:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not ranked in the top 10 I know that.</v>

7947
03:34:06.510 --> 03:34:07.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird fight to make,</v>

7948
03:34:07.921 --> 03:34:08.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7949
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:09.031
<v Speaker 1>What's the name?</v>

7950
03:34:09.031 --> 03:34:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Starts with a B block coach.</v>

7951
03:34:11.590 --> 03:34:12.231
<v Speaker 1>Yon Blocker,</v>

7952
03:34:12.231 --> 03:34:13.200
<v Speaker 1>which is a good fighter.</v>

7953
03:34:13.290 --> 03:34:14.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a very good fighter,</v>

7954
03:34:14.370 --> 03:34:15.990
<v Speaker 1>but good enough to fight gusts when right.</v>

7955
03:34:15.991 --> 03:34:20.991
<v Speaker 1>Number three or 400 you can find a highlight reel for young yon blocks of it</v>

7956
03:34:22.410 --> 03:34:22.830
<v Speaker 1>honestly.</v>

7957
03:34:22.830 --> 03:34:24.660
<v Speaker 1>But the only thing is it's gusting is gone.</v>

7958
03:34:24.690 --> 03:34:24.931
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7959
03:34:24.931 --> 03:34:27.810
<v Speaker 1>he almost beat John Jones a decision.</v>

7960
03:34:27.811 --> 03:34:29.080
<v Speaker 1>He'll SPDC and decision.</v>

7961
03:34:29.081 --> 03:34:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Then you're fighting this guy.</v>

7962
03:34:30.060 --> 03:34:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Well I think he,</v>

7963
03:34:30.921 --> 03:34:32.070
<v Speaker 1>cause he said time off.</v>

7964
03:34:32.100 --> 03:34:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It's almost a welcome back.</v>

7965
03:34:33.870 --> 03:34:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't like [inaudible] had mental problems.</v>

7966
03:34:35.521 --> 03:34:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back.</v>

7967
03:34:36.090 --> 03:34:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to say almost beat.</v>

7968
03:34:39.420 --> 03:34:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I like to say lost a close fight too.</v>

7969
03:34:41.580 --> 03:34:42.413
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>

7970
03:34:42.480 --> 03:34:42.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7971
03:34:42.781 --> 03:34:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Can't say almost covered.</v>

7972
03:34:43.761 --> 03:34:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Did it really well,</v>

7973
03:34:44.280 --> 03:34:45.300
<v Speaker 1>he was beating John.</v>

7974
03:34:45.360 --> 03:34:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to beat John Jones?</v>

7975
03:34:46.770 --> 03:34:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Fuck had some moments.</v>

7976
03:34:48.190 --> 03:34:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Some good moments.</v>

7977
03:34:49.260 --> 03:34:50.730
<v Speaker 1>But you never had John Johnson trouble.</v>

7978
03:34:50.731 --> 03:34:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones always came back.</v>

7979
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:54.330
<v Speaker 1>John John's gritty as fuck.</v>

7980
03:34:54.330 --> 03:34:54.571
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7981
03:34:54.571 --> 03:34:55.390
<v Speaker 1>But he came back.</v>

7982
03:34:55.390 --> 03:34:56.223
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

7983
03:34:56.260 --> 03:34:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I just won that fight.</v>

7984
03:34:57.390 --> 03:34:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones won that fight,</v>

7985
03:34:58.860 --> 03:35:00.390
<v Speaker 1>but it was good fight.</v>

7986
03:35:00.480 --> 03:35:00.961
<v Speaker 1>It was a very,</v>

7987
03:35:00.961 --> 03:35:01.640
<v Speaker 1>very good fighter.</v>

7988
03:35:01.640 --> 03:35:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Close fight.</v>

7989
03:35:02.290 --> 03:35:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7990
03:35:02.970 --> 03:35:05.910
<v Speaker 1>See like the fight where he was in like trouble.</v>

7991
03:35:06.120 --> 03:35:09.480
<v Speaker 1>That's like the rumble Johnson fight when he fought rumble.</v>

7992
03:35:09.780 --> 03:35:11.880
<v Speaker 1>When customers that's in trouble,</v>

7993
03:35:11.940 --> 03:35:13.570
<v Speaker 1>that's in trouble losing right.</v>

7994
03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:14.760
<v Speaker 1>That's losing the fight.</v>

7995
03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7996
03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones has never been in trouble.</v>

7997
03:35:17.071 --> 03:35:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Never been in trouble.</v>

7998
03:35:17.820 --> 03:35:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Gus Fring gave him his toughest test.</v>

7999
03:35:19.320 --> 03:35:19.831
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

8000
03:35:19.831 --> 03:35:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

8001
03:35:20.250 --> 03:35:24.450
<v Speaker 1>You know and that's how John or had him in an arm bar.</v>

8002
03:35:24.690 --> 03:35:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

8003
03:35:25.320 --> 03:35:27.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm up and slammed him and then submitted them.</v>

8004
03:35:27.870 --> 03:35:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

8005
03:35:28.410 --> 03:35:31.920
<v Speaker 1>That might be one of the most dangerous times in his career because his arm was</v>

8006
03:35:31.921 --> 03:35:33.110
<v Speaker 1>completely hyper extended.</v>

8007
03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Snap does.</v>

8008
03:35:33.740 --> 03:35:35.670
<v Speaker 1>He showed what a bad mother fucker he is.</v>

8009
03:35:35.680 --> 03:35:36.513
<v Speaker 1>He did not.</v>

8010
03:35:36.750 --> 03:35:37.583
<v Speaker 1>He snapped his arm.</v>

8011
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.861
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

8012
03:35:37.861 --> 03:35:39.420
<v Speaker 1>He said he hyperextended his elbow.</v>

8013
03:35:39.780 --> 03:35:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why he took that job on the ultimate fighter with Chael</v>

8014
03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Sonnen because he wasn't going to fight for quite a long time.</v>

8015
03:35:47.250 --> 03:35:48.780
<v Speaker 1>So they knew that.</v>

8016
03:35:48.781 --> 03:35:52.020
<v Speaker 1>So they scheduled that fight next and then if you remember correctly,</v>

8017
03:35:52.170 --> 03:35:53.070
<v Speaker 1>he has that fight.</v>

8018
03:35:53.071 --> 03:35:54.300
<v Speaker 1>He beats the shit out of jail son.</v>

8019
03:35:54.301 --> 03:35:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And he breaks his toe in the process.</v>

8020
03:35:56.640 --> 03:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>He was pushing off the mat so fucking hard trying to kill [inaudible] son and</v>

8021
03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:03.810
<v Speaker 1>then he broke his own toe and spun it around.</v>

8022
03:36:03.811 --> 03:36:04.621
<v Speaker 1>You remember that Shit.</v>

8023
03:36:04.621 --> 03:36:06.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking monster.</v>

8024
03:36:06.330 --> 03:36:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Even realize it until he looked down on for pound number.</v>

8025
03:36:09.661 --> 03:36:11.490
<v Speaker 1>He was standing there after the fight was over.</v>

8026
03:36:11.491 --> 03:36:15.240
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to him and then he looked down and realized that he had twisted</v>

8027
03:36:15.241 --> 03:36:16.470
<v Speaker 1>his toe upside down.</v>

8028
03:36:16.590 --> 03:36:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Fucking nightmare.</v>

8029
03:36:18.550 --> 03:36:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Good luck had motherfucker and if DC done beat them,</v>

8030
03:36:21.781 --> 03:36:25.020
<v Speaker 1>it's all where everyone's motherfucker.</v>

8031
03:36:25.320 --> 03:36:26.153
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

8032
03:36:26.600 --> 03:36:27.960
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if he's right,</v>

8033
03:36:28.080 --> 03:36:32.370
<v Speaker 1>but Greg Jackson was saying that he thought that one of the things about John</v>

8034
03:36:32.371 --> 03:36:33.030
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

8035
03:36:33.030 --> 03:36:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think you was sluggish.</v>

8036
03:36:34.260 --> 03:36:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I thought he took a lot of time off any,</v>

8037
03:36:35.960 --> 03:36:36.611
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pressure.</v>

8038
03:36:36.611 --> 03:36:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I thought he fought very creatively and I thought he thought,</v>

8039
03:36:38.681 --> 03:36:39.514
<v Speaker 1>well us,</v>

8040
03:36:39.770 --> 03:36:40.570
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

8041
03:36:40.570 --> 03:36:41.170
<v Speaker 1>bad chick.</v>

8042
03:36:41.170 --> 03:36:41.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

8043
03:36:41.650 --> 03:36:42.483
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

8044
03:36:43.780 --> 03:36:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

8045
03:36:44.250 --> 03:36:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't think he fired his best.</v>

8046
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:49.910
<v Speaker 1>But I think considering the fact that he was off for a long time and all that</v>

8047
03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:53.590
<v Speaker 1>personal problems that he went through and he fought a real tough guy and OSP</v>

8048
03:36:53.591 --> 03:36:56.500
<v Speaker 1>that was in a fairly defensive position and a lot of the fight,</v>

8049
03:36:56.560 --> 03:36:57.820
<v Speaker 1>he didn't risk anything.</v>

8050
03:36:57.821 --> 03:36:58.481
<v Speaker 1>It's more else.</v>

8051
03:36:58.481 --> 03:36:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Very John.</v>

8052
03:36:59.260 --> 03:36:59.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8053
03:36:59.471 --> 03:37:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Osp photo smart fight.</v>

8054
03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:01.720
<v Speaker 1>You're far a smart fight.</v>

8055
03:37:01.721 --> 03:37:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Camp tested the water he did the best is Billy took some chances,</v>

8056
03:37:05.380 --> 03:37:08.290
<v Speaker 1>but he got out of the fight ultimately in pretty good shape.</v>

8057
03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:09.530
<v Speaker 1>We set bruise on his arm,</v>

8058
03:37:09.531 --> 03:37:09.930
<v Speaker 1>got broke,</v>

8059
03:37:09.930 --> 03:37:10.500
<v Speaker 1>come to win.</v>

8060
03:37:10.500 --> 03:37:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

8061
03:37:10.670 --> 03:37:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Another guy who his arm got broke by kick.</v>

8062
03:37:12.230 --> 03:37:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8063
03:37:12.940 --> 03:37:14.020
<v Speaker 1>John broke his arm.</v>

8064
03:37:14.050 --> 03:37:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Probably significantly slowed him down.</v>

8065
03:37:15.910 --> 03:37:16.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8066
03:37:16.960 --> 03:37:19.120
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't think it was a bad performance at all.</v>

8067
03:37:19.150 --> 03:37:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I think osps fucking good man and getting better and a dangerous eats a tricky</v>

8068
03:37:24.071 --> 03:37:24.841
<v Speaker 1>fight for anybody.</v>

8069
03:37:24.841 --> 03:37:26.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a super powerful guy.</v>

8070
03:37:26.100 --> 03:37:27.040
<v Speaker 1>So South Paul,</v>

8071
03:37:27.041 --> 03:37:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

8072
03:37:27.260 --> 03:37:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I just thought John Look kind of lackadaisical.</v>

8073
03:37:29.440 --> 03:37:30.370
<v Speaker 1>He didn't risk anything,</v>

8074
03:37:30.371 --> 03:37:31.420
<v Speaker 1>get too much to lose.</v>

8075
03:37:31.450 --> 03:37:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Just a lot of factors,</v>

8076
03:37:32.410 --> 03:37:36.310
<v Speaker 1>a lot of factors and also getting that off of his chest and then getting back in</v>

8077
03:37:36.311 --> 03:37:37.150
<v Speaker 1>there and fighting.</v>

8078
03:37:37.151 --> 03:37:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Daniel is going to be like a warmup fight against a top six guy.</v>

8079
03:37:41.710 --> 03:37:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's the OSP was I'm pretty sure it was ranked number six.</v>

8080
03:37:44.070 --> 03:37:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8081
03:37:44.240 --> 03:37:44.830
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

8082
03:37:44.830 --> 03:37:46.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a great thing for John.</v>

8083
03:37:46.210 --> 03:37:47.470
<v Speaker 1>He also didn't show anything.</v>

8084
03:37:47.500 --> 03:37:47.830
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

8085
03:37:47.830 --> 03:37:48.011
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

8086
03:37:48.011 --> 03:37:49.960
<v Speaker 1>he really didn't show DC anything.</v>

8087
03:37:50.740 --> 03:37:54.760
<v Speaker 1>But what I was gonna say is it Greg Jackson seem to think allegedly after that</v>

8088
03:37:54.761 --> 03:37:58.720
<v Speaker 1>fight that the weightlifting might've played a part in him look tight.</v>

8089
03:37:59.350 --> 03:38:00.130
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>

8090
03:38:00.130 --> 03:38:00.963
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

8091
03:38:00.970 --> 03:38:01.600
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>

8092
03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're in the weight room,</v>

8093
03:38:02.771 --> 03:38:04.150
<v Speaker 1>you put on more muscle,</v>

8094
03:38:04.360 --> 03:38:04.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8095
03:38:04.631 --> 03:38:05.441
<v Speaker 1>you're slower,</v>

8096
03:38:05.441 --> 03:38:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you're a little more,</v>

8097
03:38:06.130 --> 03:38:08.020
<v Speaker 1>the more you know you're not as fluid.</v>

8098
03:38:08.260 --> 03:38:08.491
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

8099
03:38:08.491 --> 03:38:10.590
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting cause he didn't fight for a while and you went through the</v>

8100
03:38:10.591 --> 03:38:11.020
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

8101
03:38:11.020 --> 03:38:11.890
<v Speaker 1>He was in jail.</v>

8102
03:38:12.780 --> 03:38:13.601
<v Speaker 1>Hey Greg Jackson.</v>

8103
03:38:13.601 --> 03:38:14.434
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more,</v>

8104
03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Hey Greg Jackson.</v>

8105
03:38:15.670 --> 03:38:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more that he t boned a pregnant lady ran from the scene.</v>

8106
03:38:19.540 --> 03:38:20.860
<v Speaker 1>He had some time in jail.</v>

8107
03:38:20.900 --> 03:38:21.461
<v Speaker 1>You didn't find,</v>

8108
03:38:21.461 --> 03:38:22.181
<v Speaker 1>not gone forever.</v>

8109
03:38:22.181 --> 03:38:25.390
<v Speaker 1>It's called doc gun rusk and they thought it very talented south Paul who is</v>

8110
03:38:25.391 --> 03:38:26.350
<v Speaker 1>tricky to deal with.</v>

8111
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:27.760
<v Speaker 1>That's more what it is.</v>

8112
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:28.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

8113
03:38:28.450 --> 03:38:30.430
<v Speaker 1>it ain't the weight lifting well,</v>

8114
03:38:30.580 --> 03:38:31.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

8115
03:38:31.031 --> 03:38:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you would like it immediately,</v>

8116
03:38:33.740 --> 03:38:38.410
<v Speaker 1>like blame one aspect because one of the things it was after I talked to John or</v>

8117
03:38:38.411 --> 03:38:39.910
<v Speaker 1>while I was talking to John after the fight,</v>

8118
03:38:40.330 --> 03:38:44.050
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that he said was that he felt physically felt great.</v>

8119
03:38:44.260 --> 03:38:45.100
<v Speaker 1>He just wasn't,</v>

8120
03:38:45.550 --> 03:38:48.400
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't engaging enough or it wasn't pulling the trigger and you wanted to,</v>

8121
03:38:48.580 --> 03:38:51.520
<v Speaker 1>this was probably like just a comfort thing.</v>

8122
03:38:51.521 --> 03:38:51.761
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

8123
03:38:51.761 --> 03:38:53.380
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't been fighting in a long time.</v>

8124
03:38:53.381 --> 03:38:54.101
<v Speaker 1>All the pressure,</v>

8125
03:38:54.101 --> 03:38:54.680
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

8126
03:38:54.680 --> 03:38:58.360
<v Speaker 1>he's like probably quite a few factors and maybe even it's not either or.</v>

8127
03:38:58.630 --> 03:39:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even the weightlifting might have slowed him down a little bit.</v>

8128
03:39:02.680 --> 03:39:03.221
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

8129
03:39:03.221 --> 03:39:04.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the number of things,</v>

8130
03:39:04.181 --> 03:39:05.860
<v Speaker 1>but look at Gusto when he's been out for a while.</v>

8131
03:39:05.890 --> 03:39:07.090
<v Speaker 1>They gave him a pretty,</v>

8132
03:39:07.350 --> 03:39:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's a warm up fight,</v>

8133
03:39:08.531 --> 03:39:09.790
<v Speaker 1>but he's not finding a top 10 guy.</v>

8134
03:39:10.060 --> 03:39:13.990
<v Speaker 1>John's warmup fight was against the number six guy in the world where the South</v>

8135
03:39:13.990 --> 03:39:13.991
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

8136
03:39:13.991 --> 03:39:15.700
<v Speaker 1>who's explosives as fuck,</v>

8137
03:39:15.940 --> 03:39:17.650
<v Speaker 1>he's supposed to fight for the world title.</v>

8138
03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:19.270
<v Speaker 1>So John was being a little hesitant,</v>

8139
03:39:19.271 --> 03:39:19.870
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>

8140
03:39:19.870 --> 03:39:20.920
<v Speaker 1>He knows what's on the line.</v>

8141
03:39:21.190 --> 03:39:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Is there some sort of history between Gustafson,</v>

8142
03:39:23.381 --> 03:39:24.214
<v Speaker 1>the guys fighting?</v>

8143
03:39:24.490 --> 03:39:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Is there a reason why they're going to file things?</v>

8144
03:39:26.171 --> 03:39:27.550
<v Speaker 1>I think remember Gastrin was like,</v>

8145
03:39:27.551 --> 03:39:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I want to do this anymore.</v>

8146
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:30.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's more of like,</v>

8147
03:39:30.890 --> 03:39:31.860
<v Speaker 1>text me water against,</v>

8148
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:33.230
<v Speaker 1>let's see if this is for you.</v>

8149
03:39:33.231 --> 03:39:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Go through a 12 week training camp.</v>

8150
03:39:34.491 --> 03:39:35.301
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what happens.</v>

8151
03:39:35.301 --> 03:39:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're phenomenal fighter.</v>

8152
03:39:37.100 --> 03:39:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

8153
03:39:37.660 --> 03:39:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8154
03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:39.410
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting man.</v>

8155
03:39:39.620 --> 03:39:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm like you as a fighter,</v>

8156
03:39:42.140 --> 03:39:45.020
<v Speaker 1>when a fighter starts entertaining those thoughts of stopping,</v>

8157
03:39:45.140 --> 03:39:45.973
<v Speaker 1>it's game over.</v>

8158
03:39:46.880 --> 03:39:47.713
<v Speaker 1>It's game over.</v>

8159
03:39:48.380 --> 03:39:49.970
<v Speaker 1>It's game over you and it,</v>

8160
03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:51.073
<v Speaker 1>it's game over.</v>

8161
03:39:51.540 --> 03:39:52.560
<v Speaker 1>It really is B.</v>

8162
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And this has come from a guy who didn't think that way for a long time.</v>

8163
03:39:55.400 --> 03:39:56.041
<v Speaker 1>Even when he told them,</v>

8164
03:39:56.041 --> 03:39:56.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

8165
03:39:56.301 --> 03:39:56.901
<v Speaker 1>what's he talking about?</v>

8166
03:39:56.901 --> 03:39:57.770
<v Speaker 1>One flooded in one for that.</v>

8167
03:39:58.010 --> 03:39:59.420
<v Speaker 1>And then when it finally the dust cell,</v>

8168
03:39:59.421 --> 03:40:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

8169
03:40:00.080 --> 03:40:01.180
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of fucking right.</v>

8170
03:40:01.181 --> 03:40:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Cause then when you're fighting guys who it's all they have good life being a</v>

8171
03:40:04.431 --> 03:40:08.780
<v Speaker 1>glow overtake share who's in fucking Connecticut in the snow running sprints and</v>

8172
03:40:08.781 --> 03:40:11.210
<v Speaker 1>all he gives a fuck about is knocking you out.</v>

8173
03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Or Anthony Johnson,</v>

8174
03:40:12.321 --> 03:40:13.580
<v Speaker 1>who all he cares about his knock,</v>

8175
03:40:13.581 --> 03:40:13.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:38.783
<v Speaker 1>You can do with that.</v>

8465
03:47:39.070 --> 03:47:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8466
03:47:39.230 --> 03:47:39.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8467
03:47:39.671 --> 03:47:40.750
<v Speaker 1>here's my question.</v>

8468
03:47:40.900 --> 03:47:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know thing.</v>

8469
03:47:42.040 --> 03:47:43.330
<v Speaker 1>We know each other where I can say,</v>

8470
03:47:43.331 --> 03:47:43.781
<v Speaker 1>hey brother,</v>

8471
03:47:43.781 --> 03:47:44.614
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

8472
03:47:45.370 --> 03:47:47.210
<v Speaker 1>How do you distinguish a guy like Shane Mosley from a garlic,</v>

8473
03:47:47.230 --> 03:47:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Hopkins like Gag Bernard Hopkins.</v>

8474
03:47:50.590 --> 03:47:52.510
<v Speaker 1>If he thinks that he can fight somebody,</v>

8475
03:47:52.511 --> 03:47:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him see if he can fight that guy.</v>

8476
03:47:54.460 --> 03:47:54.951
<v Speaker 1>Even if it,</v>

8477
03:47:54.951 --> 03:47:57.940
<v Speaker 1>even though he's 49 or almost 50 I mean that guy,</v>

8478
03:47:58.510 --> 03:48:02.540
<v Speaker 1>the only guy that really kind of dismantled his defense was Kovalev Kavala.</v>

8479
03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Put them in some real trouble.</v>

8480
03:48:03.820 --> 03:48:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Real trouble.</v>

8481
03:48:04.390 --> 03:48:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Kovalev to me might be the best in the world.</v>

8482
03:48:06.101 --> 03:48:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Pound for pound.</v>

8483
03:48:06.700 --> 03:48:07.600
<v Speaker 1>He's one of them.</v>

8484
03:48:07.660 --> 03:48:09.790
<v Speaker 1>He's done top three could article Lufkin.</v>

8485
03:48:09.820 --> 03:48:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Him apparently had some wars and some boxing wars.</v>

8486
03:48:13.031 --> 03:48:15.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the rumors are they're both nasty,</v>

8487
03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:17.320
<v Speaker 1>nasty fucking knockout.</v>

8488
03:48:17.321 --> 03:48:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Russia's own combat sports.</v>

8489
03:48:18.940 --> 03:48:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Really think about it.</v>

8490
03:48:20.170 --> 03:48:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Not really named one UFC Russian champion</v>

8491
03:48:24.340 --> 03:48:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Nigga,</v>

8492
03:48:25.060 --> 03:48:25.893
<v Speaker 1>Nigga Madoff.</v>

03:48:25.930 --> 03:48:26.763
<v Speaker 1>Do I get him?</v>

8494
03:48:27.280 --> 03:48:28.113
<v Speaker 1>He'll be</v>

8495
03:48:32.780 --> 03:48:34.940
<v Speaker 1>jumping to conclusions.</v>

8496
03:48:34.941 --> 03:48:36.020
<v Speaker 1>He might have some good shit.</v>

8497
03:48:37.370 --> 03:48:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Habib's on defeated.</v>

8498
03:48:38.721 --> 03:48:39.554

03:48:39.620 --> 03:48:40.431
<v Speaker 1>Stopped him here.</v>

8500
03:48:40.431 --> 03:48:41.810
<v Speaker 1>He beat the champion of Santos.</v>

8501
03:48:42.480 --> 03:48:43.530
<v Speaker 1>He's 55</v>

8502
03:48:45.570 --> 03:48:47.050
<v Speaker 1>he's the outlier and fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them bud.</v>

8506
03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Some fury fury just beat Vladimir Klitschko.</v>

8507
03:48:54.800 --> 03:48:55.670
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting again.</v>

8508
03:48:55.820 --> 03:48:55.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8509
03:48:55.971 --> 03:48:57.680

<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

8515
03:49:02.480 --> 03:49:03.890
<v Speaker 1>But Andre Ward might be able to beat him.</v>

8516
03:49:03.980 --> 03:49:04.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

8517
03:49:05.300 --> 03:49:06.880
<v Speaker 1>He better fight more than fracking.</v>

03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:23.150
<v Speaker 1>after he won his last fight.</v>

8556
03:50:26.240 --> 03:50:26.781
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

8557

8562
03:50:35.800 --> 03:50:38.270
<v Speaker 1>So it was about misunderstanding.</v>

8563
03:50:38.380 --> 03:50:39.213

<v Speaker 1>he can threaten.</v>

8581
03:51:01.430 --> 03:51:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Cause once he gets to the,</v>

8582
03:51:02.360 --> 03:51:03.470
<v Speaker 1>once he got to the ground,</v>

8589
03:51:13.180 --> 03:51:13.771
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

8590
03:51:13.771 --> 03:51:17.210
<v Speaker 1>it's more of like how quickly would he be able to progress to the back.</v>

8591
03:51:17.240 --> 03:51:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It was just a matter of time.</v>

8592
03:51:18.240 --> 03:51:19.070

03:51:44.640 --> 03:51:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Eddie went down there.</v>

8608
03:51:45.930 --> 03:51:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I saw him like in his prime.</v>

8609
03:51:47.701 --> 03:51:49.190
<v Speaker 1>He got some really high level guys.</v>

8610
03:51:49.191 --> 03:51:49.741
<v Speaker 1>See I heard,</v>

8611
03:51:49.741 --> 03:51:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I heard eating that I heard even then,</v>

8612
03:51:52.141 --> 03:51:54.210
<v Speaker 1>he never lived up to his potential.</v>

8613
03:51:54.211 --> 03:51:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I heard in the trains.</v>

8614
03:51:55.090 --> 03:51:55.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

8615
03:51:55.591 --> 03:51:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I've heard like it at,</v>

8616
03:51:57.211 --> 03:51:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I've never grabbed the guy.</v>

8617
03:51:58.140 --> 03:51:58.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

8618
03:51:59.010 --> 03:52:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I think I've met him once passing through UFC.</v>

8619
03:52:02.610 --> 03:52:03.690
<v Speaker 1>He's like a Centaur.</v>

8620
03:52:03.700 --> 03:52:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Like he's the stories I hear from other people and legit people are nuts.</v>

8621
03:52:07.650 --> 03:52:12.650
<v Speaker 1>One thing that was clear with Joe Soto and Ebi for was his leg locks were really</v>

8622
03:52:12.811 --> 03:52:15.440
<v Speaker 1>good in his leg lock defense hasn't trail enough.</v>

8623
03:52:15.530 --> 03:52:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8624
03:52:15.780 --> 03:52:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and it was because of Dave truck.</v>

8625
03:52:17.400 --> 03:52:21.600
<v Speaker 1>He's been all about leg locks for the last 10 15 years and he got to the finals</v>

8626
03:52:21.900 --> 03:52:24.660
<v Speaker 1>against Eddie Cummings who just leg locked three dudes in a row.</v>

8627
03:52:25.130 --> 03:52:27.630
<v Speaker 1>And you would think nobody ever sits on their ass in place.</v>

8628
03:52:27.631 --> 03:52:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Footsies with any Cummins.</v>

8629
03:52:28.751 --> 03:52:29.970
<v Speaker 1>They genuinely don't that.</v>

8630
03:52:30.290 --> 03:52:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8631
03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:30.901
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

8632
03:52:30.901 --> 03:52:31.141
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

8633
03:52:31.141 --> 03:52:31.470
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

8634
03:52:31.470 --> 03:52:34.170
<v Speaker 1>let's try to get around those legs and try to play smash.</v>

8635
03:52:34.320 --> 03:52:35.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what everyone's trying to do.</v>

8636
03:52:35.311 --> 03:52:37.500
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to go like for legs with no Eddie Cummins.</v>

8637
03:52:37.620 --> 03:52:41.870
<v Speaker 1>But Joe Soto did in the fucking Tony and no,</v>

8638
03:52:42.120 --> 03:52:42.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

8639
03:52:42.440 --> 03:52:42.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

8640
03:52:42.900 --> 03:52:43.710
<v Speaker 1>But Eddie Cummings is,</v>

8641
03:52:43.710 --> 03:52:44.461
<v Speaker 1>he's the champion.</v>

8642
03:52:44.461 --> 03:52:45.930
<v Speaker 1>He's coming back to defend the belt.</v>

8643
03:52:45.931 --> 03:52:46.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a Saturday,</v>

8644
03:52:47.100 --> 03:52:49.050
<v Speaker 1>July 16th on fight pass.</v>

8645
03:52:49.080 --> 03:52:49.913
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

8646
03:52:51.720 --> 03:52:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Ebi On fucking five pounds.</v>

8647
03:52:54.800 --> 03:52:55.560
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

8648
03:52:55.560 --> 03:52:56.251
<v Speaker 1>It's going well.</v>

8649
03:52:56.251 --> 03:52:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So good and Fucker,</v>

8650
03:52:57.570 --> 03:53:02.370
<v Speaker 1>it's took best grappling format that's ever been created far which is such a</v>

8651
03:53:02.371 --> 03:53:03.121
<v Speaker 1>smart move,</v>

8652
03:53:03.121 --> 03:53:03.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

8653
03:53:03.360 --> 03:53:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Have Fun when you guys went fucking.</v>

8654
03:53:05.940 --> 03:53:08.400
<v Speaker 1>But it's fights moving wheel fucking white</v>

8655
03:53:12.080 --> 03:53:13.170
<v Speaker 1>about five shows.</v>

8656
03:53:13.530 --> 03:53:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Is that the one thing that king of the cage had that no one else had is they</v>

8657
03:53:17.081 --> 03:53:18.360
<v Speaker 1>would have to 13 fights,</v>

8658
03:53:18.600 --> 03:53:19.800
<v Speaker 1>but there would be no waiting.</v>

8659
03:53:19.801 --> 03:53:21.120
<v Speaker 1>As soon as one fight was done,</v>

8660
03:53:21.150 --> 03:53:21.780
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

8661
03:53:21.780 --> 03:53:22.710
<v Speaker 1>they start the next fight.</v>

8662
03:53:22.711 --> 03:53:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

8663
03:53:23.320 --> 03:53:23.810
<v Speaker 1>As that.</v>

8664
03:53:23.810 --> 03:53:24.481
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad idea.</v>

8665
03:53:24.481 --> 03:53:27.210
<v Speaker 1>But I hear you for Judah to for well,</v>

8666
03:53:27.240 --> 03:53:31.620
<v Speaker 1>for anything it's great because it just moves the show along and you know,</v>

8667
03:53:31.950 --> 03:53:32.131
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8668
03:53:32.131 --> 03:53:32.700
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

8669
03:53:32.700 --> 03:53:32.881
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8670
03:53:32.881 --> 03:53:35.700
<v Speaker 1>behind schedule because we've had to do everything in a three hour block because</v>

8671
03:53:35.701 --> 03:53:37.260
<v Speaker 1>of paper view and we're behind.</v>

8672
03:53:37.261 --> 03:53:39.000
<v Speaker 1>So we weren't even showing replace.</v>

8673
03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:40.320
<v Speaker 1>People thought that that was our style.</v>

8674
03:53:40.321 --> 03:53:41.101
<v Speaker 1>We don't show replays.</v>

8675
03:53:41.101 --> 03:53:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Like we didn't even have time for replaced go.</v>

8676
03:53:43.190 --> 03:53:43.810
<v Speaker 1>We were just go,</v>

8677
03:53:43.810 --> 03:53:44.041
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

8678
03:53:44.041 --> 03:53:44.290
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

8679
03:53:44.290 --> 03:53:45.123
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

8680
03:53:45.330 --> 03:53:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that little girl still ripping heels off?</v>

8681
03:53:49.410 --> 03:53:49.801
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

8682
03:53:49.801 --> 03:53:50.634
<v Speaker 1>He turned my grace.</v>

8683
03:53:50.670 --> 03:53:51.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

8684
03:53:51.630 --> 03:53:52.980
<v Speaker 1>The only one ripping heels off.</v>

8685
03:53:53.070 --> 03:53:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh Riley,</v>

8686
03:53:54.690 --> 03:53:57.150
<v Speaker 1>she's gonna fight soul snatcher in September.</v>

8687
03:53:57.260 --> 03:53:57.990
<v Speaker 1>You're better.</v>

8688
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8689
03:53:58.340 --> 03:53:59.040
<v Speaker 1>we gotta find a,</v>

8690
03:53:59.040 --> 03:53:59.761
<v Speaker 1>an opponent for,</v>

8691
03:53:59.761 --> 03:54:00.710
<v Speaker 1>we don't have an opponent for it,</v>

8692
03:54:00.711 --> 03:54:03.390
<v Speaker 1>but grace is fighting and Ebi seven as well.</v>

8693
03:54:03.391 --> 03:54:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm super curious to see how this is received because as a person who loves</v>

8694
03:54:07.771 --> 03:54:08.604
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

8695
03:54:09.060 --> 03:54:10.450
<v Speaker 1>and I think we could all agree on this,</v>

8696
03:54:10.470 --> 03:54:12.450
<v Speaker 1>like one of the big problems that you've been involved in these kinds of</v>

8697
03:54:12.451 --> 03:54:12.811
<v Speaker 1>matches,</v>

8698
03:54:12.811 --> 03:54:16.110
<v Speaker 1>they go to draw and it's like a lot of them go to draw and you'll have a</v>

8699
03:54:16.111 --> 03:54:18.880
<v Speaker 1>professional matches four five six in a row and nothing happened.</v>

8700
03:54:18.881 --> 03:54:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Super Boring and nothing happened.</v>

8701
03:54:20.400 --> 03:54:20.990
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

8702
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:22.890
<v Speaker 1>the draws are boring though.</v>

8703
03:54:22.891 --> 03:54:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Some are amazing</v>

8704
03:54:24.940 --> 03:54:29.940
<v Speaker 3>on 100% peritoneum versus who said mark behind the great draw for the public.</v>

8705
03:54:31.721 --> 03:54:32.860
<v Speaker 3>They're not trying to see that</v>

8706
03:54:34.480 --> 03:54:34.770
<v Speaker 3>joy.</v>

8707
03:54:34.770 --> 03:54:35.890
<v Speaker 3>The mouth finishes.</v>

8708
03:54:35.920 --> 03:54:36.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

8709
03:54:36.281 --> 03:54:37.120
<v Speaker 3>but they still enjoy them.</v>

8710
03:54:37.121 --> 03:54:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Not just saying if you out ratings you need finishes or none.</v>

8711
03:54:40.031 --> 03:54:42.910
<v Speaker 3>That's what you mean sort of.</v>

8712
03:54:42.911 --> 03:54:47.911
<v Speaker 3>But I see your point too because there's something interesting about a fight</v>

8713
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:51.550
<v Speaker 3>that gets that close to being finished several times with a guy escapes and you</v>

8714
03:54:51.551 --> 03:54:54.100
<v Speaker 3>don't know exactly what's going to happen and there's a lot of drama.</v>

8715
03:54:54.310 --> 03:54:56.020
<v Speaker 3>And then it gets to the end and it still drama,</v>

8716
03:54:56.050 --> 03:54:59.800
<v Speaker 3>but it would be infinitely better if then they moved into your format.</v>

8717
03:54:59.830 --> 03:55:04.830
<v Speaker 3>That's what they went to draw was pretty good because it was a technical jujitsu</v>

8718
03:55:04.901 --> 03:55:05.231
<v Speaker 3>battle,</v>

8719
03:55:05.231 --> 03:55:09.580
<v Speaker 3>but your format makes that draw one of the best fights in the history of the</v>

8720
03:55:09.581 --> 03:55:10.414
<v Speaker 3>world</v>

8721
03:55:12.740 --> 03:55:15.700
<v Speaker 3>because all of a sudden the has got Jake shields back and he starts,</v>

8722
03:55:15.701 --> 03:55:19.030
<v Speaker 3>he starts with the over under or Jake's got his back and he starts to go over</v>

8723
03:55:19.031 --> 03:55:19.211
<v Speaker 3>under,</v>

8724
03:55:19.211 --> 03:55:19.870
<v Speaker 3>that's all I'm saying.</v>

8725
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Any your format proves that we want to see people try and finish because if you</v>

8726
03:55:24.611 --> 03:55:25.870
<v Speaker 3>have the metamor style though,</v>

8727
03:55:25.930 --> 03:55:29.690
<v Speaker 3>it proves that that thing's not working styles.</v>

8728
03:55:30.730 --> 03:55:32.530
<v Speaker 3>Is that your style?</v>

8729
03:55:32.650 --> 03:55:34.270
<v Speaker 3>That could work the metamor style.</v>

8730
03:55:34.390 --> 03:55:38.550
<v Speaker 3>If there was more incentive to win instead of a draw,</v>

8731
03:55:38.590 --> 03:55:39.670
<v Speaker 3>there's men an incentive.</v>

8732
03:55:39.850 --> 03:55:40.481
<v Speaker 3>People were like,</v>

8733
03:55:40.481 --> 03:55:42.050
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to lose weight set up off.</v>

8734
03:55:42.860 --> 03:55:43.870
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>

8735
03:55:44.080 --> 03:55:45.700
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the draws is when you have,</v>

8736
03:55:45.790 --> 03:55:47.710
<v Speaker 3>when it's clear that the one of the fighters are,</v>

8737
03:55:47.711 --> 03:55:50.140
<v Speaker 3>both of the fighters are totally satisfied with the draw.</v>

8738
03:55:50.141 --> 03:55:50.441
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

8739
03:55:50.441 --> 03:55:50.811
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

8740
03:55:50.811 --> 03:55:51.644
<v Speaker 3>Who you tell him.</v>

8741
03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:52.600
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

8742
03:55:52.600 --> 03:55:54.070
<v Speaker 3>As long as there's then,</v>

8743
03:55:54.340 --> 03:55:55.780
<v Speaker 3>then it's a problem,</v>

8744
03:55:56.020 --> 03:55:56.321
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

8745
03:55:56.321 --> 03:55:58.840
<v Speaker 3>But if two guys are really going after it,</v>

8746
03:55:58.990 --> 03:55:59.890
<v Speaker 3>then it's not a problem.</v>

8747

<v Speaker 3>It's a mental problem.</v>

8788
03:57:08.930 --> 03:57:09.780
<v Speaker 3>There's something wrong with me.</v>

03:57:25.001 --> 03:57:26.220
<v Speaker 1>So recessed we're setting.</v>

8798
03:57:27.320 --> 03:57:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I would protest against sense.</v>

8799
03:57:30.860 --> 03:57:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Jesus got one job.</v>

8800
03:57:33.140 --> 03:57:35.840
<v Speaker 1>You drive in a psalm and you know those things break dude.</v>

8803
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a different one.</v>

8804
03:57:41.320 --> 03:57:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

8805
03:57:41.680 --> 03:57:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess they have a bunch of fucking accidents.</v>

8806
03:57:43.840 --> 03:57:44.900
<v Speaker 1>That one's on fire,</v>

8807
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.261
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>

8808
03:57:45.261 --> 03:57:46.130
<v Speaker 1>That's no big deal.</v>

8809
03:57:46.190 --> 03:57:46.760
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

8810
03:57:46.760 --> 03:57:49.220
<v Speaker 1>That's like a Batmobile you have to run at this point.</v>

8811
03:57:49.310 --> 03:57:49.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8812
03:57:49.521 --> 03:57:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

8813
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

8814
03:57:50.941 --> 03:57:51.774
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

8815
03:57:51.890 --> 03:57:52.191
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

8816
03:57:52.191 --> 03:57:52.990
<v Speaker 1>This car racing.</v>

8817
03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:53.823
<v Speaker 1>Just got</v>

8818
03:57:55.080 --> 03:57:55.913
<v Speaker 1>any movies.</v>

8819
03:57:55.960 --> 03:57:58.850
<v Speaker 1>What happens at that point that you've got to get the fuck out of dodge before</v>

8820
03:57:58.851 --> 03:58:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you become a part of the problem.</v>

8821
03:58:00.230 --> 03:58:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I want them to look like actual cars that are dope.</v>

8822
03:58:03.530 --> 03:58:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I think racing is fucking probably so unbelievably exciting,</v>

8823
03:58:08.031 --> 03:58:11.870
<v Speaker 1>but the consequences are absolutely devastated.</v>

8824
03:58:12.200 --> 03:58:12.890
<v Speaker 1>You Die.</v>

8825
03:58:12.890 --> 03:58:14.780
<v Speaker 1>How crazy do you have to be to race a car like that?</v>

8826
03:58:15.610 --> 03:58:16.443
<v Speaker 1>They all crazy.</v>

8827
03:58:16.460 --> 03:58:16.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

8828
03:58:16.821 --> 03:58:20.090
<v Speaker 1>they develop a real good sense of how to control the car.</v>

8829
03:58:20.120 --> 03:58:23.630
<v Speaker 1>And then at a high level you're around a lot of other people with a really good</v>

8830
03:58:23.631 --> 03:58:26.570
<v Speaker 1>sense of how to control car and then you got to mind each other.</v>

8831
03:58:26.571 --> 03:58:28.250
<v Speaker 1>And that was like one of the things about,</v>

8832
03:58:28.251 --> 03:58:29.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8833
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:30.110
<v Speaker 1>that fucking dude,</v>

8834
03:58:30.380 --> 03:58:30.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8835
03:58:30.920 --> 03:58:31.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8836
03:58:31.520 --> 03:58:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Ayrton Senna.</v>

8837
03:58:33.080 --> 03:58:35.480
<v Speaker 1>If you ever seen that documentary on Ayrton Senna,</v>

8838
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:40.510
<v Speaker 1>he's a Brazilian guy who was a formula one racer who was extremely aggressive.</v>

8839
03:58:40.880 --> 03:58:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Formula One.</v>

8840
03:58:41.901 --> 03:58:42.830
<v Speaker 1>He's a race car driver.</v>

8841
03:58:43.100 --> 03:58:44.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about this stuff.</v>

8842
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I believe that he was Formula One,</v>

8843
03:58:47.030 --> 03:58:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but if they had a documentary on him and was fucking genius,</v>

8844
03:58:50.181 --> 03:58:50.421
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

8845
03:58:50.421 --> 03:58:51.254
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant.</v>

8846
03:58:51.620 --> 03:58:56.620
<v Speaker 1>He was just this dude who just felt where the car was going at a level,</v>

8847
03:58:57.051 --> 03:59:02.051
<v Speaker 1>like at an understanding that very few people ever get to and he would push it</v>

8848
03:59:02.151 --> 03:59:03.890
<v Speaker 1>to that fucking limit.</v>

8849
03:59:04.280 --> 03:59:08.360
<v Speaker 1>He like had this feeling for what a car could and couldn't do and he,</v>

8850
03:59:08.361 --> 03:59:12.800
<v Speaker 1>he better than almost anybody of his era could get the car to that limit and</v>

8851
03:59:12.801 --> 03:59:13.810
<v Speaker 1>everybody was scared of him.</v>

8852
03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:14.481
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>

8853
03:59:14.481 --> 03:59:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Super Dangerous.</v>

8854
03:59:15.560 --> 03:59:19.070
<v Speaker 1>You got a Porsche nine 11 g r s you need to step your game up.</v>

8855
03:59:19.071 --> 03:59:19.904
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

8856
03:59:20.150 --> 03:59:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Look your gt three C I don't want to do those.</v>

8857
03:59:23.940 --> 03:59:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8858
03:59:24.360 --> 03:59:25.193

8859
03:59:25.370 --> 03:59:26.090
<v Speaker 1>He do.</v>

8860
03:59:26.090 --> 03:59:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't.</v>

8861
03:59:27.020 --> 03:59:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I like going [inaudible] damn.</v>

8862
03:59:29.150 --> 03:59:30.440
<v Speaker 1>One step below this.</v>

8863
03:59:30.740 --> 03:59:31.340
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

8864
03:59:31.340 --> 03:59:34.970
<v Speaker 1>but I like to go through a canyon and a slightly unreasonable race rate of</v>

8865
03:59:34.971 --> 03:59:35.600
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>

8866
03:59:35.600 --> 03:59:36.410
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

8867
03:59:36.410 --> 03:59:37.071
<v Speaker 1>Just slightly.</v>

8868
03:59:37.071 --> 03:59:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

8869
03:59:37.180 --> 03:59:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

8872
03:59:39.220 --> 03:59:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's take it easy.</v>

8873
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I or hear a rumble shift.</v>

8874
03:59:42.160 --> 03:59:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I like to feel a car pulling into a corner.</v>

8875
03:59:44.540 --> 03:59:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to break the law that deep.</v>

8876
03:59:46.520 --> 03:59:47.930
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers are crazy,</v>

8889
04:00:15.330 --> 04:00:16.163
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

8890
04:00:17.900 --> 04:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>they can get really bad now.</v>

8891
04:00:19.351 --> 04:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And there's the walk away from it.</v>

8892
04:00:20.940 --> 04:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Is it because of the new technology?</v>

8893
04:00:22.830 --> 04:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>They barely are moving in those little cockpits.</v>

8894
04:00:24.631 --> 04:00:25.464
<v Speaker 1>Their heads are.</v>

8895
04:00:26.920 --> 04:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>That's actually really good news,</v>

8896
04:00:28.531 --> 04:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

8897
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:29.663
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew that.</v>

8898
04:00:30.390 --> 04:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I do know that.</v>

8899
04:00:31.080 --> 04:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Jamie.</v>

8900
04:00:32.040 --> 04:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

8901
04:00:32.790 --> 04:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Well that's awesome that they figured that out and it definitely is a comfort,</v>

8902
04:00:37.170 --> 04:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a dangerous sport but dangerous endeavor and these guys are</v>

8903
04:00:41.911 --> 04:00:42.721
<v Speaker 1>athletes for sure.</v>

8904
04:00:42.721 --> 04:00:42.991
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

8905
04:00:42.991 --> 04:00:43.824
<v Speaker 1>I would agree.</v>

8906
04:00:44.520 --> 04:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of fucking,</v>

8907
04:00:46.110 --> 04:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be tuned in.</v>

8908
04:00:47.880 --> 04:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>It's exhausting.</v>

8909
04:00:49.150 --> 04:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Some of these guys are great man to physical activity.</v>

8910
04:00:53.460 --> 04:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>It's arguable.</v>

8911
04:00:54.331 --> 04:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not athletes in the same extent.</v>

8912
04:00:56.310 --> 04:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not an athlete to the same extent as like an MMA fighter or a basketball</v>

8913
04:01:00.031 --> 04:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>player or someone who relies on endurance as well as explosive ability.</v>

8914
04:01:07.240 --> 04:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>This my thing just as a physical,</v>

8915
04:01:08.701 --> 04:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>how is this any different?</v>

8916
04:01:09.811 --> 04:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Well yet,</v>

8917
04:01:10.410 --> 04:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>how's it any different?</v>

8918
04:01:11.341 --> 04:01:16.341
<v Speaker 1>If I play a race car game on my couch in a Sauna,</v>

8919
04:01:16.560 --> 04:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

8920
04:01:17.140 --> 04:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>we can't die.</v>

8921
04:01:18.151 --> 04:01:18.781
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>

8922
04:01:18.781 --> 04:01:19.051
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

8923
04:01:19.051 --> 04:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>so kind of question is that this is real shit.</v>

8924
04:01:22.290 --> 04:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>If you play a game on your day,</v>

8925
04:01:23.790 --> 04:01:24.623
<v Speaker 1>barely,</v>

8926
04:01:25.020 --> 04:01:25.791
<v Speaker 1>they barely ever die.</v>

8927
04:01:25.791 --> 04:01:26.431
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

8928
04:01:26.431 --> 04:01:27.264
<v Speaker 1>It's still the,</v>

8929
04:01:28.020 --> 04:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>the terror of getting an an,</v>

8930
04:01:29.481 --> 04:01:29.581
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

8931
04:01:29.581 --> 04:01:30.211
<v Speaker 1>an accident.</v>

8932
04:01:30.211 --> 04:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't think you're going to die.</v>

8933
04:01:31.740 --> 04:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>So he jumps through a plaintiff's through a plaintiff's work.</v>

8934
04:01:35.250 --> 04:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Jumping through a plane,</v>

8935
04:01:36.481 --> 04:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>jumping off a plane,</v>

8936
04:01:37.460 --> 04:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

8937
04:01:38.090 --> 04:01:38.923
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

8938
04:01:39.300 --> 04:01:39.781
<v Speaker 1>hang gliding.</v>

8939
04:01:39.781 --> 04:01:40.614
<v Speaker 1>In sport,</v>

8940
04:01:41.350 --> 04:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I think competitions about hang gliding.</v>

8941
04:01:43.161 --> 04:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>That's your sweet ass.</v>

8942
04:01:44.041 --> 04:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a physical activity.</v>

8943
04:01:45.420 --> 04:01:45.631
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

8944
04:01:45.631 --> 04:01:46.441
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is,</v>

8945
04:01:46.441 --> 04:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>or the definition,</v>

8946
04:01:47.610 --> 04:01:48.443
<v Speaker 1>the definition is just,</v>

8947
04:01:48.700 --> 04:01:49.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8948
04:01:49.590 --> 04:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>trying to put this in.</v>

8949
04:01:50.490 --> 04:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>We know what this is.</v>

8950
04:01:51.540 --> 04:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>This is car racing.</v>

8951
04:01:52.900 --> 04:01:53.733
<v Speaker 1>It's quiet.</v>

8952
04:01:53.810 --> 04:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>But why does it have to be a sport or a game or an endeavor?</v>

8953
04:01:58.231 --> 04:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking car racing.</v>

8954
04:01:59.580 --> 04:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is like.</v>

8955
04:02:00.510 --> 04:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to categorize it and decide whether or not it's a sport,</v>

8956
04:02:04.300 --> 04:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>but be more joy it for whatever the fuck.</v>

8957
04:02:06.560 --> 04:02:07.393
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

04:02:32.281 --> 04:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>A sport because chess is like a more complicated,</v>

04:02:34.951 --> 04:02:35.671
<v Speaker 1>what about go?</v>

8977

8983
04:02:40.891 --> 04:02:41.611

<v Speaker 1>Don't do that anymore.</v>

8985

<v Speaker 1>That's tough.</v>

8987
04:02:43.530 --> 04:02:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>let's stop it.</v>

8989
04:02:44.571 --> 04:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

8990
04:02:44.910 --> 04:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's hit him on the hook and then make them do complex move.</v>

8996
04:02:55.860 --> 04:02:56.431
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

8997
04:02:56.431 --> 04:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>When you look at cars just a few decades ago,</v>

8998
04:02:58.800 --> 04:03:00.350
<v Speaker 1>like car engineering,</v>

8999
04:03:00.351 --> 04:03:02.250
<v Speaker 1>he's had an amazing level right now.</v>

9000
04:03:02.760 --> 04:03:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a really strange place.</v>

9001
04:03:04.540 --> 04:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>The point of this kind of at a standstill.</v>

9002
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:12.390
<v Speaker 1>The what point does it go away when you have fucking Tesla's driving themselves.</v>

9003
04:03:12.440 --> 04:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Then you have [inaudible] wood oven has a horse race cars.</v>
