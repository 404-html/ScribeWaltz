1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Who did you do to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>another episode of the Richard Jeni Fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>club?</v>

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy that I've been telling</v>

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>forever is probably the most underrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup in the history of standup.</v>

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I think he's one of the all time greats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry's got a body of work because he</v>

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>did a one hour back before everybody was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing one hour specials every year.</v>

7
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>He was doing that shit back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on showtime.</v>

9
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was just starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think it was like 89 or 90</v>

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a showtime special.</v>

11
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he had a male.</v>

12
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a bunch of hbo specials,</v>

13
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>but the last one that he did before he</v>
<v Speaker 1>died in 2007.</v>

14
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>That is his masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>It's called a steaming pile of me and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was listening to it one night coming</v>

16
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:53.331
<v Speaker 1>home from a club and just laughing out</v>
<v Speaker 1>loud in the car and clapping,</v>

17
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>clapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

18
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was good.</v>

19
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a good.</v>

20
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was one of those guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dressed.</v>

21
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 2>He put on a sharp outfit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleated pants,</v>

22
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucking Corny,</v>

23
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 2>like nineties looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 2>call it the collar with the rounded</v>
<v Speaker 2>priest collared shirts.</v>

25
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Well he was from Bensonhurst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

26
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:15.501
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the old school mentality from</v>

28
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 2>And he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 2>he would give you lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can remember like at least three</v>

31
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would call me an hour after my set</v>

32
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.130
<v Speaker 2>and give me taglines to bits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

33
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were fucking good.</v>

34
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 2>He was almost like on the spectrum with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

35
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

36
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't look you in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like looking down and go really</v>

37
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 2>fast and talk with his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

38
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he obviously,</v>

39
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 2>if people don't know Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeni sadly committed suicide in the end.</v>

40
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 2>And what was tough for him was that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that good and he never really broke</v>

41
00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a sitcom short lifts Sitcom</v>

42
00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 2>called platypus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

43
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 2>That was on like one of those a upn</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>

44
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 2>And after that it was like he was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who used to fill up his book in</v>

45
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 2>January,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

46
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was on the road 45 weeks a year and</v>

47
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making 100 grand on corporate dates,</v>

48
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 2>50 grand on corporate dates with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 2>15 of those a year.</v>

50
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he was living well but,</v>

51
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>but he felt like a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And to us he was a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember seeing him in east side</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy Club in New York and um,</v>

54
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>it was me and Joey Cola and a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>other guys.</v>

55
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I only saw one set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

56
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who the host was,</v>

57
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>but the host said he did didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different hour all four shows.</v>

58
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

59
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I was so humbled because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have.</v>

60
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I had 20 minutes back then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

61
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>how did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you do that?</v>

62
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the best.</v>

63
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a weird thing.</v>

64
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

65
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.370
<v Speaker 3>he came along before Netflix because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was around today and people got to</v>

66
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.410
<v Speaker 3>see his netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those things that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have caught on.</v>

68
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the hbo specials,</v>

69
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 3>you either home when it aired or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't,</v>

70
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no dvrs back then.</v>

71
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Maybe maybe set up the vhs tape to</v>
<v Speaker 3>record maybe.</v>

72
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could never figure out how to fucking</v>

73
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 3>get that thing to record when I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

74
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could tell them now the time or you,</v>

75
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.290
<v Speaker 2>you'd end up recording like days of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives or something and golden girls,</v>

76
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.750
<v Speaker 2>potential twats being written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of old women in the</v>

77
00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.390
<v Speaker 2>scripts are written by old Jewish guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

78
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw menopause joke.</v>

79
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 3>He said one of the saddest cases to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I just don't think that.</v>

80
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know like how many friends he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

81
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.590
<v Speaker 3>like in comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's really good friends with</v>

82
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Chris Rock and he worked with Chris a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

83
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Like he was like a punch up guy for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris a lot,</v>

84
00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.580
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

85
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if anybody was there to</v>

86
00:04:01.321 --> 00:04:04.590
<v Speaker 3>just be as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a big thing for us</v>

87
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 3>because we're so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think comics are some of the weirdest</v>

88
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:09.380
<v Speaker 3>fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.260
<v Speaker 3>But I gravitate towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've always said if I run into a</v>

90
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:14.760
<v Speaker 3>comic at the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

91
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:17.100
<v Speaker 3>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of us,</v>

92
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird.</v>

93
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird job where weird people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>all crazy.</v>

94
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I've never met one of us that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

95
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.680
<v Speaker 3>And I think sometimes we need each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go.</v>

96
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all right.</v>

97
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody loves you,</v>

98
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:31.350
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

99
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

100
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 2>going to the comedy store for me is</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely like a therapy session I</v>

101
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 2>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's partly,</v>

102
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 2>it's that you're performing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the positive feedback and part</v>

103
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 2>of it is that you're running into</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

104
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it could be anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be a,</v>

105
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 2>an Asian female comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be fat,</v>

106
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 2>can be Don Barris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the spectrum of different types.</v>

107
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 2>But like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that,</v>

108
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 2>there's a thread that runs through all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

109
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 2>which is like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this feeling that like mma,</v>

110
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get in the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>

111
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>we are going to face an audience at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point that night and there's a charge to</v>

112
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a fear.</v>

113
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who the fuck you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can deny you're afraid when you go</v>

114
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 2>on stage every but it's in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

115
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>We've just gotten so good at dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it that it doesn't show and</v>

116
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>sometimes we're not even aware of it.</v>

117
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 3>And if it's not there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you're probably not taking</v>

118
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 3>any chances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

119
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll have that doll thing going</v>

120
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:29.080
<v Speaker 3>on stage and then you'll bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you'll really have fear when</v>

121
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 3>you're doing jokes that you think are</v>
<v Speaker 3>killer and they've just eaten plates a</v>

122
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 3>ship up there because you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything left in you.</v>

123
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like last night,</v>

124
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 3>it's just murderer's row man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm walking in and fucking Bobby Lee's</v>

125
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 3>crushing and then Chris Delea is</v>
<v Speaker 3>crushing and then I go up and Thiel,</v>

126
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 3>vons crushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it's fucking Ian Edwards smash.</v>

127
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

128
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 3>good Lord with a lineup and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>hugging everybody.</v>

129
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm hugging barris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see him a hug Whitney Cummings.</v>

130
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I see how</v>

131
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.890
<v Speaker 1>everybody's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this big comradery place.</v>

132
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so lucky</v>

133
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We survived.</v>

134
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's so many guys that I came up,</v>

135
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we came up with guys that I would have.</v>

136
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I was competitive when I started out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys I had bad blood with and I</v>

137
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 2>see this guys now and they're like my</v>
<v Speaker 2>brothers because we went through it</v>

138
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:19.050
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

139
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the competitive thing.</v>

140
00:06:21.241 --> 00:06:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had to give that up.</v>

141
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I had that when I was a kid when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>21 ish because it was still leftover</v>

142
00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:31.770
<v Speaker 1>from the martial arts days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts competition.</v>

143
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Then like I would want people to do bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized that God is so</v>

144
00:06:36.301 --> 00:06:39.510
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that has zero effect on me.</v>

145
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Like when they're up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're doing good,</v>

146
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 1>that'll just make me better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would just make me work harder.</v>

147
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they do bad,</v>

148
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.650
<v Speaker 1>like I was like that's the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>some comedians do.</v>

149
00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:52.560
<v Speaker 1>They will take a terrible comment on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road with them so they can look like a</v>

150
00:06:52.561 --> 00:06:54.960
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a common thing,</v>

151
00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:56.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called stacking the deck.</v>

152
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll stack the deck.</v>

153
00:06:57.871 --> 00:07:01.410
<v Speaker 1>They'll have like just some torturous</v>
<v Speaker 1>act for half an hour and then they go up</v>

154
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.880
<v Speaker 1>and look like a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

156
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I think the way to do is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have a bunch of murderers on in</v>

157
00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:10.720
<v Speaker 1>front of you and have fun with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And everybody have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that you.</v>

160
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

161
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't like going on you layer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like one or two guys that I just</v>

162
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 2>don't like going on after and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

163
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.380
<v Speaker 2>but in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you like going on after</v>

164
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.020
<v Speaker 2>deleted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like he's so physical and</v>

165
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.280
<v Speaker 2>big and that doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't affect me,</v>

166
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.930
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel like when he gets off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crowd is just like in this mode of</v>

167
00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:44.950
<v Speaker 2>like euphoria and it's Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

168
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take it down a couple</v>

169
00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:51.430
<v Speaker 2>notches and just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like sometimes that's my</v>

170
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 2>weakness that I can adjust to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz,</v>

171
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:54.484
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

172
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.590
<v Speaker 2>it's just like the room is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to put their socks back on and</v>

173
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:02.650
<v Speaker 2>you're up there and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm writing dry shit.</v>

174
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be a little ironic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just looking at me like,</v>

175
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.790
<v Speaker 2>you're small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're insignificant.</v>

176
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:10.301
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:13.120
<v Speaker 2>in all your insecurity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start coming out sometimes.</v>

178
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 2>And I've beaten that like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come up in New York and you can't be</v>

179
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:20.710
<v Speaker 2>like that because you go on after a</v>
<v Speaker 2>towel and Louis and whoever.</v>

180
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:24.880
<v Speaker 2>And so I came to terms with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with trying to realizing that you don't</v>

181
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:28.030
<v Speaker 2>ride the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you let the wave settle and you start</v>

182
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:29.710
<v Speaker 2>your own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

183
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 2>and I would make that mistake early on</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I'd come up then and I jack up my</v>

184
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:35.890
<v Speaker 2>energy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't me and then it would</v>

185
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 2>falter.</v>

186
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

187
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to bring the audience to you.</v>

188
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>And of the best place to learn how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as the Olr right now because first</v>

190
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:46.731
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

191
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you only have 15 minutes and there's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other guys that have 15 minutes to</v>

192
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 1>and they go on these rides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's going on a new ride,</v>

193
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

194
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>just got done with magic</v>

195
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 4>mountain or space mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going to go on this ride.</v>

196
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 4>And it's a small world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

197
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 4>small world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slower.</v>

198
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 4>He settled down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not as crazy.</v>

199
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 4>We're all the lights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to settle in.</v>

200
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

201
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.900
<v Speaker 4>It's a great fucking place for just just</v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring it out and working on your</v>

202
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in this weird place right now with</v>

203
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 4>my act where I'm getting ready to film a</v>
<v Speaker 4>special.</v>

204
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm hyper examining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

205
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 4>everything going over everything with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine tooth comb.</v>

206
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with that is you go over</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything too much and then it starts</v>

207
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 4>getting real blurry looking at what is</v>
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

208
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you start landing.</v>

209
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.360
<v Speaker 4>I find that I start landing on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>punchlines too hard instead of talking</v>

210
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 4>it out instead of like being like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>more ideal at the more.</v>

211
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.240
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

212
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 4>this is where they laugh and I sort of.</v>

213
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 4>And there's sort of lucky I stick it too</v>
<v Speaker 4>much instead of flowing.</v>

214
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 4>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you do the special,</v>

215
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:54.540
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like you got to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a little time off before you do it.</v>

216
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.040
<v Speaker 4>There's a number of sets you do where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

217
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.830
<v Speaker 4>you're in the groove and it's tight and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything feels good.</v>

218
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a number that you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much and everything gets kind of</v>

219
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 4>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

220
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 4>You've got to find that right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

221
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they have that,</v>

222
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:12.150
<v Speaker 4>another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if that's a must be the case</v>

223
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 4>with bands right when they toured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they must get so sick of fucking singing</v>

224
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:18.510
<v Speaker 4>the same song over and over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over again.</v>

225
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw the beach boys recently and uh,</v>

226
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 4>they fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They love being up there,</v>

227
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see it,</v>

228
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 4>you can feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

229
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 4>I think it goes to another level.</v>

230
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.780
<v Speaker 4>I think it becomes a communication with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fans,</v>

231
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 4>with bands that we don't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 4>have the same thing.</v>

232

<v Speaker 4>point in time that they think was</v>

284
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 4>preying on early humans.</v>

285

<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

286
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 4>They think that there's been some giant</v>
<v Speaker 4>raptors in the past and they found some</v>

287
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 4>old primate bones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some old ancient ancestors of human</v>

288
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 4>beings that had what looked like claw</v>
<v Speaker 4>marks on their skulls.</v>

289
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Speaker 4>Their brains had been picked out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>their skull and caught out.</v>

290
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an eagle like that and it's</v>

291
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand was called the Haast Eagle</v>
<v Speaker 4>was an enormous ego in New Zealand,</v>

292
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Speaker 4>like way bigger than any of the eagles</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have alive today.</v>

293
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 4>I think it might have jack to few</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

294
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Pomeranian American eskimo mix.</v>

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 4>That's a decent sized dog that he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>real little.</v>

303
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 4>He was like this big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like maybe 30 pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Tiny little guy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But we saw the cat hanging around the</v>
<v Speaker 4>property.</v>

307
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.620
<v Speaker 4>We saw the cat in the area and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

308
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 4>there was definitely evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 4>something had gone down.</v>

309
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it happens all the time.</v>

311
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that they found in</v>
<v Speaker 4>California is because California has a</v>

312
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:13.210
<v Speaker 4>lot of mountain lions that live on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>outskirts of cities.</v>

313
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 4>They purposely hanging around the</v>
<v Speaker 4>outskirts of cities and come into town</v>

314
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 4>at night and eat people's dogs and cats</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they found that when they examined</v>

315
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 4>the contents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they expected it to be way more like</v>

316
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 4>rabbits and deer and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was half domestic house cats and</v>

317
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 4>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Half of their diet because they're easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fatted calf.</v>

319
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Well also they can just jump over</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

320
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any fence,</v>

321

<v Speaker 4>grab your dog and they're so powerful</v>

322
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.810
<v Speaker 4>they can take your dog over the top of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fence.</v>

323

508
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.890
<v Speaker 4>there's a physical aspect to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you want your muscles to be</v>

509
00:23:19.891 --> 00:23:24.340
<v Speaker 4>manipulated because it's very good for</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and you get loose some kinks in a</v>

510
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:26.670
<v Speaker 4>lot of like weird stuff that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>adopt.</v>

515
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:41.860
<v Speaker 2>And they talk about emotionally and</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychically what it means to have skin</v>

516
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 2>to skin contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for an hour somebody is devoting</v>

517
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 2>their skin to your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

518
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.630

<v Speaker 1>you're getting energy from those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people must feel weird.</v>

526
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked.</v>

527
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to who say that they have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discharge energy after a massage.</v>

528
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.830
<v Speaker 2>They do in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are more like touchy feely kind of</v>

529

<v Speaker 2>That one that she,</v>

532
00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.510
<v Speaker 2>she would put crystals in my belly</v>
<v Speaker 2>button.</v>

533
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then my arm would be down and she</v>

534
00:24:33.731 --> 00:24:38.731
<v Speaker 2>would hold my arm and tell me to raise</v>
<v Speaker 2>my arm to see what the pressure was and</v>

535
00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:43.210
<v Speaker 2>then she could tell by that which herbal</v>
<v Speaker 2>remedies I needed for my allergies,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they fill it with that water and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's homeopathic remedy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like some little little pills.</v>

552
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 1>They're little tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little,</v>

553
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.180
<v Speaker 1>almost little little things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolve in your mouth.</v>

554
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

555
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

556
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sugar.</v>

557
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.441
<v Speaker 1>And someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

558
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 1>the sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

559
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:47.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is there sugar in it?</v>

560
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:50.300
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar's not good for you.</v>

561
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.140
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was homeopathic or some sort of</v>

562
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:55.280
<v Speaker 1>homeopathic remedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

563
00:25:55.281 --> 00:25:57.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I have to believe this stuff works</v>

564
00:25:57.351 --> 00:25:58.730
<v Speaker 1>for it to work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of those things,</v>

565
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.170
<v Speaker 1>because that's a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

566
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.280
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

567
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 1>what do you say to people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that vitamins are helpful?</v>

568
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's silly.</v>

569
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of studies that show the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamins are healthy.</v>

570
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>What does a lot of studies that say</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not?</v>

571
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

572
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vitamins was excessive.</v>

573
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Vitamins doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the studies that show that vitamins</v>

574
00:26:19.881 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 1>are beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty specific.</v>

575
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.730
<v Speaker 1>There's pretty specific in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get your blood work done,</v>

576
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

577
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.760
<v Speaker 1>and you are short a lot of people short</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vitamin D dot vitamin D is a big one.</v>

578
00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin B is also a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bb Twelve,</v>

579

<v Speaker 1>100 percent legit,</v>

585
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.160

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a balanced meal,</v>

589
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.190

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

590
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.580
<v Speaker 1>if you really made sure that you ate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain portion of vegetables,</v>

591
00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 1>green leafy dark vegetables that have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of vitamins,</v>

592
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:15.030

<v Speaker 1>right amount of protein and fruit.</v>

593
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:15.931

<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>

594
00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fruit.</v>

595
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.380
<v Speaker 1>You're not a proponent of eating too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much fruit or identity.</v>

596
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Tell me like a sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like juices.</v>

597
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Most juices are too high in sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you drink a big glass of orange</v>

598
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:29.190
<v Speaker 1>juice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body has a really hard time</v>

599
00:27:29.191 --> 00:27:34.191
<v Speaker 1>differentiating that between a big glass</v>
<v Speaker 1>of soda or fucking high c or some shit</v>

600
00:27:34.711 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if it has 30 grams of sugar,</v>

601
00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 1>it has 30 grams of sugar and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

602
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:42.210
<v Speaker 1>It's 30 grams of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's coming out of an</v>

603
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 1>orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>

604
00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but you're not supposed to drink it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the orange is supposed to be</v>

605
00:27:45.841 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 1>something you eat when you eat it.</v>

606
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 1>You get all the fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body breaks it down slower.</v>

607
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.480
<v Speaker 1>You're just getting this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainline a sugar right into your system.</v>

608
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I drink a glass or like if I go and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have breakfast with a big glass of</v>

609
00:27:58.381 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>orange juice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking crashed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a little insulin dump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

612
00:28:03.841 --> 00:28:06.330

613
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:11.220
<v Speaker 1>study now that losing weight is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>about caloric intake.</v>

614
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 1>It's all about sugar and processed</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>

615
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Could they say the amounts don't matter?</v>

617
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat way more than you think you</v>

618

<v Speaker 1>Will weightwatchers have completely</v>

620
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:26.940

<v Speaker 1>You can eat as many eggs as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat five eggs.</v>

625
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.770

<v Speaker 1>They collided heads.</v>

696
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

697
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking head.</v>

698
00:31:50.271 --> 00:31:51.980
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like running into another,</v>

699
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.380
<v Speaker 1>like a rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bone.</v>

700
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone could beat you to death with a</v>

701
00:31:56.181 --> 00:31:56.940
<v Speaker 1>head</v>

702
00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.710
<v Speaker 2>and you're whipping your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're whipping your head at the ball.</v>

703
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.740
<v Speaker 2>So like both slamming into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

704
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I played hockey my whole life though and</v>
<v Speaker 2>never had any major involvement.</v>

705
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.170
<v Speaker 2>My neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I chipped a vertebrae in my neck.</v>

706
00:32:10.171 --> 00:32:11.910
<v Speaker 2>That was the only thing that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do that?</v>

707
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.910
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was small but I was a good skater</v>

708
00:32:14.911 --> 00:32:18.360
<v Speaker 2>because I grew up near a lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we just skated back before global</v>

709
00:32:18.361 --> 00:32:21.070
<v Speaker 2>warming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That lake froze at Christmas and it went</v>

710
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.270
<v Speaker 2>till March.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were out there every fucking day.</v>

711
00:32:24.271 --> 00:32:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Afterschool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all weekend.</v>

712
00:32:25.711 --> 00:32:28.950
<v Speaker 2>All we did was play ice hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I got to high school,</v>

713
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

714
00:32:30.271 --> 00:32:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I was the only kid who could really</v>
<v Speaker 2>skate backwards.</v>

715
00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the coach was like,</v>

716
00:32:34.051 --> 00:32:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you're on defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

717
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hundred and 15 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he taught me how to check of usually</v>

718
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 2>check with</v>

719
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 4>your shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hip.</v>

720
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 4>He taught me how to check guys under the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chin with the top of my head,</v>

721
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 4>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I got good at.</v>

722
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 4>And then I did it one time and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>click and it.</v>

723
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 4>And I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a,</v>

724
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.900
<v Speaker 4>I got an extra and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

725
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:54.910
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's chipped.</v>

726
00:32:54.911 --> 00:32:56.720
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing we can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To this day,</v>

727
00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:01.260
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my tendons will get caught in my neck on</v>

728
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.310
<v Speaker 4>that chip and it will just lock up like</v>
<v Speaker 4>once a year,</v>

729
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:08.270
<v Speaker 4>lock up for a couple days on me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the tendons rub against that area.</v>

730
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 4>It's tendons or ligaments or whatever is</v>
<v Speaker 4>right there around.</v>

731
00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:14.330
<v Speaker 4>You're a vertebrae.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck the next dude.</v>

732
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrible.</v>

733
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.860
<v Speaker 4>Terrible thing to injure you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are there good exercises for neck?</v>

734
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a thing called the iron</v>
<v Speaker 4>neck.</v>

735
00:33:22.851 --> 00:33:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of him now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

736
00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's out there.</v>

737
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 4>I'll show it to you after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a halo.</v>

738
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.190
<v Speaker 4>I've put it on my head and then I pump</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up with air and the air locks in</v>

739
00:33:31.191 --> 00:33:34.310
<v Speaker 4>place and there's a giant Bungee cord</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's on the end of it and I pull it</v>

740
00:33:34.311 --> 00:33:36.530
<v Speaker 4>back and the bungee cord is a 50 pound</v>
<v Speaker 4>resistance,</v>

741
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:39.170
<v Speaker 4>but they make it lower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make like several different weights</v>

742
00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.520
<v Speaker 4>of Bungee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You pull it back to.</v>

743
00:33:41.521 --> 00:33:46.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like fully polled and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>adjust the resistance on the halo itself</v>

744
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.310
<v Speaker 4>and so you do these like as you got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull it back,</v>

745
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:53.930
<v Speaker 4>you turn</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn sideways and I do look 10 reps this</v>

746
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:55.590
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll do sideways that way and that'll</v>

747
00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 4>turn all the way behind and face the</v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite direction and do 10.</v>

748
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.411
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

749
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 4>And then you do stevie wonder's where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do this,</v>

750
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.800
<v Speaker 4>you do a bunch of different exercises.</v>

751
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.920

<v Speaker 4>She would wear it.</v>

753
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.360
<v Speaker 4>She would wear it and then you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>be good because her record would be in</v>

754
00:34:14.361 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 4>the way you run the cord between your</v>
<v Speaker 4>legs</v>

755
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 4>and then you put your penis in her</v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>

814
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Did he ever run into drugs?</v>

815
00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.540
<v Speaker 1>He was a serious heroin addict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>

816
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he kicked the heroin and still</v>

817
00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:34.930
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still drinks.</v>

818
00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

819
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's,</v>

820
00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean he figured out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

821
00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.930
<v Speaker 1>But he works out every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

822
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.470
<v Speaker 1>the trains every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he brings his Jujitsu ski with</v>

823
00:36:44.471 --> 00:36:45.940
<v Speaker 1>him everywhere he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes on the road,</v>

824
00:36:45.941 --> 00:36:48.400
<v Speaker 1>like when we were in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to,</v>

825
00:36:48.401 --> 00:36:53.401
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were outside of Bozeman I think</v>

826
00:36:54.101 --> 00:36:57.430
<v Speaker 1>somewhere outside of Bozeman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he found a Jujitsu club in Bozeman</v>

827
00:36:57.431 --> 00:37:00.310
<v Speaker 1>and met them and just went there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained with them during the day.</v>

828
00:37:00.311 --> 00:37:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking animal.</v>

829
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's addicted to it.</v>

830
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.440
<v Speaker 1>He goes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in Croatia,</v>

831
00:37:05.441 --> 00:37:08.140
<v Speaker 1>you told me it was in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget where it was,</v>

832
00:37:08.141 --> 00:37:11.290
<v Speaker 1>but some Asia type place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Serbia is one of them fucking</v>

833
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Albania with one of them crazy places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he was shitting out bone</v>

834
00:37:15.551 --> 00:37:17.290
<v Speaker 1>chips because these guys were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashing them.</v>

835
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.513
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

836
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were old school crossing Gracie,</v>

837
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.920
<v Speaker 1>top control guys and they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing him.</v>

838
00:37:26.921 --> 00:37:27.401
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

839
00:37:27.401 --> 00:37:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm shitting bone chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like doing of yourself.</v>

840
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.260
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

841
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.940
<v Speaker 1>he's at an age where a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

842
00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.040
<v Speaker 1>they would back off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would think,</v>

843
00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:38.370
<v Speaker 1>oh my body is frail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ride this off into the</v>

844
00:37:38.371 --> 00:37:39.250
<v Speaker 1>sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

845
00:37:39.251 --> 00:37:40.084
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

846
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Well all exercise is really sub</v>
<v Speaker 2>sublimating pain on some level.</v>

847
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean even even a light jog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in pain and so you don't have to</v>

848
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:51.480
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're doing it wrong.</v>

849
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always in pain.</v>

850
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I feel like when I jog I feel like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel afraid.</v>

851
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when people see me jogging,</v>

852
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:06.180
<v Speaker 2>they think I'm running from something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm scared.</v>

853
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the panic on my face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What hurts my back.</v>

854
00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I think the next settled into my back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have slight scoliosis.</v>

855
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:16.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

856
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.410
<v Speaker 2>and then my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wrists and ankles for some reason</v>

857
00:38:19.411 --> 00:38:23.190
<v Speaker 2>about a year ago started to get sore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't do pushups anymore.</v>

858
00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I had to buy those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those grips that you put on the ground</v>

859
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:28.260
<v Speaker 2>because I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't put my hands flat.</v>

860
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>What part hurts the whole wrist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole.</v>

861
00:38:31.231 --> 00:38:32.790
<v Speaker 2>All the ligaments in the wrist hurt.</v>

862
00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they hurt.</v>

863
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An overuse thing?</v>

864
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.860
<v Speaker 4>I'd get hurt from now because it's both</v>
<v Speaker 4>of them.</v>

865
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I could have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing with both of them.</v>

866
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 4>Have you tried doing it since you cut</v>
<v Speaker 4>bread and everything out of your diet?</v>

867
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.890
<v Speaker 4>I think it probably is better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is better.</v>

868
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 4>I bet it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

869
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.860
<v Speaker 4>That was the first thing a therapist</v>
<v Speaker 4>told me.</v>

870
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.390
<v Speaker 4>Physical therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got not a mental therapist.</v>

871
00:38:53.391 --> 00:38:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Like cut bread out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

872
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.810
<v Speaker 4>You got mental problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm no,</v>

873
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:59.200
<v Speaker 4>a physical therapist told me she was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

874
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.780
<v Speaker 4>you'd be surprised if you cut bread out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your diet.</v>

875
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Just inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inflammation.</v>

876
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.890
<v Speaker 4>How much your back would feel better and</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel better.</v>

877
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was 100 percent horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

878
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like hippie chiropractor.</v>

879
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

880
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I did it and I was like,</v>

881
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.000
<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everything feels better.</v>

882
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 4>You don't realize it.</v>

883
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Like that puffy feeling that you get in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your face though.</v>

884
00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:24.280
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get fat face if I,</v>

885
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:26.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I eat too much bread and pasta,</v>

886
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.311
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

887
00:39:27.311 --> 00:39:30.310
<v Speaker 4>you start getting a little gut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's also in your joints,</v>

888
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's everywhere.</v>

889
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 4>Everything's inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's all like not good.</v>

890
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 4>Your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this shit and how do we get rid</v>

891
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:39.430
<v Speaker 4>of this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking hard on the road not to eat</v>

892
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:41.590
<v Speaker 4>bread dough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to find a meal.</v>

893
00:39:41.591 --> 00:39:43.720
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have bread and unless you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to eat like,</v>

894
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

895
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.800
<v Speaker 4>some salad from starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so uninspired salad and it was made by</v>

896
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:53.560
<v Speaker 4>somebody with a hair net that was also</v>
<v Speaker 4>making like stale,</v>

897
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.530
<v Speaker 4>stale tasting muffins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They come out of the oven,</v>

898
00:39:56.531 --> 00:40:01.531
<v Speaker 4>they're already stale tasting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at a starbucks recently and there</v>

899
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.900
<v Speaker 4>was a played out with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

900
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.080

<v Speaker 4>waiting.</v>

901
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.800
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat more than I should,</v>

902
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should probably just have one I</v>

<v Speaker 4>And I have like three of them.</v>

904
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.070

<v Speaker 4>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you eating my muffin?</v>

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 4>who gets sober and doesn't start talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1047
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like Jesus Christ.</v>

1048
00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:09.030
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't you mind that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of comics start in a</v>

1049
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:10.180
<v Speaker 4>rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get up and they,</v>

1050
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they qualify,</v>

1051
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:13.520
<v Speaker 4>which is when you speak in a room and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

1052
00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>remember this one great joke that he had</v>

1054
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.920
<v Speaker 4>about being in Catholic school and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>did something wrong and the priest</v>

1055
00:46:25.921 --> 00:46:29.520
<v Speaker 4>smacked him in the head and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly how I think Jesus would</v>

1056
00:46:29.521 --> 00:46:30.354
<v Speaker 4>have handled it.</v>

1057
00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 4>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this method of delivery,</v>

1058
00:46:39.511 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was just a funny guy.</v>

1059
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Like he was one of those guys that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw him on stage.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

1063
00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:51.620
<v Speaker 4>Some people that the deck is loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you walk on stage.</v>

1064
00:46:51.621 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 4>He's had this gravelly voice and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>big square head.</v>

1065
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 4>And he just said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as that thick.</v>

1066
00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:01.530
<v Speaker 4>I think he was from East Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thick accent.</v>

1067
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was a fucking mailman,</v>

1068
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:06.900
<v Speaker 4>he was like a real blue collar guy and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lifetime of stories.</v>

1069
00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a guy who became a pro real quick.</v>

1070
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.940
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember like being real impressed</v>

1071
00:47:11.941 --> 00:47:14.820
<v Speaker 4>with him because he was like a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit ahead of me.</v>

1072
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was starting out as an open mic or,</v>

1073
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:21.891
<v Speaker 4>and he was real maybe a year ahead and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was starting to get work and I'm</v>

1074
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.540
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy fucking took it seriously.</v>

1075
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was older.</v>

1076
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>I think he was 40 when he was getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>started and so he</v>

1077
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 1>had his notebook and he was like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized with his bets and he had like</v>

1078
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>some philosophy about like why he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would take a pause and why he would</v>

1079
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:41.860
<v Speaker 1>rush this part where he would take that</v>
<v Speaker 1>part and I was like,</v>

1080
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 1>this guy's putting a lot of thought and</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort into.</v>

1081
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.380
<v Speaker 2>I remember going down to see Paula</v>
<v Speaker 2>poundstone perform at the comedy</v>

1082
00:47:49.381 --> 00:47:53.640
<v Speaker 2>connection and he was the feature act</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he went up and as the feature got a</v>

1083
00:47:53.641 --> 00:47:55.200
<v Speaker 2>standing ovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1084
00:47:55.201 --> 00:47:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't happen.</v>

1085
00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was good.</v>

1086
00:47:59.311 --> 00:48:01.260
<v Speaker 1>He got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got sick and died as well.</v>

1087
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1088
00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I think this is just a lifetime of drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and alcohol just caught up to him</v>

1089
00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:10.650
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right when he was right when he was,</v>

1090
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting his shit together.</v>

1091
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:13.043
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1092
00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.730
<v Speaker 1>There was so many of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1093
00:48:14.731 --> 00:48:18.750
<v Speaker 1>how many guys did we start out with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were alcoholics or former alcoholics?</v>

1094
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking everybody.</v>

1095
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.023
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

1096
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're all.</v>

1097
00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 2>And that was the thing about when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were an open or a Boston,</v>

1098
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:29.350
<v Speaker 2>it was like the criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you funny enough to cover 15</v>

1099
00:48:29.351 --> 00:48:33.070
<v Speaker 2>minutes to open number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have a functioning automobile</v>

1100
00:48:33.071 --> 00:48:36.010
<v Speaker 2>that you can take these dui headliners</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Gig with?</v>

1101
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Because none of them had licenses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I can remember like picking up</v>

1102

1103
00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 2>drive these guys out to wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you couldn't leave early</v>

1104
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 2>because you were driving them home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd give you a few bucks for gas and</v>

1105
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 2>you were happy to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1109
00:49:00.161 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Speaker 2>headliner out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go downtown to pick them up in</v>

1110
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:05.280
<v Speaker 2>front of Nick's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've got a uh,</v>

1111
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I had a 1976 Volkswagen Rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four cylinder,</v>

1112
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 2>rusted out floor boards and I get down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's Mike Sullivan,</v>

1113
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:19.891
<v Speaker 2>Irwin who weighed about 300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And John Pinette is about to 75 and they</v>

1114
00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:25.200
<v Speaker 2>saw my car and they both started</v>
<v Speaker 2>giggling like school girls.</v>

1115
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.280
<v Speaker 5>We're going to fucking go to a Gig in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this car.</v>

1116
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.720
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we pack them in and I couldn't get on.</v>

1117
00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get the car go on above like</v>
<v Speaker 2>40.</v>

1118
00:49:32.781 --> 00:49:35.330
<v Speaker 2>So instead of taking the mass pike at</v>
<v Speaker 2>West to Framingham,</v>

1119
00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I had to take a route nine the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1120
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.010
<v Speaker 5>Forty miles an hour.</v>

1121
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you carry lumber on the roof.</v>

1122
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Fucking 800 pounds of humans in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Mike Sullivan,</v>

1123
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.730
<v Speaker 1>but I remember when he was Mike</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sullivan,</v>

1124
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.000
<v Speaker 1>they became like Sullivan Irvin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the first guy that ever met that</v>

1125
00:49:57.001 --> 00:49:59.770
<v Speaker 1>took his wife's last name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that why?</v>

1126
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.680

<v Speaker 2>so I take that shit seriously.</v>

1141
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Eating right and exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he also smoked three and a half</v>

1142
00:50:38.801 --> 00:50:41.200
<v Speaker 2>packs a day and was an alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So different,</v>

1143
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.810
<v Speaker 2>different circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is crazy</v>

<v Speaker 1>how much of that shit is genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1145
00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always admired that.</v>

1146
00:50:47.101 --> 00:50:49.770
<v Speaker 1>You figured out when we were really</v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

1147
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I met you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you quit and you know,</v>

1148
00:50:52.591 --> 00:50:55.560
<v Speaker 1>we were both in our early twenties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were like,</v>

1149
00:50:55.561 --> 00:50:57.300
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1150
00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going down that road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you didn't need anything.</v>

1151
00:50:59.761 --> 00:51:01.930
<v Speaker 1>You didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't need alcoholics anonymous.</v>

1152
00:51:01.931 --> 00:51:02.764
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1153
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:03.953
<v Speaker 1>not doing it.</v>

1154
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I did some therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That helps.</v>

1155
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I just needed to realize that once I</v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that and I had gone to Alanon</v>

1156
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:14.390
<v Speaker 2>because of my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult child of alcoholic meetings,</v>

1157
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:17.660
<v Speaker 2>which helped me phenomenal amount just</v>
<v Speaker 2>to realize that,</v>

1158
00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a disease and that,</v>

1159
00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're powerless to it.</v>

1160
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:25.730
<v Speaker 2>And that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was able to apply what I learned in</v>

1161
00:51:25.731 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 2>there because I went to a couple of AA</v>
<v Speaker 2>meetings and in Boston it was like guys</v>

1162
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:32.570
<v Speaker 2>would get up and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I blow a guy for a sandwich and</v>

1163
00:51:32.571 --> 00:51:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I passed out in the fucking and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1164
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like I couldn't relate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1165
00:51:37.251 --> 00:51:39.170
<v Speaker 2>my thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked a fat chick,</v>

1166
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my bottom.</v>

1167
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:45.590
<v Speaker 2>I had a three way with a couple girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were a plus net.</v>

1168
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.060
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1169
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 2>so I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1170
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.080
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read the literature of the 12 steps</v>

1171
00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:54.140
<v Speaker 2>and it helped me because it made me</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that when I wanted to drink</v>

1172
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 2>something was going on and to this day I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just have that reaction.</v>

1173
00:51:58.731 --> 00:52:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I know that I still want to drink all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

1174
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.560
<v Speaker 2>but when I really want to drink I</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped and I go,</v>

1175
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.030
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's stressing you out?</v>

1176
00:52:05.031 --> 00:52:07.580
<v Speaker 2>What do you need to deal with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I just kind of focus on it.</v>

1177
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:09.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1178
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:10.603
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1179
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.290
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1180
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:16.010
<v Speaker 1>my dad was an architect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I worked on a lot of construction</v>

1181
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 1>sites and I met a lot of junkies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of junkies,</v>

1182
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.540
<v Speaker 1>lot of people in construction sites are</v>
<v Speaker 1>either alcoholics or drug addicts.</v>

1183
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.850
<v Speaker 1>And there was this one guy that I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked.</v>

1184
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.920
<v Speaker 1>He's a funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1185
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Really Funny Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's in a band,</v>

1186
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:32.510
<v Speaker 1>his name was Robbie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny fucking dude.</v>

1187
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Loved hanging around with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just stay off the coke wow.</v>

1188
00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't stay off the coke and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally tell he was.</v>

1189
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:43.520
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be honest about it to see how he</v>

1190
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:45.740
<v Speaker 1>went off the rails and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1191
00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.540
<v Speaker 1>and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would be working together.</v>

1192
00:52:47.541 --> 00:52:49.920
<v Speaker 1>He was a carpenter and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1193
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>

1194
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.260
<v Speaker 1>So I was like an apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he'd be talking to me,</v>

1195
00:52:54.261 --> 00:52:56.090
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain to me how to do things and stuff</v>

1196
00:52:56.091 --> 00:52:57.740
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1197
00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:58.251
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1198
00:52:58.251 --> 00:53:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucking tired of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting my shit together.</v>

1199
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.470
<v Speaker 1>The bands getting back together again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're writing songs and this and that.</v>

1200
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:07.570
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd come in Monday looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>like shit,</v>

1201
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.570
<v Speaker 1>just looking like shit real grumpy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't want to talk,</v>

1202
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.570
<v Speaker 1>had a headache and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't get it,</v>

1203
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:15.723
<v Speaker 1>went off the rails</v>

1204
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:18.830
<v Speaker 2>May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The saddest thing is that when you first</v>

1205
00:53:18.831 --> 00:53:20.720
<v Speaker 2>start doing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know about you,</v>

1206
00:53:20.721 --> 00:53:23.540
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a phenomenal time doing cocaine,</v>

1207
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:28.160
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and all this stuff I did as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>teenager was like beef.</v>

1208
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I never got hooked on it and if you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1209
00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I did coke 50 times without ever</v>

1210
00:53:34.531 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 2>getting hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a blast.</v>

1211
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:38.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best kept secret.</v>

1212
00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:42.140
<v Speaker 2>But then once you get hooked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even having fun anymore.</v>

1213
00:53:42.141 --> 00:53:45.980
<v Speaker 2>You're just maintaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just feeding it so you don't</v>

1214
00:53:45.981 --> 00:53:47.180
<v Speaker 2>crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1215
00:53:47.181 --> 00:53:47.961
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with heroin,</v>

1216
00:53:47.961 --> 00:53:51.470
<v Speaker 2>you're just trying to avoid withdrawals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not even feeling that great</v>

1217
00:53:51.471 --> 00:53:52.180
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1218
00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I think with Robbie to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the problem was he was very</v>

1219
00:53:55.901 --> 00:53:57.560
<v Speaker 1>disappointed in himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1220
00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.480
<v Speaker 1>know it was booze too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would just go off the rails and try</v>

1221
00:54:01.481 --> 00:54:02.201
<v Speaker 1>to keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1222
00:54:02.201 --> 00:54:05.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people out there that</v>

1223
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:09.310
<v Speaker 1>they have a dream and then the pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying to reach that dream,</v>

1224
00:54:09.311 --> 00:54:11.530
<v Speaker 1>like his dream is to be in a successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>band.</v>

1225
00:54:11.531 --> 00:54:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pressure of trying to reach that</v>

1226
00:54:13.961 --> 00:54:17.890
<v Speaker 1>dream and see it to fruition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just seems it seems unreachable.</v>

1227
00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems too far off.</v>

1228
00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.030
<v Speaker 1>And here you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your thirties and you're</v>

1229
00:54:22.031 --> 00:54:27.031
<v Speaker 1>working a construction job and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking work all day in Boston in</v>

1230
00:54:27.041 --> 00:54:30.250
<v Speaker 1>the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're tired as shit when you get home,</v>

1231
00:54:30.251 --> 00:54:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go to band practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get home at 6:30,</v>

1232
00:54:33.791 --> 00:54:36.880
<v Speaker 1>have dinner now it's 7:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get up,</v>

1233
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:38.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get up in a few hours.</v>

1234
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:40.300
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are you going to bed?</v>

1235
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get up at six.</v>

1236
00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Then you got a band</v>

1237
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.750
<v Speaker 2>practice and the drummer doesn't shell</v>
<v Speaker 2>up so you can't practice.</v>

1238
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.230
<v Speaker 1>So our 45 minutes late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his car breaks down and you're fucking</v>

1239
00:54:49.231 --> 00:54:52.290
<v Speaker 1>pissed and you're screaming at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1240
00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:53.001
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1241
00:54:53.001 --> 00:54:54.860
<v Speaker 2>And then try to have a relationship on</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of that.</v>

1242
00:54:54.861 --> 00:54:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Tell that girl you can't go out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night ever because you're doing</v>

1243
00:54:58.551 --> 00:54:59.384
<v Speaker 2>gigs</v>

1244
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.320
<v Speaker 1>and then the gigs suck and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>making any money.</v>

1245
00:55:02.321 --> 00:55:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And she should get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gigs.</v>

1246
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:07.010
<v Speaker 1>You should get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.080
<v Speaker 2>And then you're in a band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So girls,</v>

1248
00:55:09.081 --> 00:55:10.870
<v Speaker 2>they've thrown themselves at you having</v>
<v Speaker 2>an affair.</v>

1249
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:12.010
<v Speaker 2>She's got some coke.</v>

1250
00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:13.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

1251
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 1>No story turned around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turned it around.</v>

1252
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Now it's exciting again.</v>

1253
00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when I've worked at casino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will always be that band in the</v>

1254
00:55:26.721 --> 00:55:30.470
<v Speaker 2>lounge just playing like born to be wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the songs and like you'll see</v>

1255
00:55:30.471 --> 00:55:35.471
<v Speaker 2>people that are like 57 dancing and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see them in their dancing and it's like</v>

1256
00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.520
<v Speaker 2>they're just reliving the only joy they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had in their life,</v>

1257
00:55:40.521 --> 00:55:44.510
<v Speaker 2>which was like when they were young</v>
<v Speaker 2>dance in Iraq and this band is fucking</v>

1258
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.640
<v Speaker 2>their gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To them</v>

1259
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:51.940
<v Speaker 1>you the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time when you're young,</v>

1260
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.900
<v Speaker 1>when you're having fun is so fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:55:56.180 --> 00:56:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck up and all of a sudden you know,</v>

1262
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have obligations,</v>

1263
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you have so much that you have to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1264
00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For so many people,</v>

1265
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.690
<v Speaker 1>there's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this period of their life where</v>

1266
00:56:11.691 --> 00:56:15.740
<v Speaker 1>they look back to whimsically like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the time when I was free.</v>

1267
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Dick got hurt all the time.</v>

1268
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I could go two or three times,</v>

1269
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.080
<v Speaker 4>three times in a night like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

1270
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.780
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe it.</v>

1271
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:31.000
<v Speaker 4>And you think anything is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1272
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:34.180
<v Speaker 4>that's really can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the loss of innocence is when you</v>

1273
00:56:34.181 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 4>realize that a certain point that you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to pick a path and stay on it,</v>

1274
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 4>you better [inaudible] you gotta pay the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bills with it and you know what's so sad</v>

1275
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:48.550
<v Speaker 4>is you see people that work so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard for not a lot of money and you</v>

1276
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:50.560
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill's just add up and then they save</v>

1277
00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 4>just enough when they get their vacation</v>
<v Speaker 4>twice a year,</v>

1278
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:58.800
<v Speaker 4>the good like accrues and they'll just</v>
<v Speaker 4>drink nonstop for a week.</v>

1279
00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:01.870
<v Speaker 4>At the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just hung over.</v>

1280
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.690
<v Speaker 4>They blew the excess money they had and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was it.</v>

1281
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.590
<v Speaker 4>That's what you worked all year for out</v>
<v Speaker 4>a friend of mine and working in</v>

1282
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.050
<v Speaker 4>restaurant and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the guys who worked with saved up</v>

1283
00:57:11.051 --> 00:57:14.690
<v Speaker 4>his money for eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went to Vegas and ballooned in one day.</v>

1284
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:23.710
<v Speaker 4>It was the most heartbreaking story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This poor guy,</v>

1285
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:28.330
<v Speaker 4>I think he was a dishwasher and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked there for eight years.</v>

1286
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:31.700
<v Speaker 4>Set aside 50 here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty five.</v>

1287
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.520
<v Speaker 4>They're set aside for eight fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1288
00:57:35.521 --> 00:57:37.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it was some good amount of</v>

1289
00:57:37.721 --> 00:57:39.330
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like $30,000.</v>

1290
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:43.090
<v Speaker 4>She went there with a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is it baby.</v>

1291
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm good at blackjack or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck he played.</v>

1292
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:48.490
<v Speaker 4>He read a book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys read books.</v>

1293
00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:52.210
<v Speaker 4>You can win money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can win money playing blackjack,</v>

1294
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.850
<v Speaker 4>but you know what's fucked up when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1295
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:56.920
<v Speaker 4>if you get good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they ban you.</v>

1296
00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:59.610
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy was.</v>

1297
00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other crazy thing is in black jack</v>

1298
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:08.440
<v Speaker 4>there's there's like multitech and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're single deck blackjack and the</v>

1299
00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 4>payout on single deck is less instead of</v>
<v Speaker 4>three to two odds you get paid like,</v>

1300
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.130
<v Speaker 4>I forget what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you get,</v>

1301
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:18.460
<v Speaker 4>you get less of a payout when you hit</v>
<v Speaker 4>black Jack and the rules and more</v>

1302
00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:21.370
<v Speaker 4>restrictive about like splitting aces</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that stuff.</v>

1303
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:26.890
<v Speaker 4>So the implication is with a single deck</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can count cards.</v>

1304
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 4>That's why they pay you less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you get caught counting cards,</v>

1305
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.340
<v Speaker 4>you get thrown out of the casino,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck.</v>

1306
00:58:33.341 --> 00:58:38.341
<v Speaker 4>Did they catch you counting cards and</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it normal that you are using</v>

1307
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:41.350
<v Speaker 4>strategy to try to win the game like</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

1308
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't try so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1309
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:46.090
<v Speaker 4>That's like if you're playing pool and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you aim the aim Ayman</v>

1310
00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 4>or when they don't let you use drugs in</v>
<v Speaker 4>sports,</v>

1311
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.090
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make you better.</v>

1312
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:55.750
<v Speaker 4>They definitely make you better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why should we not have drugs in sports?</v>

1313
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because were out of your body because</v>

1314
00:58:58.661 --> 00:59:00.790
<v Speaker 4>you don't want the children to get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong message.</v>

1315
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 4>You're writing and drugs are the only</v>
<v Speaker 4>way to win.</v>

1316
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:05.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that should be a supernaturally</v>

1317
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 4>and the natural league.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

1318
00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:08.723
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1319
00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Supernaturally is you just go get one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them fucking Russian guys from that</v>

1320
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Icarus documentary and you just.</v>

1321
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:15.820
<v Speaker 4>What do you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>baby?</v>

1322
00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.460
<v Speaker 4>Let's do this shit and you find out what</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

1323
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:24.060
<v Speaker 4>The problem is legitimately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do go whole hog and take the</v>

1324
00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 4>fucking full steroid route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're definitely redlining your body.</v>

1325
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:32.830
<v Speaker 4>You're doing some shit to your body that</v>
<v Speaker 4>your endocrine system is gonna.</v>

1326
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're putting ungodly stress on all</v>

1327
00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:39.880
<v Speaker 4>sorts of parts of your body because the</v>
<v Speaker 4>workload that your body's putting out is</v>

1328
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:44.890
<v Speaker 4>just super human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for those brief shining moments,</v>

1329
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 4>you can absolutely performed better on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's about.</v>

1330
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:53.300
<v Speaker 4>And as a viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see them run faster and hit</v>

1331
00:59:53.301 --> 00:59:58.220
<v Speaker 4>harder and jump higher and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and honestly they're jocks.</v>

1332
00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 4>This is what they were bred to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are,</v>

1333
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.240
<v Speaker 4>they are the jock class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pe.</v>

1334
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 4>They did it their whole lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've dreamed of the shining moment.</v>

1335
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Let them have their shining moment.</v>

1336
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what about the natural athletes?</v>

1337
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.710
<v Speaker 4>What about the Hershel Walker's out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there that don't need it?</v>

1338
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1339
01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 4>they're in the other league.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1340
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.640
<v Speaker 4>for them they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1341
01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:19.250
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't be a fucking athlete and</v>
<v Speaker 4>know I need it.</v>

1342
01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or I don't need it.</v>

1343
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.160
<v Speaker 4>You need it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1344
01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.750
<v Speaker 4>But I always wondered about those guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they'd be honest that they don't</v>

1345
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:29.330
<v Speaker 4>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Hershel Walker look deep into his</v>

1346
01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:31.940
<v Speaker 4>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was claiming that he never took anything</v>

1347
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.600
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he only ate a bowl of soup and a</v>

1348
01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:36.920
<v Speaker 4>salad a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1349
01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:38.800
<v Speaker 4>shit doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't,</v>

1350
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:41.060
<v Speaker 4>didn't his mother do the Campbell's soup</v>
<v Speaker 4>commercial.</v>

1351
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:44.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing about Herschel though is that</v>

1352
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:48.810
<v Speaker 4>he also has multiple personality</v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder or no shit.</v>

1353
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:54.070
<v Speaker 4>I think he has um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stress or trauma induced trauma induced</v>

1354
01:00:55.251 --> 01:01:00.251
<v Speaker 4>multiple personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's entirely possible that when he</v>

1355
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only took a bowl of soup and a salad,</v>

1356
01:01:03.141 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 4>he's telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's him.</v>

1357
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.150
<v Speaker 4>There's like five other people that live</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside his brain and they've been eating</v>

1358
01:01:08.151 --> 01:01:10.160
<v Speaker 4>steak all day steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1359
01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>

1360
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm always the trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>

1361
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he had a really rough childhood.</v>

1362
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.290
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of psychological abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>physical abuse,</v>

1363
01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:23.840
<v Speaker 4>and then there was football abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think all those things.</v>

1364
01:01:23.841 --> 01:01:26.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean there is no way you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of football for free.</v>

1365
01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 4>You're getting fucking hit hard and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's trauma.</v>

1366
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:32.270
<v Speaker 4>So there's trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological trauma.</v>

1367
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:34.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's talked about it pretty openly</v>

1368
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.040
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's interesting is even after all</v>

1369
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 4>that he still fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fought.</v>

1370
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.300
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fought in strikeforce.</v>

1371
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.820
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pete the Fuck Addison people,</v>

1372
01:01:43.821 --> 01:01:45.750
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a legit martial artist.</v>

1373
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.420
<v Speaker 4>Shit Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in his forties like 46 to 48.</v>

1374
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:55.340
<v Speaker 4>I believe he fought in strikeforce and</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I say he was jacked,</v>

1375
01:01:55.341 --> 01:02:00.341
<v Speaker 4>I mean Jack full six pack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shredded 46 years old.</v>

1376
01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:07.151
<v Speaker 4>Just manhandling lesser athletes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>beating the fuck out of them in what you</v>

1377
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:12.430
<v Speaker 4>Jitsu mma and he fought in strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strikeforce was a league that the UFC</v>

1378
01:02:13.761 --> 01:02:17.260
<v Speaker 4>one that purchasing and we took all</v>
<v Speaker 4>their fighters and it came over in.</v>

1379
01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys like Gilbert Melendez</v>

1380
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>was champ over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson,</v>

1381
01:02:22.561 --> 01:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>like real high level fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke rockhold,</v>

1382
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:29.961
<v Speaker 1>they all came over from strikeforce and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Herschel Walker was over there and it's</v>

1383
01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like super skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Herschel Walker is gonna fight.</v>

1385
01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Herschel Walker is an old football</v>

1386
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>player and then you see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like Jesus Freak athlete.</v>

1387
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Just a freak of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think he must've been using</v>

1388
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:46.044
<v Speaker 1>steroids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1389
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1390
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Must have no need.</v>

1391
01:02:48.901 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean always get suspicious when you</v>

1392
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>see someone who's a freak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are real freaks.</v>

1393
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Like just let John Holmes had a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

1394
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>It didn't take steroids to have a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

1395
01:02:57.721 --> 01:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>He just had a giant Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some girls have enormous tits.</v>

1396
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1397
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.830
<v Speaker 1>they just do like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no even body,</v>

1398
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:09.930
<v Speaker 1>like there's no equality in physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction and some people just get</v>

1399
01:03:09.931 --> 01:03:11.900
<v Speaker 1>born with freak body parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1400
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And they just are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1401
01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>there's athletes that are just way</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than you will ever be no matter</v>

1402
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:18.714
<v Speaker 1>what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1403
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I think Hershel Walker's unquestionably</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those.</v>

1404
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just how long did you maintain it?</v>

1405
01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the Olympics and I'm the</v>

1406
01:03:26.951 --> 01:03:28.200
<v Speaker 2>curling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

1407
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curling.</v>

1408
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:31.930
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's not much to watch,</v>

1409
01:03:31.931 --> 01:03:36.931
<v Speaker 2>but I would pay a lot of money to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking get high one day and curl.</v>

1410
01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much out of money?</v>

1411
01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:40.870
<v Speaker 2>$50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Housing dollars.</v>

1412
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Thousand dollars to curl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day.</v>

1413
01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's for all my friends,</v>

1414
01:03:45.011 --> 01:03:48.280
<v Speaker 2>it pays for the whole curling corey the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole day.</v>

1415
01:03:48.281 --> 01:03:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Everybody get bored after like 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1416
01:03:49.781 --> 01:03:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love games like that.</v>

1417
01:03:52.601 --> 01:03:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I love a ladder ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1418
01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:57.820
<v Speaker 2>where this like a two sticks and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>got like a ladder that goes between it</v>

1419
01:03:57.821 --> 01:04:01.210
<v Speaker 2>and its got a ball with a rope between</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two balls and you whip it.</v>

1420
01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I can play that for upwards of three or</v>
<v Speaker 2>four hours.</v>

1421
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:07.600
<v Speaker 2>We have it in the backyard three or four</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours nonstop.</v>

1422
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:10.780
<v Speaker 2>I just get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get so competitive and so obsessed.</v>

1423
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horseshoes,</v>

1424
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Botchy Ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horseshoes or fun?</v>

1425
01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get into such a groove.</v>

1427
01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Like Pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1428
01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1429
01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean you and I have played pool for</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours easily.</v>

1430
01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easily.</v>

1431
01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>We could have today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't stop and do the podcast,</v>

1432
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.790
<v Speaker 1>we probably would have kept going.</v>

1433
01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Well son is a good luck to Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ohio today.</v>

1434
01:04:31.671 --> 01:04:35.360
<v Speaker 2>And the soccer playoffs third round</v>
<v Speaker 2>undefeated this year.</v>

1435
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you like watching soccer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love watching it,</v>

1436
01:04:40.821 --> 01:04:45.740
<v Speaker 2>but I love watching my son play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's few joys in the world like</v>

1437
01:04:45.741 --> 01:04:47.630
<v Speaker 2>watching my son play soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

1438
01:04:47.631 --> 01:04:49.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A person who's out there running around.</v>

1439
01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1440
01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:51.380
<v Speaker 2>And you just see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1441
01:04:51.381 --> 01:04:55.220
<v Speaker 2>because no matter how old your kid gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still see them as a little kid and</v>

1442
01:04:55.221 --> 01:04:58.100
<v Speaker 2>then when you see them out there on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>field with these and you see the size of</v>

1443
01:04:58.101 --> 01:05:00.560
<v Speaker 2>the other guys and how aggressive they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are and you're like,</v>

1444
01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my little kid is in there holding his</v>

1445
01:05:02.991 --> 01:05:07.220
<v Speaker 2>own and he's a physical player and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just uh,</v>

1446
01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.430
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to know the parents and the kids</v>

1447
01:05:10.431 --> 01:05:13.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's like a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like being a fan of a sport,</v>

1448
01:05:13.281 --> 01:05:14.990
<v Speaker 2>but you actually know the players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1450
01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.910
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>

1451
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that's incredibly important for</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids to learn how to compete and also</v>

1452
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 1>learn what it feels like to lose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bad feeling.</v>

1453
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of people that grew up and</v>

1454
01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>they were never involved in competitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

1455
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>They were never involved in any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive games and they just don't</v>

1456
01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>know what it's like to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a valuable lesson in</v>

1457
01:05:36.551 --> 01:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>life to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it teaches you a lot about</v>

1458
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>rejection from the opposite sex or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same sex we are in that shit.</v>

1459
01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it teaches you a lot about not</v>

1460
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>getting the job that you want a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it teaches you a lot about real</v>

1461
01:05:51.011 --> 01:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>competition in the real world and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets,</v>

1462
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:57.400
<v Speaker 1>you used to that weird feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competing at a young age.</v>

1463
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:58.830
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1464
01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Go.</v>

1465
01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's,</v>

1466
01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:04.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a shame with being competitive</v>

1467
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.810
<v Speaker 1>these days because everything is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically correct that you shouldn't</v>

1468
01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:10.290
<v Speaker 1>be an Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be progressive,</v>

1469
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:15.250
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't try to beat somebody down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in sports it gives you a safe place</v>

1470
01:06:15.251 --> 01:06:18.730
<v Speaker 1>to realize that that's a part of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup that's a part of your,</v>

1471
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:22.510
<v Speaker 1>your whole psyche is to want to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to challenge,</v>

1472
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to beat Darwinian and that there is a</v>

1473
01:06:25.121 --> 01:06:27.790
<v Speaker 1>place to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a place to not do it.</v>

1474
01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's easier to find the place to</v>

1475
01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 1>not do it when you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1476
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.440
<v Speaker 1>And this is the thing about Jujitsu that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always try to explain to people.</v>

1477
01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu practitioners are some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicest people you'll ever meet and one</v>

1478
01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why is they get all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit out on the mats and they're</v>

1479
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 1>tired all the time too.</v>

1480
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:51.100
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to start any bullshit.</v>

1481
01:06:51.101 --> 01:06:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And plus they don't need their egos</v>

1482
01:06:54.181 --> 01:06:58.000
<v Speaker 1>stroked their egos getting beaten down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stroked all the time.</v>

1483
01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Stroking and tap somebody beaten down</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get tapped out and you have to</v>

1484
01:07:01.901 --> 01:07:04.180
<v Speaker 1>get used to it in order to get to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain rank.</v>

1485
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if you get up to like purple belt or</v>

1486
01:07:06.101 --> 01:07:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with somebody who knows how many</v>

1487
01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of times he'd been tapped out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who knows,</v>

1488
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea how many times have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>tapped out,</v>

1489
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:16.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>

1490
01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.250
<v Speaker 1>How could it not be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1491
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>All those years of doing Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years of doing jude,</v>

1492
01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:25.140
<v Speaker 1>20 plus years of doing Jujitsu and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the times I rolled and the,</v>

1493
01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 1>all the times our role people better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than me.</v>

1494
01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I've been fucking choked and arm barred</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just get used to it.</v>

1495
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't enjoy it,</v>

1496
01:07:32.051 --> 01:07:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but what you do enjoy is that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced something that you didn't</v>

1497
01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:37.960
<v Speaker 1>have an answer for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1498
01:07:37.961 --> 01:07:39.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's work to be done and that's</v>

1499
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu's endless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's endless.</v>

1500
01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:43.323
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1501
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:48.400
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy who explained this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How has the explanation so far a</v>

1502
01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.990
<v Speaker 1>brilliant Helson gracie explained it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who didn't understand your</v>

1503
01:07:51.991 --> 01:07:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and he's got this thick</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian accent.</v>

1504
01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this and then you do that.</v>

1505
01:07:58.150 --> 01:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you do that.</v>

1506
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I do this for ever that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujutsu.</v>

1507
01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:10.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's constantly move and</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense and counter and defense and</v>

1508
01:08:11.471 --> 01:08:13.300
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I hear people describe it as a</v>

1509
01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:14.950
<v Speaker 1>chess match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

1510
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.180
<v Speaker 1>but chess pieces</v>

1511
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.180
<v Speaker 2>only moved one way.</v>

1512
01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:21.450
<v Speaker 3>It's so dynamic and kinetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they're always adding new moves</v>

1513
01:08:21.451 --> 01:08:23.250
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all these new moves and people</v>

1514
01:08:23.251 --> 01:08:24.630
<v Speaker 3>are constantly learning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1515
01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:25.261
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1516
01:08:25.261 --> 01:08:28.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is you're using your body.</v>

1517
01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Your body is what is being attacked and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's what you're using to attack.</v>

1518
01:08:33.481 --> 01:08:34.590
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1519
01:08:34.591 --> 01:08:38.310
<v Speaker 3>you see things give out while you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking and things give out while</v>

1520
01:08:38.311 --> 01:08:40.700
<v Speaker 3>you're getting attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's not enough to just</v>

1521
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:42.090
<v Speaker 3>two guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1522
01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.600
<v Speaker 3>I think if I was going to advise people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I would advise is</v>

1523
01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:53.490
<v Speaker 3>you should have a regular conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning routine just</v>

1524
01:08:53.491 --> 01:08:55.990
<v Speaker 3>to strengthen your joints,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strengthened your limb,</v>

1525
01:08:55.991 --> 01:08:57.570
<v Speaker 3>strengthen your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoga.</v>

1526
01:08:57.571 --> 01:09:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I think strength and conditioning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>yoga are almost as important,</v>

1527
01:09:01.141 --> 01:09:03.570
<v Speaker 3>not as important as Jujitsu itself to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get good at it,</v>

1528
01:09:03.571 --> 01:09:08.160
<v Speaker 3>but almost as important to prevent</v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries and to allow you to reach your</v>

1529
01:09:08.161 --> 01:09:09.330
<v Speaker 3>full physical potential.</v>

1530
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.370
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1531
01:09:11.371 --> 01:09:13.790
<v Speaker 2>in terms of that being a life lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

1532
01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I think when you can physicalize</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that then becomes like in a</v>

1533
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:23.681
<v Speaker 2>workplace more of a mental thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize that being tapped out in the</v>

1534
01:09:23.871 --> 01:09:27.500
<v Speaker 2>workplace can mean everybody gets fired</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a regular basis.</v>

1535
01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:30.530
<v Speaker 2>People used to get one job and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would keep it for 30 years.</v>

1536
01:09:30.531 --> 01:09:34.370
<v Speaker 2>You get a gold watch and a pension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the average job,</v>

1537
01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1538
01:09:35.751 --> 01:09:38.180
<v Speaker 2>what's the average lifespan of a job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>

1539
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Four years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so I think people tend to bounce</v>

1540
01:09:42.231 --> 01:09:44.900
<v Speaker 2>around a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that life people get</v>

1541
01:09:44.901 --> 01:09:47.570
<v Speaker 2>divorced and they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have other successful</v>

1542
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:49.100
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1543
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.740
<v Speaker 2>like somebody was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like today,</v>

1544
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.910
<v Speaker 2>like that joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Henny youngman joke,</v>

1545
01:09:52.911 --> 01:09:56.270
<v Speaker 2>take my wife please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense anymore because</v>

1546
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.240
<v Speaker 2>you would have fucking left her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be saying,</v>

1547
01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:00.890
<v Speaker 2>take my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1548
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:04.010
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that it's a life is filled,</v>

1549
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.550
<v Speaker 2>more transitions and being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>accept and almost be,</v>

1550
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:08.930
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn from,</v>

1551
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:13.130
<v Speaker 2>be empowered and strengthened by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>change as opposed to defeated by it.</v>

1552
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one gets through life perfect.</v>

1553
01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 3>You just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you think other people are getting</v>

1554
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 3>through life perfect and you're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>up all the time,</v>

1555
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:23.010
<v Speaker 3>you feel terrible about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1556
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.690
<v Speaker 3>but you got to realize that those fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>ups in those terrible moments,</v>

1557
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.160
<v Speaker 3>those are valuable learning experiences</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the people that I know that the most</v>

1558
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:35.690
<v Speaker 3>interesting have failed the hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've had these colossal fuck ups and</v>

1559
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:40.100
<v Speaker 3>then they rebuilt themselves and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand it also gives you like a</v>

1560
01:10:40.101 --> 01:10:44.060
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of humility and</v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion for other people because you</v>

1561
01:10:44.061 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've realized like,</v>

1562
01:10:45.381 --> 01:10:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not like no one rides the wave</v>

1563
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.513
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1564
01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.370
<v Speaker 3>you crash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit the coral gets scratched up.</v>

1565
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.620
<v Speaker 2>You get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never served.</v>

1566
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't use those analogies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you grow from it or you become evil</v>

1567
01:11:01.101 --> 01:11:01.930
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had.</v>

1568
01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could definitely can.</v>

1569
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could definitely become evil from</v>

1570
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:07.210
<v Speaker 2>defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just think um,</v>

1571
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a fucked up thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1572
01:11:10.251 --> 01:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really think we all collectively</v>

1573
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:19.460
<v Speaker 1>as a species need to emphasize and learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to be nicer to each other.</v>

1574
01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Nobody teaches you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rare.</v>

1575
01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 1>They teach you in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be nice when you go to offices.</v>

1576
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:27.600
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1577
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.310
<v Speaker 1>there's certain standards of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're supposed to behave in,</v>

1578
01:11:32.311 --> 01:11:37.311
<v Speaker 1>but there's not like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an emphasis on kindness and just being</v>

1579
01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>friendly and I think that that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminish competition.</v>

1580
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Like you can be friendly and kind to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you're competing with as</v>

1581
01:11:46.861 --> 01:11:49.500
<v Speaker 1>hard as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was also a thing that you find in</v>

1582
01:11:49.501 --> 01:11:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu guys who were just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill each other all the time or like</v>

1583
01:11:52.621 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 1>really close friends really close and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1584
01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.090
<v Speaker 1>very competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like motherfucker,</v>

1585
01:11:57.091 --> 01:11:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting you tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Bitch.</v>

1586
01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:00.720
<v Speaker 1>You not like that kind of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but friendly.</v>

1587
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a safety,</v>

1588
01:12:02.191 --> 01:12:06.060
<v Speaker 2>because there's rules and in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace the rules are much more</v>

1589
01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:09.570
<v Speaker 2>nebulous and what you do to get ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kissing a bosses asked,</v>

1590
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:12.780
<v Speaker 2>sabotaging a project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that part of competitive or is that</v>

1591
01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:15.750
<v Speaker 2>over the line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with Jujitsu you'll get called</v>

1592
01:12:15.751 --> 01:12:16.540
<v Speaker 2>on a foul.</v>

1593
01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sabotaging a project.</v>

1594
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Imagine working with somebody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sabotaging.</v>

1595
01:12:20.921 --> 01:12:24.310
<v Speaker 1>When you're trying to accomplish now go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the boss and talking shit behind your</v>

1596
01:12:24.311 --> 01:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>back about your project and what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to achieve.</v>

1597
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.700
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most soul sucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>things about jobs.</v>

1598
01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>The fakeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the office banter,</v>

1599
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:41.560
<v Speaker 1>nonsense fakeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think as a,</v>

1600
01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.110
<v Speaker 1>as a species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the human race,</v>

1601
01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:48.510
<v Speaker 1>especially us as Americans because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so God damn competitive color,</v>

1602
01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.353
<v Speaker 1>I'd be nicer.</v>

1603
01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it starts with manners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it starts with.</v>

1604
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean as a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manners,</v>

1605
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:59.300
<v Speaker 2>they seem trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it creates the paradigm for Nice.</v>

1606
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Just thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please hold a door,</v>

1607
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 2>donate like don't eat until everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>served their food.</v>

1608
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:11.520
<v Speaker 2>They're all little signals to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you care about them and respect</v>

1609
01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:15.120
<v Speaker 2>them and I think it spills over and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>informs your other actions when you have</v>

1610
01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:16.020
<v Speaker 2>good manners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1611
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the eye.</v>

1612
01:13:17.531 --> 01:13:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1613
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1614
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It'd be pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people do that to you,</v>

1615
01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you get a good feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1616
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1617
01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:26.950
<v Speaker 1>when someone holds open the door for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or someone says thank you.</v>

1618
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I said hi to some guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other day I was walking by him in</v>

1619
01:13:30.581 --> 01:13:31.780
<v Speaker 1>the hallway of the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1620
01:13:31.781 --> 01:13:36.280
<v Speaker 1>how you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just stared at me and immediately I</v>

1621
01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1622
01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I was angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1623
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Immediately like part of my instinct was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1624
01:13:41.771 --> 01:13:43.010
<v Speaker 1>fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Then part of me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that poor bastard,</v>

1626
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went with that poor bastard.</v>

1627
01:13:47.171 --> 01:13:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1628
01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>that's his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said Hi.</v>

1629
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>But he looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at me like I was almost like I</v>

1631
01:13:53.171 --> 01:13:55.450
<v Speaker 1>was weak and saying hi to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1632
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1633
01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.310
<v Speaker 2>I was raised to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I see somebody with bags,</v>

1634
01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I helped them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it makes me feel fucking great.</v>

1635
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.900
<v Speaker 2>It feels good to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1636
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I think I was raised and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about being raised Catholic</v>

1637
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.930
<v Speaker 2>because I was raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you raised Catholic?</v>

1638
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I was raised Catholic</v>

1639
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.590
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First grade after first grade we kind of</v>

1640
01:14:14.591 --> 01:14:17.130
<v Speaker 4>abandoned it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even up until then it's,</v>

1641
01:14:17.131 --> 01:14:17.760
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1642
01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.730
<v Speaker 4>it gives you a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1643
01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:23.320
<v Speaker 4>it's a life of service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very much about helping people.</v>

1644
01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:24.550
<v Speaker 4>It's very much she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1645
01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.350
<v Speaker 4>he could say what you want about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Catholics,</v>

1646
01:14:26.351 --> 01:14:28.090
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were in the trenches and a lot of</v>

1647
01:14:28.091 --> 01:14:30.260
<v Speaker 4>third world countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuns and,</v>

1648
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:31.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1649
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:32.890
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did a lot of good.</v>

1650
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that rubbed off on me.</v>

1651
01:14:35.081 --> 01:14:37.990
<v Speaker 4>My parents both always did a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>charity work.</v>

1652
01:14:37.991 --> 01:14:40.620
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of charity work with my kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1653
01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 4>that's going to stay with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we throw the baby out with the</v>

1654
01:14:43.511 --> 01:14:47.770
<v Speaker 4>bathwater when it comes to religion and</v>
<v Speaker 4>even just rigid ideologies.</v>

1655
01:14:47.771 --> 01:14:50.230
<v Speaker 4>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about religion that</v>

1656
01:14:50.231 --> 01:14:52.120
<v Speaker 4>can absolutely help some people.</v>

1657
01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.280
<v Speaker 4>And there's aspects of it that are very</v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial.</v>

1658
01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.590
<v Speaker 4>Having that code to live by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1659
01:14:56.591 --> 01:14:59.620
<v Speaker 4>even if it's because of the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>spaghetti monster in the sky,</v>

1660
01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:03.310
<v Speaker 4>like whatever it is that you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you really act that,</v>

1661
01:15:03.311 --> 01:15:05.650
<v Speaker 4>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>act like that thing is watching over you</v>

1662
01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:08.050
<v Speaker 4>and that there's codes and tenants that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to live by,</v>

1663
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.960
<v Speaker 4>like most of the tenants of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>

1664
01:15:10.961 --> 01:15:13.840
<v Speaker 4>if you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really follow Jesus has rule,</v>

1665
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:16.060
<v Speaker 4>which most people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you really did,</v>

1666
01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:17.680
<v Speaker 4>you'd be doing a lot of great work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1667
01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 4>you'd be helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be treating each other as if they</v>

1668
01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 4>were your brothers and sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The neediest.</v>

1669
01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:25.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's who Jesus helped the beggars in</v>

1670
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:27.640
<v Speaker 4>the street and the prostitutes and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1671
01:15:27.641 --> 01:15:30.010
<v Speaker 4>that was some hardcore shit he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>back then.</v>

1672
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:32.140
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1673
01:15:32.141 --> 01:15:35.470
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like the 10 commandments</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can live by,</v>

1674
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:36.363
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight of them.</v>

1675
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.350
<v Speaker 4>Eight of them are pretty good to live</v>
<v Speaker 4>by.</v>

1676
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm still gonna cover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My neighbor's wife Covet.</v>

1677
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.880
<v Speaker 4>She's fucking hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what that was about?</v>

1678
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:45.510
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it about your neighbors?</v>

1679
01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.870
<v Speaker 4>She was possession.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was covet like she was a possession</v>

1680
01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:52.300
<v Speaker 4>of the neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she.</v>

1681
01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:53.410
<v Speaker 4>He owned her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1682
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1683
01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the same thing stood for the</v>

1684
01:15:56.861 --> 01:15:59.140
<v Speaker 4>commandment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you really read it says,</v>

1685
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.900
<v Speaker 4>do not covet thy neighbor's wife or they</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighbor,</v>

1686
01:16:02.901 --> 01:16:05.380
<v Speaker 4>slave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slave,</v>

1687
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:07.780
<v Speaker 4>slave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a donkey.</v>

1688
01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.060
<v Speaker 4>I think it's donkey enslave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1689
01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:11.080
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1690
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.180
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1691
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:13.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

1692
01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:15.790
<v Speaker 4>don't try to steal their slave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can keep slaves.</v>

1693
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.800
<v Speaker 4>Just walk them from your neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so obvious that what they were</v>

1694
01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:25.861
<v Speaker 4>talking about back then was all wrapped</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the way people thought about</v>

1695
01:16:26.771 --> 01:16:28.000
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then yeah,</v>

1696
01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:30.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they knew even then,</v>

1697
01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:33.400
<v Speaker 4>even thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew there's a right way to do</v>

1698
01:16:33.401 --> 01:16:34.780
<v Speaker 4>things and there's a wrong way to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1699
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:37.180
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you pick up the people's bags,</v>

1700
01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:39.790
<v Speaker 4>you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's tell kids that.</v>

1701
01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.130
<v Speaker 4>Let's teach people that you pick up the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bags,</v>

1702
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 4>you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hold the door open,</v>

1703
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:45.880
<v Speaker 4>you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You help someone.</v>

1704
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:46.870
<v Speaker 4>You feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1705
01:16:46.871 --> 01:16:47.704
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's.</v>

1706
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:50.620
<v Speaker 4>This is obviously we all want to feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>

1707
01:16:50.621 --> 01:16:53.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we feel like there's moments in</v>

1708
01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:56.800
<v Speaker 4>my life where I feel terrible where I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>done something wrong or a fucked up</v>

1709
01:16:56.801 --> 01:17:01.801
<v Speaker 4>something or just failed and I just feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible and I always think when I do</v>

1710
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.490
<v Speaker 4>have that feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

1711
01:17:03.491 --> 01:17:05.980
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hate this feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't I feel great?</v>

1712
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Why can't I just feel awesome right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1713
01:17:08.201 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 4>because it didn't go and this is</v>

1714
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:13.970
<v Speaker 3>like the psychic reminder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is that jolt of energy that's</v>

1715
01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:14.960
<v Speaker 3>letting you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1716
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:19.430
<v Speaker 3>you went on a wrong path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucked up you tank this,</v>

1717
01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:23.780
<v Speaker 3>you crashed that you did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're supposed to feel like shit.</v>

1718
01:17:23.781 --> 01:17:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that you don't do it again.</v>

1719
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But conversely,</v>

1720
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.740
<v Speaker 3>when something good happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you help someone,</v>

1721
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 3>when someone can't get their bag in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>overhead because it's too heavy and you</v>

1722
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:36.200
<v Speaker 3>help them and you hand it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they smile at you and you smile at them.</v>

1723
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.090
<v Speaker 3>You walk off the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel good,</v>

1724
01:17:38.410 --> 01:17:41.150
<v Speaker 3>you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to teach that to like,</v>

1725
01:17:41.151 --> 01:17:43.040
<v Speaker 3>you have to remember that and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go,</v>

1726
01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:44.170
<v Speaker 3>why do I feel so good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1727
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I felt so good because it helped that</v>
<v Speaker 3>lady.</v>

1728
01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1729
01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.850
<v Speaker 3>I felt so good because I said hi to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and like I say hi me back and we</v>

1730
01:17:49.851 --> 01:17:51.500
<v Speaker 3>looked at each other and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1731
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:53.120
<v Speaker 3>made some niceties or whatever.</v>

1732
01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1733
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:59.240
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the joy of life is those</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly,</v>

1734
01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:02.240
<v Speaker 3>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice interactions with people.</v>

1735
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.080
<v Speaker 3>But when you got your shit in order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easier to have those experiences</v>

1736
01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:07.970
<v Speaker 3>when you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My personal experience,</v>

1737
01:18:07.971 --> 01:18:11.040
<v Speaker 3>when I don't have my shit in order and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've made mistakes and I'm,</v>

1738
01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 3>I fucked something up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard for me to enjoy anything.</v>

1739
01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just go through the motions.</v>

1740
01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.020
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

1741
01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:21.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have something that I fucked up and</v>

1742
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:24.800
<v Speaker 3>then I have that terrible feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to hang out with my family</v>

1743
01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:26.720
<v Speaker 3>and my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just ride it out.</v>

1744
01:18:26.721 --> 01:18:29.780
<v Speaker 3>I just have to ride it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to be real friendly and real</v>

1745
01:18:29.781 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 3>sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't feel good inside.</v>

1746
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:33.350
<v Speaker 3>I feel terrible and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1747
01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:35.420
<v Speaker 3>this is going to go away with</v>
<v Speaker 3>contemplation,</v>

1748
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.370
<v Speaker 3>with understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to.</v>

1749
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 3>This feeling is gonna go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to ride it out.</v>

1750
01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know I can ride it out because</v>

1751
01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:43.820
<v Speaker 3>I've read it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote it out before,</v>

1752
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:45.650
<v Speaker 3>but for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1753
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:49.130
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what to do there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't they don't know what that feeling</v>

1754
01:18:49.131 --> 01:18:50.960
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like this is their life and</v>

1755
01:18:50.961 --> 01:18:53.210
<v Speaker 3>then that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't conquer it,</v>

1756
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.370
<v Speaker 3>you get comfortable with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get used to it.</v>

1757
01:18:55.371 --> 01:18:57.980
<v Speaker 3>You used to failing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get used to that terrible feeling</v>

1758
01:18:57.981 --> 01:19:02.430
<v Speaker 3>and then you start pouring booze on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible feeling or pouring drugs or.</v>

1759
01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also becomes like A.</v>

1760
01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I was in therapy and I remember the</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapist told me that you,</v>

1761
01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.810
<v Speaker 2>we all have a narrative of our lives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can choose that narrative.</v>

1762
01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.960
<v Speaker 2>It's that fucking simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's basically what behavioral therapy</v>

1763
01:19:15.961 --> 01:19:20.961
<v Speaker 2>tells you is that it's all a projection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything in your life as a projection.</v>

1764
01:19:21.871 --> 01:19:22.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

1765
01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:26.130
<v Speaker 2>I have these attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've accomplished these things.</v>

1766
01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Or you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lacked these things and I fucked up</v>

1767
01:19:29.971 --> 01:19:34.500
<v Speaker 2>these things and you can live your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting that energy out to people and</v>

1768
01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:39.120
<v Speaker 2>it's as simple as just literally sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and thinking about how you want to</v>

1769
01:19:39.121 --> 01:19:43.680
<v Speaker 2>see yourself and just keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep reminding yourself of that and</v>

1770
01:19:43.681 --> 01:19:44.700
<v Speaker 2>you'll start to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

1771
01:19:44.701 --> 01:19:47.700
<v Speaker 2>this sounds so fucking hokey to</v>
<v Speaker 2>oversimplified,</v>

1772
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:49.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's real,</v>

1773
01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:50.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1774
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.200
<v Speaker 2>and part of the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the downside of religion is that I was</v>

1775
01:19:55.201 --> 01:19:58.830
<v Speaker 2>raised with a lot of shame and guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those periods you're talking</v>

1776
01:19:58.831 --> 01:20:01.800
<v Speaker 2>about where you fucked up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling bad and you got to ride it out.</v>

1777
01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:06.420
<v Speaker 2>You throw shame on top of that and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>extends it and it makes it more</v>

1778
01:20:06.421 --> 01:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>profound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just about your action and</v>

1779
01:20:10.951 --> 01:20:15.210
<v Speaker 2>how it might have affected other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about original sin,</v>

1780
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:16.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>

1781
01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 2>original sin shed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garden of Eden,</v>

1782
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:20.880
<v Speaker 2>where evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1783
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:22.680
<v Speaker 2>we're dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to confess,</v>

1784
01:20:22.681 --> 01:20:26.070
<v Speaker 2>we need to be cleansed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw all that on top of a simple</v>

1785
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:26.970
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1786
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.780
<v Speaker 2>it makes it complex.</v>

1787
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah Man,</v>

1788
01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:34.020
<v Speaker 3>the sin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the pain and the suffering that mean</v>

1789
01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:36.150
<v Speaker 3>island went through one year of Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

1790
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 3>but that one year when I was six years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

1791
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:39.450
<v Speaker 3>first grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1792
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.060
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are crazy.</v>

1793
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not this bad.</v>

1794
01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:48.530
<v Speaker 3>I just knew that my parents got split up</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was five and then I was really</v>

1795
01:20:49.831 --> 01:20:50.790
<v Speaker 3>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1796
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:53.370
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe my mom and dad aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>together anymore.</v>

1797
01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:56.250
<v Speaker 3>And there was screaming and hitting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of violence.</v>

1798
01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 3>And it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was good that my mom got out because</v>

1799
01:20:59.911 --> 01:21:02.370
<v Speaker 3>I learned that when something is</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible,</v>

1800
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:06.180
<v Speaker 3>like you don't just stay and get smacked</v>
<v Speaker 3>around you leave.</v>

1801
01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.720
<v Speaker 3>But the bad thing was it just through my</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life into chaos and I wanted some</v>

1802
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.520
<v Speaker 3>order and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I turned to</v>

1803
01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:19.440
<v Speaker 3>for order was religion.</v>

1804
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Even though it's five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years old,</v>

1805
01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:24.520
<v Speaker 3>like I remember my grandparents or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1806
01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 3>whoever was taking me to church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I got into it.</v>

1807
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the answer.</v>

1808
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does God want you to do?</v>

1809
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.970
<v Speaker 3>Because when you're six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>

1810
01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:36.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not a con.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking of it and there's a</v>

1811
01:21:36.581 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 3>very narrow confined way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't have a broad sense of the</v>

1812
01:21:41.011 --> 01:21:43.590
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a sense of God as being like the</v>

1813
01:21:43.591 --> 01:21:45.390
<v Speaker 3>ultimate dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1814
01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:46.220
<v Speaker 3>And then will the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1815
01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:49.830
<v Speaker 3>this data that I have is failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's ultimate dad.</v>

1816
01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:52.110
<v Speaker 3>You've got to do what he says and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you,</v>

1817
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:53.700
<v Speaker 3>that's how life works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1818
01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:57.840
<v Speaker 3>And that's how you're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This very small vocabulary that I have</v>

1819
01:21:57.841 --> 01:22:01.210
<v Speaker 3>this narrow view of the world with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1820
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:05.580
<v Speaker 3>five summers of life experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I went to Catholic school and I</v>

1821
01:22:05.581 --> 01:22:07.350
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1822
01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:08.184
<v Speaker 3>is this wrong?</v>

1823
01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.960
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so wrong.</v>

1824
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Sister Mary Josephine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the only person I remember from</v>

1825
01:22:14.551 --> 01:22:16.770
<v Speaker 3>being six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember anybody's name,</v>

1826
01:22:16.771 --> 01:22:19.920
<v Speaker 3>but I remember that fucking evil monster</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a lady.</v>

1827
01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.860
<v Speaker 3>She was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking,</v>

1828
01:22:22.861 --> 01:22:27.420
<v Speaker 3>she smelled like death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looked like how she just looked like</v>

1829
01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:32.780
<v Speaker 3>she was just in grief and anger and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>annoyed all the time and was so mean to</v>

1830
01:22:34.831 --> 01:22:36.570
<v Speaker 3>kids bat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1831
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:38.430
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it fucking knocked it right out of me,</v>

1832
01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:42.660
<v Speaker 3>knocked it all right out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all my ideas about religion and</v>

1833
01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Catholicism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was done by the time first grade</v>

1834
01:22:46.531 --> 01:22:47.311
<v Speaker 3>was over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1835
01:22:47.311 --> 01:22:49.650
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I'm going back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When my parents had run away.</v>

1836
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1837
01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:51.363
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking.</v>

1838
01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents went to Catholic schools in</v>

1839
01:22:54.591 --> 01:22:57.830
<v Speaker 2>the Bronx back when they just hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1840
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:59.960
<v Speaker 2>like every infraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a room,</v>

1841
01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:03.500
<v Speaker 2>literally they had the ruler out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wrap you on the knuckles all the</v>

1842
01:23:03.501 --> 01:23:05.860
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My mother said to me,</v>

1843
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 2>she realized she got older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these nuns that were teaching very often</v>

1844
01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:13.720
<v Speaker 2>they became nuns because maybe they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbians,</v>

1845
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:17.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe they hated kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to go down that road.</v>

1846
01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:21.970
<v Speaker 2>And so they joined the sisterhood to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from it and they stuck him in</v>

1847
01:23:21.971 --> 01:23:26.971
<v Speaker 2>fucking classrooms with 25 jacked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone written kids.</v>

1848
01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.540
<v Speaker 2>And it's their worst nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're so miserable.</v>

1849
01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:35.890
<v Speaker 1>We got a kid in the neighborhood that</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a priest and he was a nice kid.</v>

1850
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1851
01:23:37.141 --> 01:23:39.450
<v Speaker 1>He's gay as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows gay as fuck.</v>

1852
01:23:39.451 --> 01:23:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It was so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just soft and this,</v>

1853
01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 1>his face was soft and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had no interest in women who's</v>

1854
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1855
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:51.360
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went right into the priesthood.</v>

1856
01:23:51.361 --> 01:23:53.790
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started calling him father by the</v>

1857
01:23:53.791 --> 01:23:55.920
<v Speaker 1>time he was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1858
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like a year older than us,</v>

1859
01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe two years older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1860
01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.440
<v Speaker 1>and I think he had graduated and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>already like going into the priesthood.</v>

1861
01:24:06.781 --> 01:24:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what steps you have to take</v>

1862
01:24:08.491 --> 01:24:09.750
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people started calling.</v>

1863
01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Father started calling him father when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 16.</v>

1864
01:24:13.861 --> 01:24:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I think people are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember thinking like,</v>

1865
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:17.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gay,</v>

1866
01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:20.340
<v Speaker 1>obviously he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he's like,</v>

1867
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:25.520
<v Speaker 1>what are the options and fucking Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts in 1983.</v>

1868
01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.210
<v Speaker 1>That's going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1869
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:29.630
<v Speaker 1>What's it going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1870
01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:32.700
<v Speaker 1>didn't know where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Became a fucking priest.</v>

1871
01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that priests in a rectory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which Latin derivative rectum visit now,</v>

1872
01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:45.850
<v Speaker 2>do you think they're all fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the precert mostly gay,</v>

1873
01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting laid there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got what,</v>

1874
01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:52.420
<v Speaker 2>23 hours of downtime every day when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing a to an a mass.</v>

1875
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what percentage of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pedophiles and what percentage of</v>

1876
01:24:56.771 --> 01:25:00.010
<v Speaker 1>them were molested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So became pedophiles.</v>

1877
01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.053
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1878
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:04.090
<v Speaker 1>and people to get upset of this look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get upset at it.</v>

1879
01:25:04.091 --> 01:25:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like blowing tires on Nascar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

1880
01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1881
01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:08.560
<v Speaker 1>We'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tarzan don't always fail.</v>

1882
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:09.910
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't always fail,</v>

1883
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:12.190
<v Speaker 1>but they fail a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people lose tires.</v>

1884
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:14.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people crash cars.</v>

1885
01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:19.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant history of sex offenders</v>

1886
01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:23.440
<v Speaker 1>that become priests and molest kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the,</v>

1887
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.130
<v Speaker 1>what are the numbers like if yet is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 percent?</v>

1888
01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:29.530
<v Speaker 1>And we just hearing about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it was 10 percent of priests</v>

1889
01:25:29.531 --> 01:25:30.970
<v Speaker 1>is still a lot of people getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>molested,</v>

1890
01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.550
<v Speaker 1>is it 30 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the number.</v>

1891
01:25:33.551 --> 01:25:34.384
<v Speaker 1>It's not zero.</v>

1892
01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's disturbing isn't just that</v>

1893
01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:38.860
<v Speaker 2>number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the number of priests that know</v>

1894
01:25:38.861 --> 01:25:43.210
<v Speaker 2>about it that don't say anything or then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they even know about it and they shift</v>

1895
01:25:43.211 --> 01:25:46.300
<v Speaker 2>them to another church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the complicity of the church in</v>

1896
01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:49.240
<v Speaker 2>dealing with this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a civil case.</v>

1897
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:51.490
<v Speaker 2>This is rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this should be in the courts.</v>

1898
01:25:51.491 --> 01:25:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Police should be brought to the church</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they should be fingerprinted and put</v>

1899
01:25:55.451 --> 01:25:58.360
<v Speaker 2>in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead we somehow say,</v>

1900
01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:00.550
<v Speaker 2>you guys deal with it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1901
01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember when Ratzinger had to</v>

1902
01:26:04.011 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 1>leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a quick,</v>

1903
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>which is very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was because they wanted to try</v>

1904
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:10.930
<v Speaker 1>him for crimes against humanity like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1905
01:26:10.931 --> 01:26:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I was a fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he did was take priests that were</v>

1906
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:18.950
<v Speaker 1>molesting kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just move him and he moved this one</v>

1907
01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>priest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this the guy that became pope,</v>

1908
01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:21.704
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1909
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:25.670
<v Speaker 1>He was in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a cardinal or whatever the fuck</v>

1910
01:26:25.671 --> 01:26:27.200
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the name is.</v>

1911
01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Were you in Germany?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take these priests and move them to this</v>

1912
01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:35.621
<v Speaker 1>new spot and I think it was in Arizona</v>
<v Speaker 1>or New Mexico.</v>

1913
01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I forget where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was somewhere in the United States.</v>

1914
01:26:37.911 --> 01:26:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I believe he moved this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

1915
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:41.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send him over there.</v>

1916
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 1>And the guy wound up raping 100 deaf</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1917
01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1918
01:26:47.901 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 1>What you hear about that and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1919
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.880
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He imagine your baby,</v>

1920
01:26:52.881 --> 01:26:57.170
<v Speaker 1>your poor baby you can't hear and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to this place and they can't hear</v>

1921
01:26:57.171 --> 01:27:00.760
<v Speaker 1>anything and this priest sticking his</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick in their ass and then her mouth and</v>

1922
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:05.000
<v Speaker 1>like now like this is God does God wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1923
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:06.740
<v Speaker 1>God wants this guy to do this to me.</v>

1924
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.560
<v Speaker 2>And if there was a company where the CEO</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow that to happen under his watch,</v>

1925
01:27:11.561 --> 01:27:15.460
<v Speaker 2>nevermind facilitated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were the head of the company and</v>

1926
01:27:15.461 --> 01:27:17.560
<v Speaker 2>it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have to step down.</v>

1927
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy got elevated.</v>

1928

1929
01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it that way for so long.</v>

1930
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many digital or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever see,</v>

1931
01:27:27.851 --> 01:27:29.980
<v Speaker 1>hear no evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a documentary about it.</v>

1932
01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't watch those.</v>

1933
01:27:32.441 --> 01:27:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Documentaries are rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1934
01:27:33.851 --> 01:27:35.440
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a few of them and I</v>

1935
01:27:35.441 --> 01:27:39.520
<v Speaker 1>usually make it like 45 minutes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>them where I'm just crying and I can</v>

1936
01:27:39.521 --> 01:27:40.530
<v Speaker 1>handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1937
01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:42.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing.</v>

1938
01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Most of those guys who were perpetrators</v>
<v Speaker 1>were victims at one point in their</v>

1939
01:27:47.141 --> 01:27:47.980
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1940
01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:53.020
<v Speaker 1>90 percent I would say fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What had horrible,</v>

1941
01:27:53.021 --> 01:27:55.260
<v Speaker 1>horrible system of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1942
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.650
<v Speaker 1>not a system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1943
01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.140
<v Speaker 1>repeating action in there.</v>

1944
01:27:59.730 --> 01:28:02.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1945
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.830
<v Speaker 2>the way it spreads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1946
01:28:04.831 --> 01:28:08.100
<v Speaker 2>every time somebody molested they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're creating,</v>

1947
01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:09.930
<v Speaker 2>you're creating other predators.</v>

1948
01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:11.650
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1949
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so crazy.</v>

1950
01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1951
01:28:20.410 --> 01:28:22.630
<v Speaker 2>We went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to a pretty cool church growing</v>

1952
01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:26.470
<v Speaker 2>up and the priests were apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found out later were all having</v>

1953
01:28:26.471 --> 01:28:28.990
<v Speaker 2>affairs with women in town.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And people's wives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1960
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:45.380
<v Speaker 2>like we like eucharistic ministers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1961
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:48.280
<v Speaker 2>like the eucharistic ministers are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that go to church,</v>

1962
01:28:48.281 --> 01:28:50.650
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so special that they can</v>

1963
01:28:50.651 --> 01:28:55.150
<v Speaker 2>actually go give communion to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are home homebound.</v>

1964
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1965
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:59.510
<v Speaker 2>So the pre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were in the inner circle and the</v>

1966
01:28:59.511 --> 01:29:00.150
<v Speaker 2>priest,</v>

1967
01:29:00.150 --> 01:29:02.790
<v Speaker 4>I have a little fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he would go over,</v>

1968
01:29:02.791 --> 01:29:05.730
<v Speaker 4>like maybe grandma was bedridden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd go over,</v>

1969
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.070
<v Speaker 4>give her the service,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then slip it to the daughter.</v>

1970
01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.190
<v Speaker 4>How's call?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1971
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:17.123
<v Speaker 4>that's not what he did.</v>

1972
01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.600
<v Speaker 2>It was like the people that were the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ministers,</v>

1973
01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:23.770
<v Speaker 2>they became close to the priest because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have to go to him to get the,</v>

1974
01:29:23.771 --> 01:29:25.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bread blessed.</v>

1975
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:29.590
<v Speaker 2>And then they will take it in like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>takeout bag and they would deliver it to</v>

1976
01:29:29.591 --> 01:29:30.690
<v Speaker 2>the people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1977
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:32.690
<v Speaker 4>homeboy bedridden.</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1979
01:29:34.151 --> 01:29:35.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1980
01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:40.410
<v Speaker 4>those religions become so ingrained in</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's behavior patterns that mean it</v>

1981
01:29:41.531 --> 01:29:43.520
<v Speaker 4>becomes a part of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't be like,</v>

1982
01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking quit in the church.</v>

<v Speaker 4>not just your life,</v>

1988
01:29:55.511 --> 01:29:59.380
<v Speaker 4>but the way you socially interact with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your friends and your loved ones.</v>

1989
01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Get everybody together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's part of the Sunday</v>

1990
01:30:01.961 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 4>bonding.</v>

1991
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your child being christened and</v>

1992
01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:08.160
<v Speaker 2>getting their first communion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are big like landmark moments in</v>

1993
01:30:08.161 --> 01:30:09.300
<v Speaker 2>your kid's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1994
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you get your communion around the</v>

1995
01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 2>time that you begin puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1996
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:17.040
<v Speaker 2>they're all based on cycles of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1997
01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Jesus was born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1998
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.720
<v Speaker 2>in reality in April,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but according to the church,</v>

1999
01:30:21.721 --> 01:30:24.990
<v Speaker 2>December 25th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is right at the winter solstice</v>

2000
01:30:24.991 --> 01:30:26.580
<v Speaker 2>when the north star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2001
01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:30.380
<v Speaker 2>it's all built into nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all pagan and its origins and all</v>

2002
01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.720
<v Speaker 2>the ceremonies that you go through are</v>
<v Speaker 2>tied into,</v>

2003
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:36.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rites of passage and people's lives.</v>

2004
01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:40.290
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's so weird that like when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to convert pagans</v>

2005
01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:42.510
<v Speaker 4>during the Roman days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2006
01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.291
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2007
01:30:43.291 --> 01:30:44.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do this thing,</v>

2008
01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:46.920
<v Speaker 4>the winter solstice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like what a coincidence,</v>

2009
01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:51.360
<v Speaker 4>a Jesus was born the same time and come</v>
<v Speaker 4>on board,</v>

2010
01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:52.120
<v Speaker 4>come on board.</v>

2011
01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Most of the pagan gods and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2012
01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:59.050
<v Speaker 2>and most of the world religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Messiah was born during the winter</v>

2013
01:30:59.051 --> 01:31:03.280
<v Speaker 2>solstice and there was a and many of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them died and rose up in the,</v>

2014
01:31:03.281 --> 01:31:04.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the spring,</v>

2015
01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:08.140
<v Speaker 2>which is what the vernal equinox right</v>
<v Speaker 2>around Easter always lands right around</v>

2016
01:31:08.141 --> 01:31:08.980
<v Speaker 2>the vernal equinox.</v>

2017
01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to think for those people back</v>

2018
01:31:10.641 --> 01:31:13.010
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everything was about the crops</v>

2019
01:31:13.011 --> 01:31:17.270
<v Speaker 4>rising and gathering food and fertility</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was everything.</v>

2020
01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything was about whether or not you</v>

2021
01:31:19.401 --> 01:31:22.250
<v Speaker 4>could make a baby whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could feed your family.</v>

2022
01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the crops went bad,</v>

2023
01:31:24.201 --> 01:31:26.930
<v Speaker 4>you had a late frost or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and things died.</v>

2024
01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:28.250
<v Speaker 4>You were fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2025
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Especially since you had 12 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No birth control shoot loads all willy</v>

2026
01:31:32.871 --> 01:31:35.780
<v Speaker 4>nilly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2027
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2028
01:31:36.861 --> 01:31:38.780
<v Speaker 2>and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a sin for a woman to say,</v>

2029
01:31:38.781 --> 01:31:40.790
<v Speaker 2>now you had to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2030
01:31:40.791 --> 01:31:42.530
<v Speaker 2>you look at you really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fuck.</v>

2031
01:31:42.531 --> 01:31:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the Catholic church,</v>

2032
01:31:43.701 --> 01:31:45.140
<v Speaker 2>you can't say no to your husband.</v>

2033
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:46.580
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Way,</v>

2034
01:31:46.581 --> 01:31:48.290
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a crime to sin.</v>

2035
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:51.870
<v Speaker 4>You can go to the priest and complain</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it on the priests.</v>

2036
01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.240
<v Speaker 4>Go give up the posts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2037
01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2038
01:31:56.230 --> 01:31:57.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no birth control either.</v>

2039
01:31:57.710 --> 01:32:00.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2040
01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.120
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

2041
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to create Christian soldiers.</v>

2042
01:32:03.231 --> 01:32:05.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where these rules came from is</v>

2043
01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:10.921
<v Speaker 2>that it was about populating with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of our guys as possible so they</v>

2044
01:32:11.621 --> 01:32:14.250
<v Speaker 2>don't want to limit you having kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2045
01:32:14.251 --> 01:32:17.680
<v Speaker 2>there was no birth control at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean back when that was all going on,</v>

2046
01:32:17.681 --> 01:32:21.100
<v Speaker 2>but you can pull out and come in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls face legally</v>

2047
01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:29.090
<v Speaker 3>it's mandatory and so when you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about like birth control today,</v>

2048
01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:33.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great that people have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>option for birth control 100 percent and</v>

2049
01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not anti birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's amazing,</v>

2050
01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:40.640
<v Speaker 3>but it's very weird for a girl to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones in her body that are</v>

2051
01:32:42.871 --> 01:32:45.480
<v Speaker 3>artificially put in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tricker body into thinking it's</v>

2052
01:32:45.481 --> 01:32:46.314
<v Speaker 3>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:49.230
<v Speaker 3>And they go through this whole cycle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and what's really fascinating is</v>

2054
01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.330
<v Speaker 3>women lose their ability to discern</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain smells that they get from men,</v>

2055
01:32:54.331 --> 01:32:57.720
<v Speaker 3>whether or not a man is compatible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they've done these studies where</v>

2056
01:32:57.721 --> 01:33:00.360
<v Speaker 3>they took women on birth control and off</v>
<v Speaker 3>birth control,</v>

2057
01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:05.370
<v Speaker 3>and they could smell men's clothes like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman off birth control can smell a</v>

2058
01:33:05.371 --> 01:33:07.350
<v Speaker 3>man's clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just know anything about them and can.</v>

2059
01:33:07.351 --> 01:33:11.840
<v Speaker 3>This can discern whether or not she'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>attracted to him certain days.</v>

2060
01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Certain degree of success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2061
01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:15.540
<v Speaker 3>but that's out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they're on the pill,</v>

2062
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:16.770
<v Speaker 3>when they're on the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just.</v>

2063
01:33:16.771 --> 01:33:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Their bodies all confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pregnant and they're not</v>

2064
01:33:18.871 --> 01:33:22.530
<v Speaker 3>thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they lose this sort of weird</v>

2065
01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.990
<v Speaker 3>sense of compatibility.</v>

2066
01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2067
01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.980
<v Speaker 2>This was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start responding only to axe body</v>

2068
01:33:28.981 --> 01:33:30.450
<v Speaker 2>spray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smell dating.</v>

2069

01:34:09.461 --> 01:34:11.200
<v Speaker 2>with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we rode.</v>

2083
01:34:11.530 --> 01:34:14.920
<v Speaker 2>We rode our bikes over the Brooklyn</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bridge and we.</v>

2084
01:34:14.921 --> 01:34:16.720
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a hot summer day and then we</v>

2085
01:34:16.721 --> 01:34:21.721
<v Speaker 2>fooled around a little bit and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember smelling her and fucking being</v>

<v Speaker 2>so aroused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like to this day her smell turns</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's legit.</v>

2090
01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2091
01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.100
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every fucking animal.</v>

2092
01:34:40.101 --> 01:34:45.101
<v Speaker 2>Smells actually watched this planet</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth a special and it was about a,</v>

2093
01:34:47.771 --> 01:34:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I forget which kind of wild cat it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they go,</v>

2094
01:34:49.961 --> 01:34:54.961
<v Speaker 2>they travel for like hundreds of miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's certain rocks that they know</v>

2095
01:34:55.271 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 2>to rub their backs up against and leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>an odor</v>

2096
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:02.660
<v Speaker 4>and the other one's in the territory go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that same rock and they smell it and</v>

2097
01:35:02.661 --> 01:35:06.980
<v Speaker 4>they rub on it and then they decide who</v>
<v Speaker 4>to mate with based on these,</v>

2098
01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:10.880
<v Speaker 4>like a specific tree or a rock that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>like miles away from each other.</v>

2099
01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.970
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:14.533
<v Speaker 6>Huh.</v>

2101
01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:17.120
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really crazy.</v>

2102
01:35:17.121 --> 01:35:20.750
<v Speaker 4>When you think about how an animal has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>

2103
01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.840
<v Speaker 4>like their sense of smell is like almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we don't have a sense of smell,</v>

2104
01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.330
<v Speaker 4>like what they can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can smell fear and adrenaline.</v>

2105
01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:31.820
<v Speaker 4>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can smell all kinds of weird shit.</v>

2106
01:35:31.821 --> 01:35:34.610
<v Speaker 4>They can smell animals from hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>yards away.</v>

2107
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:40.030
<v Speaker 4>The wind blows up like they can smell</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit that we don't have a goddamn chance</v>

2108
01:35:40.971 --> 01:35:42.320
<v Speaker 4>of smelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>

2109
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:46.880
<v Speaker 4>Smelling is so fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in my car on the 10 freeway the</v>

2110
01:35:46.881 --> 01:35:49.700
<v Speaker 4>other day and there was a small fire on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the west side.</v>

2111
01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:54.701
<v Speaker 4>I was seven miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>windows up and I could smell smoke and</v>

2112
01:35:55.311 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 4>you really think about physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck did that sent traveled that</v>

2113
01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.960
<v Speaker 4>far through my car and into my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2114
01:36:02.961 --> 01:36:04.310
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Skunks.</v>

2115
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2116
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:10.330
<v Speaker 4>They say skunks give you a sense of how</v>
<v Speaker 4>an animal smells because the parts per</v>

2117
01:36:10.401 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 4>million of skunk smell that you can pick</v>
<v Speaker 4>up is a lot like how a dog could pick up</v>

2118
01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:16.460
<v Speaker 4>the smell of like a robber.</v>

2119
01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:18.530
<v Speaker 4>When they give a dog a t shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there he goes,</v>

2120
01:36:18.531 --> 01:36:19.364
<v Speaker 4>go get them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy.</v>

2121
01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:24.170
<v Speaker 4>And they run around like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's apparently very similar.</v>

2122
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you smell a skunk,</v>

2123
01:36:26.331 --> 01:36:27.650
<v Speaker 4>like you could smell skunk and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2124
01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.670
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's over to the right.</v>

2125
01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Like you know where it is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you could be on the street.</v>

2126
01:36:32.121 --> 01:36:32.990
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2127
01:36:32.991 --> 01:36:35.090
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking smell that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'd go like that to the left.</v>

2128
01:36:35.091 --> 01:36:36.320
<v Speaker 4>You go like that to the right and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2129
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:37.190
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's over this way.</v>

2130
01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.760
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could smell skunk from blocks away,</v>

2131
01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:42.140
<v Speaker 4>blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2132
01:36:42.141 --> 01:36:45.800
<v Speaker 4>imagine a smell that you could smell</v>
<v Speaker 4>from blocks away and it comes out of an</v>

2133
01:36:45.801 --> 01:36:47.420
<v Speaker 4>animal the size of a football.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2134
01:36:47.690 --> 01:36:48.890
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2135
01:36:49.110 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 4>It's not a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a little bit of a spray.</v>

2136
01:36:51.441 --> 01:36:55.100
<v Speaker 4>That's like if you took a hairspray can</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just held it down for two seconds.</v>

2137
01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.590
<v Speaker 4>Like Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what a skunk sprays.</v>

2138
01:36:57.591 --> 01:36:58.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2139
01:36:58.611 --> 01:36:59.690
<v Speaker 4>Sprayed once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you?</v>

2140
01:36:59.710 --> 01:37:01.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were in Newport,</v>

2141
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:03.530
<v Speaker 4>Rhode Island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had this house and it was,</v>

2142
01:37:03.531 --> 01:37:05.750
<v Speaker 4>it was a converted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a horse stable.</v>

2143
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 4>So there was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2144
01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:12.410
<v Speaker 4>it was 21 of us living in the house one</v>
<v Speaker 4>summer and there were people literally</v>

2145
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:17.590
<v Speaker 4>they were stables that had cots in them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people slept in those.</v>

2146
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:20.840
<v Speaker 4>And I think there was like three</v>
<v Speaker 4>bathrooms in the entire place.</v>

2147
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:22.440
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2148
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:26.960
<v Speaker 4>there were skunks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>skunks that lived in the basement of the</v>

2149
01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:30.260
<v Speaker 4>house and the house just smelled like</v>
<v Speaker 4>skunks.</v>

2150
01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.990
<v Speaker 4>And then one night I hear this clunking</v>
<v Speaker 4>out in the garage.</v>

2151
01:37:32.991 --> 01:37:34.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like clunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clunk,</v>

2152
01:37:35.210 --> 01:37:38.660
<v Speaker 4>and I opened the door and I walk out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a skunk and he's got his head</v>

2153
01:37:38.661 --> 01:37:43.661
<v Speaker 4>jammed in as small hellman's mayonnaise</v>
<v Speaker 4>jar and he's trying to bang his head on</v>

2154
01:37:44.151 --> 01:37:45.650
<v Speaker 4>the ground to get it off.</v>

2155
01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I felt so bad for the thing that I</v>

2156
01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:51.140
<v Speaker 4>got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a golf club in the corner and</v>

2157
01:37:51.141 --> 01:37:54.980
<v Speaker 4>I got the golf club and went over and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hit,</v>

2158
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 4>I hit the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2159
01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.080
<v Speaker 4>the glass trying to break it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2160
01:37:58.081 --> 01:38:01.680
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the skunk squirted me and then ran</v>

2161
01:38:01.681 --> 01:38:06.150
<v Speaker 4>outside and disappeared and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he fucking died or whatever,</v>

2162
01:38:06.151 --> 01:38:10.320
<v Speaker 4>but that shit stayed on me for days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2163
01:38:10.321 --> 01:38:14.010
<v Speaker 4>My dog got hit when I was in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got hit or she got hit.</v>

2164
01:38:14.011 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 4>It was a girl dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got hit and I watched her in tomato</v>

2165
01:38:16.711 --> 01:38:21.090
<v Speaker 4>juice close to use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't work and it kind of worked,</v>

2166
01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:24.330
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't really work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She smell like shit for days,</v>

2167
01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.340
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just forever.</v>

2168
01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how he even wears off,</v>

2169
01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.810
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:38:30.811 --> 01:38:33.540
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird defense mechanism,</v>

2171
01:38:33.610 --> 01:38:34.830
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very weird,</v>

2172
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:36.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got the big stripes,</v>

2173
01:38:36.631 --> 01:38:39.120
<v Speaker 4>you associate them with the smell and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stay article about it.</v>

2174
01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:42.450
<v Speaker 4>So alcohol file thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the.</v>

2175
01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:44.520
<v Speaker 4>I was actually reading the part about</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomato juice.</v>

2176
01:38:44.521 --> 01:38:45.750
<v Speaker 4>Won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tomato juice</v>

2177
01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:48.690
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a strong smell that attempts</v>

2178
01:38:48.691 --> 01:38:51.690
<v Speaker 3>to cover up the smell of skunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you need is a chemical that will</v>

2179
01:38:51.691 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 3>change the composition of the thiol</v>
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

2180
01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately baking soda and hydrogen</v>
<v Speaker 3>peroxide or cheap mild,</v>

2181
01:38:57.841 --> 01:38:59.280
<v Speaker 3>and we'll do the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2182
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:03.780
<v Speaker 3>So baking soda and Hydrogen Peroxide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mild oxidizing agents,</v>

2183
01:39:03.781 --> 01:39:07.980
<v Speaker 3>meaning they will attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attach oxygen atoms to the sulfur atom.</v>

2184
01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:12.420
<v Speaker 3>And the thiol pairing and takeaway its</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to stink.</v>

2185
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And water makes it worse too.</v>

2186
01:39:16.321 --> 01:39:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the chemicals are flammable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So under the right conditions we can</v>

2187
01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.550
<v Speaker 3>have a little stripe flame throwers run</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the woods.</v>

2188
01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a skunk.</v>

2189
01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:31.740
<v Speaker 3>You fucking forced them to spray and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just hold a lighter up to his asshole.</v>

2190
01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.510
<v Speaker 4>I think he got a new marvel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a character skunk man.</v>

2191
01:39:37.630 --> 01:39:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2192
01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:42.560
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy that it's an alcohol based</v>
<v Speaker 3>spray coming out of an animal.</v>

2193
01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also like,</v>

2194
01:39:45.650 --> 01:39:48.200
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck does something evolve to</v>
<v Speaker 3>spray shit.</v>

2195
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:52.670
<v Speaker 3>I now get of all the different possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that could have happened through</v>

2196
01:39:52.671 --> 01:39:55.730
<v Speaker 3>natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A skunk is one of the weirder ones.</v>

2197
01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:56.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2198
01:39:57.970 --> 01:40:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Is there flowers to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there a stink that's spray?</v>

2199
01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:06.520
<v Speaker 4>There's flowers that do think that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they opened they smell.</v>

2200
01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:07.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're talking about.</v>

2201
01:40:07.991 --> 01:40:11.740
<v Speaker 4>I think that is a flower that is a trap</v>
<v Speaker 4>for rats.</v>

2202
01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.870
<v Speaker 4>The rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It smells like rotten.</v>

2203
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.121
<v Speaker 4>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2204
01:40:16.121 --> 01:40:17.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how there's like a Venus</v>

2205
01:40:17.630 --> 01:40:21.130
<v Speaker 4>flytrap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also one that attracts rodents</v>

2206
01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:25.390
<v Speaker 4>and it opens up and it smells like</v>
<v Speaker 4>rotten meat and they fall in it and it</v>

2207
01:40:25.391 --> 01:40:27.340
<v Speaker 4>just closes up on them and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get out.</v>

2208
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:30.970
<v Speaker 4>Jesus might not close up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might not be able to climb out of</v>

2209
01:40:30.971 --> 01:40:33.160
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a metaphor for marriage</v>

2210
01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:39.480
<v Speaker 7>right after you get to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love the smell of my wife,</v>

2211
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:43.930
<v Speaker 4>but I can't get out.</v>

2212
01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:49.070
<v Speaker 3>If you could find that thing of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a plant that eats mice.</v>

2213
01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:50.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

2214
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Newly discovered carnivorous jungle</v>
<v Speaker 3>plant.</v>

2215
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 3>Gobbles rats.</v>

2216

<v Speaker 1>Pray.</v>

2225
01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not a stuffy cat or poisonous</v>
<v Speaker 1>lizard.</v>

2226
01:41:24.251 --> 01:41:26.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each rats,</v>

2227
01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:28.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been named after the famous</v>

2228
01:41:28.871 --> 01:41:32.350
<v Speaker 1>naturalist and TV personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir David Attenborough.</v>

2229
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Me Eating pitcher plants their pitcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plants discovered by science and time</v>

2230
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:40.650
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who has is eating plan.</v>

2231
01:41:40.730 --> 01:41:44.590
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For an unlucky mouse or bird became a</v>

2232
01:41:44.591 --> 01:41:46.480
<v Speaker 1>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a rare treat,</v>

2233
01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:51.160
<v Speaker 1>but this one is a vertebrate specialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some that eat insects and</v>

2234
01:41:51.161 --> 01:41:54.190
<v Speaker 1>spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an unlucky mouse or a bird is rare.</v>

2235
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 1>But these fucking plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this giant plant is a specialist in</v>

2236
01:41:58.271 --> 01:41:59.104
<v Speaker 1>rats.</v>

2237
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:02.440
<v Speaker 1>They lure rats with the promise of sweet</v>
<v Speaker 1>nectar,</v>

2238
01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:05.920
<v Speaker 1>but when the rat leans into the plant</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drink the saccharin liquid,</v>

2239
01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:09.760
<v Speaker 1>it slips on the pitcher's waxy interior</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get stuck.</v>

2240
01:42:09.761 --> 01:42:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's gooey sap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it's trapped,</v>

2241
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:14.530
<v Speaker 1>acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like digestive enzymes,</v>

2242
01:42:14.531 --> 01:42:17.050
<v Speaker 1>break down the still living road and up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2243
01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:20.770
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To better explain the whole process as</v>

2244
01:42:20.771 --> 01:42:25.771
<v Speaker 1>well as the life cycle of pitcher plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video by a David Attenborough,</v>

2245
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:30.040
<v Speaker 1>the poisonous pitcher plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could find that the private life of</v>

2246
01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:32.320
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plants are so fucking complicated.</v>

2247
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

2248
01:42:33.561 --> 01:42:38.561
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating that just develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's one of the real gigantic</v>

2249
01:42:39.071 --> 01:42:42.430
<v Speaker 1>problems that people have with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deforestation of the rain forest.</v>

2250
01:42:42.431 --> 01:42:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Is their stuff down there that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't even figured out yet?</v>

2251
01:42:44.771 --> 01:42:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is so little of it has been explored.</v>

2252
01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that new thing in Guatemala</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're going through the jungle</v>

2253
01:42:52.001 --> 01:42:53.470
<v Speaker 1>and they found thousands.</v>

2254
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:57.150
<v Speaker 1>They have some new technology where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can like see like sonar ushers.</v>

2255
01:42:57.151 --> 01:42:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they found thousands of unknown</v>

2256
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:01.960
<v Speaker 1>structures like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like building cities.</v>

2257
01:43:01.961 --> 01:43:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Like right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There used to be a thriving,</v>

2258
01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:06.440
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a thriving community in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2259
01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:08.860
<v Speaker 1>He had and they say that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it proves,</v>

2260
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:12.820
<v Speaker 1>it disproves a lot of theories about</v>
<v Speaker 1>were things that developed,</v>

2261
01:43:12.821 --> 01:43:16.210
<v Speaker 1>at what rate they were so far beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we thought they were in terms of</v>

2262
01:43:16.211 --> 01:43:18.380
<v Speaker 1>irrigation and things like that where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you met.</v>

2263
01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so weird because we only</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived to be 80,</v>

2264
01:43:21.251 --> 01:43:22.450
<v Speaker 1>90 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2265
01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:25.900
<v Speaker 1>And in that time you barely have enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to figure out what the fuck you're</v>

2266
01:43:25.901 --> 01:43:28.330
<v Speaker 1>doing your own life and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2267
01:43:28.331 --> 01:43:32.650
<v Speaker 1>what's that stone wall over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been here like nobody knows.</v>

2268
01:43:32.651 --> 01:43:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I've been out of the ancient ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dancer wants made it and then you die.</v>

2269
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:37.630
<v Speaker 1>And then your grandchildren here the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same story.</v>

2270
01:43:37.631 --> 01:43:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh the ancient ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They built that wall and then someone</v>

2271
01:43:39.881 --> 01:43:41.890
<v Speaker 1>comes along and like 1990 and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2272
01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.590
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck are the ancient ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Like let's start doing some digs if</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God for archaeologists and all</v>

2274
01:43:48.851 --> 01:43:51.080
<v Speaker 1>these people that are out there with</v>
<v Speaker 1>toothbrushes,</v>

2275
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>cargo</v>

2276
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.030
<v Speaker 2>shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a fucking toothbrush for</v>

2277
01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:58.790
<v Speaker 3>days to scrape and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to find little bits of pottery</v>

2278
01:43:58.791 --> 01:43:59.550
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

2279
01:43:59.550 --> 01:44:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the new radio lab that came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out last week?</v>

2280
01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:02.941
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

2281
01:44:02.941 --> 01:44:04.610
<v Speaker 2>Marty plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

2282
01:44:04.630 --> 01:44:05.490
<v Speaker 2>That's going to freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

2283
01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:08.040
<v Speaker 2>It's only 30 minutes long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really easy listen,</v>

2284
01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:09.450
<v Speaker 2>but there's a couple cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

2285
01:44:09.451 --> 01:44:11.610
<v Speaker 2>cool story to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like plants might have memory</v>

2286
01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.100
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this sort of data.</v>

2287
01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 3>They definitely know that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>

2288
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:18.500
<v Speaker 3>They allocate resources to the more</v>
<v Speaker 3>needy.</v>

2289
01:44:18.501 --> 01:44:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Amongst them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have some sort of a symbiotic</v>

2290
01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:26.330
<v Speaker 3>relationship with fungi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were they the fungi?</v>

2291
01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:30.470
<v Speaker 3>The microrisal relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain plants and fungus.</v>

2292
01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:34.460
<v Speaker 3>The plants in the fungus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like exchange nutrients,</v>

2293
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fungus actually breathes air that they</v>

2294
01:44:39.081 --> 01:44:41.750
<v Speaker 3>breathe air and exhale carbon dioxide</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an animal,</v>

2295
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.650
<v Speaker 3>and then plants breathe carbon dioxide</v>
<v Speaker 3>and exhale oxygen.</v>

2296
01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2297
01:44:47.171 --> 01:44:48.560
<v Speaker 3>It's madness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2298
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:50.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there they are.</v>

2299
01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Plants are a life form and we have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in our head because they don't</v>

2300
01:44:54.291 --> 01:44:56.090
<v Speaker 3>move all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They must be stupid,</v>

2301
01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:00.680
<v Speaker 3>but there are in some way communicating</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other in a method that we</v>

2302
01:45:00.681 --> 01:45:02.190
<v Speaker 3>don't totally understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Which fucks vegans hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whole self righteousness and all</v>

2304
01:45:07.821 --> 01:45:11.120
<v Speaker 3>the craziness that comes along with</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a Vegan and cruelty free,</v>

2305
01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:15.470
<v Speaker 3>not to those screaming plants that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't hear because they scream,</v>

2306
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:17.510
<v Speaker 3>they fucking scream.</v>

2307
01:45:17.610 --> 01:45:20.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make noise like the end.</v>

2308
01:45:20.481 --> 01:45:23.320
<v Speaker 3>They know when they're being eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the weirdest things.</v>

2309
01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Like when they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only do they know when they're being</v>

2310
01:45:26.541 --> 01:45:29.990
<v Speaker 3>eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you place sounds of a caterpillar</v>

2311
01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 3>eating leaves next to a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some trees change the composition of the</v>

2312
01:45:34.851 --> 01:45:38.810
<v Speaker 3>tastes structure of the way the plants</v>
<v Speaker 3>taste to animals.</v>

2313
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:41.930
<v Speaker 3>They becoming in the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the word?</v>

2314
01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unpalatable.</v>

2315
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:47.600
<v Speaker 3>They taste disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're inevitable.</v>

2316
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these giraffes starve to death</v>

2317
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:54.680
<v Speaker 3>because upwind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain drafts will be eating and then</v>

2318
01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:59.681
<v Speaker 3>the wind comes down and through either a</v>
<v Speaker 3>smell or sound or some method of</v>

2319
01:46:00.711 --> 01:46:03.350
<v Speaker 3>transportation that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or transmission that we're not totally</v>

2320
01:46:03.351 --> 01:46:06.560
<v Speaker 3>aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything down when is changing its</v>

2321
01:46:06.561 --> 01:46:08.900
<v Speaker 3>flavor and it becomes disgusting to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drafts.</v>

2322
01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking nuts,</v>

2323
01:46:10.581 --> 01:46:11.290
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

2324
01:46:11.290 --> 01:46:12.260
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's eating us.</v>

2325
01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy is it's not just something</v>

2326
01:46:15.501 --> 01:46:18.080
<v Speaker 3>biting into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the actual sound of it.</v>

2327
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:19.550
<v Speaker 3>The sound of it triggers.</v>

2328
01:46:19.670 --> 01:46:20.503
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2329
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that talk about is</v>

2330
01:46:22.191 --> 01:46:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they find water.</v>

2331
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:24.241
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2332
01:46:24.241 --> 01:46:24.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2333
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:25.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read about that.</v>

2334
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.120
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hear the sound of water and they</v>

2335
01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:32.060
<v Speaker 3>grow towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy is they've played</v>

2336
01:46:32.061 --> 01:46:37.061
<v Speaker 3>recordings of the sound of water and</v>
<v Speaker 3>plants grow towards the recordings.</v>

2337
01:46:38.290 --> 01:46:40.870
<v Speaker 2>So what the fuck is going on with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>

2338
01:46:40.871 --> 01:46:45.871
<v Speaker 2>So they have auditory canals and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>said the roots have a very similar hair</v>

2339
01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 2>follicle like we have in our ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is you actually hear you here.</v>

2340
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.860
<v Speaker 2>You're picking up vibrations on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hairs and that's what their roots are</v>

2341
01:46:52.861 --> 01:46:55.270
<v Speaker 2>made up of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tons and tons of tiny little fiber.</v>

2342
01:46:55.271 --> 01:47:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Like heres that become a root fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2343
01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:02.280
<v Speaker 2>And the difference is if I eat an</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

2344
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:06.120
<v Speaker 2>it's been killed and I'm eating the dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>flesh theory and a salad.</v>

2345
01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Some of that Shit's still alive.</v>

2346
01:47:07.690 --> 01:47:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's okay.</v>

2347
01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2348
01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:14.290
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's all okay,</v>

2349
01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:18.920
<v Speaker 1>but we have this idea that some life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>more important than other labs.</v>

2350
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:21.400
<v Speaker 1>That intelligent life is more important</v>
<v Speaker 1>than non-intelligent life.</v>

2351
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:22.623
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2352
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I know they did this whole thing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics about how,</v>

2353
01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:30.890
<v Speaker 2>how many dislike 2000 dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a farms in South Korea where they breed</v>

2354
01:47:32.101 --> 01:47:36.240
<v Speaker 2>dogs for eating and you go there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're just regular fucking</v>

2355
01:47:36.241 --> 01:47:38.220
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A whole variety like you would see in a</v>

2356
01:47:38.221 --> 01:47:42.360
<v Speaker 2>pet store and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were outraged by it and we've</v>

2357
01:47:42.361 --> 01:47:43.740
<v Speaker 2>sent out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2358
01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:47.010
<v Speaker 2>there's people that fly over from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>states and they adopt one pet.</v>

2359
01:47:47.011 --> 01:47:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile there's like hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and you get maybe 50 rich</v>

2360
01:47:50.941 --> 01:47:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Americans come over and adopt a pet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back.</v>

2361
01:47:54.370 --> 01:47:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I rescued her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rescued her from a Korean factory.</v>

2362
01:47:57.841 --> 01:48:01.480
<v Speaker 2>They made burgers out of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2363
01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:05.880
<v Speaker 2>But that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for some people a dog is food and</v>

2364
01:48:05.881 --> 01:48:07.110
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2365
01:48:07.111 --> 01:48:08.100
<v Speaker 2>what does that Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2366
01:48:08.101 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 2>pigs are like one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent animals.</v>

2367
01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:12.880
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a dog farm to rows.</v>

2368
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Cages that will be used for dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2369
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile those chickens,</v>

2370
01:48:19.411 --> 01:48:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't give a fuck billard well I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like that.</v>

2371
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:25.530
<v Speaker 1>They have to live like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like chicken so</v>

2372
01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.330
<v Speaker 2>he ever like stop and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in the middle of eating chicken</v>

2373
01:48:28.331 --> 01:48:31.150
<v Speaker 2>and ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is five meals in a row that I've</v>

2374
01:48:31.151 --> 01:48:33.840
<v Speaker 2>eaten a fucking chicken eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:48:33.850 --> 01:48:36.520
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how much of those hormones I</v>
<v Speaker 2>must have in my body.</v>

2376
01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a big misconception about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2377
01:48:39.751 --> 01:48:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Most chickens that you're eating don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have hormones in them.</v>

2378
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Hormones are expensive and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to give the chickens hormones.</v>

2379
01:48:45.751 --> 01:48:48.630
<v Speaker 1>The hormones that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that you give a chicken</v>

2380
01:48:48.631 --> 01:48:49.830
<v Speaker 1>hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so big,</v>

2381
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:52.380
<v Speaker 1>but now they're so big through selective</v>
<v Speaker 1>breeding.</v>

2382
01:48:52.410 --> 01:48:55.440
<v Speaker 1>They've essentially like if you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl with giant tits and you</v>

2383
01:48:55.441 --> 01:48:59.280
<v Speaker 1>breeder with a guy whose mom has giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>tits and everybody gets together and</v>

2384
01:48:59.281 --> 01:49:02.550
<v Speaker 1>then you have just a giant tip family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially what they've done</v>

2385
01:49:02.551 --> 01:49:04.470
<v Speaker 1>with these chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out a way to breathe.</v>

2386
01:49:04.471 --> 01:49:08.420
<v Speaker 1>These chickens were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have preposterously large breasts</v>

2387
01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:09.610
<v Speaker 1>and they can't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

2388
01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.760
<v Speaker 1>They're all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2389
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:14.070
<v Speaker 1>They're not like a regular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the chickens I have in my yard.</v>

2390
01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:16.650
<v Speaker 1>They run around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they jump up in there and they fly a</v>

2391
01:49:16.651 --> 01:49:18.650
<v Speaker 1>couple of steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are normal checks,</v>

2392
01:49:18.651 --> 01:49:20.130
<v Speaker 1>so they're flat chested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

2393
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:21.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like little,</v>

2394
01:49:21.511 --> 01:49:22.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics chickens</v>

2395
01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:27.750
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to a stripper chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get some stripper chickens</v>

2396
01:49:27.751 --> 01:49:30.300
<v Speaker 1>with double e fake tits that can crush</v>
<v Speaker 1>beer cans.</v>

2397
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Ever seen those gals and they hold a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beer.</v>

2398
01:49:32.131 --> 01:49:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Can they take one of their whoppers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just smashed that beer can with</v>

2399
01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:39.100
<v Speaker 1>them dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have glitter on the chicken and</v>

2400
01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:40.110
<v Speaker 1>she's got a backstory.</v>

2401
01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Why third dollar bill inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken?</v>

2402
01:49:44.850 --> 01:49:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you think that you're getting</v>

2403
01:49:46.381 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>hormones from</v>

2404
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.070
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely that's not the case,</v>

2405
01:49:51.190 --> 01:49:54.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's highly likely that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with beef,</v>

2406
01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:59.110
<v Speaker 3>especially corn fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting antibiotics because they</v>

2407
01:49:59.111 --> 01:50:02.260
<v Speaker 3>get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're most likely not getting</v>

2408
01:50:02.261 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 3>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some hormones in the animal</v>

2409
01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:08.830
<v Speaker 3>themselves and there's a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of selective breeding that I'm sure</v>

2410
01:50:08.831 --> 01:50:11.350
<v Speaker 3>would have more homework hormones than</v>
<v Speaker 3>less,</v>

2411
01:50:11.351 --> 01:50:15.910
<v Speaker 3>which would encourage the animals to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like larger bodies and develop more</v>

2412
01:50:15.911 --> 01:50:18.850
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think for the most part the</v>

2413
01:50:18.851 --> 01:50:23.851
<v Speaker 3>largeness is due to their diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you take a cow and you feed it</v>

2414
01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:27.250
<v Speaker 3>grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes much longer than for them to</v>

2415
01:50:27.251 --> 01:50:30.910
<v Speaker 3>reach the size that they would like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cow to reach before they butcher it.</v>

2416
01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.570
<v Speaker 3>But if you feed them corn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fattened up real quick.</v>

2417
01:50:35.110 --> 01:50:37.180
<v Speaker 3>And then obviously the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's extremes like that.</v>

2418
01:50:37.181 --> 01:50:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Why Goose Shit and Coby coby before you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

2419
01:50:40.601 --> 01:50:42.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just literally a dying animal.</v>

2420
01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:44.650
<v Speaker 3>It's filled with fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever get those things?</v>

2421
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if Mike Sullivan Irwin was a</v>

2422
01:50:46.991 --> 01:50:47.870
<v Speaker 3>cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2423
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:49.383
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

2424
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:50.860
<v Speaker 3>rest in peace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God bless you.</v>

2425
01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:53.150
<v Speaker 3>He's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2426
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:56.830
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this cow is essentially like they've</v>

2427
01:50:56.831 --> 01:51:01.550
<v Speaker 3>just given this guy this terrible diet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they fat all over their body but,</v>

2428
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:04.780
<v Speaker 3>and no exercise and even massage them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2429
01:51:04.781 --> 01:51:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they do in Japan that's like</v>

2430
01:51:06.851 --> 01:51:09.280
<v Speaker 3>part of the deal they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give them beer and then they</v>

2431
01:51:09.281 --> 01:51:11.290
<v Speaker 3>massage them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a happy ending?</v>

2432
01:51:12.810 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because their steers.</v>

2433
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:16.180
<v Speaker 3>So if their steers it means they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have any balls.</v>

2434
01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Know a steer is they take a bull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cut his balls off.</v>

2435
01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:23.140
<v Speaker 3>And that's what a steer is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time when you're buying,</v>

2436
01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:25.540
<v Speaker 3>if you buy ground beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2437
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm not wrong with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think sometimes ground beef is a</v>

2438
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:31.760
<v Speaker 3>cow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a female and um,</v>

2439
01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:35.440
<v Speaker 3>they like maybe they stopped producing</v>
<v Speaker 3>milk or they get to a certain age and</v>

2440
01:51:35.441 --> 01:51:36.790
<v Speaker 3>they shoot them and then they grind them</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2441
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:41.310
<v Speaker 3>But if you buy steaks like USD,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a prime t bone,</v>

2442
01:51:41.311 --> 01:51:42.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice t bone steak that's coming from a</v>

2443
01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:46.120
<v Speaker 3>steer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a cow that cut his balls off</v>

2444
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:48.460
<v Speaker 3>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fatten them up,</v>

2445
01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:50.820
<v Speaker 3>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know that ground beef is the,</v>

2446
01:51:50.821 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cow sometimes think ground beef</v>

2447
01:51:53.891 --> 01:51:56.350
<v Speaker 3>sometimes can be steered to like certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>cuts.</v>

2448
01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:59.290
<v Speaker 3>But I think in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm not wrong about this,</v>

2449
01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:03.400
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that most of the stakes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get if you buy like a nice rib eye</v>

2450
01:52:03.401 --> 01:52:05.140
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting it from a steer.</v>

2451
01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there also some chemical that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>released,</v>

2452
01:52:07.331 --> 01:52:10.660
<v Speaker 3>they say when they slaughter beef that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get scared.</v>

2453
01:52:10.661 --> 01:52:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it then that you're eating some kind of</v>

2454
01:52:13.151 --> 01:52:15.490
<v Speaker 3>a chemical sometimes as a result?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2455
01:52:15.491 --> 01:52:20.380
<v Speaker 3>there is a definite taste that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>think happens to an animal when they're</v>

2456
01:52:20.381 --> 01:52:21.740
<v Speaker 3>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2457
01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:25.570
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you shoot an animal and it's wounded</v>

2458
01:52:25.571 --> 01:52:29.470
<v Speaker 3>and it scared and maybe you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow up with a second shot or</v>

2459
01:52:29.471 --> 01:52:32.650
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that animal will not taste as good as an</v>

2460
01:52:32.651 --> 01:52:35.170
<v Speaker 3>animal that has no idea what hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:38.260
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy that I know that's a chef</v>

2462
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:42.730
<v Speaker 3>of a very famous San Francisco</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant say song.</v>

2463
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:44.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the name of it.</v>

2464
01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:46.080
<v Speaker 3>It was on my friend Steve [inaudible]</v>

2465
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella has a podcast called meat</v>

2466
01:52:49.161 --> 01:52:52.130
<v Speaker 1>eater and he's a pretty famous hunter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chef himself.</v>

2467
01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:54.650
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this chef of this,</v>

2468
01:52:54.651 --> 01:52:58.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this like one of the very few Michelin</v>

2469
01:52:58.370 --> 01:53:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah Blah stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many fucking Michelin</v>

2470
01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Stars and ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like very,</v>

2471
01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 1>very highly rated restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shoots the animals in the head only,</v>

2472
01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.950
<v Speaker 1>like when he goes hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hunting and he only shoots them in</v>

2473
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 1>the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has to have like a close shot with</v>

2474
01:53:12.501 --> 01:53:15.560
<v Speaker 1>a very accurate rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoots him in the head so they die</v>

2475
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:17.450
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea what happened.</v>

2476
01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:18.501
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dead,</v>

2477
01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:20.030
<v Speaker 1>no adrenaline dump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2478
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:23.480
<v Speaker 1>And then that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to him,</v>

2479
01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:26.060
<v Speaker 1>you get the finest flavor from the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2480
01:53:26.150 --> 01:53:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a harder shot to because that's</v>

2481
01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:30.380
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's moving the most on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

2482
01:53:30.381 --> 01:53:31.670
<v Speaker 1>The head could be.</v>

2483
01:53:31.670 --> 01:53:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could just be sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating like a lot of times they're</v>

2484
01:53:34.341 --> 01:53:37.670
<v Speaker 1>eating grass or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is obviously we're talking</v>

2485
01:53:37.671 --> 01:53:39.980
<v Speaker 1>about wild animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2486
01:53:39.981 --> 01:53:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it'd be really easy to do for a cow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2487
01:53:43.101 --> 01:53:45.260
<v Speaker 1>They would have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just sitting there eating.</v>

2488
01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 1>You could set up on a bench with a rifle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just take them out and they would</v>

2489
01:53:48.981 --> 01:53:51.140
<v Speaker 1>have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time with cows,</v>

2490
01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.430
<v Speaker 1>they use that cattle rod on that brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that guy used in no country for old</v>

2491
01:53:55.431 --> 01:53:58.200
<v Speaker 1>men from that dude come around with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he put it on people's heads and</v>

2492
01:53:58.210 --> 01:53:59.680
<v Speaker 1>punk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2493
01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:00.950
<v Speaker 1>That's how they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed cows.</v>

2494
01:54:01.690 --> 01:54:06.230
<v Speaker 1>They're being corralled into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the slaughterhouse and they know</v>

2495
01:54:06.231 --> 01:54:08.270
<v Speaker 1>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know something's not good.</v>

2496
01:54:08.290 --> 01:54:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they know exactly what it</v>

2497
01:54:10.221 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they definitely think they're</v>

2498
01:54:11.481 --> 01:54:11.960
<v Speaker 1>fucking hell.</v>

2499
01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.650
<v Speaker 1>I think if plants can tell that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>giraffe is eating from a mile away,</v>

2500
01:54:15.651 --> 01:54:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I think cows can tell that they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a killing field right in front</v>

2501
01:54:19.911 --> 01:54:23.810
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the worship is kosher ally.</v>

2502
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:26.260
<v Speaker 1>The way they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about this.</v>

2503
01:54:26.261 --> 01:54:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Slice their neck and the bleed out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they hang them up by their ankles</v>

2504
01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:33.740
<v Speaker 1>and flopping around bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

2505
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Cows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cows.</v>

2506
01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you buy kosher beef,</v>

2507
01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:42.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a very specific ritual that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be gone through.</v>

2508
01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:46.760
<v Speaker 1>That has to be accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to proclaim beef kosher,</v>

2509
01:54:46.761 --> 01:54:50.930
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a very sharp knife and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it all has to be done by a rabbi</v>

2510
01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.513
<v Speaker 1>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2511
01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2512
01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:56.210
<v Speaker 1>but I've watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched in videos and it's like,</v>

2513
01:54:56.211 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is terrible,</v>

2514
01:54:58.460 --> 01:54:59.690
<v Speaker 1>but kosher hot dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>

2515
01:54:59.691 --> 01:55:02.120
<v Speaker 1>They're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the best.</v>

2516
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:03.770
<v Speaker 1>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2517
01:55:03.771 --> 01:55:05.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like two different types of food.</v>

2518
01:55:05.791 --> 01:55:08.340
<v Speaker 1>There's kosher hot dogs and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty hot dogs.</v>

2519
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Think Kosher also in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be hormone free,</v>

2520
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:16.100
<v Speaker 1>it has to be antibiotics free and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they have to be on a specific</v>

2521
01:55:16.101 --> 01:55:17.750
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a bunch of things.</v>

2522
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Regular hot dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put the fucking beaks and the fee,</v>

2523
01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:22.020
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assholes,</v>

2524

<v Speaker 4>then we went to Moffitt coast,</v>

2639
02:01:09.311 --> 02:01:10.390
<v Speaker 4>which is down low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2640
02:01:10.391 --> 02:01:12.190
<v Speaker 4>And then we went to Capri,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went to the aisle.</v>

2641
02:01:12.191 --> 02:01:13.024
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did?</v>

2642
02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:15.070
<v Speaker 4>I hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That boat ride is a little crowded</v>

2643
02:01:15.071 --> 02:01:17.320
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the best.</v>

2644
02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:20.110
<v Speaker 4>It's just you just deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to the island,</v>

2645
02:01:20.111 --> 02:01:23.380
<v Speaker 4>you have awesome fish and seafood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fucking food there.</v>

2646
02:01:23.381 --> 02:01:25.260
<v Speaker 4>It's just so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2647
02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:28.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I throw all my dietary restrictions out</v>

2648
02:01:28.931 --> 02:01:31.990
<v Speaker 4>the goddamn window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I go to Italy somehow they don't get</v>

2649
02:01:31.991 --> 02:01:32.711
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2650
02:01:32.711 --> 02:01:37.480
<v Speaker 4>you're in Italy and these people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating pasta and cheese and wine and</v>

2651
02:01:37.481 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 4>they just seemed get a little launch,</v>

2652
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:41.560
<v Speaker 1>but that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2653
02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Well they walked there was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

2654
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I also think that they're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>heirloom wheat.</v>

2655
02:01:47.590 --> 02:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Wheat is a different kind of wheat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

2656
02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheat that we have today and someone</v>

2657
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>corrected me on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2658
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess I use the wrong term when I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified.</v>

2659
02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>It has been modified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been modified to traditional</v>

2660
02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:03.160
<v Speaker 1>agricultural methods of splicing and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2661
02:02:03.230 --> 02:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it was done with a dude in</v>

2662
02:02:05.781 --> 02:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>a lab coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2663
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:10.760
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheat that you get today is very</v>

2664
02:02:10.761 --> 02:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>different than the wheat of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago that we'd have 200 years</v>

2665
02:02:14.451 --> 02:02:16.310
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a small plant.</v>

2666
02:02:16.311 --> 02:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have a high yield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now when they,</v>

2667
02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>what they've done through this selective</v>
<v Speaker 1>breeding is create this really thick</v>

2668
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>heavy wheat that has a lot of complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutens.</v>

2669
02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people have gluten sensitivity</v>

2670
02:02:29.361 --> 02:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a more complex thing for your</v>

2671
02:02:31.101 --> 02:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>body digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're eating fucking wonder bread</v>

2672
02:02:34.491 --> 02:02:39.491
<v Speaker 1>and shit and all that stuff is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in your gut like that feeling,</v>

2673
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:41.510
<v Speaker 1>that's what it feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2674
02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>When you have a big fucking bowl of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pasta,</v>

2675
02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you feel like there's like because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what your body's doing,</v>

2676
02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:52.400
<v Speaker 1>your body's trying to compress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>digested and what do we do with all this</v>

2677
02:02:52.401 --> 02:02:54.590
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this fucking glue,</v>

2678
02:02:54.591 --> 02:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>this asshole just ate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just ate paste.</v>

2679
02:02:58.130 --> 02:03:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is it with pasta they give you</v>

2680
02:03:00.861 --> 02:03:04.970
<v Speaker 1>like it's the size of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I need that much of this shit?</v>

2681
02:03:04.971 --> 02:03:07.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no other meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give you that quantity of oil.</v>

2682
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.860
<v Speaker 1>They used to be a restaurant in Santa</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monica called Il Grano and it's done.</v>

2683
02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It's done now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went,</v>

2684
02:03:14.090 --> 02:03:17.870
<v Speaker 1>it went under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it first opened it was fucking</v>

2685
02:03:17.871 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And callen took me there and we ate</v>

2686
02:03:21.891 --> 02:03:26.891
<v Speaker 1>there and we had squid ink pasta and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would give you like it was a multi</v>

2687
02:03:27.501 --> 02:03:30.020
<v Speaker 1>course meal where they'd give you like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>plate of this and play that in.</v>

2688
02:03:30.021 --> 02:03:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Every plate was about the size of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fist.</v>

2689
02:03:31.851 --> 02:03:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Everything was fairly small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it right there.</v>

2690
02:03:34.130 --> 02:03:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit was good.</v>

2691
02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:38.780
<v Speaker 1>That's got um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sea urchin on top of it,</v>

2692
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:41.510
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But squid ink pasta,</v>

2693
02:03:42.410 --> 02:03:47.270
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we had had a crab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had dungeness crab and squinting</v>

2694
02:03:47.271 --> 02:03:48.650
<v Speaker 1>pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

2695
02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:50.540
<v Speaker 1>I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of the most delicious</v>

2696
02:03:50.541 --> 02:03:54.380
<v Speaker 1>things I've ever eaten in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But small portion and not the size of</v>

2697
02:03:54.381 --> 02:03:55.430
<v Speaker 1>your fucking head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2698
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He forgot to cheesecake factory.</v>

2699
02:03:57.710 --> 02:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>The other fat people eat traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2700
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:02.360
<v Speaker 1>it's the worst book.</v>

2701
02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Epo or the best depending on if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

2702
02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I used to work there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh they did in Columbus,</v>

2703
02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:12.920
<v Speaker 1>they give you a goddamn bathtub full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasta,</v>

2704
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:14.870
<v Speaker 1>family style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not for one person,</v>

2705
02:04:14.871 --> 02:04:17.660
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misconception they get crazy though.</v>

2706

<v Speaker 1>sauce and cheese and you're like,</v>

2707
02:04:20.121 --> 02:04:21.830

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
02:04:21.850 --> 02:04:24.530

<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>

2709
02:04:24.531 --> 02:04:27.530
<v Speaker 1>if you just want a gorge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just want to go deep.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That</v>

2713
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 4>was one of my favorite trump stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The trump story about the pizza with</v>

2714
02:04:41.611 --> 02:04:44.810
<v Speaker 4>little pizzas on top of it to verify</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that was.</v>

2715
02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:48.960
<v Speaker 4>That's what he was eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the stories of one of his</v>

2716
02:04:48.961 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 4>mistresses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things that she said</v>

2717
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 4>is that he ordered a pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for the toppings you want little</v>

2718
02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:55.080
<v Speaker 4>pizzas on the pizza.</v>

2719
02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:04.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that just like him.</v>

2720
02:05:04.190 --> 02:05:06.860
<v Speaker 4>He also got shit for when he was in New</v>
<v Speaker 4>York and he was running.</v>

2721
02:05:06.861 --> 02:05:11.360
<v Speaker 4>He ate a pizza with a knife and a fork</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he got a ton of shit about that.</v>

2722
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:14.540
<v Speaker 4>Maybe doesn't get his hands dirty at</v>
<v Speaker 4>satire.</v>

2723
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:17.300
<v Speaker 4>It is outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it sounded so fake that it sounds</v>

2724
02:05:17.301 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 4>so good though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

2725
02:05:18.650 --> 02:05:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Sounds so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is something that someone should</v>

2726
02:05:20.691 --> 02:05:23.840
<v Speaker 4>make pizzas a little pizzas as topping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's real.</v>

2727
02:05:23.841 --> 02:05:25.990
<v Speaker 4>The trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trump part of it was fake like him</v>

2728
02:05:26.070 --> 02:05:27.240
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>pizzas on top of that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I want to be there when it gets made.</v>

2733
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:40.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it that they stuff in the crust,</v>

2734
02:05:40.431 --> 02:05:42.020

2735
02:05:42.130 --> 02:05:43.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a pizza with little pizzas on top</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

2736
02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That actually looks delicious.</v>

2737
02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:47.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's a bunch of different kinds of</v>

2738
02:05:47.710 --> 02:05:51.890
<v Speaker 4>pizzas on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like Pizza Hut.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Domino's used to fucking suck really?</v>

2741
02:05:58.460 --> 02:06:01.640
<v Speaker 4>But now it's like decent pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2742
02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:03.680

<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2743
02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:08.510

<v Speaker 4>A couple of months ago was a bad.</v>

2744
02:06:08.730 --> 02:06:10.320
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2745
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:13.820

<v Speaker 4>I hate to sound like every other New</v>

2746
02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:14.541
<v Speaker 4>Yorker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it really is.</v>

2747
02:06:14.541 --> 02:06:16.970
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to find pizza out here in la.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's decent.</v>

2748
02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:18.110
<v Speaker 4>It's the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2749
02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:21.260
<v Speaker 4>That's what everybody says so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But has anybody made a real pizza where</v>

2750
02:06:21.261 --> 02:06:24.530
<v Speaker 4>they took the water from New York and</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought it over here?</v>

02:12:25.690 --> 02:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Elvis was a black belt under ed parker</v>

2889
02:12:30.461 --> 02:12:35.320
<v Speaker 1>legitimate karate instructor,</v>

2892
02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:43.270
<v Speaker 1>but I know he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he had places all over the</v>

2893
02:12:43.271 --> 02:12:44.050
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He went to,</v>

2898
02:12:50.081 --> 02:12:52.050

<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when we were living in</v>

02:13:01.171 --> 02:13:03.900

<v Speaker 1>how to teach karate in like a digestible</v>
<v Speaker 1>form that families could go to and it</v>

2905
02:13:09.561 --> 02:13:12.960
<v Speaker 1>just became this big business.</v>

<v Speaker 1>super legit.</v>

02:15:27.451 --> 02:15:29.400
<v Speaker 1>He didn't accidentally punched those</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys in the face.</v>

02:15:29.401 --> 02:15:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Constantly going probably to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably mad at him.</v>

2957
02:15:33.630 --> 02:15:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Just kept taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing about like karate,</v>

2958
02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:41.340
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always been bullshit karate back</v>

2959
02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:44.250
<v Speaker 1>black belts and they can kind of get</v>
<v Speaker 1>away with it because most of the time</v>

2960
02:15:44.251 --> 02:15:48.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't really spar and when you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>spar you kind of like take it light and</v>

2961
02:15:48.661 --> 02:15:49.271
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2962
02:15:49.271 --> 02:15:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I could have got you right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you do a bunch of that stuff.</v>

2963
02:15:52.111 --> 02:15:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I always saw a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't,</v>

2964
02:15:54.210 --> 02:15:57.900
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen with Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu because you can kind of do it</v>

2965
02:15:57.901 --> 02:15:58.650
<v Speaker 1>full blast.</v>

2966
02:15:58.650 --> 02:16:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Like karate can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

2967
02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:03.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not wise and you can't do it very</v>

2968
02:16:03.631 --> 02:16:04.710
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you full blast,</v>

2969
02:16:04.711 --> 02:16:07.590
<v Speaker 1>punch and kick each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wind up hurting everybody.</v>

2970
02:16:07.591 --> 02:16:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2971
02:16:08.911 --> 02:16:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Including you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2972
02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:11.353
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2973
02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:13.680
<v Speaker 1>you would be fighting like fist fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

2974
02:16:13.710 --> 02:16:17.370
<v Speaker 1>But with Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that you roll,</v>

2975
02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:20.070
<v Speaker 1>meaning you spar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that sparring does not involve</v>

2976
02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:22.860
<v Speaker 1>striking and you could tap out when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a bad position,</v>

2977
02:16:23.010 --> 02:16:26.670
<v Speaker 1>you could literally go full blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you really find out people that are</v>

2978
02:16:26.671 --> 02:16:27.870
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's very,</v>

2979
02:16:27.871 --> 02:16:30.430
<v Speaker 1>very few fake Jujitsu,</v>

2980
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:34.060
<v Speaker 3>black belts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but occasionally there are some and they</v>

2981
02:16:34.061 --> 02:16:38.950
<v Speaker 3>get outdated and there's some hilarious</v>
<v Speaker 3>videos online of guys getting arrested.</v>

2982
02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Where does Steven Seagal fall on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>line?</v>

2983
02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:45.970
<v Speaker 3>He is a legitimate I quito black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2984
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:50.770
<v Speaker 3>he was an instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the very first Americans to teach</v>

2985
02:16:50.771 --> 02:16:54.550
<v Speaker 3>at a Dojo in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Steven Seagal.</v>

2986
02:16:54.850 --> 02:16:59.560
<v Speaker 3>But the martial art is the questionable</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2987
02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:04.680
<v Speaker 3>It's the martial art of ICO is it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really a martial art that was created to</v>

2988
02:17:04.901 --> 02:17:09.190
<v Speaker 3>disarm people with swords.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea was that you lost your sword in</v>

2989
02:17:09.191 --> 02:17:11.860
<v Speaker 3>combat and someone was coming at you</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a sword.</v>

2990
02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Last ditch effort is you had to be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use someone's momentum against them.</v>

2991
02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:18.970
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be able to use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guy comes at you with a sword.</v>

2992
02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.350
<v Speaker 3>You have to be very adept at catching</v>
<v Speaker 3>their arm and flipping them over.</v>

2993
02:17:23.351 --> 02:17:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Here's the goal.</v>

2994
02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:25.000
<v Speaker 3>It's very subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2995
02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not use this because it's.</v>

2996
02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:30.340
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to poke fun at him when he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

2997
02:17:30.341 --> 02:17:31.870
<v Speaker 3>but let's go to that black and white</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2998
02:17:32.350 --> 02:17:34.570
<v Speaker 3>See that black and white one down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to that.</v>

2999
02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:36.490
<v Speaker 3>If you go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that one right there.</v>

3000
02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Steven Seagal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to that one.</v>

3001
02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some some footage of him when he</v>

3002
02:17:41.741 --> 02:17:42.491
<v Speaker 3>was young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3003
02:17:42.491 --> 02:17:45.370
<v Speaker 3>This is go fullscreen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is legit.</v>

3004
02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:48.880
<v Speaker 3>He is very legit and he was thin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a different thing,</v>

3005
02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:54.420
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is nobody comes at you</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this and a fucking ncaa wrestler</v>

3006
02:17:56.441 --> 02:18:01.150
<v Speaker 3>would shoot a double on him and take him</v>
<v Speaker 3>down faster than you can possibly</v>

3007
02:18:01.151 --> 02:18:01.721
<v Speaker 3>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3008
02:18:01.721 --> 02:18:03.910
<v Speaker 3>this does not work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dance.</v>

3009
02:18:03.970 --> 02:18:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>

3010
02:18:06.610 --> 02:18:08.950
<v Speaker 3>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone does know what they're doing</v>

3011
02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.170
<v Speaker 3>or if you have a lot of physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>attributes,</v>

3012
02:18:11.171 --> 02:18:12.580
<v Speaker 3>like Seagal is a huge guy.</v>

3013
02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:17.200
<v Speaker 3>He's a very big guy and he probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>could pull that off on a lot of people</v>

3014
02:18:17.201 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 3>who don't know how to fight and I hear</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what it was about.</v>

3015
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:23.140
<v Speaker 3>What I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quito is really bad.</v>

3016
02:18:23.141 --> 02:18:24.850
<v Speaker 3>This is Kendo though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're using swords,</v>

3017
02:18:24.851 --> 02:18:26.600
<v Speaker 3>which maybe they do use some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nikita.</v>

3018
02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but would Akita was originally created</v>

3019
02:18:29.951 --> 02:18:31.300
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm not mistaken,</v>

3020
02:18:31.570 --> 02:18:35.110
<v Speaker 3>was learning how to disarm like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy comes out and with a knife and</v>

3021
02:18:35.111 --> 02:18:36.730
<v Speaker 3>he flips the guy and takes the knife</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

3022
02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:39.160
<v Speaker 3>He's using the guy's energy against</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3023
02:18:39.250 --> 02:18:42.100
<v Speaker 3>That was the original intention of I</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quito,</v>

3024
02:18:42.430 --> 02:18:46.780
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of Japanese martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never thought of as the most</v>

3025
02:18:46.781 --> 02:18:51.781
<v Speaker 3>effective judo is far more effective</v>
<v Speaker 3>because judo involves people grabbing</v>

3026
02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:56.380
<v Speaker 3>people and flipping them and slamming</v>
<v Speaker 3>them on the ground.</v>

3027
02:18:56.590 --> 02:19:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a great video of an old</v>
<v Speaker 3>judo master.</v>

3028
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:03.580
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find this video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this guy he looks like he's</v>

3029
02:19:03.581 --> 02:19:08.110
<v Speaker 3>about 80 years old and he weighs about</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 pounds and he is lit.</v>

3030
02:19:08.170 --> 02:19:10.960
<v Speaker 3>You can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially someone who knows martial</v>

3031
02:19:10.961 --> 02:19:12.310
<v Speaker 3>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell when someone's just giving</v>

3032
02:19:12.311 --> 02:19:15.820
<v Speaker 3>in the problem with a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrations by Ketos guys are just</v>

3033
02:19:15.821 --> 02:19:18.460
<v Speaker 3>giving in like this old dude watch this</v>
<v Speaker 3>old dude.</v>

3034
02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:22.360
<v Speaker 3>The old dude in the right hand side is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much bigger than the other guy and</v>

3035
02:19:22.361 --> 02:19:25.820
<v Speaker 3>they're walking the guy around and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's really throwing this guy right?</v>

3036
02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 3>This is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is trying</v>

3037
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:30.440
<v Speaker 1>not to get thrown and he doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>

3038
02:19:30.530 --> 02:19:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Like trips him to the ground there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this old guy is tiny,</v>

3039
02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:39.200
<v Speaker 1>but he's using perfect leverage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect technique and fuck.</v>

3040
02:19:39.201 --> 02:19:42.950
<v Speaker 1>He looks really old in this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guys trying to throw him there</v>

3041
02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 1>and he can't pull it off and he can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull it off because the older guy has</v>

3042
02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:50.270
<v Speaker 1>perfect position and perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the name of this video?</v>

3043
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Perfect</v>

3044
02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:51.753
<v Speaker 2>leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this</v>

3045
02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:55.310
<v Speaker 1>nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judo master is the name of the video</v>

3046
02:19:55.311 --> 02:19:57.200
<v Speaker 1>online and I don't know if he was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>

3047
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:59.420
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly looks like it could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>

3048
02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:03.140
<v Speaker 1>but this old guy just knows how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>

3049
02:20:03.141 --> 02:20:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Also the back of his heels are always</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lifting up.</v>

3050
02:20:06.561 --> 02:20:10.310
<v Speaker 1>He's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's trying to throw him and he's</v>

3051
02:20:10.311 --> 02:20:12.350
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who's trying to throw him</v>

3052
02:20:12.351 --> 02:20:14.930
<v Speaker 1>appears to be a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least he's wearing a black belt.</v>

3053
02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Fucking incredible men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>

3054
02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:23.800
<v Speaker 1>So judo was a much more effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial art and judo was actually what</v>

3055
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:26.600
<v Speaker 1>was taught to the Brazilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3056
02:20:26.810 --> 02:20:30.460
<v Speaker 1>when count my ada went to Brazil and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3057
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:33.120
<v Speaker 1>taught people in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>

3058
02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:36.680
<v Speaker 1>particularly the gracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they taught them Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

3059
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:42.070
<v Speaker 1>The gracies took what was judo at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and they took the ground attacks of</v>

3060
02:20:42.291 --> 02:20:47.090
<v Speaker 1>judo and just perfected them and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>hone them and changed them and made them</v>

3061
02:20:47.091 --> 02:20:52.091
<v Speaker 1>more technical and really worked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>utilizing leverage and utilizing</v>

3062
02:20:52.461 --> 02:20:56.450
<v Speaker 1>submissions and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turned that into Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

3063
02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:59.410
<v Speaker 2>So judo is standing as well as ground?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3064
02:20:59.670 --> 02:21:02.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a ground aspect of judo</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

3065
02:21:02.251 --> 02:21:05.310
<v Speaker 1>like Ronda Rousey is probably one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most famous submission artists in the</v>

3066
02:21:05.311 --> 02:21:07.110
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And her background was in judo.</v>

3067
02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:09.720
<v Speaker 1>She was a judo player and very good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>judo.</v>

3068
02:21:09.721 --> 02:21:12.690
<v Speaker 1>She was a bronze medalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when she would get ahold of people,</v>

3069
02:21:12.691 --> 02:21:15.870
<v Speaker 1>she would just fucking throw 'em on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ass and flip them and toss them</v>

3070
02:21:15.871 --> 02:21:19.650
<v Speaker 1>and slammed to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just had phenomenal judo but also a</v>

3071
02:21:19.651 --> 02:21:23.580
<v Speaker 1>wicked arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was because the Ne Waza the</v>

3072
02:21:23.610 --> 02:21:27.330
<v Speaker 1>ground attack version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of Jujitsu comes from judo.</v>

3073
02:21:28.290 --> 02:21:29.123
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>

3074
02:21:29.530 --> 02:21:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father did judo and he taught it to</v>

3075
02:21:31.601 --> 02:21:35.080
<v Speaker 2>me and my brother and then I remember my</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother was bigger than me and he used</v>

3076
02:21:35.081 --> 02:21:39.220
<v Speaker 2>to flip the fuck out and then he did it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me one day and my father grabbed him</v>

3077
02:21:39.221 --> 02:21:40.830
<v Speaker 2>and flipped him down on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

3078
02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:45.300
<v Speaker 2>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is isn't like passing on knowledge.</v>

3079
02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:49.390
<v Speaker 2>This is just a violent family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Added control was dead drunk.</v>

3080
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:52.120
<v Speaker 2>He was six foot two cigarette in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

3081
02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:53.710
<v Speaker 2>My cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3082
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3083
02:21:56.381 --> 02:21:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Judo is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judah is way more legit than a kito.</v>

3084
02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Something like does not legit.</v>

3085
02:22:01.210 --> 02:22:03.420
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of pressure points and</v>

3086
02:22:03.421 --> 02:22:05.780
<v Speaker 2>holding the wrist in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3087
02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:09.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it is throws and learning how to</v>

3088
02:22:09.941 --> 02:22:13.750
<v Speaker 1>take an attack or like if you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge forward and an Aikido guy and you</v>

3089
02:22:13.751 --> 02:22:16.770
<v Speaker 1>have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your right hand come on like cocked and</v>

3090
02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:18.370
<v Speaker 1>ready and just run out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw that punch.</v>

3091
02:22:18.970 --> 02:22:21.010
<v Speaker 1>A really good Akita.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to grab that and flip you</v>

3092
02:22:21.011 --> 02:22:23.980
<v Speaker 1>and slammed me on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3093
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>how often does that come up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most,</v>

3094
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:29.640
<v Speaker 4>especially today when people actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>know how to fight,</v>

3095
02:22:30.130 --> 02:22:31.090
<v Speaker 4>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3096
02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:33.870
<v Speaker 4>it's too limited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of martial arts like</v>

3097
02:22:33.871 --> 02:22:36.060
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there are certain aspects of karate</v>

3098
02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:38.490
<v Speaker 4>that are applicable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of it that's really</v>

3099
02:22:38.491 --> 02:22:39.630
<v Speaker 4>limited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3100
02:22:39.631 --> 02:22:42.830
<v Speaker 4>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to teach your daughters</v>

3101
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:44.640
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my daughter is 14 and I'd love for her</v>

3102
02:22:44.641 --> 02:22:48.510
<v Speaker 4>to get into some martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would be the most effective Jujitsu</v>

3103
02:22:48.511 --> 02:22:49.940
<v Speaker 4>selfdefence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu,</v>

3104
02:22:50.050 --> 02:22:51.150
<v Speaker 4>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent.</v>

3105
02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:53.250
<v Speaker 4>Because with Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3106
02:22:53.251 --> 02:22:55.740
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you use a lot of your legs and a girl</v>

3107
02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:58.200
<v Speaker 4>has strong legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your bodies,</v>

3108
02:22:58.370 --> 02:23:00.150
<v Speaker 4>you're carrying your body run all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time with your legs.</v>

3109
02:23:00.350 --> 02:23:03.330
<v Speaker 4>You can catch a guy in a triangle or an</v>
<v Speaker 4>arm bar and break his arm or choke them</v>

3110
02:23:03.340 --> 02:23:04.910
<v Speaker 4>asleep with your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3111
02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:09.120
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of girls that would fuck a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of guys up on the ground just by</v>

3112
02:23:09.121 --> 02:23:11.080
<v Speaker 4>using armbars and leg locks and things</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

3113
02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Because an Armbar is your whole body</v>
<v Speaker 4>against someone's arm or a triangle is</v>

3114
02:23:17.161 --> 02:23:19.800
<v Speaker 4>your whole body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly your lower body,</v>

3115
02:23:19.801 --> 02:23:23.580
<v Speaker 4>but you're using your upper body to pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>down the head against the guy's neck and</v>

3116
02:23:23.581 --> 02:23:26.220
<v Speaker 4>arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're squashing the neck and the</v>

3117
02:23:26.221 --> 02:23:28.230
<v Speaker 4>arms together and then you're pulling</v>
<v Speaker 4>down to head.</v>

3118
02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:31.650
<v Speaker 4>A girl could absolutely put a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a girl can put me to sleep.</v>

3119
02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:35.370
<v Speaker 4>A girl's got a good triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a legit black belt and I get</v>

3120
02:23:35.371 --> 02:23:37.470
<v Speaker 4>caught in a triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will have to tap out,</v>

3121
02:23:37.471 --> 02:23:38.304
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3122
02:23:38.310 --> 02:23:41.130
<v Speaker 4>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know legs are strong men.</v>

3123
02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about what you do with your legs.</v>

3124
02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:45.930
<v Speaker 4>You know you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long can you walk in your hands?</v>

3125
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:46.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who?</v>

3126
02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:47.670
<v Speaker 4>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the world record for?</v>

3127
02:23:47.671 --> 02:23:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Walking on your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like an hour.</v>

3128
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:54.780
<v Speaker 4>How long if you walked to Disneyland?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3129
02:23:54.781 --> 02:23:57.120
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking your hours and hours on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your feet.</v>

3130
02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:59.010
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No problem at all.</v>

3131
02:23:59.090 --> 02:24:01.320
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the world record guy walked in</v>

3132
02:24:01.321 --> 02:24:03.420
<v Speaker 4>his sand?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A woman actually did it.</v>

3133
02:24:03.421 --> 02:24:06.330
<v Speaker 4>Five thousand meters and eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

3134
02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How many hours?</v>

3137

<v Speaker 4>How did she eat?</v>

3138
02:24:19.970 --> 02:24:21.560
<v Speaker 4>How do you eat upside down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just didn't.</v>

3139
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:23.070
<v Speaker 4>Each took.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Took eight hours off.</v>

3140
02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

3141
02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:25.830
<v Speaker 4>Can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can take it out.</v>

3142
02:24:26.430 --> 02:24:30.450
<v Speaker 4>I did gymnastics for like six years and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could walk like a motherfucker on your</v>

3143
02:24:30.451 --> 02:24:32.240
<v Speaker 4>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can still walk on my hands and you</v>

3145
02:24:33.631 --> 02:24:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I could literally,</v>

3146
02:24:35.701 --> 02:24:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I would walk around the house on my</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands when I was a kid.</v>

3147
02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:42.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a cool skill to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks cool.</v>

3148
02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:47.300
<v Speaker 4>Backflips to back to standing back flips</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Jesus Christ record for defending</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fourteen seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's got some pads on his hands,</v>

3152
02:24:58.830 --> 02:25:03.090
<v Speaker 4>but he's guards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's walking down those stairs like he's</v>

3153
02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:05.490
<v Speaker 4>on his hand on his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

3154
02:25:05.491 --> 02:25:06.810
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
