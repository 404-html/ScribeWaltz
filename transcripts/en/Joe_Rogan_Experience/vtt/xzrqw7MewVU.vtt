00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what's scary.</v>

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.481
<v Speaker 1>Not Scary.</v>

4
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>But to me it's just to see what happens with Jon Jones.</v>

5
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Cause now they suspended for a year.</v>

7
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

8
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>And he's been out even longer.</v>

9
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.351
<v Speaker 1>And then before that,</v>

10
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>so they're stripping and style and then Dana obviously,</v>

11
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>he never sticks to what he says.</v>

13
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.871
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he does,</v>

14
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>but he goes,</v>

15
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll never be a main event again.</v>

16
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Like we can't bill book him as the main event because we can't trust them</v>

17
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

18
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

19
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.401
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

20
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

21
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>So for John,</v>

22
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>granted he's doing that,</v>

23
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>that flow grappling event against the fuck out of here.</v>

24
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>That flow grappling.</v>

25
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>He could have been fighting for the UFC heavyweight title.</v>

26
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.551
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

27
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying Lisa Jones some active like at least he's not Muhammad Ali.</v>

28
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's lost millions of dollars,</v>

30
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>but at least he's doing something in combat sport or he's only suspended for a</v>

31
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>year retroactively.</v>

32
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It's July.</v>

33
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.963
<v Speaker 1>It's up in July.</v>

34
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>So he has to get but still got a while.</v>

36
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Cause we married before I did that huge laugh before.</v>

37
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>You'll see 200 so when he comes back,</v>

38
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to see what we get out of it.</v>

39
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.331
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

40
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>And then he came back and he fought over in saint proof and you know,</v>

41
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:00.721
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

42
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:01.351
<v Speaker 1>kind of tentative.</v>

43
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you saw Jimmy Manoir run through over in Saint [inaudible].</v>

44
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>All these guys are getting better.</v>

45
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.583
<v Speaker 1>They're getting better,</v>

46
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>they're rising up and you know,</v>

47
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>rumble rumbles fight in DC for the title again.</v>

48
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a real interesting fight.</v>

49
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Super interesting.</v>

50
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>You remember rumble did land that huge shark you see in them?</v>

51
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

53
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.771
<v Speaker 1>In this fight,</v>

54
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>he's got Neil Melanzane in his corner now.</v>

55
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>He's had them for a few years now.</v>

56
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>He's worked with a lot on his grappling.</v>

57
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>He guaranteed was concentrated a lot more as wrestling.</v>

58
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of videos of him running,</v>

59
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:29.071
<v Speaker 1>wrestling drills,</v>

60
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:29.431
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

61
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 1>nonstop.</v>

62
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>So he's preparing,</v>

63
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>he's preparing to get up.</v>

64
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>It's preparing for takedown defense,</v>

65
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:34.141
<v Speaker 1>fun fight,</v>

66
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

67
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a toss up for me.</v>

68
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.503
<v Speaker 1>Toss up.</v>

69
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>And then Jon Jones has all this laugh.</v>

70
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>It comes back and he would say,</v>

71
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>rumble for a reason.</v>

72
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Wins.</v>

73
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

74
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>what's up man?</v>

75
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

77
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>why do you think he's going to get a straight shot at the title?</v>

79
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think know if it would get a straight shot at the title and upon</v>

80
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 1>coming back.</v>

81
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

82
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>He must like everyone wants to see the in it.</v>

83
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why fans demand.</v>

84
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It might be something going on by then.</v>

85
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>By the time this time rolls around next year or July rolls around,</v>

86
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.343
<v Speaker 1>so he's gonna.</v>

87
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>He's free in July.</v>

88
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:00.384
<v Speaker 1>Whether that means,</v>

89
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.571
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

90
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how suspensions work,</v>

91
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>but what I would had been explained to me is performance enhancing drug</v>

92
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>suspensions don't even allow you to train with other fighters are on the roster.</v>

93
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

94
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

95
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>When your suspension is up,</v>

96
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>then you can train with them.</v>

97
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're even supposed to be sparring with them once they hand down</v>

98
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:19.171
<v Speaker 1>and suspension.</v>

99
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>How that regulation,</v>

100
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>do they know about that man,</v>

101
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>look that up,</v>

102
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

103
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.241
<v Speaker 1>Think that's true.</v>

104
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Wrap this up soon.</v>

105
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>

107
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's not because it's crazy because you could help your teammates,</v>

108
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>even if you're suspended,</v>

109
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you could still train and help your team and also sharpen your sword a little</v>

110
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:34.311
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

111
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:34.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like telling a guy who was an accountant.</v>

113
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>You're suspended for a year.</v>

114
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>He can't even touch a calculator when he's touching calculators.</v>

115
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>He's going to touch on,</v>

117
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

118
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

119
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Does that Tia Tia 83 Texas instrument?</v>

120
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

121
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

122
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>They used to make them have them in school.</v>

123
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Remember those?</v>

124
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Now it's now your phones.</v>

125
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.343
<v Speaker 1>Rq later.</v>

126
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.273
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

127
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Three was like a fucking elongated game.</v>

128
00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Like the calculator business man,</v>

130
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:01.834
<v Speaker 1>they took a hit.</v>

131
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>There are no longer rent.</v>

132
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Who's buying calculus?</v>

133
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>They're like blockbuster.</v>

134
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>There's none of them left.</v>

135
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Man's over gain.</v>

136
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

137
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.423
<v Speaker 1>see anything.</v>

138
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>The first article I clicked on was the one from last year,</v>

139
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think so.</v>

140
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.720
<v Speaker 1>But if the other thing to your point where you don't think he'll,</v>

141
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.311
<v Speaker 1>who says,</v>

142
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:19.144
<v Speaker 1>we'll get a title shot?</v>

143
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.373
<v Speaker 1>The lightweight,</v>

144
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.870
<v Speaker 1>the light heavyweight division is just El dinosaurs.</v>

146
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Besides the top few guys.</v>

147
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>There are so old.</v>

148
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.391
<v Speaker 1>John's like,</v>

149
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucking fight.</v>

150
00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>And show gun again.</v>

151
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how dare you buy it again.</v>

152
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>But Jimmy man was a very dangerous fight for anybody right now.</v>

153
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.700
<v Speaker 1>He's a dangerous fight for John to the man was clearly not.</v>

154
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>You are reaching Matt Matt on what lit up a OVN St Pru.</v>

155
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.240
<v Speaker 1>You see what happened when he fought gusts?</v>

156
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>When he got cracked?</v>

157
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what happened when he fought rumble?</v>

159
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.691
<v Speaker 1>He got cracked.</v>

160
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.320
<v Speaker 1>He got dealt with up restaurant.</v>

161
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't dealt with.</v>

162
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.751
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

163
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.351
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the game.</v>

164
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Well Ovince saint [inaudible] just went fucking the full distance with Jon Jones</v>

165
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>and a tough fight with a sleepy.</v>

166
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>John Jones had a broken arm.</v>

167
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Got His arm broken.</v>

169
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>That broke that arm by throwing kicks.</v>

170
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

171
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>But my point is he went the distance and St Crute took them out pretty quick.</v>

173
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I think he's dying or I think,</v>

174
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 1>and not saying per rather,</v>

175
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy man and what took them out pretty quick.</v>

177
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I think Madden was super dangerous,</v>

178
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.500
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>

179
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Striking first round for John has come back fight.</v>

180
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I think taking him down and beating him up on the ground.</v>

181
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Be John's best 100% he's a trip.</v>

182
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm thrown to the ground.</v>

183
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.224
<v Speaker 1>It's a metal.</v>

184
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Also John's different than anybody else in his length and is a bit tough to use</v>

185
00:04:29.931 --> 00:04:30.050
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

186
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get hit really.</v>

187
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>And his wrestling so fucking good.</v>

188
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>He's just so scared.</v>

190
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Not scared to go to the ground with anybody,</v>

191
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 1>but you look at light,</v>

192
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.783
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

193
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight division is hurting the most out of anyone.</v>

194
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I think you could go down the Russia God dog and we need some new blood in this</v>

195
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

196
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

197
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:48.320
<v Speaker 1>you might be right about the,</v>

198
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>the main event in Brazil is Ryan Bader rivers.</v>

199
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Little Nog little dogs.</v>

200
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

201
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking do it.</v>

202
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Y'All do what?</v>

203
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I've been fighting for 35 years,</v>

204
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Speaker 1>when is a little night move?</v>

206
00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Like a goddamn toward us,</v>

207
00:04:58.931 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to pay me,</v>

208
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.634
<v Speaker 1>I'll still do it.</v>

209
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't taken a same amount of punishment that his brother has,</v>

210
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>but he's taken some big law knockouts.</v>

211
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Hope,</v>

213
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>

214
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>hope neighborhoods.</v>

215
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>So could you knocked him out with a risk?</v>

216
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.363
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

217
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>he like clothes line down.</v>

218
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

219
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>And then the rumble one was just horrendous to suit.</v>

220
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I told you I was in the back of the locker room,</v>

221
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

222
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>warming up Pat Cummings.</v>

223
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucker warmed up,</v>

224
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>but basically doing like arm stretches couldn't hit mitts.</v>

225
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:24.874
<v Speaker 1>He was so stiff.</v>

226
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.421
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

227
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:26.254
<v Speaker 1>who's he fighting?</v>

228
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Like rumbles like,</v>

229
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

230
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>he can't go out there.</v>

231
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.281
<v Speaker 1>I looked at his coach,</v>

232
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:30.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

233
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:31.324
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

234
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.751
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

235
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't speak Spanish,</v>

236
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>but no Bueno or Portuguese,</v>

237
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:35.621
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

238
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:35.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

239
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

240
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 1>there's no commute.</v>

241
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Like he can't go out to man.</v>

242
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to grab his leg like a three year old,</v>

243
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>not let them walk out the side of the octagon.</v>

244
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I think Brazil is such a huge hotbed for MMA right now.</v>

245
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>It's so gigantic that they need Brazilian stars and you know,</v>

246
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>for the main event in particular,</v>

247
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:52.271
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

248
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>just don't have a whole lot of options in the light heavyweight division.</v>

249
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>So someone fucking wake up a little nug out of his slumber cause he's</v>

250
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>recuperating a little log or big nog little nug cause they're,</v>

251
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:05.460
<v Speaker 1>they're waking up as slumber cause little big Nog is done right.</v>

252
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>He's the little Nog they woke his ass up and he's like Alpha Phi Beta.</v>

253
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

254
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

255
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's probably asking for another fight,</v>

256
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>but outside of him.</v>

257
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>What other good light heavyweights from Brazil that are in the UFC that you</v>

258
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>could like sell a main event?</v>

259
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Our clover.</v>

260
00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

261
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>but they already fought.</v>

262
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:20.091
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

263
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>But glow over just got cracked too and he should probably take quite a while off</v>

264
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>after that knock out.</v>

265
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>That was a kind of knock out that you need to like not do nothing.</v>

266
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Lay Low.</v>

267
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

268
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.490
<v Speaker 1>he got flat line.</v>

269
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

270
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.010
<v Speaker 1>so you've got that light heavy.</v>

271
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You got Shogun,</v>

272
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.730
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know what's going on.</v>

273
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Shoguns gotta be done.</v>

274
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.811
<v Speaker 1>If he's not done,</v>

275
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>he's probably real close to being this what I'm saying like at light heavyweight</v>

276
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:38.451
<v Speaker 1>broke,</v>

277
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 1>go through name in Brazil though.</v>

278
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Even more so like as far as like Brazilian fighters as far as fame.</v>

279
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Fabulous.</v>

280
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Machida she suspended and suspended for a long fucking time,</v>

281
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.020
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>

282
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't Disney have a two year?</v>

283
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.463
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

284
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.091
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

285
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they've decided or not,</v>

286
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 1>but I felt like he got suspended for two years.</v>

287
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

288
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>you just look at the Brazilian fighters especially.</v>

289
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.111
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

290
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Light heavyweight Machida was going 85 anyway.</v>

291
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 1>You can float between two of,</v>

292

293
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.803
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot.</v>

294
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:09.561
<v Speaker 1>Not a whole lot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

296

<v Speaker 1>Beta already fought Leo.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All the,</v>

303
