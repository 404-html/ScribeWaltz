<v Speaker 4>couple miles of my house that I can go.</v>

171
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.210

175
00:11:50.291 --> 00:11:52.630
<v Speaker 4>And that's all you need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody knows that it's weed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>California for marijuana.</v>

185
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 4>And then you go to these places and some</v>
<v Speaker 4>of them you can pay with a credit card.</v>

186
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:29.041
<v Speaker 4>So trippiest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You buy weed with a credit card and </v>

187
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what year is this?</v>

188
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand and nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the rest of the country still living</v>

189
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 4>in the dark ages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado is catching up.</v>

190
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.610
<v Speaker 4>Colorado has a bunch of places now </v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado actually is going to open up a,</v>

191
00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:42.611
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a medical marijuana restaurant and </v>

192
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:45.241
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna open up some 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>square foot weeds superstore and </v>

193
00:12:45.241 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 4>boulders fucking gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like three stories.</v>

194
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:51.361
<v Speaker 4>Isn't Texas even doing like a vote soon </v>
<v Speaker 4>or a lot of people are trying in a lot </v>

195
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 4>of states are trying to chat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Massachusetts recently made it,</v>

196
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they decriminalized it.</v>

197
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.700
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have any medical law yet </v>

198
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now it's completely not legal,</v>

199
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 4>but it's not illegal.</v>

200
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not allowed to sell it.</v>

201
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 4>Like possession is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but selling it as a different thing,</v>

202
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 4>you're still not allowed to sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fine.</v>

203
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Like people fucking grow it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

204
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 4>Really fucking hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>S Thompson had it,</v>

205
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunter s Thompson.</v>

206
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:24.361
<v Speaker 4>When he was running for sheriff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was saying that no drug good enough </v>

207
00:13:24.361 --> 00:13:24.970
<v Speaker 4>to be taken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be allowed to be sold.</v>

208
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.420
<v Speaker 4>That was like a law that he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pass in Aspen and he was to call aspen </v>

209
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.841
<v Speaker 4>fat city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to change the name of Aspen </v>

210
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:34.150
<v Speaker 4>to fat city who's going to tear up all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the roads and saw the streets.</v>

211
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 4>So it was all dirt roads everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking lost by 400 votes.</v>

212
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Speaker 4>It's only 400 votes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't.</v>

213
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:42.100
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he won,</v>

214
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 4>if he was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

215
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.410
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sheriff of Aspen,</v>

216
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 4>that would've been fucking bad ass.</v>

217
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:50.710
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things that he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have was that any drug that you can take</v>

218
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 4>that was good enough to be taken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should it be legal?</v>

219
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.090
<v Speaker 4>And he's fucking totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

220
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 4>if people want weed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be.</v>

221
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.330
<v Speaker 4>People should trade things where we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

222
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.230
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

223
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to buy it if you want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

224
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 4>but the problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

225
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:08.190
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to get some really </v>
<v Speaker 4>unscrupulous people that just want to </v>

226
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:08.190
<v Speaker 4>sell pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

227
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.900
<v Speaker 4>they just want sell it and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to make profit off of it.</v>

228
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 4>And then it becomes like anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

229
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 4>they try to cut out the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

230
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.750
<v Speaker 4>like one of the weed stores that I go </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

231
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy right next door to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the that opened up like I'm talking like</v>

232
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 4>right next door.</v>

233
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Like there's maybe like one storefront </v>
<v Speaker 4>between two weeds doors and the guy's </v>

234
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.200
<v Speaker 4>pissed off and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

235
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's totally not in the spirit of you </v>

236
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 4>know what marijuana is supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

237
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:37.291
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to be opening up </v>
<v Speaker 4>right next store to a dude until his </v>

257
00:15:24.941 --> 00:15:27.010

<v Speaker 4>to fear and loathing in Las Vegas stuff.</v>

258

<v Speaker 4>Seeing things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

263
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 4>I've just started getting into hunter s </v>
<v Speaker 4>Thompson really recently.</v>

264
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 4>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess maybe a year and a half ago.</v>

265
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:47.300
<v Speaker 4>I was staying in a hotel room in Seattle</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I ordered up a Gonzo on the,</v>

266
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:52.301
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the paper view and the hotel just </v>

267
00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:52.301
<v Speaker 4>because nothing else look good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Said,</v>

268

<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just check this out and I'm </v>

269
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:56.831
<v Speaker 4>immediately became a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>S Thompson fan started reading his books</v>

270
00:15:56.831 --> 00:16:01.601
<v Speaker 4>and I'm reading the One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading what I'm reading now.</v>

271
00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 4>It's this one great shark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

272
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:15.671
<v Speaker 4>It's got everything in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a bunch of different shifts here and </v>

273
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 4>load things in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Kentucky Derby's a lot.</v>

274
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 4>A lot of great stores like a collection </v>
<v Speaker 4>of his works,</v>

275
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
<v Speaker 4>the quintessential well need to open </v>
<v Speaker 4>grow homes with retail fronts.</v>

276
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep it easy.</v>

277
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:32.291
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've never been to a grow room </v>

278
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:32.291
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only been to one grow room.</v>

279
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a um,</v>

280
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.590
<v Speaker 4>a place in la where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

281
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.920
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a full service place.</v>

282
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:41.430
<v Speaker 4>You can get a prescription there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could get weed there and you could a</v>

283
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:43.340
<v Speaker 4>picture with me.</v>

284
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 4>The Kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

285
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.850
<v Speaker 4>get weed there and they grew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was like this back room where </v>

286
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 4>they had all these lights set up and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was pretty fucking tripping man.</v>

287
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:57.850
<v Speaker 4>Like it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big ass room and it was filled with </v>

288
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 4>these plants and they were all lit up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you walked through the plants and if</v>

289
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah they were alive,</v>

290
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're living plants,</v>

291
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.740
<v Speaker 4>but it felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they were conscious.</v>

292
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was because I was really high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be,</v>

293
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.000
<v Speaker 4>but maybe because I was really high I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was able to tune into it.</v>

294
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 4>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a very weird sensation.</v>

295
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.540
<v Speaker 4>It felt like I was around like living </v>
<v Speaker 4>entities.</v>

296
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Like it didn't just feel like they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>plants.</v>

297
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.750
<v Speaker 4>It felt like they were alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

298
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 4>It was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was cool.</v>

299
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.200
<v Speaker 4>I thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

300
00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 4>that'd be cool to have something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in my house,</v>

301
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 4>but that's pretty illegal federally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least,</v>

302
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they caught you with a bunch of </v>

303
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:37.770
<v Speaker 4>plants in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

304
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:37.770
<v Speaker 4>and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey bitch,</v>

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:38.560
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing with those?</v>

<v Speaker 4>up to a group of black people.</v>

361
00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:43.900
<v Speaker 4>When the cameras aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll talk like Buddhist,</v>

362
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.820
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says stupid shit,</v>

363
00:19:45.821 --> 00:19:50.821

<v Speaker 4>younger monk and the younger monk says,</v>

365
00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.590
<v Speaker 4>And so the older monk throws him in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>water deep.</v>

366
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.700
<v Speaker 4>He talks like he's two totally different</v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes.</v>

367

<v Speaker 4>strange cop in Louisiana.</v>

369
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.340
<v Speaker 4>He has a southern accent that he uses </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the time,</v>

370
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.460
<v Speaker 4>part of the time and then occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 4>he drops a southern accent and he goes </v>

371
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.550
<v Speaker 4>with a full on black accent like waves </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hood,</v>

372
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.460
<v Speaker 4>but Steven Seagal is a fucking cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like for real.</v>

373
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.580

<v Speaker 4>The sign is a point of controversy from </v>

391
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 4>dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I hosted the.</v>

392
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible.</v>

393
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.440
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we thought it was terrible too.</v>

394
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.370
<v Speaker 4>We got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got fucked when we.</v>

395
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 4>When Doug Stam hope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I want to do that show.</v>

396
00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 4>They lie to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They told us you can do nudity.</v>

397
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 4>We'll blur it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can swear.</v>

399
00:21:25.691 --> 00:21:27.730

<v Speaker 4>It's going to be great publicity.</v>

400
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 4>And then when we started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

401
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:35.101
<v Speaker 4>Janet Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>polar nipple out and everybody went </v>

402
00:21:35.101 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy feeling the effects from that.</v>

403
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.330
<v Speaker 4>So amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like literally,</v>

404
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.360
<v Speaker 4>television got set back a decade because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Janet Jackson's nipple and the big </v>

405
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:48.361
<v Speaker 4>thing was that they were showing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>during the dinner hour and children are </v>

406
00:21:48.361 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 4>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well isn't a woman's nipple,</v>

407
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:54.270
<v Speaker 4>are we that fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like she had a rifle up her </v>

408
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:54.490
<v Speaker 4>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking nipple,</v>

409
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.370
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where babies feet.</v>

410
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it that offensive babies?</v>

411
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.000
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

412
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about it during the,</v>

413
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:07.350
<v Speaker 4>during the dinner hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody had a really good point when </v>

414
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.350
<v Speaker 4>this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he said,</v>

415
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.430
<v Speaker 4>isn't that like the first meal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the dinner breasts.</v>

416
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that when you.</v>

417
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Since you were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

418
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially having kids on my own now </v>

419
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.880
<v Speaker 4>when I see Mrs Rogan make fucking milk </v>
<v Speaker 4>with their tents and the tents are dead </v>

420
00:22:21.721 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't suck on them anymore.</v>

421
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.810
<v Speaker 4>But what's more important is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at them and you say,</v>

422
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:30.020
<v Speaker 4>that's like those are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like where food comes from.</v>

423
00:22:30.021 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

424
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.280
<v Speaker 4>this thing behind us make me hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how fucking stupid they were </v>

425
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.640
<v Speaker 4>when we were doing the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an argument and we hit,</v>

426
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:44.641
<v Speaker 4>we came up with a game show called you </v>
<v Speaker 4>make me hard and what it was is the guy </v>

427
00:22:44.641 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 4>would be strapped into a chair and he to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this box on his dick and with a </v>

428
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 4>light would go off on the box and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

429
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:54.450
<v Speaker 4>the light would indicate that he has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>boner and so we'd have like midgets </v>

430
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:54.450
<v Speaker 4>eating bananas and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

431
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's getting hard.</v>

432
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

433
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 4>it was Kinda Corny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what we really.</v>

434
00:22:57.251 --> 00:23:02.251
<v Speaker 4>The reason why we did it is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gags was we had this really hot chick </v>

435
00:23:02.251 --> 00:23:03.640
<v Speaker 4>and she climbs all over him.</v>

436
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 4>The audience is going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going nuts.</v>

437
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 4>And this really hot chick at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

438
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:13.090
<v Speaker 4>he pulls her tits out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's sucking on a tense whipped cream,</v>

439
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:18.091
<v Speaker 4>the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she pulls her panties off and </v>

440
00:23:18.091 --> 00:23:19.360
<v Speaker 4>she's got a dick and the audience goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

441
00:23:19.361 --> 00:23:24.361
<v Speaker 4>She was a tranny and I mean I've never </v>
<v Speaker 4>heard a bigger wave of disappointment </v>

442
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.490
<v Speaker 4>that when this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this tranny pulls out this Dick and she </v>

443
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.060
<v Speaker 4>was taking all kinds of hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was like addicted,</v>

444
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.350
<v Speaker 4>had been poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like dead.</v>

445
00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:37.351
<v Speaker 4>It was like dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was dark and shriveled up like it </v>

446
00:23:37.351 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 4>burned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like chemically burned.</v>

447
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:41.300
<v Speaker 4>Like it was like a little little dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>monkey dick and smell it.</v>

448
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:47.370
<v Speaker 4>And she pulled it out and she starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>like swinging it around in the fucking </v>

449
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.650
<v Speaker 4>audience went crazy and the guy sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the chair just had this look on his </v>

450
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:50.650
<v Speaker 4>face of horror.</v>

451
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they approved all that,</v>

452
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.240
<v Speaker 4>but what they wouldn't approve is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the name of the show make me hard.</v>

453
00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 4>They said that we had a name is show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make me stiff.</v>

454
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.650
<v Speaker 4>I guess like an argument like for real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's a difference.</v>

455
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they mean the same thing just to make me</v>

456
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 4>stiff doesn't sound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't sound quite as funny.</v>

457
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 4>Really doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what's the difference?</v>

458
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 4>But the point was that they were willing</v>
<v Speaker 4>to argue this.</v>

459
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:16.580
<v Speaker 4>That was a big deal for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that shows you how these shows work,</v>

460
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.410
<v Speaker 4>the best shows like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like standup Comedians,</v>

461
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.420
<v Speaker 4>like if you take a guy like Dave </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chappelle or you know Kat Williams or </v>

462
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 4>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any good comic that you like,</v>

463
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 4>they write all their own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They write it,</v>

464
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:33.491
<v Speaker 4>they perform it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're saying shit that they think is </v>

465
00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:33.491
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the producer,</v>

466
00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:33.491
<v Speaker 4>they are the performer there.</v>

467
00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 4>The whole ball of wax or the writer </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

468
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:39.761
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why you get a pure product </v>

469
00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 4>because you get a product that's from </v>
<v Speaker 4>this dudes mind.</v>

470
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 4>Well what happens is when you like start</v>
<v Speaker 4>working on a television show,</v>

471
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.850
<v Speaker 4>these people that are working for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>network,</v>

472
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 4>somebody has to work for the network and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would assume that the people at the </v>

473
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.960
<v Speaker 4>very top of the food chain are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect people for the job.</v>

474
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:56.110
<v Speaker 4>But that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just people that somehow or </v>

475
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.110
<v Speaker 4>another got that fucking job and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them,</v>

476
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.710
<v Speaker 4>they like to think that they know what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

477
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.860
<v Speaker 4>They like to think they have an iphone </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they always want to put their </v>

478
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 4>footprint on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to put their hand print on it.</v>

479
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:06.290
<v Speaker 4>They want to change something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that we,</v>

480
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.550
<v Speaker 4>I think the background should be blue.</v>

481
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.190
<v Speaker 4>We're going to ruin the whole show with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this red background and they'll go crazy</v>

482
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:11.870
<v Speaker 4>and they'll fucking fight over this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

483
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.580
<v Speaker 4>Because they want to be the ones say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

484
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't me that decided for the blue </v>
<v Speaker 4>background.</v>

485
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 4>If they didn't go with that blue </v>
<v Speaker 4>background,</v>

486
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:21.911
<v Speaker 4>the was shit and my right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the wife will agree with them </v>

487
00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:24.281
<v Speaker 4>and they all get fucking pilled up </v>
<v Speaker 4>together that this is what they argued </v>

488
00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:24.281
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make me hard.</v>

489
00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:28.811
<v Speaker 4>So this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to keep this sign because it was </v>

490
00:25:28.811 --> 00:25:29.030
<v Speaker 4>useless because we had to change the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sign to make me stiff.</v>

491
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 4>Like it's okay to pull out your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick.</v>

492
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 4>It's okay to have a guy strapped to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chair thinking a chick is on top of them</v>

493
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.840
<v Speaker 4>and this chick pulls out this wrinkled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poisoned black Dick.</v>

494
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 4>That's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't call it hard.</v>

495
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.700
<v Speaker 4>You have to call it stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really that dumb.</v>

496
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:48.701
<v Speaker 4>It seems like I would be exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's why Dave Chappelle walked </v>

497
00:25:48.701 --> 00:25:49.150
<v Speaker 4>away from the Chappelle show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just because having.</v>

498
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:54.160
<v Speaker 4>When you're a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having somebody else tell you what's </v>

499
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.441
<v Speaker 4>good and what's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was one of the things we did </v>

500
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:56.441
<v Speaker 4>in the man show where we want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joey ideas.</v>

501
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:58.100
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know what Joey Diaz is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

502
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter is mad flavor.</v>

503
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:04.631
<v Speaker 4>One word at mad flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Joey Diaz is one of the funniest </v>

504
00:26:04.631 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 4>dudes I've ever met in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the funniest human beings to</v>

505
00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:09.500
<v Speaker 4>ever live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Joey was like 350 pounds.</v>

506
00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 4>He's down to 300,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but back then it was like 3:50</v>

507
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.690
<v Speaker 4>and he would always get naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get naked all the time,</v>

508
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:19.691
<v Speaker 4>getting naked onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his balls literally look like </v>

509
00:26:19.691 --> 00:26:19.880
<v Speaker 4>grapefruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And an old ladies pantyhose.</v>

510
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're fucking ridiculous and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't shave them,</v>

511
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 4>but they have no hair on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he has no hair on his arms,</v>

512
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 4>no hair on his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's fat as fuck.</v>

513
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.290
<v Speaker 4>And we wanted to have him introduce us </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning of every show.</v>

514
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.560
<v Speaker 4>He kicks open this door and comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yell,</v>

515
00:26:32.561 --> 00:26:35.310
<v Speaker 4>and let's get this party started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his balls and Jangling.</v>

516
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.160
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

517
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:39.380
<v Speaker 4>it's hilarious because Joey's hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what he could read,</v>

518
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.620
<v Speaker 4>Doug Stanhope said Jody is could read </v>
<v Speaker 4>the phone book and it'd be fired than </v>

519
00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:44.620
<v Speaker 4>most of the shit you see late night tv </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's totally true,</v>

520
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 4>but they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not funny.</v>

521
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 4>What's funny about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not funny.</v>

522
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a big argument and I said,</v>

523
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do two openings.</v>

524
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 4>Will do one regular opening and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll do one opening with joey.</v>

525
00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did the opening with joey and they </v>

526
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.451
<v Speaker 4>went fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course everybody was screaming and </v>

527
00:27:02.451 --> 00:27:05.871
<v Speaker 4>laughing and it set the tone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tone that we wanted to have like </v>

528
00:27:05.871 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 4>this is we're just trying to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not,</v>

529
00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:08.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not trying to be relevant or what.</v>

530
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 4>We're just trying to have something that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people enjoy.</v>

531
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 4>Let's have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's have a fucking good time.</v>

532
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 4>But it was almost impossible to try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have that good time.</v>

533
00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 4>When you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

534
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:22.881
<v Speaker 4>other people like that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily funny at all and they're </v>

535
00:27:22.881 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 4>like putting their input into what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what should be in this comedy show.</v>

536
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:30.620
<v Speaker 4>So Doug and I got fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the most important thing is that we </v>

537
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:30.620
<v Speaker 4>had a good time and we came.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

538
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 4>we were always good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we became great friends.</v>

539
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else was going on here?</v>

540
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.300
<v Speaker 3>The snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

541
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:41.990
<v Speaker 3>You don't like the snowflakes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragging the video stream down.</v>

542
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

543
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 3>You might be right dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The snowflakes might be fucking us.</v>

544
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.800
<v Speaker 3>No more snow flakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that better everybody?</v>

545
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You haven't done that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>house where I'm 56 k modem for business.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but newsradio was way more fun.</v>

687
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.500
<v Speaker 4>News radio was a news.</v>

<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

691
00:34:47.191 --> 00:34:49.320
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe that I was on a TV </v>
<v Speaker 4>show that was just like.</v>

692
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Because I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really do much acting before </v>

693
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.821
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I acted on one other sitcom that I got </v>

694
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:01.431
<v Speaker 4>from doing standup comedy and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen Ninety four I've only been </v>

695
00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:03.990
<v Speaker 4>doing comedy six years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like I was still pretty raw as a</v>

696
00:35:03.991 --> 00:35:07.560
<v Speaker 4>comedian and then all of a sudden I'm on</v>

<v Speaker 4>now I'm on the show.</v>

698
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.610
<v Speaker 4>Not only am I not a TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on a TV show with Phil Hartman,</v>

699
00:35:11.611 --> 00:35:13.920
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking nuts,</v>

700
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

701
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:19.830
<v Speaker 4>and Dave Foley and Andy Dekoman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty incredible job.</v>

702
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.460
<v Speaker 4>But a fear factor was just about getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>clean,</v>

703
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.960
<v Speaker 4>getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

704
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.790
<v Speaker 4>She ain't gonna just like King Mo says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that pipe.</v>

705
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Brittany Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thoughts you don't want me to.</v>

706
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any thoughts until I find </v>
<v Speaker 4>out what children,</v>

707
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody says that it's drugs.</v>

708
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:43.881
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the husband doesn't want </v>

709
00:35:43.881 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 4>to have an autopsy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kinda strange.</v>

710
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

711
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.600
<v Speaker 2>obviously they were going to do one </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways because it's kind of like wide </v>

712
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:52.600
<v Speaker 2>sheet.</v>

713
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

714
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.380
<v Speaker 4>Unless you killed her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean why isn't she?</v>

715
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Why doesn't that guy wanted an autopsy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was a murder case,</v>

716
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.070
<v Speaker 4>then of course he would want an autopsy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

717
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.030
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you dive natural?</v>

718
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:05.050
<v Speaker 4>The only time where you die of natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>causes when you're 32 years old is if </v>

719
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.950
<v Speaker 4>you have like a serious health condition</v>
<v Speaker 4>or if you take something that kills you,</v>

720
00:36:06.951 --> 00:36:08.000
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty natural.</v>

721
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read that,</v>

722
00:36:09.261 --> 00:36:14.261
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of her close friends stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with her when she got </v>

723
00:36:14.261 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 2>married to that guy because of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something with this guy.</v>

724
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.680
<v Speaker 4>I've had some friends that have had some</v>
<v Speaker 4>serious drug problems in the past.</v>

725
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:24.681
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend that died from drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My best friend when I lived in New York </v>

726
00:36:24.681 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 4>and he used to do heroin when he used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do crack,</v>

727
00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:30.621
<v Speaker 4>but mostly heroin and he had like </v>
<v Speaker 4>manageable problems with coke and stuff </v>

728
00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:35.331
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Until he got on heroin and heroin just </v>

729
00:36:35.331 --> 00:36:35.850
<v Speaker 4>fucking sealed his fate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit,</v>

730
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.570
<v Speaker 4>that shit just gets in your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a part of you.</v>

731
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people,</v>

732
00:36:40.471 --> 00:36:45.471
<v Speaker 4>Jones and fur coat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people Jones for a lot of </v>

733
00:36:45.471 --> 00:36:45.471
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something really weird about</v>

734
00:36:45.471 --> 00:36:47.590
<v Speaker 4>watching people Jones for heroin </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

735
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.600
<v Speaker 4>It's like they need water like during </v>
<v Speaker 4>the desert and they need water and when </v>

736
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.411
<v Speaker 4>people get involved in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and apparently that's what a lot of the </v>

737
00:36:57.411 --> 00:36:57.411
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood kids are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them are doing fucking heroin,</v>

738
00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

739
00:36:58.321 --> 00:37:00.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty spooky,</v>

740
00:37:00.781 --> 00:37:01.080
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

741
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Real alcoholics are pretty tricky to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you wake up and you're 90,</v>

742
00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.710
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you drink isn't beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

743
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.790
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met a lot of alcoholics.</v>

744
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:19.940
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of alcoholics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of functioning alcoholics </v>

745
00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:19.940
<v Speaker 4>and I know a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

746
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just flat out drunks,</v>

747
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 4>especially comics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

748
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:30.171
<v Speaker 4>I've done a lot of comics that have had </v>
<v Speaker 4>real alcohol problems because they get </v>

749
00:37:30.171 --> 00:37:30.630
<v Speaker 4>free booze and they're out in clubs </v>
<v Speaker 4>every night and you know,</v>

750
00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:33.600
<v Speaker 4>alcohol gives you liquid courage and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're performing every night,</v>

751
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 4>you might be drinking every night or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're drinking every night.</v>

752
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna have a fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eventually.</v>

753
00:37:38.191 --> 00:37:39.270
<v Speaker 4>That shit's going to grab you.</v>

754
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Conspiracy theories are only theories </v>
<v Speaker 4>until proven fact.</v>

755
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the.</v>

756
00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:51.090
<v Speaker 4>There are real conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most conspiracy theories are stupid </v>

757
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:51.980
<v Speaker 4>because people want to find the mystery </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

758
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.470
<v Speaker 4>They want to find big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when.</v>

759
00:37:54.471 --> 00:37:59.471
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile there's a bunch of real live </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals that are way more interesting </v>

760
00:37:59.471 --> 00:37:59.710
<v Speaker 4>than bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If big foot,</v>

761
00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.720
<v Speaker 4>if we found big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big foot would be in a fucking cage </v>

762
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.170
<v Speaker 4>right next to the monkeys at the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we found them,</v>

763
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 4>if we really caught them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they be like,</v>

764
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:08.990
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a big ape.</v>

765
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got the short eight.</v>

766
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.560
<v Speaker 4>There's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a big 10 foot tall ape.</v>

767
00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Nobody would give a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like killer whales,</v>

768
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.160
<v Speaker 4>killer whales didn't exist and there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>some animal that people talked about in </v>

769
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.230
<v Speaker 4>legend that was as smart as people lived</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the ocean,</v>

770
00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:27.950
<v Speaker 4>but breathed air and had to come up for </v>
<v Speaker 4>air and doesn't eat.</v>

771
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Human being saves human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but kills everything else,</v>

772
00:38:30.621 --> 00:38:35.621
<v Speaker 4>including great white sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A superintelligent being it's gigantic </v>

773
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Speaker 4>and murderous and runs the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People would say,</v>

774
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

775
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not real.</v>

776
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 4>That can't be real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is real.</v>

777
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 4>We just know it's real and because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we know it's real,</v>

778
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 4>it's not as interesting to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People love mysteries.</v>

779
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 4>We love discovering new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the loch ness monster,</v>

780
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 4>loch ness monster doesn't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't kill anybody.</v>

781
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:58.681
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't do anything every now and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>pokes his head out of the water numbers </v>

782
00:38:58.681 --> 00:38:58.681
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

783
00:38:58.681 --> 00:38:58.800
<v Speaker 4>I saw it and everybody gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

784
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's fucking crocodiles that are </v>

785
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:03.810
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're alive.</v>

786
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 4>They're gigantic to like fucking 30 feet</v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

787
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 4>They can hold their breath underwater </v>
<v Speaker 4>for like hours at a time.</v>

788
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to eat for a year.</v>

789
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crocodiles are fucking crazy.</v>

790
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.880
<v Speaker 4>They're literally dinosaurs that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>still alive today.</v>

791
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:21.030
<v Speaker 4>They will be exactly the same way as </v>
<v Speaker 4>they are now hundreds of millions of </v>

792
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.030
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>

793
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's looking for the loch ness </v>
<v Speaker 4>monster.</v>

794
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something that people really,</v>

795
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 4>really get into when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies,</v>

796
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've been guilty of it myself,</v>

797
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:35.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I used to really be into Ufos and </v>

798
00:39:35.161 --> 00:39:38.550
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of stuff like that until I </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of realized like what I'm into is </v>

799
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.610
<v Speaker 4>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm into is like somehow or another</v>

800
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 4>is if there's something that's unknown </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I figured it out and I find it and I</v>

801
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:48.601
<v Speaker 4>know it's proven and true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then somehow or another you gained </v>

802
00:39:48.601 --> 00:39:51.361
<v Speaker 4>something from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you do to a certain extent if </v>

803
00:39:51.361 --> 00:39:51.730
<v Speaker 4>you can really prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mostly what it is,</v>

804
00:39:51.731 --> 00:39:55.610
<v Speaker 4>this weird desire that human beings have</v>
<v Speaker 4>for things to be to,</v>

805
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.560
<v Speaker 4>to prove things.</v>

806
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.930
<v Speaker 4>So it's a very weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conspiracy theories,</v>

807
00:39:58.931 --> 00:40:03.931
<v Speaker 4>like everybody's always looking like for</v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of conspiracies that aren't </v>

808
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:05.650
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this also from working where I've</v>

809
00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:09.550
<v Speaker 4>had people like working with the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people are always talking about the</v>

810
00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:14.551
<v Speaker 4>UFC wants this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Joe Rogan said that because of the </v>

811
00:40:14.551 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 4>UFC told them saying the UFC never tells</v>
<v Speaker 4>me to say shit.</v>

812
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:20.460
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally never tell me what to </v>

813
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:20.980
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My John's the craziest job ever.</v>

814
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm literally the guy who speaks for </v>
<v Speaker 4>this multi hundred million dollar sports</v>

815
00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:30.661
<v Speaker 4>company and nobody tells me what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I show up and they tell me what the </v>

816
00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 4>fights are and I just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to be professional as possible.</v>

817
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 4>I try not to swear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally I'll slip up with that,</v>

818
00:40:36.641 --> 00:40:41.641
<v Speaker 4>but I'm trying not to swear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all I'm trying to do is do </v>

819
00:40:41.641 --> 00:40:41.641
<v Speaker 4>commentary on the fights.</v>

820
00:40:41.641 --> 00:40:45.000
<v Speaker 4>The only thing they've ever told me what</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do is when they were trying to by </v>

821
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.151
<v Speaker 4>pride and pride,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck them over and there's this big </v>

822
00:40:48.151 --> 00:40:48.151
<v Speaker 4>thing going on back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

823
00:40:48.151 --> 00:40:50.260
<v Speaker 4>don't please don't mention pride by </v>
<v Speaker 4>name.</v>

824
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:55.261
<v Speaker 4>You can mention all the fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't mention pride by name because </v>

825
00:40:55.261 --> 00:40:55.360
<v Speaker 4>they didn't want to give advertisement </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that organization,</v>

826
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.570
<v Speaker 4>which totally is totally legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally makes sense to me,</v>

827
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't tell me like,</v>

828
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.310
<v Speaker 4>height this guy up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about that guy.</v>

829
00:41:03.311 --> 00:41:08.311
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't mention this guy's name and make </v>

830
00:41:08.311 --> 00:41:08.311
<v Speaker 4>sure you tell everybody that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the guy we want to win.</v>

831
00:41:08.311 --> 00:41:10.060
<v Speaker 4>There's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no zero.</v>

832
00:41:10.061 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 4>So I know that's a conspiracy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people think is real.</v>

833
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.080
<v Speaker 4>That's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

834
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:19.110
<v Speaker 4>I know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of other ones that people </v>

835
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:19.110
<v Speaker 4>think it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's ones that are real.</v>

836
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:19.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came to.</v>

837
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.400
<v Speaker 4>I are the ones that I've recently turned</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

838
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing.</v>

839
00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:24.480
<v Speaker 4>You talked about the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

840
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:29.820
<v Speaker 4>the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that would look </v>

841
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:29.820
<v Speaker 4>at those things in the sky and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that?</v>

842
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:29.930
<v Speaker 4>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

843
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:34.950
<v Speaker 4>well I talked to a pilot and I asked to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pilot about it and he gave me a very </v>

844
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.801
<v Speaker 4>simple explanation about how water going</v>
<v Speaker 4>through those jets,</v>

845
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:41.370
<v Speaker 4>those jet engines at a certain altitude </v>
<v Speaker 4>with certain,</v>

846
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weather conditions,</v>

847
00:41:43.351 --> 00:41:45.170
<v Speaker 4>certain moisture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humidity,</v>

848
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:48.780
<v Speaker 4>made any barometric pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of factors,</v>

849
00:41:48.781 --> 00:41:52.350
<v Speaker 4>but if it's the right factors is enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough water in it,</v>

850
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.200
<v Speaker 4>it'll create clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like literally jets create cloud.</v>

851
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.370
<v Speaker 4>So all these people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

852
00:41:56.371 --> 00:42:01.371
<v Speaker 4>they're making clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what happens when jets fly </v>

853
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:04.971
<v Speaker 4>through the fucking air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the idea that they won't be grain </v>

854
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:05.790
<v Speaker 4>cities poisoning people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't,</v>

855
00:42:05.791 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 4>they live on the ground to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're spraying themselves,</v>

856
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.580
<v Speaker 4>their families and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have shots.</v>

857
00:42:11.581 --> 00:42:13.380
<v Speaker 4>I've taken shots that they don't get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

858
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.240
<v Speaker 5>say that they don't experiment with </v>
<v Speaker 5>weather,</v>

859
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:18.110
<v Speaker 5>but the majority of the lines you see in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the air,</v>

860
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.690
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

861
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.970
<v Speaker 4>there's legitimate concerns about like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that heart program,</v>

862
00:42:21.971 --> 00:42:26.971
<v Speaker 4>whether they're fucking doing things to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ionosphere and there's for sure </v>

863
00:42:26.971 --> 00:42:30.901
<v Speaker 4>they're experimenting with whether.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we know that China has </v>

864
00:42:30.901 --> 00:42:30.901
<v Speaker 4>successfully created rain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

865
00:42:30.901 --> 00:42:35.581
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've done successful whether </v>

866
00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:35.581
<v Speaker 4>operations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>

867
00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:37.630
<v Speaker 4>there are absolutely real conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of goofy ones man.</v>

868
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:41.410
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is it's very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 4>for people to,</v>

869
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.400
<v Speaker 4>once they have made a decision about </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like jfk,</v>

870
00:42:45.401 --> 00:42:50.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oswald acted alone and people just get </v>

871
00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:50.401
<v Speaker 4>that in their head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oswald acted alone.</v>

872
00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:54.360
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult for them to look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>contrary evidence and take it into </v>

873
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:54.360
<v Speaker 4>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>

874
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.881
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like there's a competition </v>

875
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:00.601
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want their side to be right and </v>

876
00:43:00.601 --> 00:43:03.001
<v Speaker 4>people have a real hard time in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend that we were talking about with </v>

877
00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:03.001
<v Speaker 4>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

878
00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:03.880
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to be like we're having an </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument with him while saying,</v>

879
00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:08.881
<v Speaker 4>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know the research that I've </v>

880
00:43:08.881 --> 00:43:08.881
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

881
00:43:08.881 --> 00:43:11.980
<v Speaker 4>you're watching youtube clips is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>constitutes research these days,</v>

882
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.620
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was convinced the chem trails are</v>

883
00:43:14.621 --> 00:43:17.050
<v Speaker 4>real and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make no sense.</v>

884
00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.230
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing that pilot had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a good point,</v>

885
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.610
<v Speaker 4>it was like he's a pilot and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

886
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.710
<v Speaker 4>believe me man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pilots would be talking about it.</v>

887
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.140
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be like something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>that easy.</v>

888
00:43:26.141 --> 00:43:31.141
<v Speaker 4>You can just hire a guy to fucking spray</v>
<v Speaker 4>every city in the world everyday of the </v>

889
00:43:31.141 --> 00:43:32.650
<v Speaker 4>week and they're gonna keep their mouths</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut,</v>

890
00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.460
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>

891
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:38.760
<v Speaker 5>All these recorders that are like </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting pissed off at like oil </v>

892
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.701
<v Speaker 5>businesses for ripping off customers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you were getting sprayed with </v>

893
00:43:41.701 --> 00:43:44.460
<v Speaker 5>poison when that reporter be crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It researched reporter</v>

894
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:50.860
<v Speaker 4>this silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's I think chem trails or a silly </v>

895
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.081
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not not to say they haven't sprayed </v>

896
00:43:53.081 --> 00:43:55.121
<v Speaker 4>people before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to say that there haven't been some </v>

897
00:43:55.121 --> 00:43:59.110
<v Speaker 4>experiments where they've sprayed a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain bacteria or certain colds,</v>

898
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:04.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over an area to see if they can get </v>

899
00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:04.290
<v Speaker 4>people sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

900
00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:04.550
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know there's a thing called operation</v>

901
00:44:04.551 --> 00:44:07.220
<v Speaker 4>midnight climax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then in the 19 fifties,</v>

902
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:12.310
<v Speaker 4>the CIA ran fucking brothels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ran whorehouses in New York and San</v>

903
00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.480
<v Speaker 4>Francisco and they ran these things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they did was they ran a whore house</v>

904
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:22.481
<v Speaker 4>so they can do lsd experiments on people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so they unknowingly gave these </v>

905
00:44:22.481 --> 00:44:26.030
<v Speaker 4>John's acid so these poor guys would go </v>
<v Speaker 4>in there just to try to give their,</v>

906
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their hard earned money.</v>

907
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:32.351
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably didn't even have much </v>

908
00:44:32.351 --> 00:44:34.910
<v Speaker 4>pages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they had to get their dick </v>

909
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.910
<v Speaker 4>sucked and they're getting dosed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>acid,</v>

910
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 4>freaking the fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably already feeling super guilty.</v>

911
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.960
<v Speaker 4>Probably half of them were married and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they just cheat and otherwise and they </v>

912
00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.931
<v Speaker 4>felt guilty about that and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>dosed up with acid and deal with the </v>

913
00:44:44.931 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 4>reality of the situation mean we know </v>
<v Speaker 4>the CIA did that.</v>

914
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:49.770
<v Speaker 4>This is information that was released to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the freedom of Information Act.</v>

915
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 4>You look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Google it.</v>

916
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:56.211
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called operation midnight climax </v>

917
00:44:56.211 --> 00:44:59.360
<v Speaker 4>and it's just one of many experiments </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the CIA did unknowingly on American</v>

918
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:04.941
<v Speaker 4>citizens taxpayers or they've done it </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever and that's how they do business </v>

919
00:45:04.941 --> 00:45:08.250
<v Speaker 4>and guaranteed that if they did this </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in 1950,</v>

920
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 4>they're doing something like it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they changed.</v>

921
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not like these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these conspiracies,</v>

922
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:19.191
<v Speaker 4>all these things that the government's </v>
<v Speaker 4>done like operation northwoods </v>

923
00:45:19.191 --> 00:45:22.820
<v Speaker 4>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Northwoods was the thing that they </v>

924
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:22.820
<v Speaker 4>propose the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1962,</v>

925
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.171
<v Speaker 4>and this was signed by the Joint Chiefs </v>
<v Speaker 4>of staff and then vetoed by Kennedy and </v>

926
00:45:27.171 --> 00:45:31.520
<v Speaker 4>what it was was they were trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>people enthusiastic about a war against </v>

927
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.391
<v Speaker 4>Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they were planning on blowing up </v>

928
00:45:35.391 --> 00:45:38.481
<v Speaker 4>American ships like real ships that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have mock mock plane </v>

929
00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:42.000
<v Speaker 4>crashes where they're going to blow up </v>
<v Speaker 4>drones in the air and they were going to</v>

930
00:45:42.001 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 4>blame it on the Cubans.</v>

931
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:48.250
<v Speaker 4>They were going to say that all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people died and they were going to take </v>

932
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.051
<v Speaker 4>the passengers and put them under false </v>
<v Speaker 4>aliases and have pilots under false </v>

933
00:45:51.051 --> 00:45:53.080
<v Speaker 4>aliases and that pilot was going to give</v>
<v Speaker 4>may days and say,</v>

934
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 4>you got shot down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look that up too.</v>

935
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:59.601
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called operation northwoods and </v>

936
00:45:59.601 --> 00:46:02.211
<v Speaker 4>this was a real plan that they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>drafted in the 19 sixties that the </v>

937
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.760
<v Speaker 4>Department of defense drafted up and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>the joint chiefs of staff signed and </v>

938
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.700
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy vetoed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Kenny was like,</v>

939
00:46:08.701 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 4>you guys are fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

940
00:46:10.141 --> 00:46:15.141
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're going to fake attacks in </v>

941
00:46:15.141 --> 00:46:15.270
<v Speaker 4>order to get people to want to go to war</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Cuba,</v>

942
00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 4>and that's probably one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 4>why they joke Kennedy,</v>

943
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those.</v>

944
00:46:19.231 --> 00:46:21.930
<v Speaker 4>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are real conspiracies.</v>

945
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.960
<v Speaker 4>They're real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that their things are conspired </v>

946
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:26.960
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

947
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.590
<v Speaker 4>The real problem with conspiracies is </v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody wants to look stupid.</v>

948
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:33.770
<v Speaker 4>And when you say that you believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like you believe in alien </v>

949
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.801
<v Speaker 4>abduction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you believe the government killed </v>

950
00:46:36.801 --> 00:46:36.801
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy or you believe you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

951
00:46:36.801 --> 00:46:37.350
<v Speaker 4>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We didn't land on the moon.</v>

952
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 4>When you say you don't believe nutty </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

953
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 4>people just automatically label you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kook and instead of looking at it and </v>

954
00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:46.290
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

955
00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:51.291
<v Speaker 4>what has the government done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really have dosed people with lsd </v>

956
00:46:51.291 --> 00:46:55.431
<v Speaker 4>without their knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really set up whorehouses the </v>

957
00:46:55.431 --> 00:46:55.431
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The CIA did this really.</v>

958
00:46:55.431 --> 00:47:00.230
<v Speaker 4>They really were faking attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were planning a fake knee attacks </v>

959
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:03.560
<v Speaker 4>on American civilians and blowing up </v>
<v Speaker 4>American ships and blaming on the </v>

960
00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 4>Cubans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really were going to attack,</v>

961
00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 4>wanted them obey attack soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were going to fucking shoot mortars</v>

962
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:13.610
<v Speaker 4>into Guantanamo Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to kill American soldiers </v>

963
00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 4>and blame it on the Cubans and get us to</v>
<v Speaker 4>attack them.</v>

964
00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:18.450
<v Speaker 4>That's all real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you gotTa Keep Your Eyes Open.</v>

965
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.390
<v Speaker 4>You got to keep your mind open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the problem with conspiracy theories</v>

966
00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:24.710
<v Speaker 4>is people choose one side or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either there's a conspiracy,</v>

967
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:27.000
<v Speaker 4>theories are ridiculous and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>believing this.</v>

968
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Or they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

969
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.820
<v Speaker 4>the conspiracies are real and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>usually not that black or white.</v>

970
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 4>It usually takes a lot of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>before you get to the real truth.</v>

971
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.560
<v Speaker 4>And the real truth is fucking sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

972
00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.870
<v Speaker 4>it's real hard to have information about</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of things in this world,</v>

973
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.910
<v Speaker 4>as much information as we have on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet.</v>

974
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.250
<v Speaker 4>There's still a lot of shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get.</v>

975
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.340
<v Speaker 4>Like Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twittered something today that I was </v>

976
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:53.340
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy doesn't even he,</v>

977
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.300
<v Speaker 4>he's incorrectly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all been disproven.</v>

978
00:47:55.630 --> 00:48:00.630
<v Speaker 4>He twitted something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an anti Christian thing about a Mithra </v>

979
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.580
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

980
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 4>how funny it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Maher's it.</v>

981
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.780
<v Speaker 4>Even doing this research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's twittering something that </v>

982
00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.860
<v Speaker 4>everybody says about Mithra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was disproven.</v>

983
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 4>It gets his knees by the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>

984
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 4>Mithra born 12 slash 25.</v>
<v Speaker 4>12 disciples died,</v>

985
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.740
<v Speaker 4>rose on May,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the third day,</v>

986
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.170
<v Speaker 4>perform miracles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one has a lamb.</v>

987
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 4>The way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the truth,</v>

988
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:28.840
<v Speaker 4>the light 600 years before Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what this point is.</v>

989
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.620
<v Speaker 4>His point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's trying to say is like,</v>

990
00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no,</v>

991
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't.</v>

992
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.710
<v Speaker 4>There was no Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this,</v>

993
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:40.860
<v Speaker 4>this fable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this myth has existed in many different </v>

994
00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:45.541
<v Speaker 4>forms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Mithra thing is totally wrong </v>

995
00:48:45.541 --> 00:48:47.080
<v Speaker 4>because the myth or thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you just google a Zeitgeists,</v>

996
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:52.110
<v Speaker 4>the movie debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy gets really into the mythology </v>

997
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 4>behind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

998
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Zike guys,</v>

999
00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:00.660
<v Speaker 4>they talk about how Jesus really is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically the same story as all these </v>

1000
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.450
<v Speaker 4>different stores before.</v>

1001
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.910
<v Speaker 4>And one of them was Mithra and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1002
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:09.390
<v Speaker 4>so bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quoting on his thing that Mithra was </v>

1003
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 4>born 12 slash 25,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had 12 disciples.</v>

1004
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go to this other site that,</v>

1005
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.340
<v Speaker 4>that this guys seems like a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent guy.</v>

1006
00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:20.341
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's talking about anybody's </v>

1007
00:49:20.341 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 4>researched at at least talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>missing alleged of Mithra are numerous,</v>

1008
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:24.400
<v Speaker 4>numerous in account and span several </v>
<v Speaker 4>different cultures.</v>

1009
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.860
<v Speaker 4>I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says I ran into a brick wall of sorts</v>

1010
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:29.080
<v Speaker 4>trying to track down any of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

1011
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 4>I cannot find any evidence of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>birthday being December 25th.</v>

1012
00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:38.010
<v Speaker 4>The only dates that correspond to him or</v>
<v Speaker 4>his festival on October eighth and </v>

1013
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.250
<v Speaker 4>another on September twelfth through </v>
<v Speaker 4>16th.</v>

1014
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.580
<v Speaker 4>A cattle pairing festival October </v>
<v Speaker 4>twelfth through 16th.</v>

1015
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 4>There is absolutely is important part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is absolutely no evidence anywhere</v>

1016
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:49.600
<v Speaker 4>that he had 12 disciples or 12 of </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything for that matter.</v>

1017
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:52.900
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mithras scholars seem to know about it.</v>

1018
00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.770
<v Speaker 4>He was not born to a virgin but rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of solid rock.</v>

1019
00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:01.210
<v Speaker 4>So I mean it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really interesting.</v>

1020
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.680
<v Speaker 4>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1021
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:07.730
<v Speaker 4>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not enough research of </v>

1022
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.751
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't really look these things </v>

1023
00:50:09.751 --> 00:50:09.751
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1024
00:50:09.751 --> 00:50:12.160
<v Speaker 4>they quote a little bit of something </v>
<v Speaker 4>they saw on the Internet and that's the </v>

1025
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.571
<v Speaker 4>problem is there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you can have access to </v>

1026
00:50:15.571 --> 00:50:19.291
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you can know about </v>

1027
00:50:19.291 --> 00:50:19.291
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible,</v>

1028
00:50:19.291 --> 00:50:19.291
<v Speaker 4>so there's gonna be a lot of shit that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1029
00:50:19.291 --> 00:50:24.150
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you form an opinion on when you're </v>

1030
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:26.041
<v Speaker 4>really just talking out of your ass and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where most people are when it </v>

1031
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:27.060
<v Speaker 4>comes to conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1032
00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 4>everything with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People talk out of their ass and because</v>

1033
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 4>people have a huge vested interest in </v>
<v Speaker 4>being correct about things.</v>

1034
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people hate being foolish.</v>

1035
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:40.130
<v Speaker 4>They hate being the dumb one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hate being uninformed.</v>

1036
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:45.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people love correcting people they love </v>

1037
00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:48.701
<v Speaker 4>like your is u Apostrophe r,</v>
<v Speaker 4>e as in you are okay.</v>

1038
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:51.530

1117
00:54:22.271 --> 00:54:27.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was really the original mixed </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial artists when I started out as a </v>

1118
00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:27.271
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1119
00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:31.531
<v Speaker 4>I did karate and then I started doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo and each one of those </v>

1120
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:32.230
<v Speaker 4>disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>karate and taekwondo,</v>

1121
00:54:32.231 --> 00:54:36.130
<v Speaker 4>they wanted you to think that their </v>
<v Speaker 4>style was the best style,</v>

1122
00:54:36.131 --> 00:54:41.131
<v Speaker 4>the end all be all style karate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't want you training with </v>

1123
00:54:41.131 --> 00:54:41.470
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo people.</v>

1124

1127
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:51.850
<v Speaker 4>attached to their style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So really Bruce Lee and she couldn't go.</v>

1128
00:54:51.851 --> 00:54:55.660
<v Speaker 4>That's the original mixed martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the original guy to look at,</v>

1129
00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:00.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different systems and take </v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1131
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:04.770
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a genius when it came to martial </v>

1132
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:04.770
<v Speaker 4>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way,</v>

1133
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:04.770
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1134
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:04.770
<v Speaker 4>way ahead of his time.</v>

1135
00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.120
<v Speaker 4>I like this because the questions are </v>
<v Speaker 4>slower.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Twitters and yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

1138
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:17.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always threatening to do this,</v>

1139
00:55:17.171 --> 00:55:21.500
<v Speaker 4>but we're doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mother fuckers sub diverter.</v>

1141
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.710
<v Speaker 4>I love that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the truth just hits,</v>

1142
00:55:27.711 --> 00:55:30.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honors Thompson was a fucking genius.</v>

1143
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.840
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was one of the very few dudes that </v>

1144
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.460
<v Speaker 4>really captured the angst of the sixties</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the seventies,</v>

1145
00:55:37.461 --> 00:55:39.580
<v Speaker 4>that Nixon era and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1146
00:55:39.581 --> 00:55:42.020
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a part of the acid culture of the</v>

1147
00:55:42.021 --> 00:55:43.910
<v Speaker 4>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a part of the culture,</v>

1148
00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:48.911
<v Speaker 4>like the San Francisco Haight Ashbury </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement where it's like everybody was </v>

1149
00:55:48.911 --> 00:55:52.751
<v Speaker 4>doing acid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these people were like and good </v>

1150
00:55:52.751 --> 00:55:55.211
<v Speaker 4>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all these people were like really </v>

1151
00:55:55.211 --> 00:55:56.560
<v Speaker 4>coming together and they really like </v>
<v Speaker 4>releasing their egos and their cell,</v>

1152
00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:01.100
<v Speaker 4>their identity and kind of like losing </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves in a movement.</v>

1153
00:56:01.101 --> 00:56:03.380
<v Speaker 4>And then this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this hippie movement of the sixties,</v>

1154
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.460
<v Speaker 4>which seems like really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we look at it,</v>

1155
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:10.490
<v Speaker 4>it's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at these idiots with her long hand </v>

1156
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.610
<v Speaker 4>or stupid clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what they were doing was they were,</v>

1157
00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.790
<v Speaker 4>they were radically departing from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>previous culture.</v>

1158
00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:18.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fifties and the sixties is fucking </v>

1159
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:22.031
<v Speaker 4>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference between like buddy holly </v>

1160
00:56:22.031 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 4>and Jimi Hendrix is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1161
00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another world.</v>

1162
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's not like a 10 year </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolution.</v>

1163
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.690
<v Speaker 4>That's an evolution that would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken hundreds or not.</v>

1164
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:35.000
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not even gotten there at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like you.</v>

1165
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:40.080
<v Speaker 4>They needed the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They needed acid and mushrooms and pot </v>

1166
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:44.460
<v Speaker 4>pot and they needed all that shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>heroin to to launch themselves like from</v>

1167
00:56:44.741 --> 00:56:49.741
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one frequency to the next one and the </v>

1168
00:56:49.741 --> 00:56:52.570
<v Speaker 4>sixties were a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 4>frequency when it came to music,</v>

1169
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:57.630
<v Speaker 4>when it came to culture and that set the</v>
<v Speaker 4>stage for what happened in the seventies</v>

1170
00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:03.160
<v Speaker 4>and the eighties and we were the really </v>
<v Speaker 4>crappy music that came from the eighties</v>

1171
00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 4>and some of them in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but definitely the eighties.</v>

1172
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Like what that is is like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>

1173
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:13.321
<v Speaker 4>this incredible music where these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people were like really like </v>

1174
00:57:13.321 --> 00:57:16.210
<v Speaker 4>tuning into the art of it in the sixties</v>
<v Speaker 4>more sixties.</v>

1175
00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:19.700
<v Speaker 4>Music is like classic fucking Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that you,</v>

1176
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.520
<v Speaker 4>you here today and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

1177
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:23.230
<v Speaker 4>that's a good song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they,</v>

1178
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:27.160
<v Speaker 4>they really figured out how to tap into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the real shit.</v>

1179
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:29.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real energy that makes.</v>

1180
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.920
<v Speaker 4>That makes art interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes art resonate and I think they</v>

1181
00:57:35.681 --> 00:57:38.910
<v Speaker 4>did it with drugs and I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1182
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:43.930
<v Speaker 4>the decline in the seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly in the eighties was because </v>

1183
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 4>there was like a void left where the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1184
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:48.040
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this tuning in,</v>

1185
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:50.950
<v Speaker 4>this connection to the real pure source </v>
<v Speaker 4>was gone.</v>

1186
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like whatever they had hit whatever</v>

1187
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:56.410
<v Speaker 4>frequency they had nailed in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties,</v>

1188
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.500
<v Speaker 4>the echoes of it had died down by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time the eighties head,</v>

1189
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:04.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think hunter s Thompson had a fucking </v>

1190
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:08.370
<v Speaker 4>brilliant story that he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a brilliant piece that he wrote,</v>

1191
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wave,</v>

1192
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:12.900
<v Speaker 4>the talking about how the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1193
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:18.210
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a wave and that when the sixties </v>

1194
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 4>ended you could see where the wave broke</v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

1195
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:22.570
<v Speaker 4>like where they thought that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>could be like,</v>

1196
00:58:22.571 --> 00:58:25.330
<v Speaker 4>where they saw the true potential of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of humanity,</v>

1197
00:58:25.331 --> 00:58:27.970
<v Speaker 4>of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the human race in general.</v>

1198
00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:30.700
<v Speaker 4>And saw just roll back and go back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it was.</v>

1199
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's what it was between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties and seventies,</v>

1200
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:38.420
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he nailed that shit better than </v>

1201
00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.381
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunter s Thompson's words today still </v>

1202
00:58:40.381 --> 00:58:43.111
<v Speaker 4>when you look at like especially what </v>
<v Speaker 4>was going on with the Bush </v>

1203
00:58:43.111 --> 00:58:44.911
<v Speaker 4>administration and it was just like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearest evidence ever have of massive </v>

1204
00:58:45.101 --> 00:58:47.140
<v Speaker 4>amounts of corruption in government </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you know,</v>

1205
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.140
<v Speaker 4>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1206
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.590
<v Speaker 4>they got us into a war that made no </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking sense.</v>

1207
00:58:50.591 --> 00:58:55.591
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was obvious like across the </v>

1208
00:58:55.591 --> 00:58:55.591
<v Speaker 4>board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet was up,</v>

1209
00:58:55.591 --> 00:58:56.830
<v Speaker 4>the information was being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1210
00:58:56.831 --> 00:59:01.831
<v Speaker 4>very easily transferred back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 4>and yet it still managed to go through </v>

1211
00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:04.150
<v Speaker 4>and do the way he felt about the Nixon </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration.</v>

1212
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you literally could substitute Nixon for</v>

1213
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:11.461
<v Speaker 4>Bush and then insert most of the shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he said and to the early two </v>

1214
00:59:11.461 --> 00:59:15.310
<v Speaker 4>thousands raw sound as it sounds shitty.</v>

1215
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:22.740
<v Speaker 4>What do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about doing a radio </v>

1216
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:22.740
<v Speaker 4>show of my own?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to do radio show.</v>

1217
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.741
<v Speaker 4>The only problem is I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody wants to pay me to do a radio </v>

1218
00:59:26.741 --> 00:59:29.651
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might have to do a radio show like </v>

1219
00:59:29.651 --> 00:59:31.421
<v Speaker 4>this because right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Adam Corolla has a sweet setup </v>

1220
00:59:31.421 --> 00:59:36.030
<v Speaker 4>where he does a podcast and he gets a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people to listen to it and that </v>

1221
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:40.511
<v Speaker 4>might be the way to go because satellite</v>
<v Speaker 4>radio is struggling financially and you </v>

1222
00:59:40.511 --> 00:59:41.870
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people make money from it,</v>

1223
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1224
00:59:42.741 --> 00:59:47.741
<v Speaker 4>obviously Howard stern makes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>money from it and I think opie and </v>

1225
00:59:47.741 --> 00:59:48.440
<v Speaker 4>anthony make good money from it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't want to pay anybody else.</v>

1226
00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:50.660
<v Speaker 4>They're not making money so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the money to give out.</v>

1227
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:52.080
<v Speaker 4>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1228
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:56.450
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to do any sort of a turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>that up was at work.</v>

1229
00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:59.030
<v Speaker 4>Is that any better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that lauder anybody?</v>

1230
01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.690
<v Speaker 4>If I'm going to do any sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1231
01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:07.060
<v Speaker 4>a podcast or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be this,</v>

1232
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:10.390
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I saw soldier boy do it.</v>

1233
01:00:10.391 --> 01:00:10.940
<v Speaker 4>So I'll say it again.</v>

1234
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that video through a department.</v>

1235
01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:14.680
<v Speaker 5>The guy in the background with this gold</v>
<v Speaker 5>necklace.</v>

1236
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:15.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1237
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:20.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soldier boy is fascinating to me.</v>

1238
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:23.660
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know soldier boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a rapper,</v>

1239
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.560
<v Speaker 4>a very young fellow who's wildly </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>

1240
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:32.770
<v Speaker 4>made millions and millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's tattooed his entire body and </v>

1241
01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:36.341
<v Speaker 4>liked the course of a few months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the way up his neck and his </v>

1242
01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.210
<v Speaker 4>face is tattooed and his sleeves and his</v>
<v Speaker 4>chest and everything.</v>

1243
01:00:38.211 --> 01:00:40.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean he just tattooed the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself,</v>

1244
01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:42.880
<v Speaker 4>but like writing and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really bad artwork.</v>

1245
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really interesting.</v>

1246
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Just I guess he likes it</v>

1247
01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:50.930
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many times a day do you think he </v>

1248
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:50.930
<v Speaker 5>makes it rain?</v>

1249
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Makes it rain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it all day.</v>

1250
01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Smalltime multine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>multimillionaire,</v>

1251
01:00:52.871 --> 01:00:55.840

<v Speaker 4>they became rich and famous,</v>

1252
01:00:55.841 --> 01:01:00.841
<v Speaker 4>he was only like 17.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an interesting little study right </v>

1253
01:01:00.841 --> 01:01:02.290
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>All debt.</v>

1255
01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:05.410

<v Speaker 4>Making it rain all day.</v>

1256
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.390
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean making.</v>

1257
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:12.030
<v Speaker 4>When Kimbo says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all Kimbo says all dates means he's </v>

<v Speaker 5>he was younger and they're amazing.</v>

1318
01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.640
<v Speaker 3>We've tried every other phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm A.</v>

1319
01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm a technical fucking Geek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a nerd.</v>

1320
01:04:17.811 --> 01:04:22.811
<v Speaker 3>I love phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no phone that can fuck with </v>

1321
01:04:22.811 --> 01:04:26.771
<v Speaker 3>the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no network that could fuck with </v>

1322
01:04:26.771 --> 01:04:28.010
<v Speaker 3>verizon now and that's the real God damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1323
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.710
<v Speaker 3>So I don't use the iphone as my main </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

1324
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:34.880
<v Speaker 3>I mostly use the iphone these days as </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an internet device.</v>

1325
01:04:34.881 --> 01:04:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I use it as like a little tin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mini laptop and shit,</v>

1326
01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:41.780
<v Speaker 3>but from my phone I use one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>blackberry storm twos,</v>

1327
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:45.470
<v Speaker 3>which as a phone is not nearly as good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of funky.</v>

1328
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.760
<v Speaker 3>The typing on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad.</v>

1329
01:04:46.761 --> 01:04:48.710
<v Speaker 3>The storm too is definitely better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the storm one,</v>

1330
01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:54.450
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking the network is 100 times better.</v>

1331
01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.330
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1332
01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:02.510
<v Speaker 3>the verizon network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I had 18 t like when I would drive </v>

1333
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:04.970
<v Speaker 3>to Jujitsu at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drive the same way and it got to go to</v>

1334
01:05:04.971 --> 01:05:09.971
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood and my shit would drop out </v>
<v Speaker 3>three times on the way to Hollywood.</v>

1335
01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Three fucking times in 25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 miles,</v>

1336
01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:16.490
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times the shit would drop out with</v>

1337
01:05:16.491 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 3>verizon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Straight through</v>

1338
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.030
<v Speaker 6>never drops out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't.</v>

<v Speaker 6>They're about anywhere and I get better </v>
<v Speaker 6>reception inside buildings.</v>

01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:27.181
<v Speaker 6>It's just like better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just better reception period and </v>

1341
01:05:27.181 --> 01:05:28.930
<v Speaker 6>it's not like a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like several times better,</v>

1342
01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:34.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like the amount of dropbox that I </v>

1343
01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.271
<v Speaker 6>get with verizon are so tiny in </v>
<v Speaker 6>comparison to the ata and t eight t and </v>

1344
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:39.250
<v Speaker 6>t just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just got fucked by that iphone.</v>

1345
01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 6>That iphone is overloaded,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their network overload,</v>

1346
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:42.700
<v Speaker 6>that shit out of it</v>

1347
01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.940
<v Speaker 5>and the things that they just dropped </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that 18 has been pushing </v>

1348
01:05:48.341 --> 01:05:53.341
<v Speaker 5>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I and I agree is not being able to </v>

1349
01:05:53.341 --> 01:05:54.880
<v Speaker 5>use your data network while you're on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the phone.</v>

1350
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:56.320
<v Speaker 5>Verizon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>

1351
01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:01.590
<v Speaker 5>When you're on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't check your email and get new </v>

1352
01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.200
<v Speaker 5>email or go on twitter and get new </v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter's while you're on the phone.</v>

1353
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.500
<v Speaker 5>You can't use your data and your phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>together at the same time.</v>

1354
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:06.430
<v Speaker 5>Did you know that?</v>

1355
01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:07.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

1356
01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:12.770
<v Speaker 3>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bigger than a dropped call once </v>

1357
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:13.930
<v Speaker 3>in a while I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1358
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:18.950
<v Speaker 3>that is bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have no idea what I'm talking </v>

1359
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.950
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1360
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:22.790
<v Speaker 5>No data and not being able to use data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you're on the phone you can't </v>

1361
01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:26.991
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't get a emails while you're on </v>

1362
01:06:26.991 --> 01:06:26.991
<v Speaker 5>the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

1363
01:06:26.991 --> 01:06:28.570
<v Speaker 3>And Verizon can't fix that with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>current network.</v>

1364
01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1365
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:37.470
<v Speaker 6>That's why they had that thing where </v>
<v Speaker 6>they show that you can get on the phone </v>

1366
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:38.500
<v Speaker 6>and go into the apps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The but that sucks.</v>

1367
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:43.530
<v Speaker 6>It does suck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'll take being able to use the </v>

1368
01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:44.050
<v Speaker 6>phone over that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like using the phone.</v>

1369
01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:48.130
<v Speaker 6>I like what I'm driving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get my business done,</v>

1370
01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.360
<v Speaker 6>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A dry.</v>

1371
01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:54.380
<v Speaker 6>I have to get shit done and I have to </v>
<v Speaker 6>talk to people and sometimes I have </v>

1372
01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:57.901
<v Speaker 6>conference calls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes they'll do interviews while </v>

1373
01:06:57.901 --> 01:06:57.901
<v Speaker 6>I'm driving my car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1374
01:06:57.901 --> 01:06:58.360
<v Speaker 5>you know like you will call me up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll say something like,</v>

1375
01:06:58.361 --> 01:06:59.350
<v Speaker 5>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you do this?</v>

1376
01:06:59.351 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 5>Or something like come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd be gone.</v>

1377
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:02.850
<v Speaker 5>I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't do any.</v>

1378
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:04.900
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weak.</v>

1379
01:07:04.901 --> 01:07:07.630
<v Speaker 5>But I'll take it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll take that and have a signal.</v>

1380
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:11.050
<v Speaker 5>I'll take not being able to do both at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same time and have a strong signal.</v>

1381
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:11.890
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll take that.</v>

1382
01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 5>And that's because the cdma can't handle</v>
<v Speaker 5>two streams at the same time.</v>

1383
01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:15.710
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.250
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>verizon actually uses older technology.</v>

1385
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:21.130
<v Speaker 5>The TDX is a newer technology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is verizon.</v>

1386
01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:24.190
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of an avenger in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a slower network.</v>

1387
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:24.790
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 5>But it still works better.</v>

1390

<v Speaker 5>having that do that.</v>

1453
01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:26.010
<v Speaker 5>Well there it's obvious if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousand like Justin TV supposedly </v>

1454
01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:29.240
<v Speaker 5>working with the people that are owning </v>
<v Speaker 5>the copyright material,</v>

1455
01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:34.490
<v Speaker 5>why wouldn't it be easy if you noticed </v>
<v Speaker 5>that one of your chat rooms went from </v>

1456
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:35.820
<v Speaker 5>zero to 2002nd,</v>

1461
01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:52.980
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was the real problem was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people were taking a copy of it </v>

1462
01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:56.490
<v Speaker 3>after the event and then uploading it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what the problem is.</v>

1463
01:10:56.491 --> 01:10:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>promise,</v>

1464
01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.210

1468
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can stop it by cutting back on</v>

1469
01:11:06.941 --> 01:11:08.980
<v Speaker 3>those sites would probably stop and </v>
<v Speaker 3>substantially,</v>

1470
01:11:08.981 --> 01:11:12.300
<v Speaker 3>but that's going to kill those sites.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Just nobody that's even close to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1568
01:15:31.551 --> 01:15:33.620
<v Speaker 6>no one's even in his.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His frequency.</v>

1569
01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:35.360
<v Speaker 6>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's in the matrix right now.</v>

1570
01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.720
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's certain dudes they get to a </v>

1571
01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:40.720
<v Speaker 6>certain point with confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with experience,</v>

1572
01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.210
<v Speaker 6>with skill technique and then you add </v>
<v Speaker 6>discipline and conditioning to that.</v>

1573
01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.480
<v Speaker 6>They get to this crazy place that very </v>
<v Speaker 6>few people can reach this crazy high air</v>

1574
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:53.360
<v Speaker 6>and that's where Bj Penn's at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right Anderson Silva too.</v>

1575
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:58.390
<v Speaker 6>He's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's just in this air that nobody can </v>

1576
01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:01.301
<v Speaker 6>fuck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what's good about the ultimate </v>

1577
01:16:01.301 --> 01:16:01.301
<v Speaker 6>fighter that because it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>bringing new people in,</v>

1578
01:16:01.301 --> 01:16:03.410
<v Speaker 6>unknown people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

1579
01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.440
<v Speaker 6>there's such a gigantic gap between </v>
<v Speaker 6>these guys that have fought in these </v>

1580
01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.701
<v Speaker 6>smaller organizations and the guys at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the top of the food chain and you see </v>

1581
01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:13.490
<v Speaker 6>like with fate or million inco,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it takes so many years for a guy to</v>

1582
01:16:13.491 --> 01:16:17.270
<v Speaker 6>become like the fader of today and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Anderson Silva is a perfect example that</v>

1583
01:16:17.271 --> 01:16:19.400
<v Speaker 6>I like Anderson Silva when he's fighting</v>
<v Speaker 6>in pride.</v>

1584
01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:23.670
<v Speaker 6>I mean he got submitted by Rio,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shown in a to Z.</v>

1585
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:26.040
<v Speaker 6>got them in a mounted triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's dudes.</v>

1586
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:28.640
<v Speaker 6>Dudes were beating him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dudes are submitting him,</v>

1587
01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he,</v>

1588
01:16:29.611 --> 01:16:30.680
<v Speaker 6>he knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Carlos didn't,</v>

1589
01:16:30.681 --> 01:16:33.080
<v Speaker 6>but he just didn't look like the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Anderson Silva of today.</v>

1590
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:36.350
<v Speaker 6>And he had to have those fights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had to have those losses.</v>

1591
01:16:36.351 --> 01:16:38.780
<v Speaker 6>You had to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had to rise,</v>

1592
01:16:38.781 --> 01:16:40.760
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had to really get his shit together,</v>

1593
01:16:40.761 --> 01:16:45.761
<v Speaker 6>really focused on his Jujitsu and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and really become black belts on the </v>

1594
01:16:45.761 --> 01:16:49.691
<v Speaker 6>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he had this full package so that he </v>

1595
01:16:49.691 --> 01:16:51.851
<v Speaker 6>was totally confident in throwing </v>
<v Speaker 6>strikes because you didn't worry at all </v>

1596
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:51.851
<v Speaker 6>about being on the ground and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anderson Silva,</v>

1597
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:53.810
<v Speaker 6>the Ab now just like fully complete </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighter.</v>

1598
01:16:53.811 --> 01:16:58.811
<v Speaker 6>But we had to see him evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It took a long time for him to become </v>

1599
01:16:58.811 --> 01:16:58.811
<v Speaker 6>the guy that he is today.</v>

1600
01:16:59.060 --> 01:16:59.880
<v Speaker 6>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1601
01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.290
<v Speaker 6>it takes a long time to make a full,</v>
<v Speaker 6>complete mixed martial artist.</v>

1602
01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.980
<v Speaker 6>And these guys today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the competition is staggering.</v>

1603
01:17:06.981 --> 01:17:11.981
<v Speaker 6>There's so many fighters now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's mean there's so many different </v>

1604
01:17:11.981 --> 01:17:15.191
<v Speaker 6>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so many fighters and so many guys are </v>

1605
01:17:15.191 --> 01:17:15.650
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so hard to,</v>

1606
01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:17.660
<v Speaker 6>to advance and to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1607
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:22.661
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to make it to the very top of the food </v>

1608
01:17:22.661 --> 01:17:22.661
<v Speaker 6>chain in today's mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

1609
01:17:22.661 --> 01:17:24.530
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's so much fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>competitions.</v>

1610
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:29.770
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean when I first started doing the </v>

1611
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 6>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I first started working for them in 1997</v>

1612
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:35.590
<v Speaker 6>and it was tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We did the first show and dose in </v>

1613
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:36.590
<v Speaker 6>Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was nobody there.</v>

1614
01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.550
<v Speaker 6>I mean there was like a thousand people </v>
<v Speaker 6>or something like that.</v>

1615
01:17:38.551 --> 01:17:43.551
<v Speaker 6>And it's because the tickets were really</v>
<v Speaker 6>cheap and because people came to see a </v>

1616
01:17:43.551 --> 01:17:46.601
<v Speaker 6>fucking freak show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was nobody there that knew when </v>

1617
01:17:46.601 --> 01:17:47.030
<v Speaker 6>someone was passing the guard and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 6>passed the guard back then either.</v>

1639
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:53.020
<v Speaker 6>Is that a website where to float.com.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you google where to float,</v>

1640
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:58.110
<v Speaker 6>I know you can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you want to know about flotation </v>

1641
01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:00.451
<v Speaker 6>tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these are what this guy's asking about </v>

1642
01:19:00.451 --> 01:19:00.451
<v Speaker 6>is a thing called a sensory deprivation </v>
<v Speaker 6>tank.</v>

1643
01:19:00.451 --> 01:19:01.290
<v Speaker 6>And what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is um,</v>

1644
01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:03.070
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a tank filled with water.</v>

1645
01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:05.590
<v Speaker 6>If you haven't heard about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could google it and there's,</v>

1646
01:19:05.591 --> 01:19:09.280
<v Speaker 6>there's videos of the we made that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>could find online and Brian made,</v>

1647
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.770
<v Speaker 6>if you see any of my videos for my </v>
<v Speaker 6>website and you go,</v>

1648
01:19:11.771 --> 01:19:16.771
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those are really cool and creative </v>

1649
01:19:16.771 --> 01:19:16.771
<v Speaker 6>describing.</v>

1650
01:19:16.771 --> 01:19:17.860
<v Speaker 6>So that's Brian Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a fucking video genius.</v>

1651
01:19:17.861 --> 01:19:20.020
<v Speaker 6>Bitches recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1652
01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:22.780
<v Speaker 6>we made a really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the explains the isolation tank,</v>

1653
01:19:22.781 --> 01:19:27.781
<v Speaker 6>but what it is is a tank of water that </v>
<v Speaker 6>has a 800 pounds of salt in it and the </v>

1654
01:19:27.781 --> 01:19:29.620
<v Speaker 6>water is heated to the same temperature </v>
<v Speaker 6>of your skin.</v>

1655
01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:33.940
<v Speaker 6>And the salt makes you very buoyant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you lie in the water and you float.</v>

1656
01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.730
<v Speaker 6>And the um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that the water is heated to the</v>

1657
01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:38.950
<v Speaker 6>same temperature as your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't feel it.</v>

1658
01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:44.130
<v Speaker 6>So you're floating in this water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't really feel the water anymore </v>

1659
01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:44.130
<v Speaker 6>because the water in the air and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything,</v>

1660
01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:49.021
<v Speaker 6>it all feels like one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feels like you're weightless and </v>

1661
01:19:49.021 --> 01:19:51.541
<v Speaker 6>you're flying through space.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when he closed the door in this </v>

1662
01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:51.541
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're in total darkness.</v>

1663
01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:52.600
<v Speaker 6>You're in total silence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your ears are underwater,</v>

1664
01:19:52.601 --> 01:19:53.440
<v Speaker 6>you don't hear anything.</v>

1665
01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:56.980
<v Speaker 6>And in the absence of any sensory input,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't hear anything.</v>

1666
01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.680
<v Speaker 6>You don't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't see anything.</v>

1667
01:19:59.681 --> 01:20:03.340
<v Speaker 6>In the absence of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your mind has no distractions.</v>

1668
01:20:03.341 --> 01:20:08.341
<v Speaker 6>And your brain becomes supercharged and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you start having vivid hallucinations </v>

1669
01:20:08.341 --> 01:20:12.651
<v Speaker 6>and you start like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really like a psychedelic </v>

1670
01:20:12.651 --> 01:20:12.651
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You really start,</v>

1671
01:20:12.651 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you start like really like,</v>

1672
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.440
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like researching your,</v>

1673
01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:20.130
<v Speaker 6>your thoughts and getting to the heart </v>
<v Speaker 6>of who you are separate from culture,</v>

1674
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:23.880
<v Speaker 6>separate from language,</v>
<v Speaker 6>separate from your experiences.</v>

1675
01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:27.630
<v Speaker 6>You get down to who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when you get to that,</v>

1676
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:32.750
<v Speaker 6>once you get past that as one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hallucination start because you kind of </v>

1677
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.810
<v Speaker 6>ceased to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As you define yourself as who you are by</v>

1678
01:20:34.811 --> 01:20:36.570
<v Speaker 6>your job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the car you drive,</v>

1679
01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:39.090
<v Speaker 6>the house you live in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the family you have the friends,</v>

1680
01:20:39.091 --> 01:20:44.091
<v Speaker 6>you keep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you define yourself by all these </v>

1681
01:20:44.091 --> 01:20:44.091
<v Speaker 6>different things.</v>

1682
01:20:44.091 --> 01:20:44.091
<v Speaker 6>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're in that tank,</v>

1683
01:20:44.091 --> 01:20:45.300
<v Speaker 6>all those things are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>

1684
01:20:45.301 --> 01:20:48.000
<v Speaker 6>there's no outside world that is just </v>
<v Speaker 6>the mind,</v>

1685
01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:53.001
<v Speaker 6>it's the mind untethered from the body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you're in that state you,</v>

1686
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:58.310
<v Speaker 6>you kinda transverse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You kind of travel between this </v>

1687
01:20:58.471 --> 01:21:01.380
<v Speaker 6>consciousness and this reality to </v>
<v Speaker 6>another one.</v>

1688
01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:01.760
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1689
01:21:01.761 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 6>you travel outside of this world and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>traveled to this,</v>

1690
01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 6>the world of the deep inner thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1691
01:21:08.821 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 6>the deep inner connection between </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck this life is.</v>

1692
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:17.900
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the connection between your </v>

1693
01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:17.910
<v Speaker 6>consciousness and the universe and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>gets pretty fucking crazy.</v>

1694
01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.220
<v Speaker 6>I have one of those bitches in my </v>
<v Speaker 6>basement.</v>

1695
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 6>I do it all the time.</v>

1696
01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:25.800
<v Speaker 6>Is it like a really great power nap?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1697
01:21:25.801 --> 01:21:29.160
<v Speaker 6>it's not like a really great power nap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a really great mushroom trip,</v>

1698
01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:32.160
<v Speaker 6>but the best thing about it is you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>end it at any second.</v>

1699
01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:37.190
<v Speaker 6>Anytime you want to end it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just open up the door and you're </v>

1700
01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 6>stone cold sober so you can be in this </v>
<v Speaker 6>deep trance where you're,</v>

1701
01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:38.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your.</v>

1702
01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:43.490
<v Speaker 6>I've had really vivid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>vivid hallucinations in there where I </v>

1703
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:48.051
<v Speaker 6>felt like I was like I had traveled down</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the very atomic structure of human </v>

1704
01:21:49.081 --> 01:21:53.730
<v Speaker 6>beings and gotten through the lowest </v>
<v Speaker 6>point and at that lowest point,</v>

1705
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.670
<v Speaker 6>as you get lower and lower and deeper </v>
<v Speaker 6>and deeper,</v>

1706
01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.880
<v Speaker 6>it became like another universe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the idea in my head was that all of </v>

1707
01:22:02.521 --> 01:22:04.440
<v Speaker 6>this life that we see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1708
01:22:04.441 --> 01:22:07.610
<v Speaker 6>subatomic particles to Adams to all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these things like this,</v>

1709
01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:12.090
<v Speaker 6>this progression of things getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>bigger and bigger and bigger to humans,</v>

1710
01:22:12.091 --> 01:22:14.530
<v Speaker 6>to countries to continence the planets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to planets,</v>

1711
01:22:14.531 --> 01:22:17.190
<v Speaker 6>to galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>galaxies to you know,</v>

1712
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:20.880
<v Speaker 6>to universities and that all this idea </v>
<v Speaker 6>that things just keep getting bigger and</v>

1713
01:22:20.881 --> 01:22:21.600
<v Speaker 6>bigger and bigger.</v>

1714
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.570
<v Speaker 6>Well that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it works infinitely in both directions.</v>

1715
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:29.960
<v Speaker 6>And it was like I was taken on a trip </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the whole experience from </v>

1716
01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:34.850
<v Speaker 6>Subatomic to atomic to planets to flying</v>
<v Speaker 6>through space to face space,</v>

1717
01:22:35.401 --> 01:22:38.400
<v Speaker 6>being subatomic to the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1718
01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:43.401
<v Speaker 6>this new Adam that exists and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>part of new organisms that exist that </v>

1719
01:22:43.681 --> 01:22:48.681
<v Speaker 6>are part of a new ecosystem that exists </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a part of a new planet that's a </v>

1720
01:22:48.681 --> 01:22:49.320
<v Speaker 6>part of a new galaxy that's part of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>new universe.</v>

1721
01:22:49.321 --> 01:22:52.480
<v Speaker 6>And it goes on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I went through this whole thing like</v>

1722
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 6>over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like multiple times.</v>

1723
01:22:55.051 --> 01:22:58.110
<v Speaker 6>And it was really fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a very,</v>

1724
01:22:58.111 --> 01:23:00.950
<v Speaker 6>very vivid and very realistic and very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1725
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.410
<v Speaker 6>very life changing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The whole thing is like doing it a lot.</v>

1726
01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:09.440
<v Speaker 6>You got to do the isolation tank a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you've got to learn to relax and </v>

1727
01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.051
<v Speaker 6>you've got to learn to give in to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience because so many times when </v>

1728
01:23:13.051 --> 01:23:15.811
<v Speaker 6>you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're thinking about things and you're </v>

1729
01:23:15.811 --> 01:23:17.731
<v Speaker 6>worrying about things and you think </v>
<v Speaker 6>about your bills and your bullshit and </v>

1730
01:23:17.731 --> 01:23:18.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna Lose Weight and Oh,</v>

1731
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.790
<v Speaker 6>I've got to do this.</v>

1732
01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:23.940
<v Speaker 6>And all those thoughts distract you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the state of mind that you can</v>

1733
01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:30.001
<v Speaker 6>achieve in this isolation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very similar to the state of mind </v>

1734
01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:30.160
<v Speaker 6>that you can achieve from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1735
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:32.190
<v Speaker 6>when monks go through,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1736
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:35.350
<v Speaker 6>decades and decades of intense </v>
<v Speaker 6>meditation,</v>

1737
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:37.990
<v Speaker 6>like they achieve the same type of state</v>
<v Speaker 6>of mind,</v>

1738
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:40.090
<v Speaker 6>but you're achieving it like no </v>
<v Speaker 6>discipline.</v>

1739
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:44.110
<v Speaker 6>So it's hard to manage sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you can learn to manage it and if</v>

1740
01:23:44.111 --> 01:23:49.111
<v Speaker 6>you learn to go in with the correct </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought process and to approach it the </v>

1741
01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:51.970
<v Speaker 6>right way and maybe meditate before you </v>
<v Speaker 6>go in and calm yourself and put yourself</v>

1742
01:23:51.971 --> 01:23:56.971
<v Speaker 6>in a good state of mind and know how to </v>
<v Speaker 6>navigate the waters of these </v>

1743
01:23:56.971 --> 01:23:58.060
<v Speaker 6>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you can get to the crazy part,</v>

1744
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:59.680
<v Speaker 6>the crazy part.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to get to it,</v>

1745
01:23:59.681 --> 01:24:04.681
<v Speaker 6>but it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We should ask them what sounds better </v>

1746
01:24:04.681 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 6>and switch between the three.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1747
01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1748
01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:10.960
<v Speaker 3>settings to this microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what sounds better.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to upgrade this internet this </v>

1839
01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:16.540
<v Speaker 2>week as Internet I got here because then</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I'll bring my laptop and then I'll </v>

1840
01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:17.670

<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

1841
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:22.310
<v Speaker 2>We're going to set it up like a Goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking TV studio in here.</v>

1842
01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Bitch is 358.</v>

1843
01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:25.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Must be boring.</v>

1844
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Answer some questions here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adelaide show in Vegas.</v>

1845
01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1846
01:28:35.741 --> 01:28:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Late chosen vegas or a nightmare.</v>

1847
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:39.280
<v Speaker 3>How's it gloves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty big already.</v>

1848
01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The House of blues is a good size </v>

1849
01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:45.901
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the one thing that I won't do </v>

1850
01:28:45.901 --> 01:28:48.361
<v Speaker 3>anymore as I used to do the house of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Blues and I had most of the people were </v>

1851
01:28:48.361 --> 01:28:49.540
<v Speaker 3>seated but then there was all standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>room in the back.</v>

1852
01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:54.810
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is that standing room by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bar just becomes a bar and people </v>

1853
01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:55.660
<v Speaker 3>just started talking and it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nightmare.</v>

1854
01:28:55.810 --> 01:29:00.810
<v Speaker 3>So no more shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing any more shows ever </v>

1855
01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:01.500
<v Speaker 3>anywhere where people have to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 3>while they're watching show.</v>

1856
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1857
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:07.010
<v Speaker 6>the reason being is because I went to </v>
<v Speaker 6>see Doug Stan hope when he was in la and</v>

1858
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:12.050
<v Speaker 6>we went to see him and we're standing in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the back of the room because he did a </v>

1859
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:14.991
<v Speaker 6>standing room only show and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 6>after like an hour like your fucking </v>

1860
01:29:14.991 --> 01:29:17.000
<v Speaker 6>back hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He starts bothering you and you're,</v>

1861
01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:20.220
<v Speaker 6>it's not comfortable to stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>watch a show.</v>

1862
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:23.160
<v Speaker 6>I always figured because I'm on stage </v>
<v Speaker 6>standing for an hour,</v>

1863
01:29:23.161 --> 01:29:24.420
<v Speaker 6>like it's no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1864
01:29:24.421 --> 01:29:29.421
<v Speaker 6>you can stand for an hour and a half and</v>
<v Speaker 6>talk on stage and it doesn't feel it's </v>

1865
01:29:29.421 --> 01:29:31.650
<v Speaker 6>not a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but standing still watching someone is a</v>

1866
01:29:31.651 --> 01:29:32.380
<v Speaker 6>big difference between</v>

1867
01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.610
<v Speaker 5>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible.</v>

1868
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:35.620
<v Speaker 5>Do you even remember like the last half </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that show?</v>

1869
01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:37.540
<v Speaker 5>Because I was focused on my feet the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole time.</v>

1870
01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:42.070
<v Speaker 5>It's a terrible feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what's weird is I talked to somebody</v>

1871
01:29:42.071 --> 01:29:47.071
<v Speaker 5>in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they walked out of this show because </v>

1872
01:29:47.071 --> 01:29:49.121
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't because it was awkward </v>
<v Speaker 5>standing room only and Doug's show and </v>

1873
01:29:49.121 --> 01:29:49.520
<v Speaker 5>they just walked out here like we </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't take anymore.</v>

1874
01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:50.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate it.</v>

1875
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:55.460
<v Speaker 6>So I'm not doing it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm having problems with this </v>

1876
01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:56.640
<v Speaker 6>because I had a show booked in March at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fillmore,</v>

1877
01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:01.940
<v Speaker 6>the fillmore in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they said that the whole balcony he </v>

1878
01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:01.940
<v Speaker 6>had to be standing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1879
01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:04.230
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that man gave me less money.</v>

1880
01:30:04.410 --> 01:30:06.270
<v Speaker 6>Let's see what we can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And.</v>

1881
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:07.260
<v Speaker 6>But they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1882
01:30:07.261 --> 01:30:09.120
<v Speaker 6>we can make more money if people stand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

1883
01:30:09.121 --> 01:30:09.810
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're done.</v>

1884
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:15.070
<v Speaker 6>And so I canceled that Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the same thing happened in </v>

1885
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:17.841
<v Speaker 6>Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was supposed to do the house of Blues </v>

1886
01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:17.841
<v Speaker 6>and the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>

1887
01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:17.841
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1888
01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:21.981
<v Speaker 6>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we need to have people standing in the </v>

1889
01:30:21.981 --> 01:30:22.080
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'd had it booked or I don't know.</v>

1890
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:27.590
<v Speaker 6>My agents are not communicating this to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the people or they're not paying </v>

1891
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:30.711
<v Speaker 6>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going through too many people </v>

1892
01:30:30.711 --> 01:30:30.711
<v Speaker 6>before it gets to the person that makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>the decision,</v>

1893
01:30:30.711 --> 01:30:34.461
<v Speaker 6>but they didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They wanted to have people stand and I </v>

1894
01:30:34.461 --> 01:30:37.401
<v Speaker 6>said fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So now I'm going to have to find a new </v>

1895
01:30:37.401 --> 01:30:39.861
<v Speaker 6>gig in New York and new Gig in Houston </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm probably going to wind up doing </v>

1896
01:30:39.861 --> 01:30:40.170
<v Speaker 6>the Improv in Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1897
01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:44.910
<v Speaker 6>Thinking about that and some maybe one </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the clubs in New York City.</v>

1898
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:48.760
<v Speaker 5>You go to Joe's twitter or a website </v>
<v Speaker 5>that has this calendar on it.</v>

1899
01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:53.880
<v Speaker 5>You just gained for people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those people like talking about </v>

1900
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:53.880
<v Speaker 5>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1901
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:55.900
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember standing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting,</v>

1902
01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:00.920
<v Speaker 5>like wave for a roller coaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Understanding like three hours for a </v>

1903
01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:01.000
<v Speaker 5>roller coaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like last minute.</v>

1904
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:02.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking terrible.</v>

1905
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1906
01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:07.850
<v Speaker 6>Why don't like Tom Green?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1907
01:31:07.851 --> 01:31:12.851
<v Speaker 6>Tom Green's got an awesome set up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to Tom Green's house where I </v>

1908
01:31:12.851 --> 01:31:16.690
<v Speaker 6>filmed a his talk show there and he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>got a fucking crazy setup man,</v>

1909
01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:20.300
<v Speaker 6>like giant servers and he's got wires </v>
<v Speaker 6>big,</v>

1910
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:25.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wires all throughout his living room </v>

1911
01:31:25.330 --> 01:31:27.320
<v Speaker 6>because like he's doing it like serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>hardcore style and he's doing it or at </v>

1912
01:31:27.651 --> 01:31:28.400
<v Speaker 6>least back to anyone.</v>

1913
01:31:28.730 --> 01:31:30.270
<v Speaker 5>He's still doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't he or is he?</v>

1914
01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:33.390
<v Speaker 5>Is he straight paper view now that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't watch it for free at all now?</v>

1915
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:35.400
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

1916
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:38.660
<v Speaker 6>Tom Green live and see that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that the case ladies and gentlemen?</v>

1917
01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:40.730
<v Speaker 6>If it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a fucking mistake.</v>

1918
01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:43.050
<v Speaker 5>I think it is too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>

1919
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:45.230
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's the archives.</v>

1920
01:31:45.231 --> 01:31:47.270
<v Speaker 5>You have to be a member to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>

1921
01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.140
<v Speaker 6>Maybe we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going into the channel.</v>

1922
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.900

<v Speaker 3>I'm grown up.</v>

1947
01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:08.770
<v Speaker 5>is that my parents sent me money and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then I took that money to buy them </v>

1948
01:33:09.141 --> 01:33:11.120
<v Speaker 5>presents and actually spent more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1949
01:33:11.121 --> 01:33:16.121
<v Speaker 5>They sent me if I would have waited and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sent them presents first and then they </v>

1950
01:33:16.121 --> 01:33:17.450
<v Speaker 5>got me money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have felt like I got something,</v>

1951
01:33:17.451 --> 01:33:19.400
<v Speaker 5>but I felt like I just bought them </v>
<v Speaker 5>presence.</v>

1952
01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:21.320
<v Speaker 5>It's all about timing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>timing.</v>

1953
01:33:21.321 --> 01:33:26.321
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I sent you money to buy them things </v>

1954
01:33:26.321 --> 01:33:28.880
<v Speaker 5>or your personal shopper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I would have stepped in something</v>

1955
01:33:28.881 --> 01:33:30.230
<v Speaker 5>first and then got money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would've felt like,</v>

1956
01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.190
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got some cash.</v>

1957
01:33:34.290 --> 01:33:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Thanks for spending Christmas Eve with </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1959
01:33:38.431 --> 01:33:39.880
<v Speaker 3>You're welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Molly.</v>

1960
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:45.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say people's names when I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I read your question.</v>

1961
01:33:45.681 --> 01:33:47.990
<v Speaker 3>So you feel like I'm talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I am.</v>

1962
01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Were you pissed when he found out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was no Santa or did you find out there </v>

1963
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 3>was no Santa Claus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stumbled into my parents' rapping </v>

1964
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1965
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we opened it the next day.</v>

1966
01:33:58.011 --> 01:34:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I like what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I hid and I saw them.</v>

1967
01:34:01.131 --> 01:34:06.131
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I just put two and two </v>

1968
01:34:06.131 --> 01:34:06.131
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend has this video of her daughter</v>

1969
01:34:06.131 --> 01:34:07.850
<v Speaker 3>last year and her daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I saw Santa Claus last night.</v>

1970
01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:08.900
<v Speaker 3>He had a beard</v>

1971
01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:12.380
<v Speaker 5>and he had a big stomach and had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>belt and the mom's like,</v>

1972
01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1973
01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:18.760
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine fucking lie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know as you're watching them load </v>

1974
01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:18.890
<v Speaker 5>after I would have to correct the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1975
01:34:18.891 --> 01:34:19.680
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't lie.</v>

1976
01:34:19.710 --> 01:34:20.530
<v Speaker 5>Don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stopped.</v>

1977
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:23.840
<v Speaker 5>He would have said that you can't see </v>
<v Speaker 5>sandy's invisible.</v>

1978
01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.370
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't lie to me.</v>

1979
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:26.420
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>

1980
01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:28.760
<v Speaker 3>for three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a liar.</v>

1981
01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Fucking video though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very important to call kids</v>

1982
01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:35.510
<v Speaker 3>on being I was a or when I was a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid as well.</v>

1983
01:34:35.511 --> 01:34:40.511
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a very vivid imagination and not </v>

1984
01:34:40.511 --> 01:34:43.121
<v Speaker 3>such a good life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it always make up stories and I wish </v>

1985
01:34:43.121 --> 01:34:46.461
<v Speaker 3>someone had called me on my bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then so when it taken so long for me to </v>

1986
01:34:46.461 --> 01:34:47.310
<v Speaker 3>figure it out on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people knew I was right.</v>

1987
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I didn't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like 10.</v>

1988
01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio would have worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're a kid watching Nokia,</v>

1989
01:34:52.581 --> 01:34:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to know some big moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's made a wood wooden.</v>

1990
01:34:55.261 --> 01:34:56.550
<v Speaker 3>People can't fucking talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1991
01:34:56.551 --> 01:35:01.551
<v Speaker 3>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did they make about a way upstate </v>

1992
01:35:01.551 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I steal your jokes and I used them as my</v>

1993
01:35:03.291 --> 01:35:06.500
<v Speaker 3>facebook messages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope.</v>

1994
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.870
<v Speaker 3>I hope it gets you laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it get you laid?</v>

1995
01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 3>If it gets you laid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I approve or give you thumbs up,</v>

1996
01:35:12.321 --> 01:35:15.050
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show us your breasts.</v>

1997
01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:20.080
<v Speaker 3>How dare you de la Roche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you may have to keep up with </v>

1998
01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:20.380
<v Speaker 3>these twitters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She fucking.</v>

1999
01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.080
<v Speaker 3>It's twitter's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to those coming in now.</v>

2000
01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.850
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>UFC ever had a 1:35</v>

2001
01:35:26.851 --> 01:35:28.950
<v Speaker 6>division.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the UFC in the WEC.</v>

2002
01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:33.060
<v Speaker 6>The idea is eventually that is going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be one thing when I don't know,</v>

2003
01:35:33.330 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 6>but I think it should be because I think</v>
<v Speaker 6>guys like Jose Aldo and Uriah Faber and </v>

2004
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:41.130
<v Speaker 6>Mike Brown and Miguel Torres,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those guys are fucking awesome.</v>

2005
01:35:41.131 --> 01:35:43.410
<v Speaker 6>They deserve all the attention that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>UFC gets.</v>

2006
01:35:43.411 --> 01:35:45.210
<v Speaker 6>They deserve people to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2007
01:35:45.211 --> 01:35:49.370
<v Speaker 6>to be clamoring for super fights and to </v>
<v Speaker 6>see big paper view bouts in,</v>

2008
01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:54.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>matter in Madison Square Garden and </v>

2009
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.410
<v Speaker 6>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2010
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.410
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2011
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:55.300
<v Speaker 6>the mgm grand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2012
01:35:55.330 --> 01:36:00.330
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those guys deserve to be at those kind </v>

2013
01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:01.200
<v Speaker 6>of shows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The level of talent in the WEC right now</v>

2014
01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:03.630
<v Speaker 6>is staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One hundred and 3,545</v>

2015
01:36:03.631 --> 01:36:05.970
<v Speaker 6>pound division mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guys are fucking animals man.</v>

2016
01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.400
<v Speaker 6>And even 1:55,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have some awesome fighters.</v>

2017
01:36:08.610 --> 01:36:13.610
<v Speaker 6>I think it would be beneficial to </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody if it was all the UFC was all </v>

2018
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:14.210
<v Speaker 6>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2019
01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:19.220
<v Speaker 6>especially since they owned the WEC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it would help everybody if they </v>

2020
01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:19.290
<v Speaker 6>could make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it's possible.</v>

2021
01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:30.870
<v Speaker 6>Rigorous Sachs says use that little kid </v>
<v Speaker 6>liar in the act.</v>

2022
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's really funny for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2023
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:39.430
<v Speaker 3>I think that's funny white now because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about right now,</v>

2024
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:41.770
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if you could recreate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2025
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:46.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not funny enough to recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say It on stage.</v>

2026
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might be when you're talking about if my</v>

2027
01:36:49.431 --> 01:36:52.230
<v Speaker 3>daughter gets to the age where my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>kind of comedy lately?</v>

2029
01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:00.460
<v Speaker 5>Because I remember you used to be really</v>
<v Speaker 5>big into writing like Noah's Ark.</v>

2030
01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.110
<v Speaker 5>A mystery.</v>

2031

<v Speaker 3>My comedy comes in big waves of </v>

2036

<v Speaker 6>but I think people look for conspiracy.</v>

2044
01:37:33.711 --> 01:37:35.780
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of conspiracies that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>real,</v>

2045
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:38.360
<v Speaker 6>but there's a lot of shit that people </v>
<v Speaker 6>are just looking for.</v>

2046
01:37:38.361 --> 01:37:39.230
<v Speaker 6>Conspiracies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched them when they get to the </v>

2296
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>

2297
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:04.710

<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>

2299
01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:11.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't commit to watching that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen avatar yet.</v>

2300
01:49:11.241 --> 01:49:12.110

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:17.320
<v Speaker 3>probably the day after Christmas.</v>

2303
01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:17.810
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get fucking trimmed up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and go to this.</v>

2304
01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I guess one way that we could go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>D.</v>

2305
01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're already going to have </v>

2306
01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:25.760
<v Speaker 3>heart attacks and that's the way to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2307
01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:28.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not what turns per.</v>

2308
01:49:28.330 --> 01:49:30.040
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a little and I was,</v>

2309
01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:32.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just go with pot cookies.</v>

2310
01:49:33.170 --> 01:49:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

2311
01:49:33.970 --> 01:49:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I got some pot cookies and it just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>shrooms.</v>

2312
01:49:35.890 --> 01:49:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might as well be drums.</v>

2313
01:49:37.810 --> 01:49:41.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can talk about ancient alien theories.</v>

2314
01:49:41.751 --> 01:49:45.350
<v Speaker 3>He says in all capsj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>g one slash 29.</v>

2315
01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Please talk about ancient alien </v>
<v Speaker 3>theories.</v>

2316
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.400
<v Speaker 6>The big theory of the ancient alien </v>
<v Speaker 6>theories is that human beings were </v>

2317
01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:57.421
<v Speaker 6>manufactured and that they use genetic </v>
<v Speaker 6>manipulation to take monkeys and add </v>

2318
01:49:58.150 --> 01:50:01.840
<v Speaker 6>alien DNA to the monkeys to make people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you think about that,</v>

2319
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think Asians are aliens.</v>

2320
01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:05.720
<v Speaker 6>They could be right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And maybe that's why they saw.</v>

2321
01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Fuck is calling me while I'm on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

2325
01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.470
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how much longer should I be?</v>

2326
01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.470
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want me to end soon?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2331
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:36.770

<v Speaker 6>that's the reality.</v>

2332
01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:40.790
<v Speaker 6>See you see me fucking standup comedian </v>
<v Speaker 6>slash cage fighter.</v>

2333
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.160
<v Speaker 6>No Pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whipped husband and daddy.</v>

2334
01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:48.410
<v Speaker 6>Daddy has to stop smoking weed and doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>his little webcam show because everybody</v>

2335
01:50:48.411 --> 01:50:53.411
<v Speaker 6>wants to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they want to open up Christmas </v>

2336
01:50:53.411 --> 01:50:53.411
<v Speaker 6>presents.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Merry Christmas.</v>

2337
01:50:53.411 --> 01:50:57.251
<v Speaker 6>You'd already pitches.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was I talking about before that </v>

2338
01:50:57.251 --> 01:50:57.251
<v Speaker 6>happened?</v>

2339
01:50:57.251 --> 01:50:57.950
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about ancient aliens.</v>

2340
01:50:58.130 --> 01:50:58.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were saying what is,</v>

2341
01:50:58.850 --> 01:51:01.530
<v Speaker 6>what's your theories are?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Asians were like,</v>

2342
01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:06.640
<v Speaker 6>aliens landed and had Asians and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>like did not like the Asians nowadays </v>

2343
01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:08.030
<v Speaker 6>aren't aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there are a breed of aliens.</v>

2344
01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:11.090
<v Speaker 6>Like maybe they're more alien than we </v>
<v Speaker 6>are.</v>

2345
01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:13.670
<v Speaker 6>Maybe there was like different </v>
<v Speaker 6>formulations.</v>

2346
01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.850
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's what all the different </v>
<v Speaker 6>breeds of human beings are,</v>

2347
01:51:16.851 --> 01:51:17.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2348
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:21.620
<v Speaker 6>different,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Italians were just much.</v>

2349
01:51:21.621 --> 01:51:26.621
<v Speaker 6>And they're pure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're more pure to the actual human </v>

2350
01:51:26.621 --> 01:51:26.621
<v Speaker 6>race,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2351
01:51:26.621 --> 01:51:27.410
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well definitely Asians are more pure.</v>

2352
01:51:27.411 --> 01:51:32.411
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's billions of them and they look </v>

2353
01:51:32.411 --> 01:51:32.411
<v Speaker 6>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible.</v>

2354
01:51:32.411 --> 01:51:33.670
<v Speaker 6>They managed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2355
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:36.830
<v Speaker 6>I mean I guess they'd probably look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>Europeans and a similar way,</v>

2356
01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.090
<v Speaker 6>but the difference is with the blonde </v>
<v Speaker 6>hair,</v>

2357
01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:44.140
<v Speaker 6>red hair and brown hair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Europeans come in all different colors </v>

2358
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:46.550
<v Speaker 6>and sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but even like you go Korean to Japanese,</v>

2359
01:51:46.551 --> 01:51:49.010
<v Speaker 6>to Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all black hair.</v>

2360
01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:51.950
<v Speaker 6>It's all real similar skin tones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2361
01:51:51.951 --> 01:51:53.580
<v Speaker 6>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's some similarities.</v>

2362
01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:55.170
<v Speaker 5>I would love to be Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

2363
01:51:55.410 --> 01:51:56.220
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2364
01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:59.260
<v Speaker 6>Do you have an excuse for having such a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little Dick?</v>

2365
01:51:59.530 --> 01:52:02.060
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean seriously.</v>

2366
01:52:02.061 --> 01:52:04.400
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to shave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of them don't have to shave.</v>

2367
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:05.330
<v Speaker 5>I hate shaving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2368
01:52:06.170 --> 01:52:07.940
<v Speaker 5>I fucking hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2369
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:11.510
<v Speaker 5>you save everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You make it an adventure.</v>

2370
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 6>I'll keep my ball,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my lower ball hair or shave off because </v>

2371
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 6>there's some great ones in there I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to avoid.</v>

2372
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:18.090
<v Speaker 6>But my upper pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I leave those pitches alone.</v>

2373
01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:19.790
<v Speaker 6>I trim them a little bit</v>

2374
01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Speaker 5>when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I lived alone,</v>

2375
01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:26.240
<v Speaker 5>I would take it and put it on a trash </v>
<v Speaker 5>bag and roll around like a pig just so </v>

2376
01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:29.110
<v Speaker 5>to get it all over my back and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can really get the,</v>

2377
01:52:29.490 --> 01:52:34.490
<v Speaker 5>the scraper scraper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you'd have to get like a towel </v>

2378
01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:36.990
<v Speaker 5>on the towel and you just rub hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really work.</v>

2379
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:38.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2380
01:52:38.141 --> 01:52:38.210
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2381
01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:43.940
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>innovative hair loss methods by Brian </v>

2382
01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 6>and Michael had a nice thick mountain </v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2383
01:52:46.371 --> 01:52:48.400
<v Speaker 6>Beard for a while back when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2384
01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:49.790
<v Speaker 6>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2385
01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:51.080
<v Speaker 6>Evan Tanner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Attribute beard.</v>

2386
01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:53.240
<v Speaker 6>I have a good one going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I haven't shaved for something.</v>

2387
01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:58.241
<v Speaker 6>I had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rejoined the human rejoin society.</v>

2388
01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:02.090
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>back when I came back from Colorado too.</v>

2389
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:04.010
<v Speaker 6>I was really thinking about growing one </v>
<v Speaker 6>in Colorado,</v>

2390
01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:08.510
<v Speaker 6>but that might push me over the edge </v>
<v Speaker 6>when I was living in Colorado on the top</v>

2391
01:53:08.511 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 6>of a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I had a beard up there too,</v>

2392
01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:12.140
<v Speaker 6>I probably would have got way close to </v>
<v Speaker 6>an animal,</v>

2393
01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:13.570
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I let my cell phone.</v>

2394
01:53:13.571 --> 01:53:14.540
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Harry,</v>

2395
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:16.600
<v Speaker 6>was there any point of living there like</v>
<v Speaker 6>that?</v>

2396
01:53:16.601 --> 01:53:17.990
<v Speaker 6>You were just outside and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2397
01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:19.340
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is scary.</v>

2398
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:20.660
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what am I doing here?</v>

2399
01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:22.790
<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was definitely scary,</v>

2400
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.780
<v Speaker 6>but that was part of the appeal of it to</v>
<v Speaker 6>me is that it was so off the grid.</v>

2401
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:32.200
<v Speaker 6>It was show outside of the way a normal </v>
<v Speaker 6>person every day gets to experience </v>

2402
01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:34.250
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was living in the fucking woods,</v>

2403
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:39.430
<v Speaker 6>not just kind of in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was living on 150 acres on the top of </v>

2404
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:41.480
<v Speaker 6>a mountain in Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Colorado outside of boulder.</v>

2405
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:43.720
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like nine miles above boulder.</v>

2406
01:53:43.721 --> 01:53:45.230
<v Speaker 6>It was pretty trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>8,500</v>

2407
01:53:45.231 --> 01:53:48.260
<v Speaker 6>feet above sea level and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 6>wildlife.</v>

2408
01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.930
<v Speaker 6>Deer every day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dear.</v>

2409
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:52.640
<v Speaker 6>I was on a dirt road for eight miles </v>
<v Speaker 6>dear everyday.</v>

2410
01:53:52.670 --> 01:53:55.670
<v Speaker 6>I would see deer every day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would see foxes occasionally.</v>

2411
01:53:55.671 --> 01:53:57.650
<v Speaker 6>I'd see porcupines people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Peoplesoft bear.</v>

2412
01:53:57.651 --> 01:54:00.070
<v Speaker 6>I never saw bear something outline in my</v>
<v Speaker 6>backyard.</v>

2413
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.490
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you saw a lot of shit,</v>

2414
01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.020
<v Speaker 6>eagles all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2415
01:54:03.021 --> 01:54:06.470
<v Speaker 6>it was really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was so real,</v>

2416
01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:07.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was just,</v>

2417
01:54:07.361 --> 01:54:08.540
<v Speaker 6>it was so like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2418
01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:10.760
<v Speaker 6>you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're seeing wild animals.</v>

2419
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:12.230
<v Speaker 6>Like we'll wild animals.</v>

2420
01:54:12.230 --> 01:54:15.530
<v Speaker 6>Big fucking 10 point bucks walking down </v>
<v Speaker 6>the street,</v>

2421
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:17.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's very,</v>

2422
01:54:17.931 --> 01:54:22.931
<v Speaker 6>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just the fact that you can live </v>

2423
01:54:22.931 --> 01:54:22.931
<v Speaker 6>somewhere like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's such A.</v>

2424
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:27.970
<v Speaker 6>I think people get stuck in patterns and</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's real easy to get stuck in </v>

2425
01:54:27.970 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 6>the same way of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same way of looking at the world and</v>

2426
01:54:29.541 --> 01:54:34.541
<v Speaker 6>nothing changes that like moving to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>new place for awhile and moving to a </v>

2427
01:54:34.541 --> 01:54:36.500
<v Speaker 6>place that's as stunning as the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mountains of Colorado.</v>

2428
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:41.800
<v Speaker 6>I would love to go back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's just not practical to have a </v>

2429
01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:45.700
<v Speaker 6>wife and kids and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and have little vulnerable babies and </v>

2430
01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:49.121
<v Speaker 6>being around fucking wild monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean my dog had eaten by a mountain </v>

2431
01:54:49.121 --> 01:54:50.270
<v Speaker 6>lion when we were up there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's for real.</v>

2432
01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:53.900
<v Speaker 6>Like we saw a mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I let the little dog out by himself.</v>

2433
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:54.920
<v Speaker 6>Dog Disappears.</v>

2434
01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:57.350
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's all got eaten by a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>mountain lion,</v>

2435
01:54:57.770 --> 01:55:02.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is very likely and those animals </v>

2436
01:55:02.770 --> 01:55:03.260
<v Speaker 6>died of predation up there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very common.</v>

2437
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:05.600
<v Speaker 6>They even pray on animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get used to them.</v>

2438
01:55:05.601 --> 01:55:09.050
<v Speaker 6>They get used to recognizing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>associating the barks,</v>

2439
01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:14.170
<v Speaker 6>barks of these animals with like pray </v>
<v Speaker 6>and so they go towards where they hear </v>

2440
01:55:14.170 --> 01:55:17.891
<v Speaker 6>barks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's actually kind of dangerous when </v>

2441
01:55:17.891 --> 01:55:18.290
<v Speaker 6>you have a fucking house with dogs </v>
<v Speaker 6>barking because sometimes these mountain</v>

2442
01:55:18.291 --> 01:55:19.860
<v Speaker 6>lions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if they're hungry it,</v>

2443
01:55:19.861 --> 01:55:22.490
<v Speaker 6>especially if they're old and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 6>catch dear anymore,</v>

2444
01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:27.170
<v Speaker 6>they know these dogs are like in a cage </v>
<v Speaker 6>over their fence.</v>

2445
01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:29.240
<v Speaker 6>Like it ain't shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jack Dogs,</v>

2446
01:55:29.241 --> 01:55:31.310
<v Speaker 6>they do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're scary as fuck.</v>

2447
01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:34.310
<v Speaker 6>Do you think people that sleep with guns</v>
<v Speaker 6>underneath their pills,</v>

2448
01:55:34.311 --> 01:55:37.280
<v Speaker 6>if that's just fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody said it once to impress a girl.</v>

2449
01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:37.910
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know I've got.</v>

2450
01:55:37.911 --> 01:55:40.970
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It really is just seeing them as like,</v>

2451
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.140
<v Speaker 6>that's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2452
01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:44.540
<v Speaker 6>if you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you want it to have it right there.</v>

2453
01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 6>If you live in a place where you think </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to need it,</v>

2454
01:55:46.411 --> 01:55:47.730
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2455
01:55:47.850 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't seem like it's a good idea,</v>

2456
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:54.561
<v Speaker 6>but what if someone breaks in your house</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you need the gun and you just go </v>

2457
01:55:54.561 --> 01:55:56.100
<v Speaker 6>like that and you got the gun and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>that keeps you alive.</v>

2458
01:55:56.770 --> 01:55:58.290
<v Speaker 6>There's that way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2459
01:55:58.291 --> 01:56:00.240
<v Speaker 6>There's the way of looking at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

2460
01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:01.950
<v Speaker 6>if you think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2461
01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:05.100
<v Speaker 6>fucking nothing can happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2462
01:56:05.101 --> 01:56:07.770
<v Speaker 6>As long as you think positive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can sing that way.</v>

2463
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:12.420
<v Speaker 6>It be one of those dudes that goes </v>
<v Speaker 6>through life convinced that nothing ever</v>

2464
01:56:12.421 --> 01:56:14.490
<v Speaker 6>bad is gonna happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2465
01:56:14.530 --> 01:56:17.160
<v Speaker 6>I mean that that is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might sneak through,</v>

2466
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.180
<v Speaker 6>but shit might get ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit gets ugly.</v>

2467
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:24.720
<v Speaker 6>You want one of these bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this shit's important.</v>

<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2469
01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:28.590
<v Speaker 6>I believe in the second amendment.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Gun Control's important.</v>

2475
01:56:46.261 --> 01:56:51.261
<v Speaker 6>You gotta definitely screen people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to definitely make sure that </v>

2476
01:56:51.261 --> 01:56:51.390
<v Speaker 6>people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2480
01:56:55.651 --> 01:57:00.651
<v Speaker 6>and that's the problem with a lot of gun</v>
<v Speaker 6>shows is there's a lot of people that </v>

2481
01:57:00.651 --> 01:57:01.140
<v Speaker 6>sell guns at gun shows that don't give a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck if you're licensed or not.</v>

2482
01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:06.320
<v Speaker 6>They're just trying to make some money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's been expos there on that </v>

2483
01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:08.961

<v Speaker 6>shows will sell guns to people that </v>

<v Speaker 6>I bought like five.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's actually an old camera now.</v>

2533
01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Does that sound good now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it looks okay.</v>

2534
01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

2535
01:59:15.981 --> 01:59:17.270
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an hd.</v>

2536
01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:18.370
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be.</v>

2537
01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Bragg has nate steering it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that like more bandwidth for </v>

2538
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:25.721
<v Speaker 2>Beulah download.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a net when you have 20 </v>

2539
01:59:25.721 --> 01:59:25.721
<v Speaker 2>megabytes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2540
01:59:25.721 --> 01:59:27.290
<v Speaker 2>but crazy doesn't affect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It affects them downloading it.</v>

2541
01:59:27.291 --> 01:59:31.420
<v Speaker 2>It only affects up upload once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I get the Internet,</v>

2542
01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:32.510
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make it.</v>

2543
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll make it hd so you can see the ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly.</v>

2544
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:39.050
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else we got here?</v>

2545
01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:44.280
<v Speaker 6>One of the next time I'm going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>used streaming Johnny Bananas.</v>

2546
01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:46.400
<v Speaker 6>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2547
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:49.470
<v Speaker 6>I think we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I'm going to try to do is,</v>

2548
01:59:49.471 --> 01:59:50.310
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

2549
01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:55.340
<v Speaker 6>my ultimate goal in 2010 is I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 6>to write a book right now and I've been </v>

2550
01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:59.901
<v Speaker 6>spending a lot of time writing that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>writing standup comedy and not so much </v>

2551
01:59:59.901 --> 02:00:03.021
<v Speaker 6>time updating my website,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I do go on twitter because twitter </v>

2552
02:00:03.021 --> 02:00:04.410
<v Speaker 6>is fun for me and it's like a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>exercise in writing to make things short</v>

2553
02:00:04.411 --> 02:00:07.080
<v Speaker 6>and make them 140 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's fun.</v>

2554
02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:10.420
<v Speaker 6>So it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it teaches you to like,</v>

2555
02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>edit your shit with comedy.</v>

2556
02:00:13.291 --> 02:00:15.390
<v Speaker 6>That's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Economy of words.</v>

2557
02:00:15.391 --> 02:00:17.250
<v Speaker 6>It's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in stand up comedy,</v>

2558
02:00:17.251 --> 02:00:19.890
<v Speaker 6>it's very important that the less words </v>
<v Speaker 6>you could use to make a point,</v>

2559
02:00:20.010 --> 02:00:21.810
<v Speaker 6>the funnier it's going to be when it </v>
<v Speaker 6>hits people,</v>

2560
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:24.780
<v Speaker 6>the more you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more verbose it is,</v>

2561
02:00:24.810 --> 02:00:27.300
<v Speaker 6>the more it's not funny when it gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2562
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:28.560
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2563
02:00:28.561 --> 02:00:31.950
<v Speaker 6>I think twitter's real good for that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But my point is in 2010,</v>

2564
02:00:31.951 --> 02:00:34.800
<v Speaker 6>what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My main goal is more on the Internet.</v>

2565
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:37.410
<v Speaker 6>More shit like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more ustream shit.</v>

2566
02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:42.620
<v Speaker 6>More twitter and definitely more blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm going to start doing more video </v>

2567
02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:46.770
<v Speaker 6>shit and I'm carrying A.</v>

<v Speaker 6>everywhere.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm going to start putting shit online </v>
<v Speaker 6>on youtube on a really regular basis.</v>

2571
02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:58.050
<v Speaker 6>And I know there's a little ustream,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a streaming thing for the iphone.</v>
