WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>So I might plug some dates or like do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.933
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judd,</v>

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>how are you buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Judd apatow here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 1>You know susman real well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do I know your manager,</v>

7
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>sussman judge Sussman when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved comedy.</v>

8
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>So I got a job at the east side comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>club that would just in Huntington on</v>

9
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:30.431
<v Speaker 1>long island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about 83 84 he was the bartender</v>

10
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and he used to give me rides home</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I lived really far away and I</v>

11
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:41.291
<v Speaker 1>used to take a cab home and spend all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money I made as a dishwasher on the</v>

12
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>cab ride home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>But I just wanted to be in the club near</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics.</v>

14
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Murphy was coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

15
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I swear to God,</v>

16
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>this is no bs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have those people in your life that</v>

17
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>you remember who were insanely kind and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

18
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>And Jeff Sussman was like that.</v>

19
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a young kid,</v>

20
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I was maybe 15 or 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

21
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>this is the greatest guy I've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so nice to me.</v>

22
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It gives me a ride home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's funny and I'm so glad,</v>

23
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's rich now.</v>

24
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>He's been my manager since I was an open</v>
<v Speaker 1>miker.</v>

25
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he discovered him.</v>

26
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>He is an open miker or in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are his first clients?</v>

27
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Nelson.</v>

28
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Nelson at the east side comedy club.</v>

29
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Nothing funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to do a show once a week and one</v>

30
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>of the things he did is he would just</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn on the radio and scan through the</v>

31
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 1>channels and do improv based on what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the radio.</v>

32
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>So if it was elevated music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would do a dentist routine.</v>

33
00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>If it was heavy metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would suddenly do like a heavy metal</v>

34
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was incredible.</v>

35
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy was huge at one point in time.</v>

36
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>And then I think he blew a fuse or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

37
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a very religious person now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's still performs in Branson.</v>

38
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice way of saying he blew a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuse.</v>

39
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Depends on your view of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe he's happier than all of</v>

40
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be highly unlikely,</v>

41
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>but maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>

42
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>was he funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean truly.</v>

43
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>It's funny as people get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he built a thing on stage.</v>

44
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He built like a wall on the stage and in</v>

45
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>the wall he built two doors and he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>do all these bits.</v>

46
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>We would come in and out of doors as</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people and then he did a thing</v>

47
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>where he would like come out of the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one out of one door across the</v>

48
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>stage and in the other door and then run</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that door again as a different</v>

49
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

50
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Speaker 1>So it looked like he was chasing himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it'd be like a gorilla chasing Bob,</v>

51
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>but he would just change his body</v>
<v Speaker 1>language as he ran in and out of these</v>

52
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really creative.</v>

53
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>No one has ever really done stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that since even,</v>

54
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened somewhere along the</v>

55
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:52.850
<v Speaker 1>line where carrot top owns props.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

56
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 1>no one does props anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember when we first starting out</v>

57
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.740
<v Speaker 1>there was prop comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was your genre.</v>

58
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>There was Dennis Miller to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps when he started,</v>

59
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I heard that he used to put his lips</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a 45 record and I forgot what</v>

60
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>the bid was and die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I threw a couple of props.</v>

61
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>First few times I went on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember bringing a light and putting</v>

62
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>it to my finger to make my finger look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ets finger.</v>

63
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't quite remember what the bid was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how little material I had.</v>

64
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny though that that genre is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of dissolved and it is funny</v>

65
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>as hell I would to see carrot top in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>

66
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a ridiculous show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I laughed my ass off.</v>

67
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I brought my whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really laughed hard.</v>

68
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a funny genre of just</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>

69
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>stupid prop jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrot top case,</v>

70
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>way more shit than he deserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very funny.</v>

71
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very silly.</v>

72
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've always,</v>

73
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>for the silly guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I love,</v>

74
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>you know all the smart people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inventive people,</v>

75
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.320
<v Speaker 1>but this silly guy is also pretty great</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to write super silly jokes</v>

76
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and make people laugh out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's Comedians who are funny and</v>

77
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:03.311
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

78
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are people who actually</v>

79
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>make you piss your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing that job did,</v>

80
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.330
<v Speaker 1>it made me laugh was he was reds around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowded subway.</v>

81
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>He's like giving the crowd shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's handy out cups.</v>

82
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd really fast pouring shots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spilling on people if he's ready</v>

83
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.020
<v Speaker 1>around giving people shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he like turned to somebody,</v>

84
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.511
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

85
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>give it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pregnant.</v>

86
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>But she clearly wasn't pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a Chubby lady and it got</v>

87
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>really awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

88
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>that's always the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you make that mistake,</v>

89
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>are you allowed to just give people</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots?</v>

90
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Like what if you have an alcoholic but</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just there.</v>

91
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>They're sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are like so influential.</v>

92
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>They go off fucking one drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to hurt and then boom,</v>

93
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>you just throw their life off track and</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrot top wanted it to happen.</v>

94
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be careful with that now.</v>

95
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly am not pouring booze for the</v>

96
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I appreciated it as someone</v>

97
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>observing carrot top.</v>

98
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would think as a performer you'd</v>

99
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>have to be really concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many people that you give them one</v>

100
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>shot and they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they vander Doug stamper from house of</v>

101
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe carrot top is getting pre show</v>

102
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>releases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can be a whole system</v>

103
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>of how he knows who to give the shots</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

104
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>He survives in Vegas too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does.</v>

105
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>There's not a whole lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that anymore.</v>

106
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like Penn and teller and they'd</v>

107
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>been there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

108
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>But their show is a magic show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

109
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>And then there used to be like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>residents they were doing stand up,</v>

110
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>George Wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rita Rudner,</v>

111
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>George George Wallace quit doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it for a long time and he had</v>

113
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 1>enough at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

114
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>He explained to me how hard it is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

115
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to fill that room like every</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

116
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Villain rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me say,</v>

117
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I said I'm going to who makes movies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>is terrified that people will show up.</v>

118
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Filling rooms scares me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we have a movie,</v>

119
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the big sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it opens in New York and La this weekend</v>

120
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>and then in two weeks it opens around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

121
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a kumail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nanjiani,</v>

122
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Holly Hunter and Ray Romano based on an</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that happened to Kumail</v>

123
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Nanjiani when he met his wife and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

124
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 2>he's from Pakistan and his parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted him to have an arranged marriage,</v>

125
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 2>but he fell in love with an American</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman and then she quickly got sick and</v>

126
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 2>had to be put into a coma and it's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hilarious,</v>

127
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true story about him hanging out with</v>

128
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>her parents while she's in a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a very unique story,</v>

129
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 2>but it works great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 98% on rotten tomatoes.</v>

130
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of those gem movies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes around every like four or five</v>

131
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it called?</v>

132
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It's called the big sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like right now I'm terrified,</v>

133
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will people go,</v>

134
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 2>will you get off your ass for a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious movie to go to a theater?</v>

135
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing with a stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm doing some concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do you like track like how they're</v>

137
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 2>selling.</v>

138
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

139
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about this city.</v>

140
00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always sell late and then you look</v>

141
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 2>at your numbers for months and no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>bought tickets.</v>

142
00:06:55.881 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 2>And then like in the last two weeks they</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell out or do you just not tuned in at</v>

143
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to tune into as little as I</v>

144
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 2>possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 2>Other than like doing the jokes</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

146
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 2>doing the shows themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hobbies,</v>

148
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't tune in anymore.</v>

149
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like there's no reason to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fuck you money if you don't say</v>

150
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm supposed to be saying fuck you</v>

151
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

152
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 2>But not really saying fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

153
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 2>there's things to think about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things to not think about.</v>

154
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Like there's like the things that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have really any control over,</v>

155
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 2>like whether or not people buy tickets</v>
<v Speaker 2>if fucking hilarious.</v>

156
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you worried about man?</v>

157
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 2>You're super successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've done some of the greatest movies</v>

158
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 2>of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the things that always drive me is</v>

159
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 2>the terror of things not working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

160
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what keeps me on my game is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to be scared.</v>

161
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.890
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm going to tell your crowd</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

162
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 2>That's good because that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons why you're still good,</v>

163
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 2>but just let me help you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

164
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

165
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 2>you have to care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greatest comedy movies ever.</v>

166
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Just chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

167
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't chill out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

168
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I can't chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm going to tell people I'd</v>

169
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 2>be at the Columbus Theater and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Providence Road at July 25th,</v>

170
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early with the plot and then a play</v>

171
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 2>playhouse on July 23rd in Ridgefield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut.</v>

172
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Then I met the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Wilbur in Boston.</v>

173
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best place,</v>

174
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Place.</v>

175
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a website where people could</v>
<v Speaker 2>read all these cause they're not going</v>

176
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 2>to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably in their car right now.</v>

177
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 2>They're like fucking the Wilburn boss</v>
<v Speaker 2>and July 24 of the wilbur.com.</v>

178
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See this is how I,</v>

179
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 2>your website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No website.</v>

180
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I've got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a website?</v>

181
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't I suppose to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought websites.</v>

182
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.020
<v Speaker 2>My kids make fun of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I even talk about the web.</v>

183
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Like if I say like kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

184
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 2>let's find out on the of the worldwide</v>
<v Speaker 2>web.</v>

185
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:39.200
<v Speaker 2>They like dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one calls it the worldwide web</v>

186
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My daughter yelled at me the other day.</v>

187
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:41.631
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

188
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 2>no one emails don't email me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>text me.</v>

189
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 2>And she acted like I was like talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about ham radio.</v>

190
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might want to tell your kid to shut</v>

191
00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 2>the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

192
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Like emails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

193
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I email every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

194
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I guess the kids don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids don't have attachments.</v>

195
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I think that they don't need it cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no attachments.</v>

196
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Like it never has a pdf to send.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

197
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 2>And they don't spell your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care.</v>

198
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Every kid spells you are every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing there.</v>

199
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how old are your kids?</v>

200
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I have a 20 I have a nine and a seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>

201
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 2>All,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

202
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm old girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 19 and 14 old girls.</v>

203
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and they'll gang up on me and the</v>

204
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 2>teen years are rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were rough.</v>

205
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 2>They turn on you a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The genetically,</v>

206
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 2>I think they're supposed to like push</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their freedom and turn on you for a</v>

207
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think they're so confused.</v>

208
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 2>There's so many hormones raging to their</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that didn't exist just to like</v>

209
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 2>there were a new person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

210
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 2>if you stop to think about how you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're 11 and then how you are when</v>

211
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you're 15 it's only four years later and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a totally different human.</v>

212
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell them that.</v>

213
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I say you're acting hormonal right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you please stop?</v>

214
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 2>They can't help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we talk about the chemicals.</v>

215
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I have this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called a yes,</v>

216
00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 2>your teen is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then whenever they give me a hard</v>

217
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:02.190
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just take it out and just reading it</v>

218
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:03.024
<v Speaker 2>in front of them.</v>

219
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.120
<v Speaker 2>But it is all about how their brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't even cooked yet.</v>

220
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain doesn't really cook til your</v>

221
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 2>early twenties and you're impulse</v>
<v Speaker 2>control and everything is gone.</v>

222
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 2>And that what you're supposed to do as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>parent is model,</v>

223
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 2>same behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they,</v>

224
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 2>if they see you not lose your shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of times maybe that we'll</v>

225
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 2>program them to handle problems as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are going to freak out a ton</v>

226
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 2>and you shouldn't get that mad out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them at them because they're not capable</v>

227
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:34.320
<v Speaker 2>of not freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is a hard advice.</v>

228
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 2>It's hard advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you get down to the youngest</v>

229
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:37.640
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my,</v>

230
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 2>my youngest is seven and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you have your shit together yet?</v>

231
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else is older than you.</v>

232
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Let's go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>

233
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 2>So they don't get a full shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the younger kid always thinks</v>

234
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 2>they're allowed to do with the older</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

235
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it gets scarier as,</v>

236
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.630
<v Speaker 2>as you have more kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

237
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 2>because they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well my older sister does that so aren't</v>

238
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 2>and I allowed to do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

239
00:10:58.441 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seven.</v>

240
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

241
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really weird time.</v>

242
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I think especially in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is basically legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a d it's a difficult debate to have</v>

244
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 2>with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it is legal.</v>

245
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 2>You can't even pull out the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's illegal card.</v>

246
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about marijuana.</v>

247
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.890
<v Speaker 2>And what age though would you not worry</v>
<v Speaker 2>about marijuana?</v>

248
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about it at any age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your seven year olds like,</v>

249
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone handed me an edible.</v>

250
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely don't want my seven year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my nine year old to be smoking pot.</v>

251
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not worried about pot morgan</v>
<v Speaker 2>about alcohol.</v>

252
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about alcohol and I'm</v>

253
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 2>worried about driving.</v>

254
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about like teens drinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and driving.</v>

255
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.920
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That freaks me out.</v>

256
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Like her being with her friends as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to high school and that,</v>

257
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:47.310
<v Speaker 2>that freaks me out because kids just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what their tolerances are.</v>

258
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand the effects of</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol on the body and your ability to</v>

259
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 2>react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's curious.</v>

260
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>It's all about uber or lyft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is one thing I noticed that</v>

261
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 2>all the kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be a lot less drunk</v>

262
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 2>driving cause they all just uber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's amazing if you can afford it,</v>

263
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 2>but if you can't afford it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you're still screwed.</v>

264
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are screwed if you can't afford it.</v>

265
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's pretty reasonable if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just moving around the general area.</v>

266
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're hopping around West</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood and going from the store to</v>

267
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 2>the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do it all the time.</v>

268
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a couple of bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that big a deal and it's like</v>

269
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 2>it's saves you all the worry and hassle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being a drunk.</v>

270
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Are you a neurotic dad or a calm dad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to be as calm as I can.</v>

271
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of neurotic that's seeks</v>

272
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 2>in seeps in every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I try to be really calm.</v>

273
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

274
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.330
<v Speaker 2>the thing is just everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody grows up and just haven't have</v>

276
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Fun as much as possible.</v>

277
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we violently disagree on a lot of that</v>

317
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have like one or two violently.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

319
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:06.850
<v Speaker 2>there's one or two like the main things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mean the most to me in the world</v>

320
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:08.950
<v Speaker 2>where my wife's like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it's good,</v>

324
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 2>especially with your spouse to have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few interests in common.</v>

325
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I think all those people that do</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything together,</v>

326
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 2>a fucking Weirdos man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always freak me out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that is interesting.</v>

328
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:29.284
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's a,</v>

329
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife,</v>

330
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I met her when I wasn't doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did stand up from the time I was 17</v>

331
00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 2>until I was 24.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met my wife when I was 28 or 29 so she</v>

332
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:43.360
<v Speaker 2>didn't know anything about staying up</v>
<v Speaker 2>until three years ago when I started</v>

333
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 2>doing it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

334
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what caused you to do that?</v>

335
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.210
<v Speaker 2>I remember when you started coming</v>

<v Speaker 2>doing standup on the road.</v>

345
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

346
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>this is the universe saying you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do stand up and you should stop.</v>

347
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your friends are funnier than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm living with Sandler and I'm</v>

348
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:26.730
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with opening up for Jim</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carrey and it's,</v>

349
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.510
<v Speaker 2>it's daunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

350
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like trying to start a band and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend is John Lennon.</v>

351
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.350
<v Speaker 2>He just feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be weird to not feel like a</v>

352
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:39.320
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was cocky with Jim Carrey and oh yeah,</v>

353
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 2>the funnier than this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

354
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sane human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

355
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 2>I know what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

356
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 2>and I was also a little bored of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was so obsessed since I,</v>

357
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 2>since I was 10 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did funny people,</v>

358
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I did a little standup to write jokes</v>
<v Speaker 2>for funny people.</v>

359
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Speaker 2>So I was writing jokes but it was for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam's character.</v>

360
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 2>And then I started hanging out with Amy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schumer working on train wreck and she</v>

361
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 2>would come back from these tours and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just got jealous.</v>

362
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like the most fun thing.</v>

363
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 2>And then one night I said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go up tonight just to make</v>

364
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 2>you laugh just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could see what it was like when I</v>

365
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 2>did stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I told a couple of stories.</v>

366
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I had told her on talk shows and I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>would go okay.</v>

367
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And Amy was very excited hoping I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to bomb.</v>

368
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Like she was thought this would be this</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny thing.</v>

369
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Judd bombs at the comedy cellar and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did pretty good just cause it's stories.</v>

370
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 2>I know work okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the common,</v>

371
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:33.021
<v Speaker 2>he's probably said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

372
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:35.600
<v Speaker 2>anytime you want to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pop in,</v>

373
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.010
<v Speaker 2>we'll put you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

374
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 2>No one ever said that when I was a comic</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was hard to get stage time.</v>

375
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

376
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:47.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting treated like somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gets the show up and go on stage.</v>

377
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 2>I have to take advantage of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went on every night,</v>

378
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:53.380
<v Speaker 2>the entire shoot of train wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what time we finished</v>

379
00:16:53.381 --> 00:16:55.040
<v Speaker 2>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would drive straight to the comedy</v>

380
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 2>cellar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

381
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 2>And I had the best time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I came back to la and started</v>

382
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 2>doing the Improv and the comedy store in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Largo and,</v>

383
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 2>and then I would put these benefits</v>
<v Speaker 2>together at Largo once a month.</v>

384
00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:07.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to me that was the most fun because</v>

385
00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:12.851
<v Speaker 2>I could book a show and get like</v>
<v Speaker 2>channeling to come and Randy Newman or</v>

386
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aziz and Fiona apple and we did them all</v>

387
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:20.000
<v Speaker 2>his benefits and I always liked</v>
<v Speaker 2>producing things like that.</v>

388
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.900
<v Speaker 2>And then slowly my act got to the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I thought,</v>

389
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.763
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

390
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I deserve to be here.</v>

391
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>This isn't some freak show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

392
00:17:28.461 --> 00:17:31.790
<v Speaker 2>you know the difference between someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who writes for television and movies</v>

393
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:33.920
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the different stream that,</v>

394
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:38.921
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of stand ups is when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a living writing and producing</v>

395
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:42.470
<v Speaker 2>and directing and doing all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're disciplined you right?</v>

396
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually right.</v>

397
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 2>You have notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have books you have like you're</v>

398
00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:48.140
<v Speaker 2>opening up your binder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going over your stuff.</v>

399
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>So comics don't do that.</v>

400
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was opening for Larry Miller,</v>

401
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 1>one of the legendary comedians and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have these incredible,</v>

402
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 1>but some of them were like 10 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

403
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.040
<v Speaker 1>He had a great bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

404
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.260
<v Speaker 1>about drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best standard bits of</v>

405
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:09.600
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had a bit about Thanksgiving and</v>

406
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 1>a skiing and they were all like 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and they would get funnier and</v>

407
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 1>funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one day he said to me,</v>

408
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a job.</v>

409
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.770
<v Speaker 1>You got to sit down every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write jokes.</v>

410
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't just go to the mall and watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie every day.</v>

411
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Like if you sat down for two hours at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>desk and treated this like it was a job</v>

412
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>that deserves your respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a hundred times better than</v>

413
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did listen to his advice at the</v>

414
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do now,</v>

415
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.140
<v Speaker 1>like now I sit down to write it up.</v>

416
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I do show up with like notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like one of the rare guys at the</v>

418
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 1>comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll show up but notes.</v>

419
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nobody has notes.</v>

420
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.870
<v Speaker 1>If it has like a little like a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>card with three bullet points on it and</v>

421
00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little more of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 1>the shandling tons and tons of paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you're drowning and confused</v>

423
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.220
<v Speaker 1>shandling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a sad one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

425
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Fun Dude that was oh the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm doing a documentary about him</v>

426
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 1>now for Hbo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the most fun part about it is he</v>

427
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 1>always went to the comedy magic club and</v>
<v Speaker 1>did stand up even in eras where you</v>

428
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:14.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't know he was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I met him at the comedy</v>

429
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Magic Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how was it?</v>

430
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.120
<v Speaker 1>I was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

431
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a huge fan of Larry Sanders show</v>

432
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:24.410
<v Speaker 1>and Larry Sanders show a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where Paul Simms got start,</v>

433
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 1>a producer of news radio.</v>

434
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And so when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

435
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>when I saw him I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those ones like,</v>

436
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

437
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.320
<v Speaker 1>that's actually garry shandling right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

438
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 1>right there with judd apatow's right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

439
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

440
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and you know the comedy magical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tape every show since the 80s they</v>

441
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.230
<v Speaker 1>have every show taped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

442
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 1>can you give me the last 50 sets that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary did?</v>

443
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.850
<v Speaker 1>The comedy Magic Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

444
00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the last few years.</v>

445
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And no one's ever seen any of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes except that people at those shows,</v>

446
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:58.140
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do him on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do them on talk shows.</v>

447
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 1>There was no special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the funniest jokes you've ever</v>

448
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just him,</v>

449
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on the craft.</v>

450
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 1>How about going around being so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

451
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.340
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did a lot of notes.</v>

452
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.870
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his discipline guy.</v>

453
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 1>He was in the 70s he wrote so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

454
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I found these binders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds of jokes in every</v>

455
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:24.750
<v Speaker 1>loose leaf binder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy sitting at a desk all day</v>

456
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.910
<v Speaker 1>just crafting like two sentence perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

457
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's like the balance,</v>

458
00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:32.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

459
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.580
<v Speaker 1>There's crafting the perfect jokes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's just being able to be loose</v>

460
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 1>and fun and hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

461
00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:43.050
<v Speaker 1>he also used to go on stage with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice setup and he wouldn't know the</v>

462
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:45.720
<v Speaker 1>punchline and he would say the setup and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope the punchline came,</v>

463
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.460
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

464
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great things about doing a</v>

466
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 1>documentary as you get to ask people for</v>
<v Speaker 1>footage,</v>

467
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:57.110
<v Speaker 1>so Seinfeld gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.750
<v Speaker 1>the dailies for Comedians in cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting coffee when he interviewed Gary.</v>

469
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the people who made the movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian about Seinfeld gave me all the</v>

470
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 1>dailies of a sequence that they only use</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 seconds of in the documentary,</v>

471
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 1>which was Gary and Jerry going to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy magic club and doing sets.</v>

472
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And also there that night as Neil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock and there's 12 tapes.</v>

473
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.090
<v Speaker 1>It's all their performances and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>their entire conversation for three</v>

474
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:30.091
<v Speaker 1>hours hanging out backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is unbelievable the conversation,</v>

475
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.710
<v Speaker 1>how funny it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

476
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a moment where Chris rock is</v>

477
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 1>doing the joke about how Nelson Mandela</v>
<v Speaker 1>got divorced,</v>

478
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 1>that even Nelson Mandela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after decades of being in prison,</v>

479
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 1>he could survive that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't survive getting out and</v>

480
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 1>being married and gets divorced</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

481
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how he worded it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a shot of shandling alone in</v>

482
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:58.231
<v Speaker 1>a green room watching rock do this bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as he's doing it,</v>

483
00:21:58.331 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Gary's I saying what he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's like,</v>

484
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.550
<v Speaker 1>he's guessing what the bit is as rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it,</v>

485
00:22:06.551 --> 00:22:11.551
<v Speaker 1>but in awe of Chris Rock and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really beautiful moment and</v>

486
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 1>that's what the best part of doing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this documentary is it just finding</v>

487
00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 1>little magical moments that no one would</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever see if you didn't dig deep.</v>

488
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.420
<v Speaker 1>What made you decide to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we did a memorial for Gary when he</v>

489
00:22:24.431 --> 00:22:29.431
<v Speaker 1>died at the Wilshire Evil Theater and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand people showed up and I</v>

490
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:34.471
<v Speaker 1>made about five mini documentaries about</v>
<v Speaker 1>gary to show in between the speakers and</v>

491
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:37.863
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

492
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.660
<v Speaker 1>this is a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should just expand this.</v>

493
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's like the Oj doc of Gary.</v>

494
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long epic documentary.</v>

495
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 1>I think people don't realize how good</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Larry Sanders show us.</v>

496
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people forgot,</v>

497
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he'd go back and watch it again,</v>

498
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.290
<v Speaker 1>that was a revolutionary show and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the air.</v>

499
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It really was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

500
00:22:57.191 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 1>people don't go backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my kids don't go backwards digging</v>

501
00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:03.070
<v Speaker 1>that far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to them,</v>

502
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking backwards means I'll watch all</v>

503
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:09.030
<v Speaker 1>of parks and rec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

504
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.900
<v Speaker 1>They're not taking into the 90s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

505
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>they go to 2015 and people forget that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Larry Sanders show came on the</v>

506
00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:17.164
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:21.550
<v Speaker 1>the shows on Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a first and 10 are not</v>

508
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:23.980
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the news or dream on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

509
00:23:23.981 --> 00:23:28.981
<v Speaker 1>Gary was the first show on hbo that made</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hbo go,</v>

510
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what hbo should be.</v>

511
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.850
<v Speaker 1>We should be the quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

512
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.020
<v Speaker 1>network with all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this kind of groundbreaking</v>

513
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

514
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

515
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Gary was a guy who got offered all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk shows.</v>

516
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:46.180
<v Speaker 1>He got offered to replace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

517
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.740
<v Speaker 1>he was hosting the tonight show for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny.</v>

518
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and Leno would,</v>

519
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

520
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 1>take turns doing it and he decided he'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather satirize it then do it,</v>

521
00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted to explore the people and</v>

522
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:04.760
<v Speaker 1>not be a talk show hosts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to show like the world of ego</v>

523
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 1>that is not just talk to us but just</v>
<v Speaker 1>show business.</v>

524
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:11.060
<v Speaker 1>He was fascinated with people's need for</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

525
00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 1>his own need for attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own vanity and narcissism.</v>

526
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:19.241
<v Speaker 1>And he wanted to explore that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and satirize how we just want to be</v>

527
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:24.230
<v Speaker 1>liked so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what we do to be liked,</v>

528
00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:28.550
<v Speaker 1>which prevents us from actually feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>love cause we're so obsessed with</v>

529
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 1>approval.</v>

530
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you talk to Jay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

531
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:31.670
<v Speaker 1>are you friends with Jay Leno?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

532
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Jane and I were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

533
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:36.650
<v Speaker 1>what it was like to host the tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and how much more funny has now</v>

534
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.140
<v Speaker 1>doing comedians and cars are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians and cars.</v>

535
00:24:39.141 --> 00:24:40.440
<v Speaker 1>A Jay Leno's garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

536
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And because that's what he really loves</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and he really loves cars and he gets</v>

537
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:47.110
<v Speaker 1>to be himself while he's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have to have people on it.</v>

538
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he just has people want to talk to</v>

539
00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:53.750
<v Speaker 1>them about cars and stuff and has comics</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and all kinds of people on.</v>

540
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was talking about like having</v>

541
00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 1>that choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would have people on that,</v>

542
00:24:58.641 --> 00:25:01.310
<v Speaker 1>you didn't give a shit about it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to talk to them.</v>

543
00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:05.840
<v Speaker 1>And for Jay that was most everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he loves certain things,</v>

544
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.370
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't love sports.</v>

545
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.140
<v Speaker 1>He's not a massive movie Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got him going on the things he</v>

546
00:25:12.141 --> 00:25:15.290
<v Speaker 1>cares about like cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fascinated.</v>

547
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 1>But that I think was some of the fun of</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the tonight show,</v>

548
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.790
<v Speaker 1>really interviewing a young actress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't care at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how is he going to make it abusing</v>

550
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:30.260
<v Speaker 1>for himself at the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the hex bit that Hicks did</v>

551
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 1>about Jay interviewing joy lawrence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he blows his brains out and it forms the</v>

552
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:36.770
<v Speaker 1>NBC peacock or the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

553
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I always felt that could loads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that was very unfair.</v>

554
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:45.290
<v Speaker 1>The Hicks and the Andy kindler</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms of Leno.</v>

555
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Leno was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the great standups of all time?</v>

557
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a club you'd see letter in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties nobody touches it.</v>

558
00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 1>He was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing fun guy and still,</v>

559
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I saw him recently at the abrupt still</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and you know,</v>

560
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:04.520
<v Speaker 1>he made a call to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:09.521
<v Speaker 1>to be America's host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat everyone for forever.</v>

562
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Forever was proven completely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was this idea that it was a</v>

563
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:20.411
<v Speaker 1>betrayal of his club persona that some</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians were so mad about.</v>

564
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.650
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how you could be mad at</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody for deciding how to run their</v>

565
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:30.650
<v Speaker 1>show because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've seen with other people,</v>

566
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 1>sometimes snarky guy runs out of gas in</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years and you know,</v>

567
00:26:35.871 --> 00:26:39.710
<v Speaker 1>jay found the space that was comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>for him and God was he nice to me every</v>

568
00:26:39.711 --> 00:26:42.830
<v Speaker 1>time I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy and always super funny</v>

569
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 1>when I was on the show and Super Nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>would put me on when I wasn't doing</v>

570
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 1>stand up just as a director just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he liked me as a person.</v>

571
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

572
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.220
<v Speaker 1>and a really a good class guy and in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shanley documentary,</v>

573
00:26:56.221 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 1>fascinating describing his observations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Gary,</v>

574
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:03.010
<v Speaker 1>his observations about talk shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

575
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a ride he went on.</v>

576
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Did that world of being a talk show</v>
<v Speaker 3>host.</v>

577
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of wiggle room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially back then,</v>

578
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to now.</v>

579
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Now with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of like subject matter and</v>

580
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:17.010
<v Speaker 3>a lot of language has opened up more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of get it.</v>

581
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Like if you see like what's going on now</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

582
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:24.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Seth Meyers or you know,</v>

583
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 3>any of the other late night talk show</v>
<v Speaker 3>hosts,</v>

584
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:30.180
<v Speaker 3>they have much more relic look at core</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear gold bear rather coburn said that,</v>

585
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>

586
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:34.770
<v Speaker 3>the president uses Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he uses his mat,</v>

587
00:27:34.771 --> 00:27:36.990
<v Speaker 3>like coop Putin uses his mouth as a cock</v>
<v Speaker 3>holster.</v>

588
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 3>Like he said that on television with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>phrase cockles guess they beeped it out.</v>

589
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Do you not aware of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

590
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:44.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in the chrome,</v>

591
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.910
<v Speaker 3>the long rant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was really hilarious because</v>

592
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

593
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back and it said a bunch of,</v>

594
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:54.300
<v Speaker 3>think about cold bear and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>tasteless and talentless and being a</v>

595
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:55.470
<v Speaker 3>loser and all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

596
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.540
<v Speaker 3>And cold bear came back again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

597
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.280
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

598
00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I thought if there was one thing you</v>
<v Speaker 3>understood its shell business.</v>

599
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.460
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you responded.</v>

600
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.570
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you responded.</v>

601
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 3>I win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand.</v>

602
00:28:08.641 --> 00:28:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

603
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.860
<v Speaker 3>it was really fucking cool.</v>

604
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump can't help but respond.</v>

605
00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has no ability to go.</v>

606
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 1>It demeans me to acknowledge you exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't understand that.</v>

607
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And so I think these easily baited into</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of those situations,</v>

608
00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:26.250
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a little is what scares people</v>

609
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:28.860
<v Speaker 1>because you think if Cole bear can paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

610
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:31.470
<v Speaker 1>What about other countries and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious situations?</v>

611
00:28:31.471 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what bates him into action that he</v>

612
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't</v>

613
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.711
<v Speaker 3>take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

614
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:36.380
<v Speaker 3>he blocks people on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

615
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 3>He's the fucking president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are trying to,</v>

616
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.520
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to figure out like is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like a first amendment issue?</v>

617
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Like was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I allowed to communicate with the</v>

618
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 3>president directly through twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now I can't cause he blocks me.</v>

619
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:50.310
<v Speaker 3>Is He allowed to block people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's people that are considering</v>

620
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:50.990
<v Speaker 3>lawsuits right</v>

621
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.080
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does Donald Trump understand you should</v>

622
00:28:54.081 --> 00:28:56.960
<v Speaker 1>just be muting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just mute them.</v>

623
00:28:56.961 --> 00:28:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to block now.</v>

624
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.840
<v Speaker 1>He wants him to know what I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know Magda.</v>

625
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.960
<v Speaker 1>I like blocking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love block and people in the second I</v>

626
00:29:05.961 --> 00:29:08.690
<v Speaker 1>see anything I blocked somebody who even</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they say,</v>

627
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.490
<v Speaker 1>what am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies was just okay.</v>

628
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know have to be that main boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never see you again.</v>

629
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

630
00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.750
<v Speaker 1>If somebody says that was who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty good,</v>

631
00:29:17.751 --> 00:29:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll block them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Block them on almost a compliment.</v>

632
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost looks weird.</v>

633
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Underhanded stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not kissing my ass pretty hard.</v>

634
00:29:24.261 --> 00:29:25.440
<v Speaker 1>You're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

635
00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.610
<v Speaker 1>that's my twitter theory online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

636
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't even need you to call me a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the funny thing is that when</v>

637
00:29:30.651 --> 00:29:35.651
<v Speaker 1>people say nasty things on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always start sounding like they</v>

638
00:29:36.501 --> 00:29:38.900
<v Speaker 1>make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then bail at the end,</v>

639
00:29:38.901 --> 00:29:40.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll just be like,</v>

640
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give,</v>

641
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.600
<v Speaker 1>give the president a chance.</v>

642
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was duly elected by the</v>

643
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 1>American people and go jump in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

644
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's always like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to beat the,</v>

645
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.081
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

646
00:29:52.081 --> 00:29:55.200
<v Speaker 1>they're saying you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds sane and then it always lands</v>

647
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.490
<v Speaker 1>on jumping in oven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you stop exactly that.</v>

648
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Go well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take a lot of heat for</v>

649
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.770
<v Speaker 1>criticizing the President [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones?</v>

650
00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty soon.</v>

651
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm saying anything that</v>

652
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:12.400
<v Speaker 1>anyone else's and saying because I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a simple theory about all this stuff,</v>

653
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 1>which is I don't think rich people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to be rich.</v>

654
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that people are trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>told that rich people really can handle</v>

655
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you let the rich people have all</v>

656
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the money that they're just going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it all out.</v>

657
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:27.880
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last night was an interesting night</v>

658
00:30:27.881 --> 00:30:32.881
<v Speaker 1>because of Donald Trump said he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want poor people in charge of the</v>

659
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:35.260
<v Speaker 1>economy and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he said that,</v>

660
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he goes,</v>

661
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I want rich people.</v>

662
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's what he's not understanding is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are public servants who have not</v>

663
00:30:42.221 --> 00:30:46.390
<v Speaker 1>made the choice to be billionaires who</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually understand the economic</v>

664
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:48.720
<v Speaker 1>theories better than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

665
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 1>the head of Walmart or something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you were able to figure out</v>

666
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:57.490
<v Speaker 1>how to sell m and ms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you can run the economy.</v>

667
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 1>That there are people that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be rich,</v>

668
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:04.950
<v Speaker 1>they want to help other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are a very smart about ways to</v>

669
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:09.010
<v Speaker 1>help the government work well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

670
00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 1>that's like saying a Martin Luther</v>
<v Speaker 1>King's that loser because he wasn't</v>

671
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:16.600
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not smart and this only rich people</v>

672
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 1>know how to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find so offensive.</v>

673
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.990
<v Speaker 1>And I'm very surprised that people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't billionaires aren't more offended</v>

674
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.190
<v Speaker 1>at the contempt that they're held in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you could disagree on economic</v>

675
00:31:30.191 --> 00:31:31.750
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

676
00:31:31.751 --> 00:31:33.580
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in trickle down economics,</v>

677
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:35.800
<v Speaker 1>or I don't believe in trickle down</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>

678
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.100
<v Speaker 1>but this is a government that thinks if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a billionaire,</v>

679
00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 1>you're an idiot.</v>

680
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he thinks that I,</v>

681
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.120
<v Speaker 1>you said it last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not easy.</v>

682
00:31:44.121 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a literally a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

683
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 1>would you want poor people in charge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy?</v>

684
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Which is the argument for having like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of Goldman Sachs in charge of</v>

685
00:31:53.321 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 1>the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet,</v>

686
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.980
<v Speaker 1>what is a poor person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is he defining it?</v>

687
00:31:56.981 --> 00:32:01.981
<v Speaker 1>Is he defining it as an idiot failure or</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who hasn't decided to milk,</v>

688
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world for as much money as they can</v>

689
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:07.300
<v Speaker 1>get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are happy to make a</v>

690
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:12.301
<v Speaker 1>comfortable living and try to be giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>to other people and they can be very</v>

691
00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

692
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Speaker 1>being part of our government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be the head of Goldman</v>

693
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Sachs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

694
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:19.520
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

695
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:20.660
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

696
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.590
<v Speaker 1>someone who can change people's lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the better.</v>

697
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.630
<v Speaker 1>He thinks you just get the head and neck</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exxon,</v>

698
00:32:25.631 --> 00:32:28.300
<v Speaker 1>the had a Goldman Sachs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you don't want the head of</v>

699
00:32:28.301 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Exxon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want someone that's thought about</v>

700
00:32:30.071 --> 00:32:34.600
<v Speaker 1>international relations their entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and maybe they've always made 200</v>

701
00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 1>grand a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't,</v>

702
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:37.640
<v Speaker 1>that's not poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the,</v>

703
00:32:37.641 --> 00:32:39.750
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you define that core</v>

704
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.740
<v Speaker 3>and how he defines poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

705
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you say you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>pour person running the economy,</v>

706
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I think one argument for that would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want anybody who wants radical</v>

707
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:50.060
<v Speaker 3>redistribution of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One article,</v>

708
00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:54.410
<v Speaker 3>one Om argument while that rather it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be someone who says like what we</v>

709
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 3>need to do is we need to figure out who</v>
<v Speaker 3>the richest people in the world that own</v>

710
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 3>90% of the money and then just take that</v>
<v Speaker 3>money and distributed to everyone else.</v>

711
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some pretty radical arguments</v>

712
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:04.360
<v Speaker 3>from Portland.</v>

713
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's saying that.</v>

714
00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I say I think he equates poor with</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>

715
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.800
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want the,</v>

716
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bernie Sanders type.</v>

717
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.040
<v Speaker 1>He was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

718
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.000
<v Speaker 1>he considers like the head of Goldman</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sachs to be the smartest man in the</v>

719
00:33:18.001 --> 00:33:20.940
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are people who,</v>

720
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:26.150
<v Speaker 1>who don't seek to make that much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are very smart and certainly capable</v>

721
00:33:26.941 --> 00:33:29.190
<v Speaker 1>of doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he sees people who are not the</v>

722
00:33:29.191 --> 00:33:34.191
<v Speaker 1>heads of industry as being incapable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in charge of aspects of the</v>

723
00:33:34.321 --> 00:33:34.980
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

724
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Because that's his world because this</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is the world of super rich people.</v>

725
00:33:38.791 --> 00:33:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not a super rich person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a loser.</v>

726
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:41.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

727
00:33:41.881 --> 00:33:43.440
<v Speaker 1>It's all a winner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loser economy,</v>

728
00:33:43.441 --> 00:33:46.920
<v Speaker 1>which I find fascinating because he is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically calling most of the world the</v>

729
00:33:46.921 --> 00:33:50.010
<v Speaker 1>loser in his world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

730
00:33:50.011 --> 00:33:50.730
<v Speaker 1>you could debate.</v>

731
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think most people don't even</v>

732
00:33:53.311 --> 00:33:56.610
<v Speaker 1>understand most of what they talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>with politics.</v>

733
00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Like when you talk about wealth</v>
<v Speaker 1>redistribution that a lot of people are</v>

734
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.850
<v Speaker 1>fisheries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they actually don't know anything</v>

735
00:34:02.851 --> 00:34:04.470
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

736
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.590
<v Speaker 1>they have no information that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's read a book about it.</v>

737
00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.230
<v Speaker 1>And it has very few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few.</v>

738
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally less than 1% and 1% are</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing about on a regular basis.</v>

739
00:34:15.091 --> 00:34:18.390
<v Speaker 1>They've seen a few clips on Fox News and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this idea in their head of</v>

740
00:34:18.391 --> 00:34:20.910
<v Speaker 1>what it is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what's wrong with our</v>

741
00:34:20.911 --> 00:34:24.000
<v Speaker 1>country is no one knows anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything on either side.</v>

742
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

743
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply about,</v>

744
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:29.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>

745
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.460
<v Speaker 1>There's very few people who sit down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>read the study.</v>

746
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Very few people right now are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read that healthcare bill that is before</v>

747
00:34:38.131 --> 00:34:39.150
<v Speaker 1>the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

748
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of the country think is</v>

749
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.710
<v Speaker 1>going to sit down and read any part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

750
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Less than one 10th of 1% and destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives if they get sick and they</v>

751
00:34:48.511 --> 00:34:52.170
<v Speaker 1>don't have coverage and who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's perfect and we don't</v>

752
00:34:52.171 --> 00:34:55.950
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people won't bother to know anything</v>

753
00:34:55.951 --> 00:34:56.784
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

754
00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.843
<v Speaker 3>Warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

755
00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.300
<v Speaker 3>You talk to the average person on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right or the average person on the left</v>

756
00:35:01.301 --> 00:35:04.210
<v Speaker 3>about global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you will see like it's really</v>

757
00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:08.650
<v Speaker 3>strange how you see these ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 3>driven ideas that they have in their</v>

758
00:35:08.651 --> 00:35:11.530
<v Speaker 3>head about what global warming is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what causes it.</v>

759
00:35:11.531 --> 00:35:14.170
<v Speaker 3>And you can almost guess based on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction to it,</v>

760
00:35:14.171 --> 00:35:16.330
<v Speaker 3>whether they're republican or whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're liberal.</v>

761
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>

762
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously everyone talks about this,</v>

763
00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:23.770
<v Speaker 1>but people have chosen the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now anything that that side does,</v>

764
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.240
<v Speaker 1>people are okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

765
00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And so we suddenly were so soft on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and then all these,</v>

766
00:35:31.931 --> 00:35:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the being a republican used to be so</v>

767
00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>about the evil empire and on a dime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like people like</v>

768
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.641
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

769
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 3>look what they did with Wiki leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wiki leaks,</v>

770
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 3>everyone's turned on Wiki leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wiki leaks used to be the champion of</v>

771
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:45.150
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's to be,</v>

772
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:48.360
<v Speaker 3>these are the people that are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>let you know all the shit that's going</v>

773
00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:50.400
<v Speaker 3>on behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're finding out all these secret</v>

774
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 3>emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're sharing them with the world.</v>

775
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

776
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.380
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a media dumped,</v>

777
00:35:54.381 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 3>there were dumping everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's Wiki leaks is Putin's puppet</v>

778
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.220
<v Speaker 3>and wikileaks is working for Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left is turned on.</v>

779
00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Wiki leaks was quite fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well both sides we'll switch based on</v>

780
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:09.120
<v Speaker 3>what serves them in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

781
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:11.460
<v Speaker 3>But it's dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird when you see,</v>

782
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 3>when you see it so obvious and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>flippant,</v>

783
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 3>like there's not a lot of thought put</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this.</v>

784
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Like you're talking about someone like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian the size.</v>

785
00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a giant Julian assange fan as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being,</v>

786
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.760
<v Speaker 3>but I think what he's done is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn courageous and he's taken a huge</v>

787
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.450
<v Speaker 3>hit for it.</v>

788
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been stuck in this embassy in</v>

789
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 3>London forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he leaves,</v>

790
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 3>he will immediately be arrested and who</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows what's going to happen to them if</v>

791
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:38.410
<v Speaker 3>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

792
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 3>and this guy is still out there trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to distribute information.</v>

793
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Well it's about is it's selective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

794
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 3>if a guy like that is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously the issues are,</v>

795
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 3>is he putting people's lives at risk</v>
<v Speaker 3>with w mega dumps,</v>

796
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 3>which reveal sources and things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

797
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.860
<v Speaker 3>But also is he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he manipulated to release things to</v>

798
00:36:58.861 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 3>serve a different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

799
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.800
<v Speaker 3>political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he doing it on purpose in one way or</v>

800
00:37:04.801 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 3>the other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the stuff on the Republicans?</v>

801
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:07.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we had all the,</v>

802
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.860
<v Speaker 3>all the emails of the Republican's</v>
<v Speaker 3>planning the trump campaign,</v>

803
00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have a whole nother story to tell.</v>

804
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it impossible to get their emails?</v>

805
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Do they just have the best computers in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and there's no way to get</v>

806
00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:22.620
<v Speaker 3>their emails or it depends on what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story is.</v>

807
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

808
00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 3>that they believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

809
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:26.760
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to figure out what happened</v>

810
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that seth rich guy,</v>

811
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.850
<v Speaker 3>according to Kim Dotcom and according to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian assange,</v>

812
00:37:32.851 --> 00:37:34.770
<v Speaker 3>he leaked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a Bernie Sanders supporter.</v>

813
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.590
<v Speaker 3>He worked for the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He leaked some of the information that</v>

814
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:42.591
<v Speaker 3>showed that the DNC was colluding and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were trying to do was a con.</v>

815
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.930
<v Speaker 3>They were conspiring to keep Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanders from winning the primary.</v>

816
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 3>And it proved to be true that that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually did do that.</v>

817
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.490
<v Speaker 3>And Julian Assange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

818
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:54.870
<v Speaker 3>was setting after that guy got shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somehow or another,</v>

819
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:56.880
<v Speaker 3>he was alluding to that if you work with</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

820
00:37:56.881 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 3>there are consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you had someone who was a,</v>

821
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 3>a renegade inside the DNC who released</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dump.</v>

822
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.430
<v Speaker 3>You don't have anybody like that on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican side.</v>

823
00:38:05.431 --> 00:38:08.970
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that the wikileaks is</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt.</v>

824
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.850
<v Speaker 3>It just means that no one on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>republican side has done that.</v>

825
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Only one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to them,</v>

826
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

827
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.900
<v Speaker 3>some people say Russia did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but according to Julian assange and</v>

828
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:23.160
<v Speaker 3>according to Kim Dotcom was apparently</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another involved at least</v>

829
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:25.380
<v Speaker 3>part of it had to do with this seth rich</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

830
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:30.740
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that they're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to exclusively released stuff</v>

831
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 3>than makes Democrats like bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just means no one's done it on the</v>

832
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:36.430
<v Speaker 3>republican side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because the information doesn't</v>

833
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean there's some sort of</v>

834
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 3>collusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

835
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the mystery of it.</v>

836
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know anything about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>seth rich case.</v>

837
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:43.961
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>

838
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 3>cause I know people are mad about us.</v>

839
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 3>That guy that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he worked for the DNC and he was</v>

840
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:52.200
<v Speaker 3>murdered outside of his apartment at</v>
<v Speaker 3>four o'clock in the morning.</v>

841
00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.140
<v Speaker 3>They said it was a robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

842
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.370
<v Speaker 3>there's a giant conspiracy theory to</v>
<v Speaker 3>attach to it,</v>

843
00:38:57.371 --> 00:39:00.610
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just going to relay the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His wallet was left,</v>

844
00:39:00.611 --> 00:39:02.800
<v Speaker 3>his phone was left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his watch was left,</v>

845
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 3>his valuables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he might have been robbed of his</v>

846
00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 3>monies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff was there.</v>

847
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 3>So he's just murdered and they never</v>
<v Speaker 3>found who killed him.</v>

848
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:16.290
<v Speaker 3>And then immediately Julian assange was</v>
<v Speaker 3>alluding to the idea that this guy was</v>

849
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:18.820
<v Speaker 3>helping them and that he was murdered</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that,</v>

850
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 3>and that has been hotly</v>
<v Speaker 3>contested.</v>

851
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

852
00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 3>the Fox News narrative has like gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Sean Hannity has made a big deal</v>

853
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:31.210
<v Speaker 3>out of it saying that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get to the bottom of</v>

854
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:32.044
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

855
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.750
<v Speaker 3>which makes me more suspicious and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not true,</v>

856
00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:40.170
<v Speaker 3>but it is a possibility that he was one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people that was releasing</v>

857
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:41.050
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

858
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:43.000
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine if you worked for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>DNC,</v>

859
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:46.810
<v Speaker 3>especially if you were a Bernie Sanders</v>
<v Speaker 3>supporter and you saw what they were</v>

860
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:49.030
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were doing is essentially they</v>

861
00:39:49.031 --> 00:39:50.830
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were hijacking the democratic</v>

862
00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:53.800
<v Speaker 3>process from inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the Democratic Party.</v>

863
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you were a Bernie sanders</v>

864
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 3>supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be horrifying and it would</v>

865
00:39:57.911 --> 00:40:00.550
<v Speaker 3>really piss you off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially if you're someone who's</v>

866
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.420
<v Speaker 3>idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got this idea of like what the</v>

867
00:40:04.421 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 3>future could be under Bernie Sanders and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize your own party is fucking</v>

868
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:10.210
<v Speaker 3>him in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

869
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much he released or if</v>

870
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:16.900
<v Speaker 3>he released or if he was only one part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it or Russia was a part of it as</v>

871
00:40:16.901 --> 00:40:18.400
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hacking into the DNC.</v>

872
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day is it exposed corruption.</v>

873
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's absolute clear corruption in the</v>

874
00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:28.420
<v Speaker 3>DNC and everybody got away with it.</v>

875
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 3>The woman who was in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she went and left and went immediately</v>

876
00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:33.240
<v Speaker 3>to work for Hillary's campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

877
00:40:33.241 --> 00:40:35.050
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't good stuff.</v>

878
00:40:35.051 --> 00:40:38.590
<v Speaker 3>It was all bad no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter who really released it.</v>

879
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.900
<v Speaker 3>It just showed you how gross the system</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

880
00:40:40.901 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To the core.</v>

881
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the way around.</v>

882
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.880
<v Speaker 3>On both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm not a big conspiracy theorist.</v>

883
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why should you be?</v>

884
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 3>I guess that there's always more going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on than we think.</v>

885
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.960
<v Speaker 3>But I also think that most people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>too dumb to not get caught almost every</v>

886
00:40:57.971 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 3>single time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

887
00:40:59.321 --> 00:41:01.540
<v Speaker 3>You say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of shit that happens</v>

888
00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:04.300
<v Speaker 3>where people do get caught eventually</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you realize,</v>

889
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how long were you guys running</v>

890
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your favorite conspiracy theory</v>

891
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:11.620
<v Speaker 3>that turned out to be true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say whether it turned out</v>

892
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:13.990
<v Speaker 3>to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but JFK is the biggest one.</v>

893
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:16.540
<v Speaker 3>And where did you land on that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I landed on that.</v>

894
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 3>It's very possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very possible that Lee Harvey Oswald was</v>

895
00:41:21.071 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very possible that other people</v>

896
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:27.250
<v Speaker 3>involved too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very possible that he shot at</v>

897
00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy and other people shot at Kennedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time that and then he was a</v>

898
00:41:31.601 --> 00:41:36.601
<v Speaker 3>patsy and he was put like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was obviously involved in a lot of</v>

899
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:40.490
<v Speaker 3>intelligence agency shenanigans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to Russia,</v>

900
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 3>he married a Russian woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back to the United States.</v>

901
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.550
<v Speaker 3>He had been involved in all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communists,</v>

902
00:41:46.551 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 3>propaganda shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was definitely not like an above</v>

903
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:55.400
<v Speaker 3>ground guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a shady dude and it's entirely</v>

904
00:41:55.401 --> 00:42:00.050
<v Speaker 3>possible that he was one person out of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>plot to kill the president and they put</v>

905
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 3>it all on him and they had Jack Ruby</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot him.</v>

906
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 3>But everybody goes black and white on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

907
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:07.790
<v Speaker 3>You either go Lee Harvey Oswald acted</v>
<v Speaker 3>alone or you go,</v>

908
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 3>he was innocent and the CIA had him</v>
<v Speaker 3>assassinated because he was trying to</v>

909
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:14.180
<v Speaker 3>get rid of the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he was.</v>

910
00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy was trying to pull us out of</v>

911
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was trying to get rid of the CIA.</v>

912
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:19.680
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to get rid of the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

913
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

914
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 3>the Federal Reserve here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of like super</v>

915
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 3>controversial ideas that Kennedy was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to push forward and someone</v>

916
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 3>killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always go to the simple thing,</v>

917
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:33.260
<v Speaker 3>which is why would Jack Ruby shoot him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

918
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause a lot of people say,</v>

919
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:35.900
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just a patriot.</v>

920
00:42:35.901 --> 00:42:39.320
<v Speaker 3>We've got mad and happened to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

921
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.460
<v Speaker 3>which maybe makes perfect sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he was told to do it,</v>

922
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.420
<v Speaker 3>it's such a suicide end up in jail for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of your life mission.</v>

923
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.460
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It falls.</v>

924
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Things like that fall apart there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>

925
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's also possible they told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

926
00:42:54.651 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 3>just shoot him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get you off.</v>

927
00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:57.060
<v Speaker 3>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

928
00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.390
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll find some sort of a way.</v>

929
00:42:59.391 --> 00:43:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they might've had something horrible</v>

930
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:04.160
<v Speaker 3>on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack Ruby was clearly embedded in the</v>

931
00:43:04.161 --> 00:43:07.430
<v Speaker 3>mob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mob was angry at Kennedy because</v>

932
00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:11.000
<v Speaker 3>they helped Kennedy when they helped him</v>
<v Speaker 3>win Illinois.</v>

933
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.600
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They helped him become the president and</v>

934
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:19.160
<v Speaker 3>there was absolute evidence that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were mad at him once he became president</v>

935
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:21.530
<v Speaker 3>because then he started doing things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were against their interest.</v>

936
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of people pissed off at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy.</v>

937
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.580
<v Speaker 3>That's what's funny about the current</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia scandal because it's a similar</v>

938
00:43:28.581 --> 00:43:30.440
<v Speaker 3>thing where there's just so much going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

939
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I keep saying that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not hearing this defense from all</v>

940
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:34.880
<v Speaker 3>the trump people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

941
00:43:34.881 --> 00:43:39.881
<v Speaker 3>we met with Peru eight times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We met with English people like they are</v>

942
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:45.941
<v Speaker 3>just that having those meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not all those connections with</v>

943
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.090
<v Speaker 3>any other country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Russia not only that,</v>

944
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.230
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing about Flynn and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

945
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 3>the intelligence agencies were warning</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Flynn was compromised and that the,</v>

946
00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 3>he could be blackmailed by Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they had things on him,</v>

947
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.100
<v Speaker 3>what they had on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know,</v>

948
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:06.101
<v Speaker 3>but they're very convinced that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was evidence against Flynn and that the</v>

949
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 3>trump administration knew this and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were still entertaining talks with them.</v>

950
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 3>They're still bringing him on board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's fascinating is this world of</v>

951
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:16.310
<v Speaker 3>international lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Paul Manafort,</v>

952
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.430
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>

953
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.940
<v Speaker 3>did you see this a thing where Paul</v>
<v Speaker 3>manafort's kids,</v>

954
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:26.960
<v Speaker 3>someone hack their phones and they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these texts where they were talking</v>

955
00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:29.770
<v Speaker 3>about how horrible their dad was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

956
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>and how he's responsible for</v>

957
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.370
<v Speaker 2>people getting killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

958
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 2>And they're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who knows if any of that's true,</v>

959
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.520
<v Speaker 2>but there's a higher world of Americans</v>
<v Speaker 2>going overseas and being involved in</v>

960
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:48.500
<v Speaker 2>dirty politics and the work of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

961
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:53.520
<v Speaker 2>governments like the Ukraine that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any clue about what that is.</v>

962
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on the last frontiers for really</v>

963
00:44:55.561 --> 00:44:57.930
<v Speaker 2>diabolical shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

964
00:44:57.931 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 2>like Russia is one of the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what he had,</v>

965
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.840
<v Speaker 2>what he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Putin stands for is,</v>

966
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the last brutal military</v>

967
00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:09.390
<v Speaker 2>dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of in a costume.</v>

968
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in a costume as the president of</v>

969
00:45:12.031 --> 00:45:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all know,</v>

970
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he murders people that oppose him.</v>

971
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:20.250
<v Speaker 2>He murders journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he murders political candidates that are</v>

972
00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:21.350
<v Speaker 2>running against him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

973
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.340
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's terrifying guy.</v>

974
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:27.870
<v Speaker 2>But what do you think it means that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump just love some just not good.</v>

975
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.050
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did Myers.</v>

976
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I think he admires the take no shit guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

977
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:38.001
<v Speaker 2>I think he does and I think there's also</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility that he feels that what</v>

978
00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Putin stands for is like he's a this</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful superpower and it's better to</v>

979
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:45.240
<v Speaker 2>be friends with them than it is to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>

980
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Let's just cozy up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

981
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could do a lot of the shit you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

982
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people talk shit about me on</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

983
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could have him killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's entirely possible that he</v>

984
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 2>thinks along those lines because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably from decades of trump</v>

985
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:03.960
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the mob in New York and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic city and he probably developed</v>

986
00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 2>a point of view about how you deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil people.</v>

987
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how you have to make deals and how</v>

988
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 2>friends with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of rich people think</v>

989
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.890
<v Speaker 2>everyone doesn't understand this is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world works.</v>

990
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.280
<v Speaker 2>This is how the sausage gets made and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they do crazy stuff because</v>

991
00:46:23.341 --> 00:46:27.310
<v Speaker 2>they just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else is naive and just get me</v>

992
00:46:27.311 --> 00:46:29.040
<v Speaker 2>in a room with and get me a back</v>
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

993
00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:30.350
<v Speaker 2>We'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right.</v>

994
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.630
<v Speaker 2>The back channel with cushner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like sitting down with a mob</v>

995
00:46:33.631 --> 00:46:38.150
<v Speaker 2>figuring out your price for cement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he thinks the Putin back</v>

996
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 2>channel is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe we will figure it out.</v>

997
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.891
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

998
00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:43.950
<v Speaker 2>we'll come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it seems like trump likes</v>

999
00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:48.951
<v Speaker 2>the idea of that what you present is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie and what you do in private is</v>

1000
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 2>figuring out solutions and that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the world works and that it's all</v>

1001
00:46:54.451 --> 00:46:55.860
<v Speaker 2>full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1002
00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:58.710
<v Speaker 2>and that that is the way you get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with everything.</v>

1003
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.930
<v Speaker 2>That's how the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a justification.</v>

1004
00:47:00.931 --> 00:47:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's how the world works,</v>

1005
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:08.090
<v Speaker 2>which is so different than Bush who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious and had this thought,</v>

1006
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 2>we are going to go to other countries.</v>

1007
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:15.710
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take down these leaders</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are going to find freedom and</v>

1008
00:47:17.161 --> 00:47:21.300
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to change for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive when they don't have these</v>

1009
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 2>dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is an old school guy who's like,</v>

1010
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:27.180
<v Speaker 2>you need the dictators to keep all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>assholes in line.</v>

1011
00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile he's kind of right.</v>

1012
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what happens when you take the</v>

1013
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:33.550
<v Speaker 2>dictators out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You create this power vacuum and the</v>

1014
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 2>places are way more chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Libya,</v>

1015
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a failed state now.</v>

1016
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 2>He got rid of Qaddafi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's happy.</v>

1017
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton was on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did an interview with her where</v>

1018
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 2>she's cheering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like laughing at a week came,</v>

1019
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:48.250
<v Speaker 2>we saw he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha Ha.</v>

1020
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1021
00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 2>The air thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what makes the world so</v>

1022
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:56.160
<v Speaker 2>impossible to manage right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1023
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1024
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.150
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried this,</v>

1025
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:02.280
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 2>this approach of let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's make these people a democracy,</v>

1027
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 2>but you can't force people to want a</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>

1028
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're conditioned to being in a</v>

1029
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:14.500
<v Speaker 2>dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've lived that way their whole life,</v>

1030
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.380
<v Speaker 2>and there's all these other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get rid of Qaddafi,</v>

1031
00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean he's the only piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit there.</v>

1032
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:22.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a million other pieces of shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are wondering how they get to that</v>

1033
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:27.040
<v Speaker 2>guy's position and he's keeping them</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and murdering people and trying to</v>

1034
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 2>keep keeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so their entire life,</v>

1035
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:30.970
<v Speaker 2>that's the paradigm they've operated</v>
<v Speaker 2>under.</v>

1036
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 2>They've watched this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've seen this one central brutal,</v>

1037
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:39.220
<v Speaker 2>murderous figure control everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when that's gone,</v>

1038
00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not all Kumbaya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the sudden it creates this power</v>

1039
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:45.370
<v Speaker 2>vacuum and then everybody's clamoring to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see who takes that guy spot.</v>

1040
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.600
<v Speaker 2>And now you have isis steps in and Libya</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just straight chaos.</v>

1041
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:55.050
<v Speaker 2>And there's seems to be no solution to</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost no solution,</v>

1042
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:56.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a,</v>

1043
00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a massive religious tribal war</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening where if we,</v>

1044
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.220
<v Speaker 2>if we didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1045
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 2>they would just be fighting each other.</v>

1046
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened.</v>

1047
00:49:05.501 --> 00:49:07.510
<v Speaker 2>That's what we were warned about with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq.</v>

1048
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Like people that didn't understand Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Bush,</v>

1049
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 2>did not understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take Saddam Hussein out of the</v>

1050
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:14.830
<v Speaker 2>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is kind of secular,</v>

1051
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.910
<v Speaker 2>what you're left with is this Sunni Shia</v>
<v Speaker 2>up civil war.</v>

1052
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.820
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to have this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where there's two different</v>

1053
00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:26.020
<v Speaker 2>sects of Islam are going to kill each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other and no one saw that coming.</v>

1054
00:49:26.021 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know who did see that coming?</v>

1055
00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Janeane Garofalo she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1056
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:31.480
<v Speaker 2>cause I remember watching her on CNN and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

1057
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.700
<v Speaker 2>there was a massive protest against</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into Iraq before we went to war.</v>

1058
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.260
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going to happen if we go</v>

1059
00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:42.790
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she laid that out.</v>

1060
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a Noam Chomsky Fan.</v>

1061
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

1062
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:47.260
<v Speaker 2>these people are going to attack each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1063
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:48.280
<v Speaker 2>We're going to create a mess.</v>

1064
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 2>That is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna open a Pandora's box and</v>

1065
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:55.720
<v Speaker 2>there are no weapons of mass destruction</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we should wait and we don't have</v>

1066
00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:59.050
<v Speaker 2>enough information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she really took a beating,</v>

1067
00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:01.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for being,</v>

1068
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:05.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in strong opposition to invading Iraq.</v>

1069
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.410
<v Speaker 2>And every single thing that you said</v>
<v Speaker 2>would happen in the next 10 years.</v>

1070
00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 2>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she wasn't the only person.</v>

1071
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 2>There were plenty of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when nine 11 happened,</v>

1072
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Norman mailer was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1073
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:19.990
<v Speaker 2>he was on Charlie rose like that week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1074
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:23.980
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he explained the wars that would</v>

1075
00:50:23.981 --> 00:50:25.570
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they would happen.</v>

1076
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:26.890
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he,</v>

1077
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>and this is what's gonna happen</v>

1078
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:33.040
<v Speaker 1>as a result of those wars and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and laid out the mess that was created.</v>

1079
00:50:33.801 --> 00:50:34.521
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see,</v>

1080
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:37.250
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do not have the strength to not take</v>

1081
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:38.780
<v Speaker 1>these steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should clarify.</v>

1082
00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Janine's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1083
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:40.900
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1084
00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Noam Chomsky Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know chumps Chomsky was saying</v>

1085
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:45.620
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty adamant about that.</v>

1086
00:50:45.621 --> 00:50:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Like very early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just watched the Chomsky documentary</v>

1087
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 1>on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting guy.</v>

1088
00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was fascinating and it had one</v>

1089
00:50:54.231 --> 00:50:56.420
<v Speaker 1>simple idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also I think a lot of people don't</v>

1090
00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1091
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:03.250
<v Speaker 1>which is just that our country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it's set up is,</v>

1092
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:09.730
<v Speaker 1>is meant to protect people from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with money from the land owners.</v>

1093
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.040
<v Speaker 1>As it was more back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the basic theory is that</v>

1094
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:22.400
<v Speaker 1>the people with the wealth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations are not served by</v>

1095
00:51:22.401 --> 00:51:25.220
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If democracy is functioning,</v>

1096
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it is not in the favor of the wealthy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate interests.</v>

1097
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 1>And so as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always have to be against democracy</v>

1098
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.830
<v Speaker 1>because if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1099
00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.000
<v Speaker 1>if Republicans don't have voter</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppression,</v>

1100
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 1>then everything is going to change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>favor of what the population wants to</v>

1101
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:49.610
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that they'll always be incentives for</v>

1102
00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:53.870
<v Speaker 1>having less people vote and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to making democracy not function the way</v>

1103
00:51:53.871 --> 00:51:58.070
<v Speaker 1>that it should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause clearly you could have voter motor</v>

1104
00:51:58.071 --> 00:52:00.050
<v Speaker 1>id where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get your driver's license,</v>

1105
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.530
<v Speaker 1>you're registered for the whole country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have everyone in the country</v>

1106
00:52:03.531 --> 00:52:05.540
<v Speaker 1>vote by mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have everyone vote by computer,</v>

1107
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:07.610
<v Speaker 1>you can make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd have 80,</v>

1108
00:52:07.611 --> 00:52:11.420
<v Speaker 1>90% of the people voting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that goes against corporate</v>

1109
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:15.020
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they fight to say,</v>

1110
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1111
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:18.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these fake votes when there,</v>

1112
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:22.310
<v Speaker 1>there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that protects corporate</v>

1113
00:52:22.311 --> 00:52:23.630
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

1114
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:28.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a really interesting documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just came up I guess in the last</v>

1115
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:28.520
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1116
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.500
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1117
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about to find out.</v>

1118
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:35.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1119
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The computers to searching as we speak.</v>

1120
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:41.210
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that are resisting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of people voting online.</v>

1121
00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.520
<v Speaker 1>But we bank online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

1122
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Of course she'd be able to vote while we</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly could get more people voting.</v>

1123
00:52:47.301 --> 00:52:51.200
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating that there's other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like Russia trying to get into</v>

1124
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:51.561
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1125
00:52:51.561 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 1>requiem for the American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1126
00:52:54.411 --> 00:52:54.831
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1127
00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:57.740
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth seeing.</v>

1128
00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:58.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1129
00:52:58.821 --> 00:52:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1130
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:03.560
<v Speaker 1>some of these things I don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest opinions on because it's</v>

1131
00:53:03.561 --> 00:53:06.320
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very complicated and it's like you</v>

1132
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:07.154
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

1133
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you never know what new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>messier creating.</v>

1134
00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1135
00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who does a lot of charity work around</v>

1136
00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very famous actor.</v>

1137
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:15.891
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1138
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I was working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1139
00:53:16.911 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 1>on this project to dig wells and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>community in Africa.</v>

1140
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And then we dug the wells and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible for this community and</v>

1141
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:31.130
<v Speaker 2>then the neighboring community came and</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered everybody for the wells.</v>

1142
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's like trying to save</v>

1143
00:53:34.531 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 2>people and to help people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always something that results</v>

1144
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 2>that you did not anticipate that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>it even more complicated.</v>

1145
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 2>And I feel it's that way with most</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that you think it's this,</v>

1146
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 2>but you've set off that and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it takes,</v>

1147
00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.690
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I come down is you need an</v>

1148
00:53:54.691 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 2>incredibly intelligent person to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of making these choices.</v>

1149
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.580
<v Speaker 2>And just generally with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's that smart and I</v>

1150
00:54:02.581 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 2>think that he is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 2>very self-involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic person and we can debate,</v>

1152
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choices,</v>

1153
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.580
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the person who has the depth to</v>

1154
00:54:16.621 --> 00:54:18.270
<v Speaker 2>make these calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1155
00:54:18.271 --> 00:54:22.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody really is</v>
<v Speaker 2>qualified to run 350 million people.</v>

1156
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's a ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>proposition,</v>

1157
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.190
<v Speaker 2>but I think you're definitely right.</v>

1158
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1159
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:31.030
<v Speaker 2>he sets the tone for the mindset of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1160
00:54:31.031 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really is.</v>

1161
00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:37.911
<v Speaker 2>We have this Alpha male chimpanzee thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on where the one like robot Momma</v>

1162
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.940
<v Speaker 2>love him or hate him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a very articulate,</v>

1163
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 2>really well spoken calm and measured</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1164
00:54:44.701 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's very good for America</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have this guy who's smarter than</v>

1165
00:54:49.561 --> 00:54:52.590
<v Speaker 2>anybody you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's running the country like you</v>

1166
00:54:52.591 --> 00:54:53.401
<v Speaker 2>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1167
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 2>well this guy is obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1168
00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hardly ever stutters.</v>

1169
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 2>He knows what he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And very moderate.</v>

1170
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get down to it,</v>

1171
00:55:02.251 --> 00:55:07.251
<v Speaker 2>what I find interesting is Obama was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate after the banking issues,</v>

1172
00:55:07.411 --> 00:55:10.620
<v Speaker 2>he didn't go after the bankers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't send anyone to jail.</v>

1173
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:15.750
<v Speaker 2>He propped up those businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that the banks so want to</v>

1174
00:55:15.751 --> 00:55:19.830
<v Speaker 2>get rid of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me go how much money is enough,</v>

1175
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:20.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1176
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:24.420
<v Speaker 2>This guy's still basically on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary's basically still on your side.</v>

1177
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:28.080
<v Speaker 2>They were mad when their bonuses where</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimalized.</v>

1178
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that.</v>

1179
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they got billions of</v>

1180
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 2>dollars in bail money and they still</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted their bonuses.</v>

1181
00:55:34.201 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I have a contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my contract says I got a bonus or just</v>

1182
00:55:37.471 --> 00:55:41.310
<v Speaker 2>thinking about their house and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>yacht and people got bonuses even though</v>

1183
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 2>the economy collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the economy class as a</v>

1184
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:48.030
<v Speaker 2>direct result of the industry that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were involved in and the businesses they</v>

1185
00:55:48.031 --> 00:55:50.070
<v Speaker 2>were running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still got bonuses.</v>

1186
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:54.270
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy and it was interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I guess most people,</v>

1187
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't connect that and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>furious.</v>

1188
00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Like right now they're trying to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the compute,</v>

1189
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:03.380
<v Speaker 2>the Consumer Protection Bureau that</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps an eye on the bank.</v>

1190
00:56:03.381 --> 00:56:06.030
<v Speaker 2>So they're trying to Defang them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Pete,</v>

1191
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.760
<v Speaker 2>you would think that people who want</v>
<v Speaker 2>their guns would also say,</v>

1192
00:56:08.761 --> 00:56:11.880
<v Speaker 2>but I would like consumer protection so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't screw me out of my credit</v>

1193
00:56:11.881 --> 00:56:12.491
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1194
00:56:12.491 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 2>But for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't align it with their</v>

1195
00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:16.230
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1196
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.020
<v Speaker 2>They don't care about the issues that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1197
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.720
<v Speaker 2>that would protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that super dangerous to have a</v>

1198
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 2>right and a left I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just</v>

1199
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 3>cause you always do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go for independent candidates a lot.</v>

1200
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking for a third party and</v>

1201
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 3>what prevents there from being a logical</v>
<v Speaker 3>third party?</v>

1202
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:34.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we had it with Ross Perot,</v>

1203
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Ross Perot was a logical third</v>

1204
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 3>party and it became very dangerous for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1205
00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:41.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons why the</v>
<v Speaker 3>commission for presidential debates</v>

1206
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:43.540
<v Speaker 3>changed the threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you back then,</v>

1207
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:46.960
<v Speaker 3>you needed 5% in the primary in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be included in the debates.</v>

1208
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.120
<v Speaker 3>You put Ross Perot and the debate is an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1209
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.200
<v Speaker 3>an independent [inaudible] extremely</v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy man who understands a lot about</v>

1210
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 3>tax codes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understands a lot about foreign</v>

1211
00:56:56.351 --> 00:56:59.200
<v Speaker 3>relations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he became like a huge problem and</v>

1212
00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:01.720
<v Speaker 3>most likely cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1213
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Herbert Walker Bush his second term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1214
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that's why Clinton became</v>

1215
00:57:06.521 --> 00:57:08.950
<v Speaker 3>president in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the threshold is what now to get</v>

1216
00:57:08.951 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 3>into those debates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders is kind of an</v>

1217
00:57:11.621 --> 00:57:12.640
<v Speaker 3>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1218
00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's obviously that his parties not on</v>

1219
00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:17.470
<v Speaker 3>his side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we proved that with the DNC leaks</v>

1220
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 3>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're conspiring against him.</v>

1221
00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Speaker 3>This is his actual own party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the same as changing the</v>

1222
00:57:23.621 --> 00:57:26.290
<v Speaker 3>thresholds of the third party candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't be in the debates.</v>

1223
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1224
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 3>It's just another version of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1225
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's another version of that.</v>

1226
00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Well then you find out the condition for</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential debates is I,</v>

1227
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even a national thing.</v>

1228
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like a privately funded thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1229
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a private company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can choose like how they like</v>

1230
00:57:44.651 --> 00:57:45.251
<v Speaker 3>what like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1231
00:57:45.251 --> 00:57:48.250
<v Speaker 3>let's make it 15%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to get 15% and then they could</v>

1232
00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:50.350
<v Speaker 3>just change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy was a problem.</v>

1233
00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 3>That guy was a pain in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's change the threshold.</v>

1234
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could go wrong?</v>

1235
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you,</v>

1236
00:57:55.570 --> 00:58:00.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are people who feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>left and right are the same thing when</v>

1237
00:58:02.051 --> 00:58:07.051
<v Speaker 3>you really get down to it or they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting the same interests in some</v>

1238
00:58:07.121 --> 00:58:07.954
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1239
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Are you a believer in that or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>

1240
00:58:12.101 --> 00:58:15.070
<v Speaker 3>most of the people that are on the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>and most of the people on the right</v>

1241
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:18.970
<v Speaker 3>aren't even really thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever their party stands for.</v>

1242
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 3>They are just like they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are sticking with the team,</v>

1243
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:23.560
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the left team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the right team.</v>

1244
00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1245
00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I think radical ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's on the left or the right,</v>

1246
00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:32.150
<v Speaker 3>will they share a lot of common traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that they share is</v>

1247
00:58:32.151 --> 00:58:34.600
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this complete lack of objectivity,</v>

1248
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.770
<v Speaker 3>lack of objectivity and lack of</v>
<v Speaker 3>introspective thought in terms of like</v>

1249
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 3>what their party is actually doing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it means to be a liberal,</v>

1250
00:58:41.711 --> 00:58:44.440
<v Speaker 3>what it means to be progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it means to be Republican,</v>

1251
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:48.190
<v Speaker 3>what it means to be conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just get into this groove like this</v>

1252
00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:50.320
<v Speaker 3>is what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck global warming.</v>

1253
00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1254
00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 3>and then fuck this and you can't be</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist against a white person.</v>

1255
00:58:54.881 --> 00:58:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have these ridiculous ideas on</v>

1256
00:58:57.281 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 3>the left and on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just dig their heels in the sand.</v>

1257
00:59:00.521 --> 00:59:02.710
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even think about and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go with it because that's what the</v>

1258
00:59:02.711 --> 00:59:05.880
<v Speaker 3>party says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just the game because they have</v>

1259
00:59:05.881 --> 00:59:09.520
<v Speaker 3>kind of election night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called a lot of politicians and a</v>

1260
00:59:09.521 --> 00:59:11.890
<v Speaker 3>bunch of journalists was just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a sense of what's going on.</v>

1261
00:59:11.891 --> 00:59:13.900
<v Speaker 3>How could I get involved with was there</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

1262
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.440
<v Speaker 3>And it was really dispiriting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all reactive.</v>

1263
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:18.071
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1264
00:59:18.071 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 3>we have to see what they do to decide</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to react.</v>

1265
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 3>And I</v>

1266
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you were just super upset that trump</v>

1267
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 1>won?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1268
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I could see what was about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everything I was concerned about did</v>

1269
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:29.720
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they basically all said,</v>

1270
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to let him do his thing to then</v>

1271
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:35.780
<v Speaker 1>react and then have the population react</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what he did.</v>

1272
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:38.270
<v Speaker 1>And did you have any concerns at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about hillary?</v>

1273
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1274
00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1275
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:47.390
<v Speaker 1>it reminded me a little bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1276
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware of what those issues are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think,</v>

1277
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are large choices that just affect</v>

1278
00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 1>millions and hundreds of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1279
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a guy like Donald Trump says,</v>

1280
01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:05.240
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to give money to any aid</v>
<v Speaker 1>service around the world that says</v>

1281
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>anything about abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget giving out abortions.</v>

1282
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:10.610
<v Speaker 1>If they hand out a pamphlet and it says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an option,</v>

1283
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.810
<v Speaker 1>they don't get money.</v>

1284
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a country in Africa and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one aids aid service,</v>

1285
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I like feeds starving people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also hand out a pamphlet on</v>

1286
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any of the money anymore.</v>

1287
01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was fucked up and a lot of the</v>

1288
01:00:24.111 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>things he does are fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did you have any problems at all</v>

1289
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>with Hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did you know I had a big issue that</v>

1290
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:34.001
<v Speaker 1>she does not seem to understand a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain issues like the speech getting</v>

1291
01:00:35.661 --> 01:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>paid for the speeches that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that her blind spot and she has revealed</v>

1292
01:00:39.711 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 1>to still have it after the election that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1293
01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did I go there?</v>

1294
01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Cause I got paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1295
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they've made,</v>

1296
01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a hundred million dollars giving</v>

1297
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>speeches bill and Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which on one level you go,</v>

1298
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1299
01:00:54.231 --> 01:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go do a,</v>

1300
01:00:57.251 --> 01:01:00.170
<v Speaker 1>a standard corporate gig and it's crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1301
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a crazy corporate speech money</v>
<v Speaker 1>floating up.</v>

1302
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute.</v>

1303
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.453
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1304
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1305
01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying she has a blind spot to</v>

1306
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:14.540
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the potential for corruption that</v>

1307
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>people see in that and that she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

1308
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>when you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1309
01:01:19.841 --> 01:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>well one article said it was like $150</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion between the two of them over</v>

1310
01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>like 10 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that she doesn't even have a</v>

1311
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>good game to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend it,</v>

1312
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that you can't go up against trump and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say he's corrupt while you're getting</v>

1313
01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:38.570
<v Speaker 1>that much money from corporate</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>

1314
01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Like she never even saw how offensive it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1315
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>That kind of thing that Bernie Sanders</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do.</v>

1316
01:01:45.171 --> 01:01:45.831
<v Speaker 1>So people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1317
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>at least he's not lining his pockets</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that money.</v>

1318
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Hillary is basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1319
01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I lined my pockets with that money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still have my own opinions and the</v>

1320
01:01:56.151 --> 01:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>blind spot at least to the outrage of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that I,</v>

1321
01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I had threw me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately the main choices that she</v>

1322
01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 1>wanted to make on a lot of issues are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more in line with what I believe</v>

1323
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>than trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1324
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.470
<v Speaker 1>although not a perfect candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1325
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>trump is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1326
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to get this healthcare thing</v>

1327
01:02:19.171 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>through and doesn't seem</v>

1328
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:23.730
<v Speaker 2>that concerned about the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are you get kicked off.</v>

1329
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:26.820
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there are certain things I</v>

1330
01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:29.250
<v Speaker 2>sucked up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a core thing that she's</v>

1331
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:32.000
<v Speaker 2>like a terrible person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it,</v>

1332
01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty hard to get me to that place</v>

1333
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 2>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always need a little bit more proof of</v>

1334
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:39.860
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But certainly she represents someone who</v>

1335
01:02:39.861 --> 01:02:43.050
<v Speaker 2>is dishonest though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a real problem when you don't</v>

1336
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:48.051
<v Speaker 2>have a leader of this incredible country</v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone who's clearly dishonest and</v>

1337
01:02:48.661 --> 01:02:50.940
<v Speaker 2>it's been dishonest for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when they talk to her about the</v>

1338
01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.950
<v Speaker 2>emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every interview she gave about it,</v>

1339
01:02:52.951 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 2>she would give varying responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them were dishonest.</v>

1340
01:02:55.981 --> 01:03:00.981
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it was not based on facts when</v>
<v Speaker 2>she compared what she said Komi said to</v>

1341
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:04.260
<v Speaker 2>her during the investigation versus what</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comi was saying publicly,</v>

1342
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:05.460
<v Speaker 2>they were totally different things.</v>

1343
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1344
01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a lot of politics</v>

1345
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:13.500
<v Speaker 2>that's really bad and really dirty and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know enough on each specific thing</v>

1346
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Speaker 2>that have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1347
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:19.731
<v Speaker 2>a position on each thing that she said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do feel like there are people who</v>

1348
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:25.131
<v Speaker 2>are playing the game with service in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and maybe they're getting dirty or</v>

1349
01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:29.190
<v Speaker 2>making mistakes with service in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there are people like trump</v>

1350
01:03:29.191 --> 01:03:31.440
<v Speaker 2>that I really don't understand why he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1351
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:36.740
<v Speaker 2>And His general philosophy is let the</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart rich people get richer and</v>

1352
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 2>something nice might happen for you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so dishonest on a level that you</v>

1353
01:03:43.261 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 2>can't compare it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so,</v>

1354
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean he admits that he's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1355
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fully with you on this.</v>

1356
01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:54.791
<v Speaker 2>But whenever people criticize trump or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever the people talk about Hillary</v>

1357
01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:57.930
<v Speaker 2>rather the f one of the first things</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do is say trump is worse.</v>

1358
01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:00.750
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of like talking about how weird</v>

1359
01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1360
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.440
<v Speaker 2>she's such an non ideal candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she was such a terrible candidate.</v>

1361
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:11.690
<v Speaker 2>She didn't believe in gay marriage until</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013 you mean 2013 she was publicly</v>

1362
01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:15.420
<v Speaker 2>stating that gay marriage should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should not be legal,</v>

1363
01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:17.790
<v Speaker 2>that a marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a legal marriage should be between a man</v>

1364
01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:19.800
<v Speaker 2>and a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And clearly for only political reasons,</v>

1365
01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:22.080
<v Speaker 2>like she obviously had exact issue with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it at all.</v>

1366
01:04:22.081 --> 01:04:25.290
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there is a part of politics</v>

1367
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:26.940
<v Speaker 2>where people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1368
01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:31.560
<v Speaker 2>like say my position was evolving on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>

1369
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your position wasn't evolving.</v>

1370
01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:36.270
<v Speaker 2>You just weren't fighting for what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually believe.</v>

1371
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Obama took a while to make big moves on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1372
01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:45.830
<v Speaker 2>But I still think at core people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to figure out the system</v>

1373
01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 2>to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't say I understand what trump</v>

1374
01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:54.180
<v Speaker 2>has in this for other than to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered the greatest winner of all</v>

1375
01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:54.961
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1376
01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he really wanted to be</v>

1377
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:00.540
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was doing it sort of boost</v>

1378
01:05:00.541 --> 01:05:04.950
<v Speaker 2>his brand and along the way he lost the</v>
<v Speaker 2>television show right when he's doing</v>

1379
01:05:04.951 --> 01:05:06.330
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build that wall shit.</v>

1380
01:05:06.331 --> 01:05:09.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but running the wall just got 10 feet</v>

1381
01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:11.640
<v Speaker 2>higher and NBC was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you man,</v>

1382
01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.980
<v Speaker 2>we're canceling your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they did that,</v>

1383
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:15.360
<v Speaker 2>I think he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1384
01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:16.980
<v Speaker 2>well I'm really going to be fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

1385
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And he kept going</v>

1386
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>and going and going and then he won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems to me like the whole</v>

1387
01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>thing was started almost as a publicity</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>

1388
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>like a fun thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if his people said that there was a</v>

1389
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>woman in publicity for him who left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the only person I knew who left</v>

1390
01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>the campaign for this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot her name,</v>

1391
01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:36.110
<v Speaker 1>but it was very public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't a it.</v>

1392
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>She said it publicly that when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

1393
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>the plan was to come in second to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brand,</v>

1394
01:05:43.421 --> 01:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>to get some fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make some statements about what he</v>

1395
01:05:46.301 --> 01:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>believes with no belief that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that he would do better than</v>

1396
01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>second in the Republican primaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the woman said as it became</v>

1397
01:05:54.911 --> 01:05:57.310
<v Speaker 1>clear that they had a really good shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of winning.</v>

1398
01:05:57.311 --> 01:05:57.941
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1399
01:05:57.941 --> 01:06:02.941
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in it for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I find fascinating to watch is</v>

1400
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:08.370
<v Speaker 1>trump's slowly getting comfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 1>power as as he thinks he's figuring it</v>

1401
01:06:09.371 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 1>out is interesting.</v>

1402
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:12.483
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1403
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean even the Jerrod cushner thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of hilarious.</v>

1404
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 1>You have this son in law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you have a blind spot that anyone</v>

1405
01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:22.000
<v Speaker 1>in the world thinks it's weird that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>give your son in law are real estate</v>

1406
01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:25.810
<v Speaker 1>developers so much power and he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>care at all because he doesn't trust</v>

1407
01:06:25.811 --> 01:06:28.720
<v Speaker 1>anybody except like four people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got to give them all the power,</v>

1408
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:33.430
<v Speaker 1>but he puts them in charge of fixing</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything wrong with the infrastructure</v>

1409
01:06:33.431 --> 01:06:38.170
<v Speaker 1>of governments and the Middle East and</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three other things.</v>

1410
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And trump doesn't understand how insane</v>
<v Speaker 1>that appears.</v>

1411
01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:47.461
<v Speaker 1>And also how each task is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is my son when he's going to</v>

1412
01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:52.921
<v Speaker 1>fix government and the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the type of guy that doesn't realize,</v>

1413
01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>well maybe there's one person for each</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those jobs is,</v>

1414
01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 1>that's where I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1415
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:00.850
<v Speaker 1>he's full out crazy.</v>

1416
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Because who would even do that to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>son in law?</v>

1417
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe his son in law is a pain in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

1418
01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:08.230
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking kid thinks he could do</v>

1419
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:08.831
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1420
01:07:08.831 --> 01:07:11.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the worst job ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go fix government.</v>

1421
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Go fix the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1422
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to prove my worth to you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ray Ban Sunglasses and his preppy</v>

1423
01:07:19.871 --> 01:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

1424
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:25.890
<v Speaker 1>it's become so comical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1425
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:30.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating thing because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>both terrifying and comical.</v>

1426
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Like if this was a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too broad and you wouldn't believe</v>

1427
01:07:34.211 --> 01:07:36.400
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would just go to much.</v>

1428
01:07:36.401 --> 01:07:40.690
<v Speaker 1>It's happening in every scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many crazy thoughts and what I</v>

1429
01:07:40.691 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 1>guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I wonder,</v>

1430
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe you have an opinion about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1431
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:46.480
<v Speaker 1>There are people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1432
01:07:46.481 --> 01:07:50.890
<v Speaker 1>it is the destruction of truth when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make these lies up all day long,</v>

1433
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:56.310
<v Speaker 1>that you changed the definition of truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even people's ability to decide what</v>

1434
01:07:56.831 --> 01:08:01.831
<v Speaker 1>they think is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a philosophy that someone like</v>

1435
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:07.291
<v Speaker 1>bannon is executing in the White House</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something that happens randomly and,</v>

1436
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is organic out of them?</v>

1437
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a real good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1438
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:16.730
<v Speaker 1>there's always the concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolute power corrupts absolutely.</v>

1439
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 3>And knowing that you're in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a competition,</v>

1440
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.430
<v Speaker 3>knowing that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1441
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:27.890
<v Speaker 3>there's people trying to knock you down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're in this position of power and</v>

1442
01:08:27.891 --> 01:08:31.550
<v Speaker 3>you're shoring up your defenses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's a lot of weird stuff</v>

1443
01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:35.600
<v Speaker 3>that goes on whenever you're the winning</v>
<v Speaker 3>team and you realize you're being</v>

1444
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 3>attacked at all angles by this other</v>
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>

1445
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got this guy who's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>head guys,</v>

1446
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.130
<v Speaker 3>a fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got fake hair.</v>

1447
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 3>He puts a spray Tan on every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out there as his eyes are white.</v>

1448
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:49.940
<v Speaker 3>No one tells him his face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his orange.</v>

1449
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:53.900
<v Speaker 3>He's saying insane shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He contradicts himself all the time.</v>

1450
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 3>He lies all the time about numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always bragging about how well his</v>

1451
01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 3>ratings are and how shows do really well</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everybody knows he watches the</v>

1452
01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:05.690
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy stuff that you just don't</v>

1453
01:09:05.691 --> 01:09:09.950
<v Speaker 3>expect from someone who's in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>position of president of the United</v>

1454
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:10.100
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

1455
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.260
<v Speaker 3>I think almost all bets are off at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1456
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing that I find</v>
<v Speaker 3>promising about this,</v>

1457
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.050
<v Speaker 3>that people are so upset by how fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up this it is.</v>

1458
01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:20.870
<v Speaker 3>This is that they're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>politically active and that they're</v>

1459
01:09:20.871 --> 01:09:23.120
<v Speaker 3>going to realize like there's some real</v>
<v Speaker 3>holes in the system,</v>

1460
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.420
<v Speaker 3>like the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the president shouldn't just be</v>

1461
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:30.590
<v Speaker 3>able to fire the head of the FBI because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't like the investigation like of</v>

1462
01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:32.740
<v Speaker 3>yourself sane and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1463
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:36.320
<v Speaker 3>and sessions recused himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can fire the guy investigating</v>

1464
01:09:36.321 --> 01:09:37.430
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Insane.</v>

1465
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:38.840
<v Speaker 3>It's all insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1466
01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:43.841
<v Speaker 3>I guess what my fear would be is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it just swings back the other way,</v>

1467
01:09:46.401 --> 01:09:47.960
<v Speaker 3>like you could just swing left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1468
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.730
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1469
01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:53.730
<v Speaker 3>But are any institutional protections</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were put in place because it just</v>

1470
01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:57.500
<v Speaker 3>swings back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like for instance say like we don't,</v>

1471
01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an expert in healthcare,</v>

1472
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:03.380
<v Speaker 3>but let's assume it's just a shit storm.</v>

1473
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:04.191
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in,</v>

1474
01:10:04.191 --> 01:10:08.240
<v Speaker 3>in a year or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever millions of people are losing</v>

1475
01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:10.310
<v Speaker 3>the healthcare and everyday you're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging about hundreds of people who</v>

1476
01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:11.960
<v Speaker 3>have cancer who can't pay for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>

1477
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 3>What happens in this country?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do People get mad at the Republicans?</v>

1478
01:10:17.001 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Did they vote them out or to somehow not</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough sick people?</v>

1479
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.840
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough sick people to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>the change.</v>

1480
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:27.590
<v Speaker 3>I think there's so many issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many issues that like where</v>

1481
01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:29.510
<v Speaker 3>do you draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you draw the line at them?</v>

1482
01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Taking the teeth out of the EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what they're done.</v>

1483
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Environmental Protection Agency is</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that track global warming,</v>

1485
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.271
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1486
01:10:38.271 --> 01:10:40.760
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're stopping funding for all these</v>

1487
01:10:40.761 --> 01:10:43.520
<v Speaker 3>different initiatives and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different programs and all these</v>

1488
01:10:43.521 --> 01:10:46.880
<v Speaker 3>different studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to figure out what the</v>

1489
01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:48.380
<v Speaker 3>fuck is going on at the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like that,</v>

1490
01:10:48.381 --> 01:10:52.770
<v Speaker 3>that the stop all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we really need is Enron and Exxon,</v>

1491
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:55.400
<v Speaker 3>all these different companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big conglomerates,</v>

1492
01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:57.140
<v Speaker 3>big corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to drill,</v>

1493
01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.210
<v Speaker 3>we need to drill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to frack,</v>

1494
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:00.800
<v Speaker 3>we need to go over where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1495
01:11:00.801 --> 01:11:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Alaska and we're in the Antarctic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get in that ground,</v>

1496
01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:06.380
<v Speaker 3>pull that oil out and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1497
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:07.310
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1498
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 3>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you hear the healthcare shit.</v>

1499
01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's scary too.</v>

1500
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 3>And then you hear the Russian shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's scary.</v>

1501
01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:15.030
<v Speaker 2>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1502
01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 2>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different things to be</v>

1503
01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:21.270
<v Speaker 2>scared about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the people who don't have</v>

1504
01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:24.930
<v Speaker 2>cancer don't have diseases are really</v>
<v Speaker 2>considering all this healthcare stuff.</v>

1505
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of those things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

1506
01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Once you have a health issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you realize how fuck the system is</v>

1507
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:32.970
<v Speaker 2>and especially if you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>money to take care of it,</v>

1508
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1509
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.050
<v Speaker 2>like our medical system in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>

1510
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 2>it's not the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the best doctors.</v>

1511
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:43.350
<v Speaker 2>We certainly have the best surgeons and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have some pretty amazing innovative</v>

1512
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:45.550
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to like the,</v>

1513
01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:49.440
<v Speaker 2>the system itself for like when you find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how much people have to pay when</v>

1514
01:11:49.441 --> 01:11:51.240
<v Speaker 2>they go to the doctor and how about you</v>
<v Speaker 2>eve,</v>

1515
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 2>you have insurance but the insurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>only covers so much.</v>

1516
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:54.900
<v Speaker 2>You still have to pay more.</v>

1517
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:55.251
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By,</v>

1518
01:11:55.251 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 2>by my mom died of ovarian cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just remember going through those</v>

1519
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:03.900
<v Speaker 2>bills and there was a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental medicine that potentially</v>

1520
01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:07.170
<v Speaker 2>could save her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you didn't know if insurance would</v>

1521
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:12.171
<v Speaker 2>say this is the type of approach that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are willing to pay for.</v>

1522
01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anything you needed to do,</v>

1523
01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to prove you needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone says you needed a new cat scan</v>

1524
01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.800
<v Speaker 2>and you've had to that ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have to go to a war to say why</v>

1525
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 2>you need it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1526
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:29.370
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember crunchers,</v>

1527
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm just always fascinated that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't line up for people.</v>

1528
01:12:32.461 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Like you say you love the outdoors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you love hunting.</v>

1529
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Well don't you love the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1530
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And so why are you not really pissed or</v>
<v Speaker 2>trumps going to build a wall and he's</v>

1531
01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:44.490
<v Speaker 2>going to take a lot of people's land</v>
<v Speaker 2>away to build the wall?</v>

1532
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was the big issue for all</v>

1533
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:48.090
<v Speaker 2>of these militia groups don't mess with</v>
<v Speaker 2>our land.</v>

1534
01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's always going to do is</v>

1535
01:12:50.151 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 2>going to take land away to build the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>

1536
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:55.050
<v Speaker 2>The only way to build the wall in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those plots of land,</v>

1537
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of private lands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>

1538
01:12:57.331 --> 01:13:00.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a jagged path when you're</v>

1539
01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:03.170
<v Speaker 2>building that wall and you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1540
01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:06.870
<v Speaker 2>you have to take away a lot of people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lands to pull that off.</v>

1541
01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what scares me the most about</v>

1542
01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:14.750
<v Speaker 2>America's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an ilogic to people's opinions.</v>

1543
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I think there's too many variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's too many things to,</v>

1544
01:13:17.341 --> 01:13:19.890
<v Speaker 2>for people to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think people work all day and then</v>

1545
01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:22.830
<v Speaker 2>they have hobbies and families and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things they enjoy doing and they don't</v>

1546
01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.450
<v Speaker 2>have the time to really sit.</v>

1547
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean each one of those issues would</v>
<v Speaker 2>require a full time job all day long</v>

1548
01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.750
<v Speaker 2>investigating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exacerbating it,</v>

1549
01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:34.290
<v Speaker 2>discussing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Flynn's ties to Russia or</v>

1550
01:13:34.291 --> 01:13:38.540
<v Speaker 2>what session knows and how many times</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he speak to the Russians or what</v>

1551
01:13:38.541 --> 01:13:40.620
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did jared cushner actually do in</v>

1552
01:13:40.621 --> 01:13:42.710
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is he doing in the overlap?</v>

1553
01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Cause each one of those is a full time</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

1554
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:48.150
<v Speaker 2>What does he sing to Netanyahu alone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room.</v>

1555
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.630
<v Speaker 2>How do they let him do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like such a Dork.</v>

1556
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the pictures of him with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bulletproof vest on overseas?</v>

1557
01:13:54.961 --> 01:13:57.810
<v Speaker 2>And he's hanging around with the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers and he's sitting there with his</v>

1558
01:13:57.811 --> 01:14:02.370
<v Speaker 2>ray bans on masking tape with his name</v>
<v Speaker 2>magic markered on it.</v>

1559
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.760
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a comedy.</v>

1560
01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:10.000
<v Speaker 2>And I have to say as a creative person</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to be at the Wilbur Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1573
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.640
<v Speaker 2>And so it's very short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like three,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

1586
01:15:05.861 --> 01:15:08.280
<v Speaker 2>I like when I hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate when I hear someone taping one</v>

1587
01:15:08.281 --> 01:15:08.861
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1588
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:09.131
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1589
01:15:09.131 --> 01:15:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I could panic and ruin one show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1590
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 2>I can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I did only two shifts,</v>

1591
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I can panic the first show and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1592
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:19.390
<v Speaker 2>now I only have one show to get it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>panic again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1595
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my turn.</v>

1596
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

1597
01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done something like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>

1598
01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Basically the HBO Young Comedian Special</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1992 with the Ray Romano,</v>

1599
01:15:34.331 --> 01:15:36.670
<v Speaker 2>the guy who got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could have your career.</v>

1600
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.533
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1601
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:40.090
<v Speaker 2>He got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somebody else could take it.</v>

1602
01:15:40.091 --> 01:15:42.370
<v Speaker 2>And then that guy fired and I got two</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

1603
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who is the in between.</v>

1604
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Guy was on the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy on the pilot that was</v>

1605
01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 2>not ray ray got fired and another guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>took his spot and then that guy fired</v>

1606
01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 2>and I took that guy spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll Paul Simms is vicious.</v>

1607
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to get it done right around</v>

1608
01:15:56.150 --> 01:16:01.150
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of in the news radio days</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as a friend of Paul's and Andy</v>

1609
01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that show is a show that holds up</v>

1610
01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:07.180
<v Speaker 2>and is really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I was just happy that there was a</v>

1611
01:16:07.181 --> 01:16:09.550
<v Speaker 2>buffer between me and rang cause I love</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray.</v>

1612
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I would not have wanted to be the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes Ray's job.</v>

1613
01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:16.330
<v Speaker 2>I think ray is one of the first people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell you he probably was not prepared</v>

1614
01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:19.890
<v Speaker 2>as an actor at that exact moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the wrong gig forum?</v>

1615
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Everybody loves Raymond was the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay.</v>

1616
01:16:22.841 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let him write for himself and let him</v>

1617
01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:28.000
<v Speaker 2>figure it all out and become obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

1618
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.360
<v Speaker 2>He's such a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1619
01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.470

<v Speaker 2>Ray Romano was like one of the nicest</v>

1620
01:16:32.471 --> 01:16:34.690
<v Speaker 2>people I've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so good in our movie.</v>

1624
01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:44.770

<v Speaker 2>everything he's learned as an actor and</v>

1625
01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:46.780
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a and a person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They asked me to do it a year ago and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1646
01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:44.201
<v Speaker 2>original room and you were in the main</v>
<v Speaker 2>room and I could hear the place rocking</v>

1647
01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:50.080
<v Speaker 2>from the stage of the original room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe bike ride was too quiet that I</v>

1648
01:17:50.301 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 2>could hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could hear your last and you just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>be mediocre at it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the same business as you and</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I have to be able to be proud of</v>

1655
01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:13.790
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I did a largo show that he was on and I</v>

1659
01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:27.230
<v Speaker 2>was just watching him from the side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stage and just his level of</v>

1660
01:18:27.231 --> 01:18:29.690
<v Speaker 2>intensity is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:33.440
<v Speaker 2>in a weird way it's so professional and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I notice it with you the other night too</v>

1662
01:18:33.441 --> 01:18:37.580
<v Speaker 2>that you could get yourself in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>state where you care so much and you're</v>

1663
01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:42.581
<v Speaker 2>so passionate and it requires so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and focus to get to that place,</v>

1664
01:18:43.611 --> 01:18:48.080
<v Speaker 2>to perform with that passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just really impressive cause like</v>

1665
01:18:48.081 --> 01:18:50.350
<v Speaker 2>for me I can just get tired and starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>tearing a night.</v>

1666
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:52.610
<v Speaker 2>How did it get tired?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Halfway through like,</v>

1667
01:18:52.611 --> 01:18:56.270
<v Speaker 2>oh like it's just felt a wave of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like after you eat a big meal and you</v>

1668
01:18:56.271 --> 01:18:59.180
<v Speaker 2>just get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it just hit you eight minutes.</v>

1669
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:03.140
<v Speaker 2>What I'm always trying to accomplish is</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get out whatever I'm trying to</v>

1670
01:19:03.141 --> 01:19:06.230
<v Speaker 2>talk about with the most power that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can like the most.</v>

1671
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the best way to do it is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best way to do it.</v>

1672
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Slow and calm and let people soak in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea or is the best way to do it to be</v>

1673
01:19:14.781 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 2>intense and like what is like the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertaining way that I would be</v>

1674
01:19:19.581 --> 01:19:23.300
<v Speaker 2>engaging this material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure whatever that is and and fuck</v>

1675
01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:26.490
<v Speaker 2>with it and moving around and bring it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and bring it down.</v>

1676
01:19:26.491 --> 01:19:29.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>store is such a great place to focus on</v>

1677
01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.440
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff because there's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many killers because of the standards</v>

1678
01:19:33.441 --> 01:19:37.790
<v Speaker 2>are so high that you have to really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to be on point and it's</v>

1679
01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:41.930
<v Speaker 2>packed every night you go to the comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the main room would use it as be</v>

1680
01:19:41.931 --> 01:19:46.760
<v Speaker 2>desolate like four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sold out like it's vegas every</v>

1681
01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.960
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every night I walk in there like I got</v>

1682
01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:48.950
<v Speaker 2>some new jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1683
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.980
<v Speaker 2>can I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many new jokes can I do when this is</v>

1684
01:19:51.981 --> 01:19:56.981
<v Speaker 2>a big sold out excited crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which changed the face of comedy in La.</v>

1685
01:19:57.261 --> 01:19:59.570
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean comedy in La is a different thing</v>

1686
01:19:59.571 --> 01:20:01.130
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last few years.</v>

1687
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:05.210
<v Speaker 2>It's also funny how a place like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store,</v>

1688
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.220
<v Speaker 2>you know our friend Adam,</v>

<v Speaker 3>town wants to run to that club.</v>

1692
01:20:16.321 --> 01:20:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both comedians and the audience because</v>

1693
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Adam does such a good job looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>opening up that back bar where you gave</v>

1694
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:26.250
<v Speaker 3>us a place where the public can't go on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a comics can go and hang out.</v>

1695
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.400
<v Speaker 3>That was giant where there was a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>to chill and hang out.</v>

1696
01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.360
<v Speaker 3>People with like you'd be sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Ron Wyden,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody anymore.</v>

1706
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally don't know anybody that just</v>

1707
01:20:54.871 --> 01:20:58.380
<v Speaker 3>the idea of being a part of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>community and it is a community of</v>

1708
01:20:58.381 --> 01:21:00.720
<v Speaker 3>people that are really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1709
01:21:00.721 --> 01:21:02.250
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really funny.</v>

1710
01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:07.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think generally incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>supportive community to each other.</v>

1711
01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1712
01:21:08.371 --> 01:21:12.510
<v Speaker 3>Well I think especially now there's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many opportunities I don't think people</v>

1713
01:21:12.511 --> 01:21:16.320
<v Speaker 3>feel like is starved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a famine mentality</v>

1714
01:21:16.321 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 3>that was going on way back in the day</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was everybody competing for</v>

1715
01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:23.660
<v Speaker 3>tonight show spots and then every now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then someone got an hbo special and</v>

1716
01:21:23.661 --> 01:21:26.220
<v Speaker 3>it was Holy Shit there was not that many</v>
<v Speaker 3>hbo specials.</v>

1717
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:31.290
<v Speaker 3>But other than that you had to do talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows and you had to do like a few</v>

1718
01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:34.440
<v Speaker 3>minutes on a talk show or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you were like a Richard Jenny who</v>

1719
01:21:34.441 --> 01:21:38.280
<v Speaker 3>thrived in that format and you could do</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 tonight show things and then fill up</v>

1720
01:21:38.281 --> 01:21:39.420
<v Speaker 3>arenas because of that.</v>

1721
01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:44.490
<v Speaker 3>But for most people it was a scratch and</v>
<v Speaker 3>claw environment and people were</v>

1722
01:21:44.491 --> 01:21:48.600
<v Speaker 3>fighting to try to get a sitcom and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting to try to get movie roles and</v>

1723
01:21:48.601 --> 01:21:50.280
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was not a lot.</v>

1724
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:53.280
<v Speaker 3>But now because of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of Youtube,</v>

1725
01:21:53.281 --> 01:21:56.280
<v Speaker 3>because of social media and then a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix,</v>

1726
01:21:56.281 --> 01:21:59.260
<v Speaker 3>which was giant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much opportunity like,</v>

1727
01:21:59.330 --> 01:22:03.060
<v Speaker 3>and the comedians have also found way</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of an audience.</v>

1728
01:22:03.061 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 3>There's way more audience out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people realize like,</v>

1729
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Silverman has a new netflix</v>

1730
01:22:07.771 --> 01:22:08.461
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>

1731
01:22:08.461 --> 01:22:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Jim Jefferies has a new netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll look bill burroughs and who?</v>

1732
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just keeps going and going and going</v>

1733
01:22:13.531 --> 01:22:14.490
<v Speaker 3>and going and going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1734
01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:17.220
<v Speaker 3>it's almost unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember when I was a kid,</v>

1735
01:22:17.221 --> 01:22:19.140
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like Robert Klein would have</v>

1736
01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:22.350
<v Speaker 3>a special every couple of years now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then George Carlin every couple of</v>

1737
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:23.910
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't give the hours too many</v>

1738
01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:24.630
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1739
01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:28.110
<v Speaker 3>And there were so many people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably could have done a netflix</v>

1740
01:22:28.111 --> 01:22:29.370
<v Speaker 3>special back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1741
01:22:29.371 --> 01:22:31.350
<v Speaker 3>And they didn't have the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never got the shot.</v>

1742
01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1743
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:36.210
<v Speaker 3>they just sort of stayed at a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>state in their career forever.</v>

1744
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:37.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1745
01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:38.880
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an amazing,</v>

1746
01:22:38.881 --> 01:22:40.890
<v Speaker 3>amazing time for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:22:40.891 --> 01:22:41.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1748
01:22:41.731 --> 01:22:42.600
<v Speaker 3>I watch people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1749
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:43.630
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1750
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.080
<v Speaker 3>people are fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1751
01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I'd really like watch people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching Ray Romano the other</v>

1752
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.390
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his act was just monstrous.</v>

1753
01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so strong.</v>

1754
01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the Andrew Santina at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>store?</v>

1755
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>

1756
01:22:56.210 --> 01:22:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to end up here.</v>

1757
01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so good.</v>

1758
01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

1759
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:02.820
<v Speaker 3>it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think about it too much because</v>

1760
01:23:02.821 --> 01:23:05.170
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I think there's so many people</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do it?</v>

1761
01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>But I'm trying to</v>

1762
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.190
<v Speaker 1>make it very much about the audience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and that,</v>

1763
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:13.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I make movies and do tv that my</v>

1764
01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:18.310
<v Speaker 1>standup career really is just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to hang out with everybody and</v>

1765
01:23:18.311 --> 01:23:21.130
<v Speaker 1>my relationship with that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd that night.</v>

1766
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't need it to pay the rent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could do it from a very pure place</v>

1767
01:23:24.761 --> 01:23:28.270
<v Speaker 1>cause it's just about these</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>

1768
01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:29.290
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1769
01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it frees me up to not be nervous and</v>

1770
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:35.350
<v Speaker 1>then I can be a little more daring</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not going to going to sink</v>

1771
01:23:35.351 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 1>me if anything goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it enhances your</v>

1772
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:41.210
<v Speaker 1>ability to make movies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it enhance your perspective?</v>

1773
01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny,</v>

1774
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you don't talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly to the crowd,</v>

1775
01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you get stale as to what people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about.</v>

1776
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell,</v>

1777
01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just when I bring up certain topics,</v>

1778
01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:59.560
<v Speaker 1>just what people's concerns are and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens unconsciously.</v>

1779
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what people find funny these</v>

1780
01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.910
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what people are freaking out</v>

1781
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:05.650
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what people are happy about.</v>

1782
01:24:05.651 --> 01:24:07.810
<v Speaker 1>And when you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just alone in a room with your</v>

1783
01:24:07.811 --> 01:24:09.720
<v Speaker 1>editor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just sitting in it with you</v>

1784
01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.200
<v Speaker 1>sitting with one dude for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1785
01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:18.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think you're connecting to some,</v>

1786
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:19.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1787
01:24:19.001 --> 01:24:19.250
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1788
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:21.610
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creativity of the universe because</v>

1789
01:24:21.611 --> 01:24:25.870
<v Speaker 1>you're in spaces with a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of other creative people and</v>

1790
01:24:25.871 --> 01:24:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you're hooking into creativity on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1791
01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered how comedy writers</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't do standup can do it.</v>

1792
01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they know?</v>

1793
01:24:34.841 --> 01:24:37.270
<v Speaker 1>It's funny like how do they know what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're guessing?</v>

1794
01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird to write jokes,</v>

1795
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 1>make a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then two years later find out if</v>

1796
01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:42.750
<v Speaker 1>they're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our,</v>

1797
01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:43.690
<v Speaker 1>that's why people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1798
01:24:43.691 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 1>why do you have so much improv?</v>

1799
01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't want to be in an editing</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

1800
01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Put in the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote realize it sucks and then go,</v>

1801
01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:53.470
<v Speaker 1>do we have any other jokes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the editor Says No.</v>

1802
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always want like I it with any</v>

1803
01:24:56.621 --> 01:24:57.490
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always go,</v>

1804
01:24:57.491 --> 01:24:59.110
<v Speaker 1>well that's where the joke supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1805
01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Here's my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get eight more and low and then</v>

1806
01:25:02.481 --> 01:25:05.770
<v Speaker 1>we'll move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never think like when there's people</v>

1807
01:25:05.771 --> 01:25:08.740
<v Speaker 1>like the Coen brothers and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbatim,</v>

1808
01:25:08.741 --> 01:25:10.650
<v Speaker 1>you can't change a comma when they shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1809
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Is that what is good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is with them?</v>

1810
01:25:12.370 --> 01:25:17.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like a play and I respect it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do not have the courage to assume</v>

1811
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:22.540
<v Speaker 1>when I hit editing that I am such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius that I will not have fucked up</v>

1812
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:25.720
<v Speaker 1>any of this in the writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a weird kind of comedy though.</v>

1813
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:28.660
<v Speaker 1>They're comedy is so quirky and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

1814
01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess maybe it's just that,</v>

1815
01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.100
<v Speaker 1>that purity of vision that they have.</v>

1816
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sticking to that script.</v>

1817
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1818
01:25:36.401 --> 01:25:37.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1819
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:39.850
<v Speaker 1>a bomb back does that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't change any of it.</v>

1820
01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:43.090
<v Speaker 1>But I always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if,</v>

1821
01:25:43.091 --> 01:25:45.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if an actor's a said Ray Romano was on</v>

1822
01:25:45.281 --> 01:25:48.520
<v Speaker 1>the set of the big sick and he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about his feelings and he has the scene,</v>

1823
01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.990
<v Speaker 1>if I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1824

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1825
01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:52.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Showalter,</v>

1826
01:25:52.561 --> 01:25:53.650
<v Speaker 1>director of that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1827
01:25:53.651 --> 01:25:54.760
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them do another one.</v>

1828
01:25:54.761 --> 01:25:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's just let him change it this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tell him to hit the same idea.</v>

1829
01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the time he beats the joke at the</v>

1830
01:26:01.661 --> 01:26:02.494
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1831
01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>If you have the right cast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

1832
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 2>that was what sims did on Newsradio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He led everybody just come up with</v>

1833
01:26:08.871 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 2>better lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big part of why the show works</v>

1834
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:15.290
<v Speaker 2>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we all felt really invested in</v>

1835
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:18.740
<v Speaker 2>the creative process and that's so rare</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1836
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I remember it was shandling would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that on a [inaudible] should.</v>

1837
01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:25.700
<v Speaker 2>They would rehearse for several days and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that rehearsal people were allowed to</v>

1838
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:27.890
<v Speaker 2>screw around and if something good came</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1839
01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Gary would would write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Hartman was the funniest.</v>

1840
01:26:31.851 --> 01:26:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Phil Hartman really was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1841
01:26:34.551 --> 01:26:38.000
<v Speaker 2>when you really make the list of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>funniest people of all time,</v>

1842
01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:41.570
<v Speaker 2>he's just so high up on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a remarkable thing.</v>

1843
01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I would go to tapings of that show and</v>
<v Speaker 2>SNL tapings and at one point I was</v>

1844
01:26:45.441 --> 01:26:49.820
<v Speaker 2>talking about writing an Hbo special</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him and I don't know if there's</v>

1845
01:26:49.821 --> 01:26:53.810
<v Speaker 2>ever been anyone more challenge in more</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways than him now.</v>

1846
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:55.040
<v Speaker 2>He was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

1847
01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:59.000
<v Speaker 2>He really was incredibly disciplined to</v>
<v Speaker 2>why when I was on the set with them,</v>

1848
01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.950
<v Speaker 2>he was becoming a pilot and so he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of scenes he would be</v>

1849
01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:07.670
<v Speaker 2>reading flight books and reading books</v>
<v Speaker 2>on aviation and,</v>

1850
01:27:07.671 --> 01:27:10.190
<v Speaker 2>and writing notes and taking notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

1851
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:14.810
<v Speaker 2>he was so organized like his scripts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would put them all in a binder,</v>

1852
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:17.120
<v Speaker 2>he would take the script immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put three punch,</v>

1853
01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.890
<v Speaker 2>put it in a binder and he would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>tabs for each of his scenes and each tab</v>

1854
01:27:21.891 --> 01:27:23.760
<v Speaker 2>had a different color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is scene one,</v>

1855
01:27:23.761 --> 01:27:25.610
<v Speaker 2>scene two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would have everything set up like</v>

1856
01:27:25.611 --> 01:27:29.750
<v Speaker 2>that and have this line's highlighted</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would practice them and have them</v>

1857
01:27:29.751 --> 01:27:32.030
<v Speaker 2>down to like a razor sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1858
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.150
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a really,</v>

1859
01:27:35.151 --> 01:27:36.650
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting guy.</v>

1860
01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 2>A very unique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever met anybody like</v>

1861
01:27:38.841 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 2>him because he also came out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1862
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:44.380
<v Speaker 2>he was a designer and scientist.</v>

1863
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did album covers and stuff.</v>

1864
01:27:46.671 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said that he got Saturday night</v>

1865
01:27:48.381 --> 01:27:53.381
<v Speaker 2>live because he went in for the audition</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was retiring because his career</v>

1866
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:55.370
<v Speaker 2>hadn't worked out the way he wanted it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1867
01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And then someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to go in for snl?</v>

1868
01:27:57.261 --> 01:28:01.460
<v Speaker 2>And he was so ready to be done that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had an amazing audition cause he assumed</v>

1869
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically it was like,</v>

1870
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.740
<v Speaker 2>fuck this business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's the moment when he was</v>

1871
01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:08.570
<v Speaker 2>in his purest funny itself and just got</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1872
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting guy,</v>

1873
01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was blackmailed while we were on the</v>

1874
01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:17.180
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a while we're on the show,</v>

1875
01:28:17.181 --> 01:28:22.181
<v Speaker 2>he and his wife actually had went to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>strip club and this was like 1997,</v>

1876
01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 2>97,</v>
<v Speaker 2>98,</v>

1877
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:28.970
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1878
01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this some asshole at a strip club,</v>

1879
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:35.930
<v Speaker 2>got a video camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought in a video camera and filmed</v>

1880
01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:41.020
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking video camera back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he filmed phil and his wife at a</v>

1881
01:28:42.021 --> 01:28:44.510
<v Speaker 2>strip club laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just having a couple of drinks.</v>

1882
01:28:44.511 --> 01:28:48.890
<v Speaker 2>And I think phil got a lap dance and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife got a lap dance and then they laugh</v>

1883
01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.800
<v Speaker 2>and he this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1884
01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:56.380
<v Speaker 2>put a copy of this video tape in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>envelope and nailed it to Phil's garage</v>

1885
01:28:56.961 --> 01:28:58.580
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>

1886
01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:00.920
<v Speaker 2>With a note saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I had Herman's thing.</v>

1887
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It was scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1888
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.590
<v Speaker 3>but it was different because Letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his thing was someone he knew.</v>

1889
01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:07.830
<v Speaker 3>And this was not a guy I knew and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the guy who found out where Phil</v>

1890
01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:11.430
<v Speaker 3>lived and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get this to uh,</v>

1891
01:29:11.431 --> 01:29:14.940
<v Speaker 3>all of the advertisers that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do commercials with and all the</v>

1892
01:29:14.941 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 3>people that you do films with and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to ruin your career unless you</v>

1893
01:29:17.881 --> 01:29:20.220
<v Speaker 3>give me money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call me at this number that I left his</v>

1894
01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:23.520
<v Speaker 3>fucking number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Phil calls the Guy Records the thing</v>

1895
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:25.780
<v Speaker 3>and we did it in the room with me and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

1896
01:29:25.781 --> 01:29:28.250

<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna call the guy now we shut.</v>

1897
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:30.510
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

1899
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:35.760
<v Speaker 3>I understand what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to realize like,</v>

1900
01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't have as much money as you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1901
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.380
<v Speaker 3>And I mean this is coming.</v>

1902
01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:43.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't want the tape getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you're making it out like</v>

1903
01:29:43.891 --> 01:29:46.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a bigger deal than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>reasonable number.</v>

1908
01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:56.220
<v Speaker 3>So they come to this reasonable number</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this whole time where he's doing</v>

1909
01:29:56.221 --> 01:29:58.320
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's recording this and he gets it to</v>

1910
01:29:58.321 --> 01:30:02.280
<v Speaker 3>this private investigator guy and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>this asshole meets the private</v>

1911
01:30:02.281 --> 01:30:04.860
<v Speaker 3>investigator thinking he's going to meet</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phil and get paid.</v>

1932
01:30:59.941 --> 01:31:02.090
<v Speaker 3>just give me a little bit of a loan.</v>

1933
01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Phil gives them like $25,000 just</v>

1934
01:31:06.391 --> 01:31:09.660
<v Speaker 3>gives this guy and then the guy calls</v>
<v Speaker 3>him three months later and he asked for</v>

1935
01:31:09.661 --> 01:31:13.080
<v Speaker 3>another 30 and that feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck man,</v>

1936
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:15.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was just almost too nice.</v>

1937
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.250
<v Speaker 3>That's about how it usually goes with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1938
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:18.241
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1939
01:31:18.241 --> 01:31:20.220
<v Speaker 3>You never lend someone money and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

1940
01:31:20.221 --> 01:31:23.340
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You solved all my problems and now I'm</v>

1941
01:31:23.341 --> 01:31:26.280
<v Speaker 3>fine and here's the money back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just anybody money.</v>

1942
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:27.263
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1943
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Did anybody ever pay you back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1944
01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I always to tell this story just because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>

1945
01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:37.320
<v Speaker 3>My friend Dave Raff who manages Pete</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holmes at some point was like</v>

1946
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:40.560
<v Speaker 3>transitioning and starting his own</v>
<v Speaker 3>management company and asked me for some</v>

1947
01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:41.550
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not much,</v>

1948
01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.570
<v Speaker 3>but the only guy who ever paid me back</v>
<v Speaker 3>and quickly.</v>

1949
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that makes sense.</v>

1950
01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:51.000
<v Speaker 3>And it is a great man and is producing</v>
<v Speaker 3>my netflix special.</v>

1951
01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that works.</v>

1952
01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:56.520
<v Speaker 3>But the only guy to ever do what he said</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going to do.</v>

1953
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:58.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always these people that,</v>

1954
01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1955
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.950
<v Speaker 1>once this happens and this is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and I'm going to be making this</v>

1956
01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:04.360
<v Speaker 1>amount of money and don't worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1957
01:32:04.361 --> 01:32:06.370
<v Speaker 1>it's all going to come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just need a little right now.</v>

1958
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said the second people ask for</v>

1959
01:32:08.951 --> 01:32:10.540
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they resent you.</v>

1960
01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And so even if you give people money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mad that they had to ask and</v>

1961
01:32:15.281 --> 01:32:19.060
<v Speaker 1>they kind of hate you because you had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask you,</v>

1962
01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1963
01:32:21.131 --> 01:32:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>

1964
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.580
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly what you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1965
01:32:24.581 --> 01:32:28.780
<v Speaker 1>there's also the people that think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to make it is to get somebody</v>

1966
01:32:28.781 --> 01:32:33.781
<v Speaker 1>else to get you through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta you gotta call on favors,</v>

1967
01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:35.530
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta have connections.</v>

1968
01:32:35.531 --> 01:32:38.860
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get your way through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that that's the way to do it.</v>

1969
01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Somebody gave you a break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1970
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:42.070
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give me a break.</v>

1971
01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Somebody gave you a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1972
01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mentality is so wrong.</v>

1973
01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1974
01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.830
<v Speaker 1>one thing I'm proud of in my career is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really was.</v>

1975
01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I had no ins at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1976
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:54.971
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1977
01:32:54.971 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 1>my parents got divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were both bankrupt.</v>

1978
01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:01.210
<v Speaker 1>I started interviewing comedians from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school radio station at some point</v>

1979
01:33:01.211 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 1>I got Jamie Masada from the laugh</v>
<v Speaker 1>factory,</v>

1980
01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:09.100
<v Speaker 1>the who owns the laugh factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a magazine in the 80s and he</v>

1981
01:33:09.101 --> 01:33:12.100
<v Speaker 1>printed an interview I did with David</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brenner.</v>

1982
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think I did another one with Henny</v>
<v Speaker 1>youngman.</v>

1983
01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Then when I moved here in [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>85,</v>

1984
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:19.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get spots of this laugh</v>

1985
01:33:19.131 --> 01:33:21.580
<v Speaker 1>factory and it was still hard to get up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1986
01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:26.260
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the person who really hooked me up</v>

1987
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:29.350
<v Speaker 1>with Sammy shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1988
01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Same Insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started the comedy store it,</v>

1989
01:33:31.450 --> 01:33:35.080
<v Speaker 1>then he got divorced and Mitzi took it</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and made it the great place it is.</v>

1990
01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:40.150
<v Speaker 1>But he started a comedy room in Marina</v>
<v Speaker 1>del Ray called Sammie's by the shore in</v>

1991
01:33:40.151 --> 01:33:44.350
<v Speaker 1>the back of a fish restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he let me book it.</v>

1992
01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:49.380
<v Speaker 1>And in return I was allowed to go on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I got 40 bucks a week.</v>

1993
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I got stage time for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first year when I didn't know what I was</v>

1994
01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:56.950
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would book that club,</v>

1995
01:33:56.951 --> 01:33:59.710
<v Speaker 1>which also gave me an excuse to call all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comics who I admired.</v>

1996
01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny,</v>

1997
01:34:01.991 --> 01:34:06.580
<v Speaker 1>like there's those people at a key</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment opened the door for you,</v>

1998
01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:10.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because you knew them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just because you're willing to put</v>

1999
01:34:10.481 --> 01:34:12.280
<v Speaker 1>it all the work somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2000
01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:14.170
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting,</v>

2001
01:34:14.171 --> 01:34:16.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sammie's by the shore.</v>

2002
01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I never heard about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the Valley Improv?</v>

2003
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:21.790
<v Speaker 1>They had one in the Hilton in Sherman</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oaks.</v>

2004
01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:23.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't around for that.</v>

2005
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.890
<v Speaker 1>And the year was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like late eighties I wasn't here</v>

2006
01:34:26.891 --> 01:34:29.230
<v Speaker 1>until 94 oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late eighties and this guy,</v>

2007

<v Speaker 1>just the manager.</v>

2008
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Great Young Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where he is.</v>

2009
01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:35.980
<v Speaker 1>He used to say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judd,</v>

2010
01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:36.910
<v Speaker 1>come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait around.</v>

2011
01:34:36.911 --> 01:34:38.320
<v Speaker 1>If somebody doesn't show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put you up.</v>

2012
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:43.690
<v Speaker 1>And I was like 19 years old and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait there all night,</v>

2013
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:45.910
<v Speaker 1>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thrilled to talk to everyone because</v>

2014
01:34:45.911 --> 01:34:48.590
<v Speaker 1>that's what right when Sandler moved to</v>
<v Speaker 1>town and David spade and,</v>

2015
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:51.370
<v Speaker 1>and Schneider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I first met everybody</v>

2016
01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.490
<v Speaker 1>and that guy would put me on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2017
01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the funny thing about a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two or three who,</v>

2018
01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:03.610
<v Speaker 1>who change everything for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is woman Mary parents who was one</v>

2019
01:35:03.651 --> 01:35:07.550
<v Speaker 1>of the heads of universal and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sold her the 40 old virgin and she</v>

2020
01:35:07.551 --> 01:35:08.271
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judd,</v>

2021
01:35:08.271 --> 01:35:12.770
<v Speaker 1>the second you hand in the script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to green light it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I so believe in this idea and you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve.</v>

2023
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.640
<v Speaker 1>And I literally faxed her like page 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 108 and then she called and said,</v>

2024
01:35:21.831 --> 01:35:23.680
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start prepping facts.</v>

2025
01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faxed it.</v>

2026
01:35:25.930 --> 01:35:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2027
01:35:27.351 --> 01:35:28.910
<v Speaker 1>here's my question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2028
01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.760
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk my workout for a second.</v>

2029
01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's Talk My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2030
01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Omega Brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alphabet Alpha right</v>

2031
01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pete Holmes turned me onto the Alpha</v>

2032
01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:47.921
<v Speaker 1>brain and oddly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it completely works 100% and I'm,</v>

2033
01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.210
<v Speaker 3>it's all based on science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2034
01:35:52.211 --> 01:35:54.460
<v Speaker 3>we have double blind placebo controlled</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

2035
01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:57.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not something we invented in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like the,</v>

2036
01:35:57.271 --> 01:36:01.350
<v Speaker 3>the actual nutrients and their response</v>
<v Speaker 3>to human neurotransmitter's.</v>

2037
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:03.900
<v Speaker 3>It's all been documented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have known about nutrition</v>

2038
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:07.670
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] for a long time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always feel like I'm the perfect</v>

2039
01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.120
<v Speaker 1>test case for a product like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most days I go in a room with 11</v>

2040
01:36:14.031 --> 01:36:18.860
<v Speaker 1>writers in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm as tired and it is foggy as you can</v>

2041
01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:20.930
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not drink coffee,</v>

2042
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:22.880
<v Speaker 1>so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't drink coffee at all?</v>

2043
01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>

2044
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:26.800
<v Speaker 1>the only coffee I like his ice blended</v>

<v Speaker 1>started taking that I would completely</v>

2048
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:41.770
<v Speaker 1>wake up and be sharp without like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird caffeine was or sick from it or</v>

<v Speaker 3>like a fucking brutal workout,</v>

2159
01:41:11.831 --> 01:41:15.340
<v Speaker 3>a two mile brutal hill climbing workout</v>
<v Speaker 3>in half hour,</v>

2160
01:41:15.341 --> 01:41:16.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of time,</v>

2162
01:41:18.431 --> 01:41:22.420
<v Speaker 3>like how much time did you put in today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could work out in a bullshit</v>

2163
01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:26.980
<v Speaker 3>manner for two hours and not get nearly</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much done as you can for a half hour.</v>

2164
01:41:26.981 --> 01:41:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Hard just running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2165
01:41:29.010 --> 01:41:30.450
<v Speaker 3>We're like interval training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2166
01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sprints and then relax.</v>

2167
01:41:32.831 --> 01:41:34.780
<v Speaker 3>Then sprints again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2168
01:41:34.781 --> 01:41:38.110
<v Speaker 3>I just think being active and doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>something on a daily basis,</v>

2169
01:41:38.111 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 3>forcing your body to get used to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that it's going to constantly</v>

2170
01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be working constantly being under</v>

2171
01:41:44.171 --> 01:41:45.880
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it just,</v>

2172
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:46.840
<v Speaker 3>it gives you more energy.</v>

2173
01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:50.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have more of a gas tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have more enthusiasm for things.</v>

2174
01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:54.430
<v Speaker 3>That's the scary part about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His theory on exercises.</v>

2175
01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:58.780
<v Speaker 3>You only have so much energy per day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks that exercise uses it up.</v>

2176
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he doesn't ever exercise.</v>

2177
01:42:01.670 --> 01:42:03.380
<v Speaker 3>That's got to come back out of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>someplace.</v>

2178
01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking 70 I mean how was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I come back at him already,</v>

2179
01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:08.810
<v Speaker 3>but he also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>

2180
01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.740
<v Speaker 3>he's not mitigating it stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of it.</v>

2181
01:42:11.741 --> 01:42:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Is Your perspective enhancing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me the most important thing about,</v>

2182
01:42:15.791 --> 01:42:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't think maybe they're not the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>important thing.</v>

2183
01:42:17.861 --> 01:42:21.640
<v Speaker 3>One of the best things about exercise is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it gives me a perspective,</v>

2184
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:23.530
<v Speaker 3>a better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a more enhanced perspective.</v>

2185
01:42:23.531 --> 01:42:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know I'm not coming at it from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>stressful body.</v>

2186
01:42:26.801 --> 01:42:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Like my body is not tense so I can come</v>
<v Speaker 3>at things in a calm way.</v>

2187
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:33.150
<v Speaker 3>I've drained all the bullshit out of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>budget thing.</v>

2188
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Are you doing meditation or what are</v>

2189
01:42:36.281 --> 01:42:38.710
<v Speaker 3>you doing in that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a sensory deprivation tank.</v>

2190
01:42:38.711 --> 01:42:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I do most of my meditation in that</v>

2191
01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:44.470
<v Speaker 3>you do an ultra climb and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a climate and I float.</v>

2192
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2193
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:47.800
<v Speaker 3>That's one of my favorite things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever do it?</v>

2194
01:42:47.850 --> 01:42:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no I couldn't imagine you must</v>

2195
01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:52.900
<v Speaker 3>especially for you because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>working on things all the time.</v>

2196
01:42:52.901 --> 01:42:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go in there with an idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'll go in there with a bit like I</v>

2197
01:42:56.151 --> 01:42:58.180
<v Speaker 3>got this bit that I'm working on right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2198
01:42:58.181 --> 01:43:02.080
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of complicated and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just be sitting there staring at</v>

2199
01:43:02.081 --> 01:43:03.910
<v Speaker 3>the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just thinking about this one bit because</v>

2200
01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to structure it.</v>

2201
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:10.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just super complicated bit and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>go in that tank and I'll just sit there</v>

2202
01:43:10.391 --> 01:43:13.870
<v Speaker 3>for an hour and I'll just try to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>out this bit and tried to figure out if</v>

2203
01:43:13.871 --> 01:43:16.360
<v Speaker 3>there are other angles to it is other</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways to come at it.</v>

2204
01:43:16.450 --> 01:43:20.230
<v Speaker 3>The only confusing thing is when I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an idea in the tank and it seems like I</v>

2205
01:43:20.231 --> 01:43:21.910
<v Speaker 3>got it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get out of the tank and then I</v>

2206
01:43:21.911 --> 01:43:25.000
<v Speaker 3>got to write things down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you need a special pad and the pen.</v>

2207
01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:28.060
<v Speaker 3>I think I need a voice activated</v>
<v Speaker 3>recorder.</v>

2208
01:43:28.061 --> 01:43:29.590
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2209
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:31.810
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what I need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I can just talk.</v>

2210
01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2211
01:43:33.011 --> 01:43:35.530
<v Speaker 3>So I need the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to have the spa.</v>

2212
01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.110
<v Speaker 3>You have a spa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2213
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:39.790
<v Speaker 3>I need a hill to run on hills are good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

2214
01:43:39.791 --> 01:43:43.120
<v Speaker 3>I need more of my audit products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you lift weights at all?</v>

2215
01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2216
01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:48.700
<v Speaker 3>I good idea to do a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something just to keep your body strong.</v>

2217
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body atrophies and</v>

2218
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 2>there's just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're not using it.</v>

2219
01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:58.970
<v Speaker 2>And the only way to keep it from</v>
<v Speaker 2>atrophying is to make sure that you put</v>

2220
01:43:58.971 --> 01:44:01.430
<v Speaker 2>it under stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to lift weights.</v>

2221
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:03.260
<v Speaker 2>It's the only way it keeps your bone</v>
<v Speaker 2>density,</v>

2222
01:44:03.261 --> 01:44:05.540
<v Speaker 2>keeps your tendon strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your muscle strength.</v>

2223
01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.400
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2224
01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:09.770
<v Speaker 2>and otherwise he's got injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get back into reason.</v>

2225
01:44:09.771 --> 01:44:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Arm injuries and shit just starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling apart on,</v>

2226
01:44:12.141 --> 01:44:12.681
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2227
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I've had no injuries due to not doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2228
01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.570
<v Speaker 2>That's how I've been protecting by my</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2229
01:44:17.571 --> 01:44:19.490
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know that that's the thing to do.</v>

2230
01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I remember I always heard about Clint</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eastwood doing that and I met Clint</v>

2231
01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Eastwood when he was like 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know he's like,</v>

2232
01:44:25.011 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 2>he lifts heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his thing.</v>

2233
01:44:26.541 --> 01:44:30.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was a truck at 80.</v>

2234
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2235
01:44:31.911 --> 01:44:33.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like,</v>

2236
01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting things.</v>

2237
01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:41.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like counting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counting hire a trainer.</v>

2238
01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2239
01:44:42.201 --> 01:44:44.600
<v Speaker 2>get someone to devise a program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Have them come to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work you out.</v>

2241

<v Speaker 2>You just show up.</v>

2242
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:50.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could do it in your house.</v>

2243
01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:53.330
<v Speaker 2>They show up at 6:00 AM or whenever it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>come on John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you for the next 45 minutes and</v>

2245
01:44:55.971 --> 01:44:56.840
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just make,</v>

2247
01:44:58.701 --> 01:45:02.600
<v Speaker 2>when you hate that stuff really is tough</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you haven't built your brain to</v>

2248
01:45:02.601 --> 01:45:04.640
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been playing a lot of tennis lately</v>

2249
01:45:04.641 --> 01:45:09.560
<v Speaker 2>as a way to great wake up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that I need to do it,</v>

2250
01:45:09.561 --> 01:45:12.380
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is when you're like of the mindset</v>

2251
01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.750
<v Speaker 2>that when the trainer comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to punch him in the face.</v>

2252
01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough thing.</v>

2253
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of it is being a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

2254
01:45:19.521 --> 01:45:23.510
<v Speaker 2>your day becomes about waking up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging your brain all day.</v>

2255
01:45:23.511 --> 01:45:27.050
<v Speaker 2>And so you just like look at writers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat Chinese food and you're kicking</v>

2256
01:45:27.051 --> 01:45:30.650
<v Speaker 2>stuff around and it's like developing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong muscle your whole life or at</v>

2257
01:45:30.651 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 2>least not only one muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2258
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:38.210
<v Speaker 2>I know that I have to transition into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2259
01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.900
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a tough one to one.</v>

2260
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I official to your writing.</v>

2261
01:45:42.511 --> 01:45:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Now it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it 100% is I write better after I do</v>

2262
01:45:46.071 --> 01:45:49.700
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I do do is I walk really fast</v>

2263
01:45:49.701 --> 01:45:53.360
<v Speaker 2>around my neighborhood in circles for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 45 minutes every day.</v>

2264
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:55.130
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do that after you're right.</v>

2265
01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:57.680
<v Speaker 2>They say when you ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you should do is go</v>

2266
01:45:57.681 --> 01:46:02.060
<v Speaker 2>over what you wrote by going on a walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not enough where you're so</v>

2267
01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.600
<v Speaker 2>worn out that you're occupied by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2268
01:46:04.610 --> 01:46:06.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you're running or you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted.</v>

2269
01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:10.430
<v Speaker 2>You're occupied by the activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I feel like when I'm running hard,</v>

2270
01:46:10.431 --> 01:46:14.390
<v Speaker 2>especially when I do my hill sprints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking about shit other than</v>

2271
01:46:14.391 --> 01:46:15.440
<v Speaker 2>left foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right foot,</v>

2272
01:46:15.441 --> 01:46:16.400
<v Speaker 2>left foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right foot.</v>

2273
01:46:16.401 --> 01:46:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Don't fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>

2274
01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:20.090
<v Speaker 2>We're almost at the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost at the top.</v>

2275
01:46:20.091 --> 01:46:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep going,</v>

2276
01:46:21.231 --> 01:46:22.880
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna thinking about anything</v>

2277
01:46:22.881 --> 01:46:25.250
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I walk I can think about all</v>

2278
01:46:25.251 --> 01:46:27.260
<v Speaker 2>kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I walk my dog around the neighborhood</v>

2279
01:46:27.261 --> 01:46:28.430
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2280
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Just take him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll go for a walk.</v>

2281
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:32.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's like a walking meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:33.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm,</v>

2283
01:46:33.641 --> 01:46:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to read a lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you guys talk about it sometimes.</v>

2284
01:46:37.191 --> 01:46:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I heard you talking about with Russell</v>
<v Speaker 2>brand,</v>

2285
01:46:38.601 --> 01:46:39.770
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2286
01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.800
<v Speaker 2>quantum physics and trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to quiet my brain and to tune into</v>

2287
01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 2>what is left to</v>

2288
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.270
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not be crazy.</v>

2289
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And some of that is exercise because</v>
<v Speaker 1>left to do,</v>

2290
01:46:54.451 --> 01:46:55.860
<v Speaker 1>to not be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2291
01:46:56.630 --> 01:46:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was such a like a such a pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology junkie.</v>

2292
01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that stuff all day long.</v>

2293
01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:05.120
<v Speaker 1>But lately I've been reading a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>more like the,</v>

2294
01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Joe Dispenza,</v>

2295
01:47:06.901 --> 01:47:08.490
<v Speaker 1>is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Dispenza.</v>

2296
01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:09.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

2297
01:47:09.301 --> 01:47:09.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2298
01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:13.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cook quantum physics theory that</v>

2299
01:47:13.471 --> 01:47:18.471
<v Speaker 1>basically you get into a pattern of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel and it's in yourself.</v>

2300
01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:21.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a depressed person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yourselves are depressed and if you</v>

2301
01:47:21.031 --> 01:47:23.820
<v Speaker 1>get in a good mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cells try to get you back to</v>

2302
01:47:23.821 --> 01:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>depression because you've conditioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to be in a certain mood all the</v>

2303
01:47:28.081 --> 01:47:33.000
<v Speaker 1>time physically and it affects your</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole body and that you can make a</v>

2304
01:47:33.001 --> 01:47:38.001
<v Speaker 1>choice to change how you are physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>by choosing to be in a certain mood and</v>

2305
01:47:40.681 --> 01:47:45.480
<v Speaker 1>meditating about a certain mood and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could change how your body reacts</v>

2306
01:47:45.481 --> 01:47:47.670
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't want to keep you in the</v>

2307
01:47:47.671 --> 01:47:50.250
<v Speaker 1>same mental state you're used to being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2308
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Does that make any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does sort of,</v>

2309
01:47:52.681 --> 01:47:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm always real cautious about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2310
01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.880
<v Speaker 1>what causes depression and what makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people depressed and what,</v>

2311
01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:01.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2312
01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't suffer from depression,</v>

2313
01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:07.280
<v Speaker 3>so like whenever someone says you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed because of this,</v>

2314
01:48:07.281 --> 01:48:08.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

2315
01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:10.610
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to address that because</v>

2316
01:48:10.611 --> 01:48:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's certain people that do</v>

2317
01:48:13.551 --> 01:48:16.850
<v Speaker 3>have absolute chemical imbalances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what does that chemical imbalance</v>

2318
01:48:16.851 --> 01:48:18.650
<v Speaker 3>come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it come from childhood trauma?</v>

2319
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Does it come from just some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of their body that's not</v>

2320
01:48:21.981 --> 01:48:24.980
<v Speaker 3>functioning correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bad thyroid or a bad kidney?</v>

2321
01:48:25.130 --> 01:48:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Is the brain like very similar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the case or are they in a bad</v>

2322
01:48:30.471 --> 01:48:34.130
<v Speaker 3>economic situation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a bad relationship with bad friends</v>

2323
01:48:34.131 --> 01:48:36.740
<v Speaker 3>and a bad job?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's causing depression?</v>

2324
01:48:36.741 --> 01:48:38.540
<v Speaker 3>Like I think there's a host of</v>
<v Speaker 3>variables.</v>

2325
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2326
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:41.920
<v Speaker 1>you get an a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

2327
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:45.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your family to do your parents.</v>

2328
01:48:45.341 --> 01:48:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they stay together?</v>

2329
01:48:48.370 --> 01:48:49.181
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:48:49.181 --> 01:48:50.014
<v Speaker 1>So you</v>

2331
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:53.820
<v Speaker 3>step ma or my stepdad rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my mom had been together since I was</v>

2332
01:48:53.821 --> 01:48:54.320
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.260
<v Speaker 1>So you had the stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2334
01:48:56.430 --> 01:48:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

2335
01:48:57.230 --> 01:49:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I always think that's 90% of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you grow up in chaos,</v>

2336
01:49:00.501 --> 01:49:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I think you get wired for a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper vigilance and,</v>

2337
01:49:03.651 --> 01:49:08.651
<v Speaker 1>and nervousness and anxiety because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think like more bad shit's coming.</v>

2338
01:49:08.890 --> 01:49:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you had any kind of trauma as a</v>

2339
01:49:10.611 --> 01:49:12.890
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're wired to keep your eyes</v>

2340
01:49:12.891 --> 01:49:15.500
<v Speaker 1>open a little wider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also lends itself to some kind of</v>

2341
01:49:15.501 --> 01:49:17.060
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could,</v>

2342
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:19.010
<v Speaker 3>most certainly for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2343
01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 3>that hypervigilance led itself to</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>

2344
01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's also,</v>

2345
01:49:22.621 --> 01:49:24.750
<v Speaker 3>we moved around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was picked on a lot,</v>

2346
01:49:24.751 --> 01:49:26.250
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always the new kid.</v>

2347
01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:26.881
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2348
01:49:26.881 --> 01:49:28.680
<v Speaker 3>this fucking sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2349
01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:32.010
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of led me to be wary of others</v>

2350
01:49:32.011 --> 01:49:33.030
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2351
01:49:33.031 --> 01:49:34.960
<v Speaker 3>be internalize a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2352
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>

2353
01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:38.220
<v Speaker 3>that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just went in my room and watch the</v>

2354
01:49:38.221 --> 01:49:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Mike Douglas show and watch Merv</v>
<v Speaker 3>Griffin.</v>

2355
01:49:40.681 --> 01:49:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Did you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew,</v>

2356
01:49:41.611 --> 01:49:44.250
<v Speaker 3>so that from the time you were 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were working at East side comedy</v>

2357
01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:46.020
<v Speaker 3>club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of knew you always wanted to be</v>

2358
01:49:46.021 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 3>involved in common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From the time I was 10,</v>

2359
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I was into the Marx brothers first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then like cosby and George Carlin and,</v>

2360
01:49:53.530 --> 01:49:55.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to listen to lenny bruce records</v>

2361
01:49:55.781 --> 01:49:57.070
<v Speaker 1>as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand them,</v>

2362
01:49:57.071 --> 01:50:00.670
<v Speaker 1>but I just heard that's the best person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always,</v>

2363
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I think I liked that comedians just</v>
<v Speaker 1>called out bullshit.</v>

2364
01:50:05.501 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And I must have felt like there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of bullshit around me because I</v>

2365
01:50:08.171 --> 01:50:09.890
<v Speaker 1>liked the and called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2366
01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like George Carlin was like,</v>

2367
01:50:11.651 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this makes no fucking sense.</v>

2368
01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:15.940
<v Speaker 1>And so I love those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2369
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:17.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lighter stuff too,</v>

2370
01:50:17.321 --> 01:50:22.180
<v Speaker 1>like just silly comedians who just</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out the ridiculousness of</v>

2371
01:50:22.181 --> 01:50:23.810
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I loved Seinfeld when I was a kid</v>

2372
01:50:23.811 --> 01:50:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Leno,</v>

2373
01:50:24.821 --> 01:50:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but especially Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when I was little,</v>

2374
01:50:28.210 --> 01:50:32.140
<v Speaker 1>well Groucho Marx is pretty underrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and under appreciated to this day.</v>

2375
01:50:32.141 --> 01:50:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Like my roommate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was hosting that show you bet your</v>

2376
01:50:34.091 --> 01:50:34.901
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2377
01:50:34.901 --> 01:50:39.660
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny and so dirty and weird people</v>

2378
01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:40.480
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2379
01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.710
<v Speaker 1>and even like when you watch them and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2380
01:50:41.711 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 1>duck soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marx brothers movie,</v>

2381
01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:46.060
<v Speaker 1>it's all about the ridiculousness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2382
01:50:46.061 --> 01:50:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and something drew me to those people.</v>

2383
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it was also because I was bad at</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports and so I thought this system's</v>

2384
01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:55.781
<v Speaker 1>unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2385
01:50:55.781 --> 01:50:58.000
<v Speaker 1>so I'm a Dick because I can't play</v>
<v Speaker 1>softball.</v>

2386
01:51:00.330 --> 01:51:02.590
<v Speaker 1>So it led me to like look for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2387
01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:05.020
<v Speaker 1>But back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one else likes comedy.</v>

2388
01:51:05.021 --> 01:51:07.360
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't another person to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2389
01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Now I think everyone likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But back then there was no one was</v>

2390
01:51:10.541 --> 01:51:13.270
<v Speaker 1>watching Merv Griffin but me really when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was little,</v>

2391
01:51:13.271 --> 01:51:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 15 I didn't like come to</v>

2392
01:51:16.121 --> 01:51:20.230
<v Speaker 1>school and we would laugh about Jeff</v>
<v Speaker 1>Altman on Merv Griffin.</v>

2393
01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I was just alone with it.</v>

2394
01:51:22.830 --> 01:51:24.090
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:51:24.091 --> 01:51:28.500
<v Speaker 3>I became a fan of a standup watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>standup on TV,</v>

2396
01:51:28.530 --> 01:51:31.860
<v Speaker 3>like watching like the tonight show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>evening at the Improv and stuff like</v>

2397
01:51:31.861 --> 01:51:34.050
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really the big one,</v>

2398
01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:38.400
<v Speaker 3>the run that really kicked in for me was</v>
<v Speaker 3>my parents took me to see live on the</v>

2399
01:51:38.401 --> 01:51:39.750
<v Speaker 3>sunset strip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

2400
01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:41.970
<v Speaker 3>And I was a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young teenager.</v>

2401
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.790
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember being in the audience while</v>

2402
01:51:44.791 --> 01:51:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor was onstage slaying and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were laughing so hard and I was</v>

2403
01:51:49.741 --> 01:51:51.390
<v Speaker 3>laughing so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked around,</v>

2404
01:51:51.391 --> 01:51:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget this moment cause I</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked around at the crowd while the</v>

2405
01:51:55.471 --> 01:52:00.060
<v Speaker 3>movie was going on and all these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like falling out of their chairs</v>

2406
01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:02.400
<v Speaker 3>after their knee holding her chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2407
01:52:02.401 --> 01:52:04.950
<v Speaker 3>this guy's just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just talking.</v>

2408
01:52:04.951 --> 01:52:07.170
<v Speaker 3>And he's this funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is incredible.</v>

2409
01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an amazing thing this guy can do</v>

2410
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:12.000
<v Speaker 3>like I'd never seen real standup before.</v>

2411
01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.920
<v Speaker 3>I had only seen like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2412
01:52:13.921 --> 01:52:17.370
<v Speaker 3>like someone on the Johnny Carson show</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a couple minutes and tell a few</v>

2413
01:52:17.371 --> 01:52:19.980
<v Speaker 3>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That in my mind was what stand up was.</v>

2414
01:52:20.250 --> 01:52:23.160
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't until,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had listened to some of the old</v>

2415
01:52:23.161 --> 01:52:26.150
<v Speaker 3>bill cosby stuff and some of the old</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlin stuff on,</v>

2416
01:52:26.210 --> 01:52:27.660
<v Speaker 3>on uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>records,</v>

2417
01:52:27.810 --> 01:52:32.700
<v Speaker 3>but I'd never seen it like seeing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie live on the sunset strip and that</v>

2418
01:52:32.701 --> 01:52:35.760
<v Speaker 3>planted didn't plant a seed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can do it,</v>

2419
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.220
<v Speaker 3>but it did plant a seed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Holy Shit,</v>

2420
01:52:38.221 --> 01:52:40.830
<v Speaker 3>this is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is crazy that this is</v>

2421
01:52:40.831 --> 01:52:42.480
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still the best special.</v>

2422
01:52:42.690 --> 01:52:44.370
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without a doubt.</v>

2423
01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 3>He's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he holds up in a,</v>

2424
01:52:46.281 --> 01:52:49.670
<v Speaker 3>in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unique way where a lot of comedy</v>

2425
01:52:49.671 --> 01:52:54.110
<v Speaker 3>from that era just immune including</v>
<v Speaker 3>lenny bruce doesn't really hold up like</v>

2426
01:52:54.111 --> 01:52:56.390
<v Speaker 3>gets caught be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because it's contextual.</v>

2427
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were there in that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was groundbreaking,</v>

2428
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:04.340
<v Speaker 3>but that's not groundbreaking anymore</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the culture has moved on so far.</v>

2429
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:08.570
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that could be attributed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>his insight like Lenny Bruce incite</v>

2430
01:53:08.730 --> 01:53:12.650
<v Speaker 3>change the way a lot of people thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>and discussed a lot of like really</v>

2431
01:53:12.651 --> 01:53:16.310
<v Speaker 3>important issues at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was something about priors,</v>

2432
01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:21.610
<v Speaker 3>his honesty and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his delivery and his point of view</v>

2433
01:53:21.741 --> 01:53:24.260
<v Speaker 3>that's like to this day like God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was good.</v>

2434
01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:24.711
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2435
01:53:24.711 --> 01:53:28.040
<v Speaker 3>there was a record they put out a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago where they didn't tell you</v>

2436
01:53:28.041 --> 01:53:32.090
<v Speaker 3>what album it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just bits and I think maybe a</v>

2437
01:53:32.091 --> 01:53:35.450
<v Speaker 3>lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of of bits that were recorded when he</v>

2438
01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:37.630
<v Speaker 3>recorded an album but didn't make the</v>
<v Speaker 3>album.</v>

2439
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Like it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2440
01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:39.950
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2441
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:41.870
<v Speaker 3>an eras like seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>80s,</v>

2442
01:53:41.871 --> 01:53:44.570
<v Speaker 3>90s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you listen to his stuff from</v>

2443
01:53:44.571 --> 01:53:46.700
<v Speaker 3>the 70s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so militant.</v>

2444
01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so milton and it all works</v>

2445
01:53:50.751 --> 01:53:53.420
<v Speaker 3>perfectly today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what he's mad about.</v>

2446
01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all applies to right now.</v>

2447
01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:00.320
<v Speaker 3>And then when he goes honest about</v>
<v Speaker 3>himself and relationships,</v>

2448
01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:02.030
<v Speaker 3>you do feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2449
01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:03.920
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not many people opening it up</v>

2450
01:54:03.921 --> 01:54:05.270
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2451
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Like there's not a comparable person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of comedians who talk</v>

2452
01:54:09.471 --> 01:54:10.880
<v Speaker 3>about their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's really,</v>

2453
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:15.830
<v Speaker 3>he's ripping open the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the veins much deeper than anybody even</v>

2454
01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:16.700
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2455
01:54:16.701 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 3>And he was talking about horrific</v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction issues that he had back then.</v>

2456
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:22.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction issues that caused them to</v>

2457
01:54:22.251 --> 01:54:23.800
<v Speaker 3>light himself on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:54:24.110 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean when he was talking about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then,</v>

2459
01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:29.630
<v Speaker 3>who the hell had done that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember he would do that thing.</v>

2460
01:54:29.631 --> 01:54:31.840
<v Speaker 3>We would light a match and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and move it around.</v>

2461
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:33.171
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who am I?</v>

2462
01:54:33.171 --> 01:54:37.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm Richard Pryor running down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>street and joke around about lighting</v>

2463
01:54:37.431 --> 01:54:40.550
<v Speaker 3>himself on fire and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have the whole audience laugh.</v>

2464
01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:42.290
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2465
01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:45.710
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some bits where he talked</v>

2466
01:54:45.711 --> 01:54:49.940
<v Speaker 3>about having multiple sclerosis near the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end of his life and he was still doing</v>

2467
01:54:49.941 --> 01:54:54.760
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store and on audio they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>riot asleep.</v>

2468
01:54:54.761 --> 01:54:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutally honest bits about,</v>

2469
01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it felt like to be that sick.</v>

2470
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.180
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think it ever was on an</v>
<v Speaker 3>album before when he was doing that.</v>

2471
01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was,</v>

2472
01:55:06.291 --> 01:55:07.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming back to the comedy store when he</v>

2473
01:55:07.761 --> 01:55:11.210
<v Speaker 3>was really sick before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the guy who went on after him</v>

2474
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:14.140
<v Speaker 3>every night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every night for like five weeks.</v>

2475
01:55:14.150 --> 01:55:15.860
<v Speaker 3>So Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time he did his show,</v>

2476
01:55:15.861 --> 01:55:18.500
<v Speaker 3>I bombed so many times going on after</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor.</v>

2477
01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was death.</v>

2478
01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:23.630
<v Speaker 3>And how was he terrible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

2479
01:55:23.710 --> 01:55:28.580
<v Speaker 3>he was old and he was sick and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk and he was on pills and he</v>

2480
01:55:28.581 --> 01:55:31.340
<v Speaker 3>probably shouldn't have been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just wanted to do it.</v>

2481
01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:33.440
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't,</v>

2482
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.510
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't Richard Pryor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like they had it,</v>

2483
01:55:35.511 --> 01:55:37.520
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was really unhealthy so they had to</v>

2484
01:55:37.521 --> 01:55:38.780
<v Speaker 3>crank the microphone up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

2485
01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:42.360
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't even hear Shira</v>

2486
01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.650
<v Speaker 3>barely hear him and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would like,</v>

2487
01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I always love pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't,</v>

2488
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:48.850
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2489
01:55:48.930 --> 01:55:51.570
<v Speaker 3>he was just kind of talking and ranting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would,</v>

2490
01:55:51.610 --> 01:55:53.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be on stage with a drink and people</v>

2491
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.800
<v Speaker 3>didn't know how to respond and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would give him this amazing round of</v>

2492
01:55:58.801 --> 01:56:01.380
<v Speaker 3>applause when he got on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it took forever for them to get them</v>

2493
01:56:01.381 --> 01:56:06.000
<v Speaker 3>to the stage because chewy who worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>the door and this guy dave,</v>

2494
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:09.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would carry Richard prior to the stage</v>

2495
01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:13.830
<v Speaker 3>and slowly just move him towards the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage and all the time that people would</v>

2496
01:56:13.831 --> 01:56:17.070

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2512
01:56:58.441 --> 01:57:03.360

<v Speaker 2>and now ladies and gentlemen and unknown</v>

2513
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:06.960
<v Speaker 2>White Guy after the greatest comedians</v>

<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

2515
01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I would just make fun of myself for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>few minutes and you know,</v>

2516
01:57:14.671 --> 01:57:15.504
<v Speaker 2>and then sometimes</v>

2517
01:57:15.670 --> 01:57:17.210
<v Speaker 3>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2519
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:23.190

<v Speaker 3>to get off the stage too.</v>

2520
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:26.610
<v Speaker 3>So that was the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would get introduced by Jeff</v>

2521
01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:31.670
<v Speaker 3>who's a piano man and I would pass</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard and Dave and Chewy as they were</v>

2522
01:57:32.071 --> 01:57:35.250
<v Speaker 3>carrying Richard off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd have to kind of move around</v>

2523
01:57:35.251 --> 01:57:37.920
<v Speaker 3>them and then get onto the stage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'd have to say,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2525
01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:41.610

<v Speaker 3>and sometimes ppc people's eyes,</v>

2526
01:57:41.611 --> 01:57:42.840
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like this is so to facing their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortality.</v>

2529
01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

2530
01:57:47.881 --> 01:57:49.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know Richard,</v>

2531
01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:53.940
<v Speaker 3>like I remember like he wasn't supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to drink but he drank anyway cause they</v>

2532
01:57:53.941 --> 01:57:57.060
<v Speaker 3>had them on all this medication and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like fuck you just kept drinking.</v>

2533
01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:59.240
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2534
01:57:59.310 --> 01:58:00.143
<v Speaker 3>it was dark.</v>

2535
01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I remember meeting him at a birthday</v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

2536
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I went with Jim character to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>birthday party and it was,</v>

2537
01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:08.330
<v Speaker 2>it was sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

2538
01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:12.290
<v Speaker 2>it was sad to see but somebody that ill</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then especially when you think of</v>

2539
01:58:12.291 --> 01:58:17.291
<v Speaker 2>just the power of the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just how crazy funny he was.</v>

2540
01:58:17.331 --> 01:58:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's not that many people just</v>
<v Speaker 2>took the core funny.</v>

2541
01:58:19.731 --> 01:58:21.710
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when Robin Williams,</v>

2542
01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:26.740
<v Speaker 2>we used to come into the Improv in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>late eighties and he would kill so hard.</v>

2543
01:58:28.730 --> 01:58:31.970
<v Speaker 2>There was just no way to recover the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room couldn't recover.</v>

2544
01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's not that many people can do</v>

2545
01:58:34.791 --> 01:58:36.290
<v Speaker 2>that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like people could follow each</v>

2546
01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:38.090
<v Speaker 2>other now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Louie comes in and you go on</v>

2547
01:58:38.091 --> 01:58:40.550
<v Speaker 2>after him and you know and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like he kills.</v>

2548
01:58:40.551 --> 01:58:44.080
<v Speaker 2>But like Robin Williams would come in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you wanted to end the show,</v>

2549
01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:44.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2550
01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was only one of him then,</v>

2551
01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now there's like Louis,</v>

2552
01:58:48.251 --> 01:58:50.770

<v Speaker 2>Diaz and then there's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's so many funny people now maybe</v>

2555
01:58:57.401 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 2>the audience understands in a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>way and they can transition.</v>

2556
01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:03.960
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2592
02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I remembered Chris Rock says that Martin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence was opening up for him in the</v>

2593
02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:28.960
<v Speaker 2>90s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.090
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

2595
02:00:30.130 --> 02:00:34.210
<v Speaker 2>before he did his big specials and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was downstairs in the dressing room</v>

2596
02:00:34.211 --> 02:00:39.211
<v Speaker 2>and he could feel the theater rocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went on stage and he said he had</v>

2597
02:00:40.210 --> 02:00:44.740
<v Speaker 2>had some shows where he couldn't follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>him the way he wanted to and that's what</v>

2598
02:00:44.741 --> 02:00:49.741
<v Speaker 2>made him work hard and then develop</v>
<v Speaker 2>those great specials because having</v>

2599
02:00:49.751 --> 02:00:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Martin opened for him scared him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2600
02:00:51.851 --> 02:00:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Well he also said that he did too many</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowds in front of white people.</v>

2601
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too many shows in front of white crowds</v>

2602
02:00:57.310 --> 02:01:01.020
<v Speaker 2>and they were just too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too happy and too,</v>

2603
02:01:01.090 --> 02:01:05.290
<v Speaker 2>except day and Martin Lawrence or just</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring the thunder dude.</v>

2604
02:01:05.291 --> 02:01:10.090
<v Speaker 2>He was so strong before he put the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wetsuit on and ran around with a gun in</v>

2605
02:01:10.091 --> 02:01:11.860
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the city and the in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>heat,</v>

2606
02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:15.970
<v Speaker 2>like a whatever fuse he blew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But before that,</v>

2607
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>that fucking guy would go onstage with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leather jumpsuit on and just destroyed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>don't appreciate today.</v>

2609

2611
02:01:28.570 --> 02:01:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I was as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a two in a set.</v>

2612
02:01:31.211 --> 02:01:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I was playing Bonnaroo and biff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go on the night before to</v>

2613
02:01:34.481 --> 02:01:38.650
<v Speaker 2>warm up and I went to xannies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nashville and he's there and I hadn't</v>

2614
02:01:38.651 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>seen him before and I did</v>

2615
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.710
<v Speaker 1>a set and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2616
02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>it was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't very good.</v>

2617
02:01:43.911 --> 02:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>It was just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he gets on.</v>

2618
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard louder left.</v>

2619
02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard louder last me and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager,</v>

2620
02:01:49.671 --> 02:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Miller sat in the back of the room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were like,</v>

2621
02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>what is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we start really paying</v>

2622
02:01:54.891 --> 02:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>attention going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how funny is this guy?</v>

2623
02:01:57.231 --> 02:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like listening to the material?</v>

2624
02:01:59.001 --> 02:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Like is this good material or is he</v>
<v Speaker 1>pandering or what is it?</v>

2625
02:02:01.671 --> 02:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Then we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

2626
02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>here's the materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

2627
02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Like he is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was the biggest labs I've ever</v>

2628
02:02:09.501 --> 02:02:13.250
<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a sustained like killing the</v>

2629
02:02:13.251 --> 02:02:13.971
<v Speaker 1>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2630
02:02:13.971 --> 02:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>where the place is just rocking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving up and down.</v>

2631
02:02:16.530 --> 02:02:17.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lot of black shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2632
02:02:17.861 --> 02:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2633
02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>he went full 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 minutes at 10 before he slowed it</v>

2634
02:02:24.351 --> 02:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>down and had to slow it down and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to kill these people.</v>

2635
02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>And I swear I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm in the same</v>

2636
02:02:30.801 --> 02:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy like,</v>

2637
02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>is this what we're supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when you,</v>

2638
02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>when you jumped back into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought that three years ago you're</v>

2639
02:02:39.291 --> 02:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>just going to have some fun and go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

2640
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:45.290
<v Speaker 1>When was it that you realize like I am a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic now,</v>

2641
02:02:45.610 --> 02:02:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I've got a kind of like really aspire to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high standard,</v>

2642
02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>like I have to really tighten everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2643
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2644
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2645
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I was watching Louie work on his new set</v>
<v Speaker 1>very seriously at the comedy cellar and</v>

2646
02:02:59.121 --> 02:02:59.601
<v Speaker 1>he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2647
02:02:59.601 --> 02:03:01.850
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing tonight and go onstage and</v>

2648
02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:06.851
<v Speaker 1>just crush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I played Carnegie Hall and I</v>

2649
02:03:06.861 --> 02:03:09.020
<v Speaker 1>had a good set for the New York comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>festival.</v>

2650
02:03:09.021 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 1>And then as a surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought sandler out to do a surprise</v>

2651
02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.270
<v Speaker 1>set after me and I thought I did great.</v>

2652
02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And then when he came out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laughter went up 20% where I felt it</v>

2653
02:03:22.750 --> 02:03:23.510
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2654
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm like at a seven and he's at a nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half.</v>

2655
02:03:27.110 --> 02:03:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a diff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sound changed and I thought,</v>

2656
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:33.590
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole nother step here that I</v>

2657
02:03:33.591 --> 02:03:36.680
<v Speaker 1>need to kick into gear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always want the material to be good,</v>

2658
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:38.480
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2659
02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:43.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a a way to crush that's hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

2660
02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>to get that momentum and have the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously Chris Rock is one of the</v>

2661
02:03:47.451 --> 02:03:50.570
<v Speaker 1>best of everybody at it because he has</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many great ideas,</v>

2662
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>but understands how to get the room rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really hard.</v>

2663
02:03:56.091 --> 02:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>The cadence and the peace and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to find what,</v>

2664
02:03:59.351 --> 02:04:03.860
<v Speaker 1>what is in your cadence that does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't become obnoxious or loud or</v>

2665
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.800
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2666
02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:09.440
<v Speaker 1>just talking fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you find an original way to</v>

2667
02:04:09.441 --> 02:04:11.000
<v Speaker 1>create that energy in a room?</v>

2668
02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I think the only way it's constant</v>
<v Speaker 1>repetition.</v>

2669
02:04:13.431 --> 02:04:15.690
<v Speaker 1>You have to be on stage all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2670
02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And you have to really always be trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to improve it and you have to always be</v>

2671
02:04:19.221 --> 02:04:21.110
<v Speaker 1>listening to your recordings and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have,</v>

2672
02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to listen to bad sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two sets go bad.</v>

2673
02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:26.160
<v Speaker 1>You got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't that go back?</v>

2674
02:04:26.161 --> 02:04:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And let's listen to this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always hear myself mumble like,</v>

2675
02:04:28.971 --> 02:04:30.230

<v Speaker 1>they didn't even hear what I said.</v>

2676
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:32.960
<v Speaker 1>That's big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to stumble.</v>
