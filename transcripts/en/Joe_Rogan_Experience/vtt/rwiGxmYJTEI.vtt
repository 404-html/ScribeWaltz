WEBVTT

1
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.710
And we're live.
What's up
dude?

2
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.190
You're on a rollercoaster ride.
What does it like to be the champ?
Ah,

3
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.320
what's the feeling like this is fresh for you?
Oh,
well first of all,

4
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:25.060
I just want to say,
man,
it's such an honor to be here.
Um,
the honors mind,

5
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.550
I never,
I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest.
Um,
um,

6
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.740
my thing is I'm just going to be 100% and totally transparent.

7
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.350
I was never,
I never really watched the show.

8
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:37.120
I never really kind of heard of this show.

9
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.820
Of course I heard of you and all the things you do.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

10
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:41.680
it's fear factor guy,
you know?

11
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:46.681
But I never really heard of the show until like after like a fight or two in the

12
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:49.480
UFC and people are like tagging me in shit.

13
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.930
Like Yo Joe Rogan's talking by Joe Wrong and talking about you and pocket.

14
00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:55.840
I'm like fucking podcasts.
Cause I'd never listened to podcasts at the time.

15
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.470
I was like,
what are you talking about?
Till I finally started listening,
I'm like,

16
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.090
oh this dude is for real.
This dude got some,
some,
some pool.

17
00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:07.750
You got some people watching this shit,
random people would tag me.
Oh,

18
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:11.290
Joel was talking about you today on the podcast.
I'm like,
Oh man,

19
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.990
this guy's for real.
And then every time after that that I see you,

20
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:18.340
I'm like sub Gel.
Yeah,

21
00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:20.140
we've been talking about you for a long time man.

22
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:21.910
We were just with your friend out there.

23
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:25.030
We're watching a video of us talking about you back when you were ranked number

24
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:29.190
12.
And I was saying,
I think you can fight for the title right now am and that.

25
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.710
Um,
and I I like to attest it to,

26
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:36.070
I think because I went back once I started kind of researching you,

27
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.470
I like to go back and do a little research and I'm like,

28
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:42.730
fucking Joe's been with this,
this sport for the beginning.

29
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.490
Like you were in the back with hair is

30
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.530
the hair freaking interview and the guys,

31
00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:53.890
yet they were during the tournament that we're finding multiple fights and nine

32
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.950
and you were interviewing those guys and I was like,
Damn.
Even back there,

33
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.400
Joe has skills.
Joe was a BS interviewing these guys.

34
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.340
There was no shaking behind it.
Cause I,
you know,
one thing about me,

35
00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:07.600
I've gotten into comp and commentating and things like that now and I'm like,

36
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:11.380
Dang Joe,
he didn't seem nervous.
You would just like a freaking natural at it.

37
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.000
And the sport was just growing at that time.
There was nobody watching back then.

38
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.120
It was,
it wasn't as much pressure,
you know,
it wasn't like coming into it today.

39
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.200
Yeah.
Espn paper view,
all that deal.
It would be a lot of pressure,

40
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.220
but back then it was just fun.
Yeah,
it was.
It was weird man.

41
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.480
The first one I did was in Dothan,
Alabama and this weird like it was,

42
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.690
I don't know if it was a high school gym or some small auditorium,

43
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:37.450
tiny little place.
It was very weird.
They have a,

44
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:41.910
you made it look like a freaking certain little walk in the park.
I mean it was,

45
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.790
I was like damn chosen good at that.
Joe's been doing this shit for a while.
Well,

46
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.610
it's a,
it's an interesting thing to see,
you know,

47
00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:52.090
to see it progress from 1997 to where it's out of 2019.

48
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.570
The biggest difference is not just,
uh,

49
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.840
the amount of eyes at accounts and amount of people that are paying attention to

50
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.110
the real difference is the level of athlete.
It's a,
it's a giant,
giant leap.

51
00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:05.110
I can no other sport.

52
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:10.111
I don't think there's another sport from 1993 to 2019 where the athletes are

53
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.990
almost,
it's almost unrecognizable.
How much better the fighters are as Lilly,

54
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.990
you know,
now back in the day it was like,
okay,

55
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.170
you finished your college career,
you finished all this,

56
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.950
you've got to the height of whatever you know,
sport you could be,

57
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.820
let's start fighting.
And so guys were coming in at 28,

58
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.700
27 starting to learn the tricks.

59
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.480
Now you got freaking 10 year old kids.
Yup.
Sparring.

60
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.760
There's all these crazy videos like little bitty kids fighting in like Russia or

61
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:46.240
other places.
Like they're full on MMA fighting.
Yeah.
It's a totally,

62
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.220
that whole promotion.
I'm like,
men,
by the time these guys get to 1617,

63
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.500
they're going to be killers.
Yeah.

64
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:57.370
But if you go back and watch like a boxing match from like 93 a by a world

65
00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:00.130
champion boxer like Marvin Hagler,
perfect example,

66
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Marvin Hagler from the 80s could absolutely hang with w middleweights like he's,

67
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:09.040
he would fit right in with world champions today.
Absolutely.

68
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.780
But a UFC champ from 93 mean God,
it's just not the same.

69
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:18.430
It's not by any stretch.
It's,
it is such a,
back then it was a,
it was wild.

70
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:21.580
It was crazy,
but nobody had endurance.
And you know,

71
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:24.900
there was a few guys that had some skill and certainly our event,

72
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.800
Orlando v or hoists Gracie,

73
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.410
there was guys are really good at their individual arts,

74
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.220
but there was no real complete fighters yet.
Yeah.

75
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:35.200
You got the transition because it was,

76
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.650
everyone came in with their special scales and now it was then that was a big

77
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:42.760
thing.
I think UFC even sold that as,
oh yeah,
you got the wrestler,

78
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.770
the con,
the Combo,

79
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.630
the sambal guy and the Jujitsu guy.
And,
uh,
so that was the thing.

80
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.580
Everyone came in with their one skill and they put it to the test to see which

81
00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:58.420
you still watch better.
It's freaking crazy.
Joe,
my first fight,

82
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:00.190
first time I ever watched a UFC fighter,

83
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.800
I was visiting John Jones in college freshman year.

84
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.710
This was our,
our,
our freshman year to freshman year.

85
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.310
I was visiting him cause I went to uh,
a small school,
you know,

86
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.700
only in William Penn University,
which is about two hours away from him.

87
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.040
He was at Iowa Central in Fort Dodge,
Iowa.

88
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.510
So I went to go spend my fall break a whole week with him just hanging out

89
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.540
because we had met the previous year in high school and just,

90
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.750
he knows his two brothers and the wrestling.
It was like,
Hey,
two brothers,

91
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:32.140
what's up man?
What are you going to school lectures like I'm bi.
I was like,

92
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:37.120
show me too as well.
We kept in touch and I went up to hang out with him.

93
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.590
And during that week it was a fight on someone,
like a friend of the team,

94
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:45.880
something like that invited us to come to his house and watch it and we went

95
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:48.730
over there to watch the fights.
I had never really heard of it.

96
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.200
I never really cared.
I was just at freshman just trying to hang out with John.

97
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:58.000
And Paul uses this room.
This was 2005 I think.
Yeah,
thousand five so it was

98
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.690
<v 2>like first season of the ultimate fighter.
Yeah,
2005 so we got,</v>

99
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.580
I think it might've been Randy couture or somewhat judges reminded,

100
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.200
but I forgot who was fighting and we went to the House party and watched it.

101
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.220
I really didn't really remember the fight.
I cause I didn't really care.

102
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:14.540
I never paid attention to it.

103
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.160
I never thought I would ever do something like that.
So I just washed it.

104
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.250
And then I remember the guy saying,
hey man,
you guys can do this.

105
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.000
Well why don't you guys try this?
And I was like,

106
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.440
me and John kind of looked at each other like,
hell,

107
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.320
I ain't no way are we going to do that.
I see.
You know,
wrestling is controlled,

108
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.960
you know,
there's rules.
W you know,
certain things you can or can't do,

109
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.850
there's no way we're doing that.
So we kind of laughed it off and left that day.

110
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.020
Never knew that I freaking,
years later I'd be doing this,
doing that,

111
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.020
just doing it.

112
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.520
<v 3>Thrown the guy who many people,</v>

113
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:53.660
including me were saying as of is a very good argument for the best welterweight

114
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:57.830
ever.
I felt like Tyron is like,
you got to give it.
There's like two,

115
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.360
there's legendary status,
right?

116
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:03.230
There's like Matt Hughes has legendary status from being the original.

117
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:06.560
He was one of the first wrestlers who really knew how to submit guys.

118
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.200
And then George St Pierre was,
of course,

119
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.410
many people's eyes is the greatest of all time in the welterweight division.

120
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.130
Went on this long run,
but I was like,
man,
when you,
if Tyron beats ooze,

121
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.841
mano is like,

122
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:21.950
there's a real good argument for him being number one of all time beaten.

123
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.120
Wonderboy beat smashing Darren tail beaten.

124
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.130
Damien Maia knocking out Robbie Lawler to win the title.

125
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.700
<v 2>Absolutely.
I considered him.
I put him in that conversation.</v>

126
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.460
He's in that conversation for sure.
For sure.
I put them in that conversation.

127
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.280
I ain't have nothing but respect for Tyron.
It was nice to see.
Yeah,

128
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.911
<v 3>sure.
As it was.</v>

129
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:45.890
There's a video of you and Tyrons mom and Tyron and Tarryn's mom after it is a

130
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:46.820
beautiful video.

131
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.110
<v 2>Yeah man.
I hear jerker.
I freaking,</v>

132
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.660
I let it go cause I'm one of those guys,

133
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:56.500
I never really sit and stop and smell the roses and things like that.
I always,

134
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.010
I always have a chip on my shoulder and I'll explain why that is.

135
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.760
But I always had this chip on my shoulder with everything that I do.

136
00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:07.210
So I never really sit and celebrate and say,
Oh yeah,

137
00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:11.530
I accomplished this or I did that or did that.
But I had known,

138
00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:15.970
I known his mom.
I,
I've met her previously to the fights.

139
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.550
I fought in Saint Louis one time.
Man.

140
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.950
Of course I'd seen her several times at his fights,

141
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.980
but I was fighting in Saint Louis and I was there early and she was at the hotel

142
00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:30.700
tire,
wasn't fighting or anything,
but she just came to the hotel.

143
00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:34.630
I think she was just hanging out and I got to sit with her before,

144
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:37.240
like all the fighters even came into town.
I had to sit with her.

145
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:41.560
I think we sat for a couple of hours,
maybe three,
four hours,
just talking.

146
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.310
I got to know her and she was,
she was just such an angel,

147
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.740
but at the same time she's,
she's a gangster to like you,

148
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.140
you can't,
you know,
she sees everything.

149
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:58.170
And the only in the biggest thing I could compare it to is if you ever seen that

150
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:02.880
show for way backs called touched by an angel and I forget what her name is.

151
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:05.520
She's like the famous eye black actress.
And um,

152
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.870
do you remember that woman saying,
but don't forget her name is Maya Angelou.

153
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.440
It was,
it wasn't,
no,
I wasn't my Angela,
it was that late.
I mean,

154
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.100
she's my Angela status.
How big as she was.
Inspirational.

155
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:21.810
But that's Kinda what I compare her too.
And so we got,
we got,

156
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.561
you know,

157
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:27.240
I knew her and Tyra obviously wasn't who I would have chosen to take the belt

158
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:32.220
from,
but is how long could you hold yourself back?
Because being a chain,

159
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.900
there's a huge entire,
and send himself,

160
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.900
there's a huge difference between being a challenging and a champion.
Yeah.

161
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.750
And of course I,
I need,
I needed to have my family in that.
Yeah.

162
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.080
That argued I need,

163
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:47.370
I need to get them to that status to where now I'm setting my daughter up.

164
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:52.380
I'm setting everyone up for,
you know,
life better life forever.

165
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.170
And I couldn't continue to hold that back.
So yeah,

166
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:58.380
it was unfortunate that I had to take that from him and I kind of,
in a sense,

167
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:02.310
I felt like I was taken away from what he was doing for them.

168
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.410
So when I saw her walking backstage,
I just couldn't control it.
I just let,

169
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.510
I just let go and I just can't help but cry on her shoulders.

170
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.870
<v 3>Disagree.
It's a great video.
What is her name was woman's actresses.
Roma.</v>

171
00:10:13.871 --> 00:10:16.270
Downey Roman,
yeah.
Yeah.
That's right there.

172
00:10:16.271 --> 00:10:20.800
The video is amazing cause she's hugging you and she's telling you

173
00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:22.940
congratulations and she's telling you that they're coming,

174
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.940
they're going to be coming for you.
So train hard.
Yeah.

175
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.310
And it's just like her attitude,
Matt.
It's,
it's beautiful man.
It's,
it's,
um,

176
00:10:30.311 --> 00:10:35.020
it's amazing her character that she handled that.
I mean this is her baby.

177
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.910
Her baby just lost and lost every round and it was a,
you know,

178
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.000
pretty dominant victory by you and for her to treat you that way afterwards to

179
00:10:43.001 --> 00:10:47.260
shows amazing character.
Yeah.
It's,
Sarah does right here.

180
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:52.690
You can see it up here.
Look at her.
She just embraces you.
Open arms.

181
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.630
It's all good.
It's all good baby.
Look at that.

182
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.560
<v 4>Oh,
amazing.</v>

183
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.100
That's an amazing woman right there for a couple of phone calls.

184
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.820
So you take it too.
Oh good.
Wow.

185
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.880
<v 3>That's amazing man.
And even Tyron,
the way tire and hill,
it's crazy,
right?</v>

186
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.730
It makes me cry.
Something in the air over here.
I've got to do it.

187
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.430
I got it made me cry when I saw it.
It's making me cry now.
Yeah,
man.
Um,

188
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.760
and in the way she treated tire and to the same thing.
I mean,
she's just,

189
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.590
<v 2>that's,
and that,
that's,
that's kind of,
that's how my mom is to that.</v>

190
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.630
So I felt such a connection to that to her because my mom has the exact same way

191
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:43.290
my mom had done the same thing to Tyron.
And um,
it just,

192
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:45.990
it was powerful man.
It was.
And because it's,

193
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.510
and it goes through a test to how the sport has,
how bay this sport is as well.

194
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.340
Yeah.
Like it's not all that's just a regular

195
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.510
<v 1>fight.
You guys hate each other and you're fighting.
No,
this was a competition.</v>

196
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:03.340
Yeah.
You know,
this was two men that went in there for a competition and one guy,

197
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:05.230
one and you know,

198
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:09.370
and you saw the aftermath to see the family receive each other.
People love them,

199
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:13.150
man.
They love when people put all their bullshit aside.
I mean,

200
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:17.230
you guys had a lot of trash talk at the press conferences and there was a lot of

201
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:20.280
that going on,
but that sells tickets and it's good for everybody and it's,

202
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.560
it's natural and normal.
But after it was over,

203
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.770
it was nothing but respect and it's what a lot of people think is wrong about

204
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:33.820
the trash talk of this era because there's,
this is a,
there's an error right now,

205
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:36.330
right?
We're in the trash talk error.
Absolutely.

206
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.160
Some people are really good at it and some people are terrible at it,

207
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.360
but it seems like everybody's trying me Mazda doll.
Um,

208
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.160
recently when he just beat Darren till it was very interesting because you know

209
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:52.270
his take on it before the fight was,
why am I,
why,
why trash talk?

210
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.850
Like what are we doing?
What have you,
you know,
why we're going to fight?

211
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.940
Like what does all this bullshit about?
Like he doesn't like it.
He was like,

212
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:01.610
I don't like where this is going.
I don't like where the sport is going.
Yeah.

213
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.613
I mean it was,

214
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.480
it's one of those things that I had to adjust to because I wasn't brought on

215
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:10.540
those principles.
I don't,
I'm not,
you know,
cause I'm not here.
Yeah.

216
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:14.830
I wasn't here for a salesman.
Like people ask me all the time,
why do you do this?

217
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.300
And I chose to do this,
like I'm college educated,

218
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.190
I can get a fucking job and I'm sitting in an office and punch numbers and all

219
00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:29.020
that.
But I chose to do this because of my burning desire to compete.
That's what,

220
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:33.340
when I,
even now when I compete with guys,
I'm not competing angry.

221
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:37.810
I don't want to kill this guy.
I'm not Rah,
Rah,
Rah and all that shit.
No,

222
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:40.810
it's competition for me.
My mind is I'm going to beat you.

223
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.340
And which is partially which it goes to test with the how I fight and how I

224
00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:49.360
compete.
I'm not like that.
This is not the only thing that I can do.

225
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.180
And so this error came about.
We're now everybody,
you got to talk change,

226
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.300
you got to sale,
you got to do this and do that.

227
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.770
And so do you feel any pressure to do that?
Initially,

228
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:02.150
at some point I did because it was um,

229
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.790
I was fighting the way I was fighting and I was dominating guys and I was

230
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:10.030
getting nowhere.
It was like,
no,
no,
the variety.

231
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:12.170
They were kind of like just kind of putting you on the wayside.

232
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.280
They would always tell him,
oh,
you get a top 10 guy,
you will get a top thing guy.

233
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.620
But they wouldn't happen.
He was like,
oh you,

234
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.610
you fight this guy and you can't really argue with them because this promotion

235
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:25.600
has given you the opportunity to even really make money at all for the career

236
00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:30.070
path that you've chose.
So for our,
for a while I just felt like,
man,
this is not,

237
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.820
I guess I just got to do this because you saw it.
The other clown Covington it,

238
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.150
he had to do that.
He absolutely had,

239
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.400
nothing has changed with the way that he fights.

240
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.610
He's done the exact same day since he'd been in the UFC,

241
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.210
but after the first couple of fighting,
no one gave a shit.
So he felt,

242
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:48.370
you know what?
No,
I'm just going to have to start doing this.

243
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.160
Everyone knows it's fake.
Right.
Because he just

244
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.850
<v 2>one day woke up and started doing it.
And that's,</v>

245
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.300
that's the thing now you have to do,
people try to say you have to do that,

246
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.220
but for me is when I'm not going to do is I'm not going to just sell my soul

247
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:05.840
just to,
Oh yeah,

248
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:08.840
I'm just trying to earn a couple of bucks because I'm not going to do that.

249
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.870
I'm going to do it the right way.
George did it the right wind and,
and I,

250
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.200
I'm a firm believer that when you do it the right way,

251
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.250
you will earn what you deserve.
It will come to you at some point.
I don't that,

252
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:22.200
that you have to,
uh,
really don't.
Yeah.
I mean,

253
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.890
Colby Covington does because I dude freaking socks.

254
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.310
He show each show because look,
you got to give it to him.

255
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:31.990
He did beat those aren't Joe's,
that was a big victory.
He did be Damien Maia.

256
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.300
That was a big victory.
Those are,

257
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.380
those are two legit victories over to very dangerous guys.

258
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.580
He did beat those guys.
He's got skill on top of the trash talk and,

259
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.450
but the trash talking bumped him ahead of you in line.

260
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.890
And a lot of us were surprised.
I was surprised.
I was surprised that he had to,

261
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.090
he had to do it.
And I mean it's gotten them where he has.

262
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:57.590
And I mean look what he did last two weeks ago when I fought his whole,

263
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.860
his whole deal was for me to create an uproar.
Right?

264
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.100
Get my name back in the picture.
And he did a wonderful job.

265
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.600
This is the one thing that I will,
I will,

266
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.660
I would say is that he has done a wonderful job at having people talk about

267
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:12.800
them,
whether you hate him,
which,

268
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:18.350
and even the bosses have said exact same thing is no one has done what he's

269
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.213
done.

270
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.520
No one has ever created the persona that is unanimously hated worldwide.

271
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.730
Like unanimously,
there's not even the hill.
Like literally it,

272
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.800
like those guys,
they still had fans,
you know,
that wanted to see him succeed.

273
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.540
Like nobody likes,
he's not safe anywhere.
No,
you don't even have to be.

274
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.970
There's flyweights that one hurt this guy.

275
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.220
So he's unanimously,
he has,
he's done a good job of creating that,

276
00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:52.430
which I love and I appreciate that it's going to sell a lot of paper views.

277
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.540
I'm not,
I'm not a hater.
I'm not a hater.
Like I give credit where credit is due.

278
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.460
I appreciate the fact that he has done that.
And,

279
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.850
and that's one day now Rashad taught me over the years,

280
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:04.850
is that you have to appreciate certain things like that.
And I,
and I do,

281
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.700
I always wanted this moment.
I always wanted that Connor.
It could be that,
that,

282
00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:13.820
that adversary,
that Rashad and rampage,
that Hughes and,

283
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.660
and George St Pierre,
I like,
I always wanted that and,

284
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.000
and he's done a good job of creating that.

285
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:24.710
So not just an adversary in terms of like a legitimate worthy opponent,

286
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.870
but uh,
do that you want to fuck up.
Absolutely.
I mean,

287
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.590
I haven't,
I haven't been in a fight yet where it was like a malicious,

288
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:38.280
like I was maliciously trying to hurt someone.
I haven't been in that fight.
Yes,

289
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.910
I don't,
that's the thing it might means,
and with my mind,
my mind is strong.

290
00:17:40.911 --> 00:17:42.830
I don't compete.
Oh yeah,

291
00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:45.650
I'm trying to kill this guy and then you swing five punches.
You Miss,

292
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:50.100
now you're dead tired.
I don't compete like that.
This,
I'm still going to compete

293
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.300
<v 1>as myself,
but there's going to be a letter,
extra oomph behind these,</v>

294
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:58.740
these elbows.
Now I'm going to fillet your face with the little longer cuts.
I'm,

295
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:03.030
I'm trying to,
this one is going to be one that I really enjoy.
Well,

296
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:05.040
there was the same with could be even Connor,
what do you said?

297
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:08.280
I want to change your face when you said that,
I was like,
damn,

298
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:10.470
that's deep on want change your face.

299
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.720
And you saw that even when Kobi was like that is um,

300
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.220
because he was never out of character and it can be never was like,
oh yeah,

301
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:19.310
I'm just going to go out there and try to kill this guy.
Right.

302
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.640
There's a certain level,

303
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.980
there's a certain mentality then certain fighters have to add.
It could be you.

304
00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:29.981
Is that another guy that I've seen that competes similarly to the way that I do

305
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:34.170
as far as his mind,
where it's at.
Like I don't give a shit what you do,

306
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:37.770
talk about me,
do all this,
try to distract me.
Like they tried me,

307
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.830
this whole come leading up to the tire and fight.
They did everything.

308
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.540
What are you going to do?
And then you had his,

309
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.220
his little psychic that looked like sideshow Bob that was was talking in doing

310
00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:51.120
there is trying to distract me and this and then Colby popped up trying to

311
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:54.390
distract me.
Dad didn't change anything and that's not going to do nothing to me.

312
00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.460
I my mind,
his own competing.

313
00:18:56.461 --> 00:19:00.570
I'm going to compete to the best of my abilities and I'm going to embarrass you

314
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.840
and then this guy is going to be even more worth the big change in your skillset

315
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.900
from your first fight in the UFC to now as you're striking,

316
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.970
you're wrestling has always been outstanding.

317
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.560
Your cardio has always been excellent,

318
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.300
but your striking is much more fluid and much looser.

319
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.740
You're you,
you're much more efficient now you are always powerful.

320
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.680
But it seems like now everything's falling together.

321
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:29.130
Like you don't have any holes in your game anymore.
It's a different thing.
Yeah.

322
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:33.030
Joe.
Um,
I've been with my,
I've been with my same team since the start,

323
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.490
the same guys that have been with,
um,
um,
for,
you know,

324
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.170
Glenn Robinson started arch him.
Unfortunately he passed away,
you know,

325
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.760
rest in peace to Glen.
Um,
when did he die?
I didn't even know he died last year.

326
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.940
Yeah,
he died last year.
I didn't,
yeah,
he had a heart attack man.
And uh,

327
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.240
it's,
it was sad.
I couldn't really believe that it happened,
you know,

328
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:58.020
but it did and I'd say he's in a better place,
you know,
but,
um,

329
00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.640
he,
he passed and he was the,
he started all this,
you know,
him and Rashad Evans,

330
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.190
Rashad needed a new place when he was leaving Jackson's and uh,

331
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.730
and Glen was kind of like,
they got together and decided to,

332
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.760
to start this and Rashad Evans at the top of the game who doesn't want to train

333
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:15.594
with Rashad Evans.

334
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.200
And so it kind of spread like wildfire to where everyone started going down

335
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:22.890
there.
But yeah,
I,
I've been with the same guy.

336
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.100
Henri Hooft just came down at that time and Rufus was a striking coach.

337
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.480
I met with him since,
you know,
it's a phenomenal coach.
Amazing coach,

338
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.750
good striking coach.
So there's those Dutch fundamentals.
He has got it down.

339
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.240
Yeah.
And a lot of,
you know,
there's,
I've seen a lot of different coaches,

340
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:43.290
different styles.
I don't know.
You know,
I like,
I like a lot of different things.

341
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:45.660
But the thing with Henry,
he's,
he's,

342
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:50.661
he's very basic because at the end of the day when you're fucking tired and,

343
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.610
and you can't even hold your arms up and do certain things,

344
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:59.470
you're just going to do basic regular shit.
Yeah.
Oh,
jab to one,

345
00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:02.780
two.
That's what you're going to do.
Now he's in a,
he's simple,
stupid.
Yeah.

346
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.470
He's very like that.
It keeps it simple.

347
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.030
And that was the way for me to learn it is just from the,
from the bottom up.

348
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:14.110
I just,
I learned it now.
I don't get it wrong,
Joe.
I can do some of that caution.

349
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.650
Like in practice I'll do a cartwheel kicks.
I'll do the all that core shit.

350
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.710
Yeah,
that reverse loop,
front side side,
taekwondo kick.

351
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.200
I can try it

352
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.880
ever about like moments in fights.

353
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.140
There are moments in fights where a fighter will do something,

354
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.100
but the best example is Chris Weidman versus Luke Rockhold.

355
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.490
Chris Weidman tries this wheel kick out of nowhere and he misses with it.

356
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.090
Luke gets a hold of them,

357
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.970
drag them to the ground and beats the shit out of him and it was a real,

358
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.850
Luke has a nasty top game.
His top came is crushing and he just,
he just,

359
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.750
Ruth was ground and pound and it changed the course of Chris's career and a lot

360
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:03.751
of ways that beating went on him and he lost the title and then he lost other

361
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:06.760
fights afterwards.
But before that he was dominating.

362
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:09.190
He had beaten Anderson twice.
He had crushed v tour.

363
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.150
He was a different thing and that it just,
there's these moments,

364
00:22:13.151 --> 00:22:16.180
these pivotal moments in fights when someone just try something,

365
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.980
I mean most of the time you just get away with it.

366
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.930
But sometimes like in that is my go to when I tell people,

367
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.210
don't try some shit.
That's not your thing.

368
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:29.980
This is the best example Chris Weidman throwing that we'll kick against Luke

369
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.460
Rockhold yet you got to,
um,

370
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.470
and that's part of everything that's grouped in with fight Iq.

371
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:41.180
You have to be able to assess risk reward and certain things like that and that,

372
00:22:41.181 --> 00:22:44.410
that's kind of,
at some point it was a knock on me.
He's like,
oh,

373
00:22:44.411 --> 00:22:45.940
this guy had never gets out of position.

374
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:49.210
He never does any other cool shit or any of that.
You know,

375
00:22:49.211 --> 00:22:54.210
it was kind of who's giving you that knock.
Fucking people come to me now,
Joe,

376
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.900
I listened to you say that all the time.
Yeah.
Like I was saying a long time ago,

377
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:00.520
it was like,
this guy's not fucking up.

378
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.880
Like he keeps running through guys and he's beating guys like a world champion

379
00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:07.030
already.
Yeah.
A lot of people always kind of,
you know,
like,
oh,

380
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:11.230
he didn't do all this and not doing all that.
But the thing with me it is,

381
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.400
it's being able to assess when,
when I can do that,
when I,
I can't do that.

382
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.600
Like when I fought Rda,

383
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:20.290
I threw a freak and ax kick in the fifth round and you know,
I,
and I was,

384
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.980
I practiced that in practice.
I,

385
00:23:21.981 --> 00:23:26.981
I catch guys with it all the time and it's just being able to assess us warm.

386
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.230
Yeah.
I knew that they was,
you know,

387
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:34.570
if there's an opportunity for me to start letting go.

388
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.190
And so I started letting go and I mean,
is it tough?

389
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.330
Tough dude.
Very tough.
Tough dude.
He's a tweener hard head.

390
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.930
He seems like he's a tweener to like,
he's not quite a one 70 I mean,

391
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:50.900
he could beat a lot of guys that want 70 but it's almost like he should be like

392
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:55.580
one 60 or one seven five one 55 is too hard of a cut for him these days.

393
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.420
But the thing that's,
that's just,
that's the nature of the,
yeah,
because if we,

394
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:02.210
if we started saying,
okay,
well we're going to accommodate everybody.

395
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.350
It's never going to stop.
Do you think there should be more weight classes?
Well,

396
00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:09.350
you don't care.
You don't get any 70 works for you.

397
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.860
And I still hardcore doesn't it?
It's a harder one.

398
00:24:13.861 --> 00:24:18.620
91 81 80 88 [inaudible] believe it or not.

399
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.430
Like for most people that are listening to this,
that's on the light side.
Yeah,

400
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.500
no,
absolutely.
I know it is,
but the thing is,

401
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:29.170
I'm so late and I'm on 80 and I'm walking around below 6% body.
You are.
Wow.

402
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.410
Who Do you use to cut two for weight?
For the last couple of fights,
man,

403
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:35.080
I've been working with Clint,

404
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:39.260
Clint Wickenburg up at the Pi and Trifecta.
Yeah.

405
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:44.220
And try like Clint and Clint Trifecta food system Trifecta,

406
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.510
essentially,
you know,
the meal delivery,
meal prep stuff,

407
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.930
and they do a phenomenal job.
Phenomenal.
And Clint,

408
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:55.250
the reason I chose to go with him is I've always did it by myself.

409
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.330
I like to cook,
I cook for myself.
I always,
you know,

410
00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:02.720
when all those fights earlier fights in the UFC,
every,
the one of my fights,
I,

411
00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:05.180
he was in charge of my own diet.
I cook for myself.

412
00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:10.130
I do this because I've done it so many years in wrestling all the wrong way.

413
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.680
I can look at myself,

414
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:15.170
I can wake up in the morning and look at myself in the mirror and tell how much

415
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:19.160
I weight and I'll be right on just because I'm so used to my body.

416
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.240
So I know what I can or I can't eat.
What can hold food,
what can hold water?

417
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.590
And it's just,
it's a discipline thing for me as well.
And so I,
so I decided,

418
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:30.170
you know what,
I'm getting higher up now.

419
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.030
One thing that I don't understand is that I haven't done the research is,

420
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:39.031
is what foods to eat before a certain practice at certain times to fuel me the

421
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:40.820
best to make me help,

422
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.140
help me feel the best because I'm getting older and things aren't the same.

423
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:49.790
They use the way they [inaudible].
I'm 31 and I'm gonna be 32 in May.

424
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:54.020
And I'm like,
man,
I just don't feel,
if you notice a lot of difference,

425
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.220
you know like at 24 I just fucking wake up at 6:00 AM and I can go for a

426
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:02.660
freaking five mile run like that with nothing.
Now I can't do that anymore.

427
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.480
Do you think that his age or do you think that is miles,

428
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.460
like all the hard training come?

429
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:10.310
It's a combination because 31 year in your athletic time.
Yeah,

430
00:26:10.311 --> 00:26:12.430
it's a combination of both.
Because in wrestling years I,

431
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:16.700
I gotta be late forties he's wrestling years.
Am I late for us?

432
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:21.560
I mean back his reserve shot my,
you know,
my shoulders are shot,

433
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:26.120
my knee,
my knees.
Oh my God,
my knees.
I've had five knee surgeries.
Jesus Christ.

434
00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.960
So you limping.
Did you have one recently?
I just had surgery,

435
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:34.970
actually had surgery on Tuesday.
Her Suzanne had a double hernia.

436
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.190
Jesus,
did you fight with a double hernia?

437
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.770
I tore it before like five weeks before the fight and I'm,

438
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.610
but I don't know if it was completely,
you had a hernia and a broken foot.
Yeah.

439
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.510
Yeah.
Fucking crazy.
The funny thing is an Ali makes fun of me about this.

440
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:56.160
My manager is like all fight week.
Like if you saw me,

441
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:59.490
you would think this guy was like a Zombie.
Like I limp around,

442
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.760
I freaking light patches on me and I'm in a boot or sleeve and all I do all days

443
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.330
I go do the media rounds or whatever I need to do training,

444
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:13.770
come back and I'm just in my room either game ready on me or or something on me.

445
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.180
But when I walked through that door to fight the Nigerian nightmare wakes up.

446
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.700
I flipped a switch and a lot of people would,

447
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:24.000
would if they'd go back and look at videos of when I walk into the cage,

448
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.500
I said right before the case,

449
00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:30.501
I'd probably say my prayer for protection and when I walk in I just freaking

450
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.560
don't.
If it's like a flip that switch a prayer that you say every time.
Yeah.

451
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.430
You have the exact same thing.
Yeah.
What do you say similar along those lines?

452
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:40.560
I just,
I basically just a prayer for protection,

453
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:46.070
prayer for me to be able to display the best of my abilities.

454
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:51.090
It's never,
I,
cause I'm not self,
it's just not,
I'm not getting in that prayer.

455
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.070
Please let me win now.

456
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.020
It's please protect me here so I can go back to my family safe and salad and

457
00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:03.021
protect my opponent as well and give me the strength to be able to display the

458
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:08.040
best of my abilities.
And that's it.
And once I freaking walk through that door,

459
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.080
I'm the freaking Nigeria nightmare.
I just feel like a different person.
I am.

460
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.460
I am.
And you'll see it in my face.
Um,
I'm good and dandy,

461
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:21.810
but when I walk in and it goes away,
I've,
I just,
I transform into that person.

462
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.171
Yeah.

463
00:28:22.171 --> 00:28:25.530
I think a lot of people would be surprised at how friendly and easygoing you are

464
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.970
outside.
People can't tell.
And that's the thing now is there's really,
I haven't,

465
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.590
I don't,
I don't,
there's no change in me.

466
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.430
I'm still the same freaking guy since I haven't done anything since a fi,

467
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.650
nothing.
People were like asking me,

468
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:42.040
have you gone out and partied in this now with the belt and not having done
shit.

469
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.030
I know my daughter,
I brought her from my daughter,
but I didn't,

470
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:52.740
I didn't do anything.
I just sit on the couch,
watch TV,
go back,

471
00:28:52.741 --> 00:28:56.520
made me go to the,
uh,
the shop that I liked to take my daughter to get,
uh,

472
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.720
get French toast.
She loves this one place.
So I take her there,
come back,

473
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.240
that's it.
Or maybe take her to a date night.

474
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:07.080
And the only difference is now a lot people are starting to recognize me more so

475
00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:10.000
like I'm walking out the movies and people will stop me.
Hey,
can I get a picture?

476
00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:13.950
You can hide a pitcher.
Yeah,
of course.
You know,
but nothing changed.

477
00:29:13.951 --> 00:29:16.560
I'm the same freaking guy.
I haven't got a chance to do anything.

478
00:29:16.561 --> 00:29:19.320
I had surgery last Tuesday.
I've been in bed for weeks,

479
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:22.530
so I haven't done anything,
but I don't think anything is going to change.

480
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.880
I'm the same guy.
And you know,
you sound like you have the perfect attitude.

481
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.600
Like the idea that you're having,

482
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.670
making a prayer to just do your best and not be hurt and not have your opponent

483
00:29:35.221 --> 00:29:39.540
hurt and protect you and your opponent.
That's the,
that was a beautiful attitude.

484
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.070
And the fact that the way you're approaching

485
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.480
<v 2>this,
I mean,
you just,
you're just here to compete and to do your very best,</v>

486
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.441
all the,
that you,

487
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:50.710
you're free of the burden of a lot of bullshit that some people carry around

488
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:55.660
with them.
Gel.
And I was thinking about this on the way up and um,
a lot of,

489
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.580
a lot of those fighters,
a lot of those champions,
like after a while you,

490
00:29:59.581 --> 00:30:03.520
you there,
they feel this certain pressure to,

491
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.040
to be able to do this or that and,
and,

492
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:09.670
and some of the examples that I gave is there's so much pressure and it's in

493
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:13.370
silver.
I almost felt like he couldn't wait to lose.
Yeah.
He was just like,

494
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.970
it's like a pressure the way you just want to put it down.

495
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.940
You imagine when Bj Penn beat them,
it was just so much want to get hired.

496
00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.860
Is that actually,
and I feel like it was so much pressure.

497
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.180
George Saint Pierre ran away from the sport because of that pressure.
You know,

498
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.350
something for me,
I don't feel shit.

499
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.080
I was just,
I was just thinking,
I was like,
I don't care.

500
00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:37.790
Like they look at this fight now that come in to fight.
Right.

501
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.030
Everyone's already bringing,
making a big deal out of it.

502
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.470
It's another fight for me.

503
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.800
I don't even think of myself as all you are the champion.
I don't care.

504
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.170
I just want to beat this guy up.

505
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.710
Do you think that you will care though when the media obligations and all that

506
00:30:50.711 --> 00:30:53.830
shit happens or do you think you'd just be able to Zen your way through all that

507
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:58.630
shit?
Um,
I would be lying to say I would never care.
I would be,

508
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.120
I think that would be doing it an injustice.

509
00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:04.540
But I feel like I go to search certain people,

510
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:07.150
like I have some of my go to people that I,
I get to the,

511
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:10.460
I call them my mentor coaches and like Rashad,

512
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.890
the biggest thing with her that I learned,

513
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:15.940
I talked to a shot about is Rashad was always pouring into me like,
man,

514
00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:17.500
you just enjoy and enjoy the ride.

515
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.500
You'd be okay with that feeling because there was a certain time where I was a

516
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:24.370
little more nervous than usual.
I was,

517
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.350
I was nervous for Wa one I think I can't remember the fight and I was nervous.

518
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.070
And retailers,
I may just make friends with that feeling,
be okay with it,

519
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:36.550
make friends with the feeling of being like,

520
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.410
understand that it's okay to feel that way and just be okay with it.

521
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:47.220
And so that I go back to those feelings and even there was an exercise when I

522
00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:50.110
was wrestling,
I was living at the Olympic training center,

523
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:52.650
I was training and I started feeling all this pressure that,

524
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.360
that a lot of people put on me.
All your division to guy,

525
00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:58.330
you can't be Olympic champion.
You can't do this,
you can't do that.

526
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.530
And my coach at the time,
Brendan slayer was like,
yeah,
a lot of people may,

527
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.100
you know,

528
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.660
made put that pressure on me when I was competing to and said that,

529
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:10.950
oh you too short.
You can't beat these guys.
You can't beat [inaudible] basis.

530
00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:15.250
The Tate Sattia of the,
you know,
the most famous Russian wrestler of all time.

531
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.610
And,
and they're saying you can't beat him.
You can't do this.
You can't do that.

532
00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.450
And you said one exercise you should do is he'll think of all these negative

533
00:32:22.451 --> 00:32:26.890
thoughts cause people start saying it in your mind.
It's you goes into your mind.

534
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.810
You know,
especially now when all these fans tweet shit and say stuff to you,

535
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.910
you read it.
If you read it,
it's in there.

536
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.840
And so one day he said you should do is just put all those thoughts in.

537
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:42.350
Just imagine this iVision is glass jars.
You just put them all in the jar.

538
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.490
Shut the lid,
grab a big sledge hammer.
You just smash it.

539
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.420
And it sounds silly,
but I was like,
ah.

540
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.690
It wasn't until a little while after I started kind of doing that.

541
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:58.520
So when I started doubting myself,
man,
can I do it?
Can I do a good,
oh man,

542
00:32:58.521 --> 00:32:59.990
this guy,
he can beat me.
I mean,

543
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:02.510
what if he knocked me hard and embarrassing me in front of everyone?

544
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.710
Then on my snap the fuck out of it,
put it in that job,
but an HR it and smash it.

545
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.380
Might have fun with it,
man.
You supposed to feel like this.

546
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:13.040
Rashad said you supposed to feel like this.
Yeah man,
it's,
yeah,

547
00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:15.410
and I just take a deep breath.
I smile and I just,

548
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:18.570
I snapped back in and Eddie Alvarez also is a,

549
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.110
someone I consider a brother and these are the guys that,

550
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.440
that I go to for when I started to feel down and I,

551
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:27.410
I talked to Eddie quite a few times before this last fight,

552
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.330
when I started feeling a little bit of pressure,

553
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.600
I talked to them and they just kind of,
they snap me back.

554
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.030
<v 3>Will you wait?</v>

555
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:38.690
Will you getting frustrated that you weren't being considered amongst the top

556
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:40.730
contenders when you were undefeated?

557
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.540
You dominating all these people and you were seeing it like when the,

558
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.930
when Wonderboy got two shots and then you know,

559
00:33:47.931 --> 00:33:51.830
you saw the Damien Maia fide and these all these other fights.
Was that,

560
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.460
was that hard for you?
Yeah,

561
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.780
<v 2>it was.
It was a time where I'm not gonna lie Jo.
I was like,</v>

562
00:33:57.781 --> 00:34:01.320
why the fuck am I doing this?
I'm you.

563
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:06.420
I'm going to keep fighting for 25 and 25 30 in 30 what?

564
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:12.030
What?
The thing is,
what a lot of people don't understand is they think,

565
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.661
oh man,

566
00:34:12.661 --> 00:34:15.660
is that 15 minutes that you're out there or that 25 minutes you're out there

567
00:34:15.661 --> 00:34:20.070
training and fighting and that's it.
You know you got paid tenant 10 bro.

568
00:34:20.071 --> 00:34:20.581
You just did.

569
00:34:20.581 --> 00:34:25.500
I just did a five month training camp to where I didn't eat right for five

570
00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:30.180
months for $20,000 if you win,
if you win,
and on top of it,

571
00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.640
it's that society so backwards nowadays to eat clean food is more expensive.

572
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:39.600
So for me to just eat clean for five months,

573
00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:43.590
I'm already five 10 grand in the hole on top of it.

574
00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.120
You've got bills coming every month.
That's not going anywhere.
Yeah.
You know,

575
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.420
just to train for these fights.
I've spent more than that.

576
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.920
And you have taken more damaged than that because that's when you really take

577
00:34:55.921 --> 00:34:59.190
damage.
I'm sparring and when I fractured my foot,

578
00:34:59.191 --> 00:35:02.300
that happened the last week in training,
my last barn session,

579
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:06.930
I'd kicked someone in the face.
Boom,
my foot's got,
it was a fun.
It was,

580
00:35:06.931 --> 00:35:10.320
it was bad.
It was at first I just figured,
you know,
it's like more tie.

581
00:35:10.321 --> 00:35:12.630
Like you kicked Shands and elbows all the time and you know,

582
00:35:12.631 --> 00:35:15.090
you get the little fractures,
but that,
you know,

583
00:35:15.091 --> 00:35:17.760
you work on it and has gone and a week.

584
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.130
But this one just wasn't going away.

585
00:35:20.131 --> 00:35:23.310
The swelling kept coming back and coming back.
So I'm start freaking out my,

586
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.510
Oh shit.
I think I really broke something and,

587
00:35:26.511 --> 00:35:30.240
and so I started freaking out and then a day or two,
three days,
four days,

588
00:35:30.241 --> 00:35:31.110
I get it worked on.

589
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:35.070
I'm having a really special compression socks that I have on it at all time and

590
00:35:35.071 --> 00:35:38.220
I'm icing this thing four times a day and it's not going away.

591
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.290
I'd wake up to swallow would be bigger.
I'm like,
Oh man,
I did damage.
So,

592
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:45.700
and then I kept walking on it and I haven't,
uh,
cause I,

593
00:35:45.701 --> 00:35:48.030
I have to practice because I had to keep that weight to,

594
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:52.470
I got to keep that metabolism going.
And so I'm just like,
man,

595
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:58.060
there's no way I'm not fighting.
Like you only get an opportunity,

596
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.270
wants a fight call and say I'm pulling out of this.

597
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:04.500
I might not ever get a shot again.
Right.
And so I'm like,
I'm going to fight.

598
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.760
And there was no doubt in my mind of what I could do.
I was just,
I,

599
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.200
it's going to happen.
I'm already dealing with the hernia situation.

600
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.540
And so I'm like,
screw it.
And thinking about me is,
I have a rant in three years,

601
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:21.810
Joe.
I have,
yeah,
my knees are so bad.

602
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.980
I have not ran such good cardio.
What are you doing for cardio?
I,
everything I do,

603
00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:28.980
I do freaking hard.
I guess I do a frigging hard,

604
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:33.320
I'm on that air dying and man shout out to my strength and conditioning coach to

605
00:36:33.321 --> 00:36:37.740
Doctor Cory Peacock.
I mean,
he's also honored to,
I mean Dark Cory's uh,

606
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:42.400
we put in,
we put in some time man,
and it's not just him,
it's,

607
00:36:42.401 --> 00:36:45.840
it's my coaches were Greg,
Greg Jones.
When we wrestle,
we rest.

608
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:50.000
I wrestled freaking hard and when I,
I can't do it often anymore,
but I,

609
00:36:50.001 --> 00:36:54.780
I wrestle hard when I hit pains.
Yeah.
When I hit pads,
I had past hard with Henry.

610
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.270
Everything that I do in my mind,

611
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.050
I try to do it at the speed that I would want to do it in a fight and anything

612
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:05.250
greater because my whole mentality is when you get tired,
when people get tired,

613
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:07.350
that's your threshold.
That's where you're at.

614
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.550
So that's why your body feels like that.
Oh,
I'm tired.
There's as far as I can go.

615
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.150
I tried to get to that as fast as possible.
Boom.

616
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:18.360
Because then everything after that it's extra.
I just push,

617
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.380
push that condition and more and more and more.
So I just freaking go hard.

618
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.370
Everything that I do,
I do it hard.
Of course I do it smart,

619
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.480
but I'd do it hard.

620
00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:31.260
But I haven't ran Joe and almost three years that it's crazy because one of the

621
00:37:31.261 --> 00:37:33.900
most impressive things about the photos,
you never let your foot off the gas.

622
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:34.890
And in the fourth round,

623
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:38.100
I think it was when you had Tyron hurt and when you really started pouring it
on,

624
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.560
I was like,
okay,
he's trying to finish this fight.
How,

625
00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.740
how much gas is he going to have left in the tank?

626
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.770
Because you know that sometimes when someone tries to finish someone and they

627
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:50.400
can't,
they're done.
You know,
you poured it on,

628
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.630
you took a couple of deep breaths then right back on him.
I'm like,
damn,

629
00:37:54.631 --> 00:37:59.280
that's some serious fucking cardio.
Cij I was sprinting in my mind.
I,

630
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.580
I watched that back.
I was like,
what the fuck was I doing?
I was swinging like,

631
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:04.020
wow,
wild man.

632
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:09.000
Just because I saw the light at the end of the tunnel and I was like,
you know,

633
00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:11.190
and um,
um,
it's like I was sprinting towards it.

634
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:14.360
But then he kept getting dimmer and dimmer.
I was like,
Oh shit,
fuck it.

635
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.190
We're slow down tyrants.
You're still going to get there man.

636
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:21.450
He was tough as fuck.
He ate some big shots.
People didn't really see it.

637
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:25.580
What happened was started that transition.
We were in the clinch,
I had him in a,

638
00:38:25.581 --> 00:38:29.950
in a Thai clinch and I think he was trying to work on my body and I hit him with

639
00:38:29.951 --> 00:38:32.400
the knee.
I hate him with another knee.

640
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.910
And in my mind I just remember some of the trainings that I've been through.

641
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.830
I've been in that situation and training and ice tray with a cosmo Alexandra,

642
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.260
more tie dye,
freaking amazing.

643
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.930
And one thing that he would show me is how more anti guys would sneak and
elbows.

644
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:54.880
And so I'm in there and I'm like,
I'm tired is not really getting out of this.

645
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.510
So I'm like freaking,
let me try it.
And this elbow that you throw,

646
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:01.870
it's a sideways elbow and I'm in there.

647
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:05.210
I throw a knee in and I just do the sideways up one and it doesn't look hard.

648
00:39:05.211 --> 00:39:07.030
It doesn't look crazy or anything like that,

649
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:12.031
but it was like side of the head and I just felt that land and I'm trying to,

650
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.580
cause you got to read fast.
So I'm trying to reading them.

651
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.490
I'm going to try to assess them.
I'm like,
is he hurt?

652
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.550
Cause he kind of stumbled back.
But Tara has a very good poker face,

653
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:26.780
so he has this nonchalant face on and I'm trying to read them.
I'm like,
wait,

654
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.863
wait.

655
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.480
So I kind of fake a little fake Adam to see if he's trying to set me up for a

656
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:35.020
big shot and I fake,
he doesn't throw anything.
You keep saying it.
I'm like,

657
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.580
Oh shit.
So I throw a jab and I threw a uh,
uh,
uh,

658
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:42.430
right hand.
I threw it across his guard.

659
00:39:42.431 --> 00:39:46.870
They hit him and he really didn't look,
didn't change.

660
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:50.620
It didn't look like he was out there.
I was like,
Oh shit,
he's hurt fricking.

661
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.870
Let's go.
It's go time.

662
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.990
And I remember I talked to Eddie Alvarez and I asked him,

663
00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:59.890
why did he freak out like that when he had RDA her?
And Eddie was just like,
man,

664
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.310
I saw that light at the end of the tunnel and I just freaking,

665
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.420
I had to empty the tank and I'm like fuck it.
Empty the tank.
Let's go.

666
00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:08.890
This is my moment.
Empty the tank.

667
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.220
So I'm throwing like a madman and Tyron has taken it all and he's tough as shit.

668
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:16.390
I'm like,
damn,
he's not going down.

669
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:18.730
And there was a couple of times he was rocked to look like he could have went

670
00:40:18.731 --> 00:40:23.200
down and all I had to do is really settled back,
hit him,
went clean shots,

671
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.200
but I wasn't even fucking thing and about that.
I was just like,

672
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.400
get this Guy Outta here now.
This is what I wanted to do.

673
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.420
Put the stamp on it.
Let's freaking do it.
There was a hell of a barrage.
Yeah,

674
00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:38.920
and I'm throwing,
I'm throwing,
I'm throwing,
I'm like
red light,

675
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.340
red light and the gas tank is on e it's on e,
it's on e,

676
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:46.200
which is the only reason I even shot in for a shot.
I was,

677
00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.030
and then I heard my coach is saying take him down.

678
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.750
When they realized I wasn't frigging knocking them out,

679
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:57.970
they were like take it down to us
and I grabbed his leg and tried to,

680
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.250
but that was the thing that I can recover pretty quickly.

681
00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:04.270
So you recovered very quick because it was one of those pivotal moments in a

682
00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:07.210
fight where I was like,
man,
if Tyron doesn't go out here,

683
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:11.590
how much does he have left?
I knew I was,
I was scared cause I was like,

684
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:16.210
I know he knows he's probably down three to four rounds.
And I knew I was like,

685
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.280
I was in a sense waiting for him to just start to snap out of it.

686
00:41:21.281 --> 00:41:22.840
But not soon.
One thing you,

687
00:41:22.841 --> 00:41:27.820
you never really give yourself enough credit with your gaming?
With my games,

688
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:31.210
I feel like I,
um,
I put people in a,

689
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:36.211
in a trans and I like a certain to where they just no getting out of it and I,

690
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.670
and that,
that's Kinda been a knock on me.
People are saying,
Oh,

691
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:45.080
you're not finishing fights and I'm doing this.
You know,
you're not submit guys.

692
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:48.710
You're not knocking him out.
This is my mentality on that,

693
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.760
and this has been since I was a wrestling,
is they were wrestling.

694
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:55.580
You can pin guys really quick,
do slick moves and pen guys.

695
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.750
But then the guys would get up and say,
Oh man,
I never seen that movie before.

696
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:02.840
He caught me in this slick mood.
That's why he got me now I'm,
I'm a get him.

697
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:04.880
Next time I'm going to do that.
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna get him.

698
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.640
And the same thing with a fire.
It's like,
man,

699
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:11.630
I had my hand down and he caught me sleeping.
So he caught me the shot.

700
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:14.210
It was a lucky shot.
He's not ever going to do that shit to me.
If I,

701
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.330
next time I'm going to get him or he called mood is slick submission.

702
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:21.710
I never seen that before.
I'm a train for next time he's going to um,
stop him.

703
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.350
My thing is even the wrestling,

704
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.800
what I always wanted to do as I wanted to tech fall,

705
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:30.050
guys in wrestling and tech fall.

706
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:33.140
What that means is when you're beating someone by 15 points,

707
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:37.130
you have a 15 point gap.
They stopped at match because it's basically a skunk.

708
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.300
Like you skunked this guy.
Like he sucked at that.
You beaten them that bad.

709
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:43.640
They had to stop it.
That is my mentality.

710
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:46.880
That is always what I strive for and in 2011 I believe,

711
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.810
I'm not 2011 2009 I led the Nation Division One,

712
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:53.960
two and three Nai,
whatever in tech falls.

713
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.460
I think at one point me and Brent Metcalf was battling like every week I would

714
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:01.730
look and see who had the most tech fault.
It was me,
be him,
be me,

715
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:06.731
him and I had the most because that's my was my goal was I wanted to say guys,

716
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.530
because in their mind what it says is you can't fuck with that guy.

717
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.130
There's,
you can't hang with him.
There was nothing.
You can do it.
He didn't.

718
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:21.370
It wasn't a quick pan of lucky pen or or this like heat destroyed you.

719
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.130
He just set levels apart and that's what I do even in fighting.

720
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:30.131
Now I do the exact same thing is I would much rather dominate you from start to

721
00:43:30.321 --> 00:43:32.630
finish.
I want to break you.
I don't want,

722
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:35.080
I want you to think about fighting me again.
It's not you don't,

723
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:38.870
I don't want you to you.
I want you to say fuck no,
I don't.
No Shit.
No.

724
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.150
He beat me everywhere.
He broke me.

725
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.720
He took something from me because you're going to think about,

726
00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:48.020
you only remember the fights you lose.
You don't like.

727
00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:49.280
I've been so many guys and rest.

728
00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:53.240
I can't tell you maybe 30 guys that I'd beat in wrestling.
I don't have no idea,

729
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.370
but the ones you lose,

730
00:43:55.371 --> 00:43:59.360
you can almost tell everyone and that's what my take on it.

731
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:04.460
I want to dominate you so bad when you think about fighting me again.
You don't.

732
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:08.570
You say,
fuck that.
I'll pass on that fight.
And so people were like,
Oh man,

733
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:12.020
this guy doesn't really finish guys.
But how many guys want to fight me again?

734
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.180
Not a lot of them.
Do you have one loss in MMA?
Yes,
I do one loss,
right?
Yeah.

735
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:20.270
I have one loss in my second fight.
Um,

736
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:25.370
uh,
cause Sarah's,
I forget his name,

737
00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:30.560
I forget his first name.
Um,
it's the Hosea.
Is it Jose?

738
00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:33.330
Cause there's rather Alex.
It's Jose.

739
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:36.270
Cause his name's Jose Carstairs alleys considered rather old.

740
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:40.260
I think it's older brother.
Oh yeah.
And,
and um,
man,
it was a,

741
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:43.470
I took the final like two weeks notice or something like that because it was

742
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:47.880
like eight months in between.
I fought my first fight and I thought,
see,

743
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:51.540
that's the thing with fighters coming in MMA now this is a lesson to you guys.

744
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:54.740
Everyone feels like,
oh,
I'm just going to jump in and he's going to be peachy.

745
00:44:54.741 --> 00:44:58.530
I'm beginning fights every other week.
Every other month.
No.

746
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.270
So I fought my first fight and I thought,
okay,
great.
My career's kickstarting,

747
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:07.530
I'm going to be doing fights.
And every so often I went through 20,

748
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.640
22 opponents within my first fight.

749
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.420
If I got the second fight.
Because now,
you know it was Google.

750
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:18.290
Now everyone all froggies it,
national champion wrestling.

751
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.940
I don't want to fight that because everyone wants to get to the UFC and they

752
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:24.480
figure,
oh it's the best record.
You want to be undefeated to get to the UFC.

753
00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:26.860
So nobody wants to fight anyone.
That's hard.
Right?

754
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.160
And so of course at that point I was at wrestler,

755
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:32.010
I could take anyone down to hold them down for three rounds and when fight.

756
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.410
So everyone,
no one wanted that fight.

757
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:39.770
So it was months and months went by and then that fight came about.

758
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.180
I was just like,
shit,
I'll take it.
And I'll be honest,

759
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.800
I never grabbed hold before that.

760
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:48.360
I never did Jujitsu and so I figured I could rest on my way,

761
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:52.350
do all this shit like,
man,
fuck these guys,
these guys are low level guys.

762
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.550
You know,
look who I trained with a train.
We were shot Evans and these guys,

763
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.420
those guys can't touch me.
I get in a fight,

764
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.160
I throw a one to his legs are there.
I hit him with a one,
two boom,
boom,

765
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:08.040
double leg,
like live within 15 seconds.
Boom.

766
00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:11.100
Threw him down for Mal and I'm kind of throwing punches.

767
00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:12.330
I didn't really know what I was doing.

768
00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:17.010
I'm throwing punches and I'm trying to elbow him and Jose,
because serious day,

769
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:21.150
I think six to 6.16 I don't,
he's well taller than me.

770
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:24.570
Long limbs.
He throws his legs.

771
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.930
I'm in full mount and he throws his legs around my body.

772
00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:31.580
I never seen no shit like that.
Right.

773
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:38.190
My mind at that time was like,
what is,
Oh shit,
what's this shit?

774
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.590
I didn't know what to do.
So I'm like,

775
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.450
so I started kind of panicking in my mind,
I don't know what to do.
I'm like,

776
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:50.580
fucking get out,
which is what you don't do.
Right.
So I turned my body,

777
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:54.090
I'm trying to like get up and walk out,
which is what you don't do.

778
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:59.640
And so he just basically climbed up my back.
Boom.
We're not even sweating.

779
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:03.000
Yeah.
Boom.
He's on my back.
I'm standing up with a backpack on.

780
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.770
He's six so he has a foot on the ground,
one foot wrapped around me.

781
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:13.200
He's fighting for the Choate and I think I hold him off for another like minute

782
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.480
and a half.
I'm standing and I'm fighting this choke.

783
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.400
All the while I'm thinking like,
Oh shit,

784
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:25.860
I can't go down cause I don't know what the fuck I'm doing down there as well.

785
00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.400
Right.
So I don't really know the defense down there.
So if I go down,

786
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.490
that just might make it worse.

787
00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:33.430
I don't know the defense and this dude looks like he knows what he's doing

788
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:37.920
behind me.
He's got a few more,
he's out of few fights and I'm,

789
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:41.680
I'm kinda scared and I'm fighting it now.
I'm standing up,

790
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:45.880
my feet are getting heavy,
getting shaky.
I'm like,

791
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.210
I'm a strong guy.
What the fuck?

792
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.520
My feet shaking because they're starting to fill up with blood.

793
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:55.840
My adrenaline is pumping and I'm just like,
Oh shit,

794
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.530
I'm about to lose
Joe.

795
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:02.460
There's this moment in your mind to it.

796
00:48:02.461 --> 00:48:06.400
You start to come to realization when certain things I'm like,
Oh shit,

797
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:08.600
I'm about to lose and win.

798
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.410
And then I start thinking about random thoughts.

799
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.790
And one of the thoughts that I thought thought about was before the fire,

800
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.650
we had a commission meeting in the bag and the commission said,

801
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.580
if you get choked unconscious,
you're suspended for six months.

802
00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:29.770
So you can't fight for six months.
Because in my mind I'm like,
fuck this.

803
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:33.310
I'm a tough guy.
I'm you got to put me to sleep.
I ain't never tap it.

804
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.430
So I'm like,
if I get,

805
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.750
it took me eight months to get this fight and this is short notice fight.

806
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.290
I haven't made money in eight months.
I'm broke as shit.
I sleep and I,
I'm,

807
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:49.360
I live with Rashad,
I live with another man,
I'm broke as shit.

808
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.120
I have no money,
I need money.

809
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:56.410
So if I can't fight for another six months,
I have no money.

810
00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.880
So all these thoughts are going through my mind and I hear Alex Caceres on the

811
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:07.630
other side of the cage screaming,
he is going to tap,
he's elbows out.

812
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:10.160
And I'm like,
fuck,
am I going to die?

813
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:18.060
I'm like,
fucking well played Alex.
Now I'm thinking about to happen.

814
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:22.600
Just for that shit.
Oh Man.
I just saw it going down and I'm like,

815
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.180
you can't be suspended for six months bro.

816
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.790
I know you want to be tough right now and you want to go to sleep.
What?

817
00:49:27.791 --> 00:49:31.180
You can be suspended for six months,
Bro.
You have to,
you gotta.

818
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:35.710
You know you got to make money.
You're broke.
I fucking tapped Joe.

819
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.800
I fucking tap.
I'd never felt so,

820
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:46.150
I don't want to say emasculated if that's the word.
I never felt so like I just,

821
00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:47.530
that's what I said,
like win or lose,

822
00:49:47.531 --> 00:49:51.760
it takes something from you and I walked out of that fight.
I went to the back,

823
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:54.940
I paced for like maybe two,
three hours in the back,

824
00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.430
all the fights fee finished up and I finally went to lock and got my stuff and

825
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:05.110
came out.
But I just paced back and forth and the feeling in my mind was,

826
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.030
I am never going to feel like this again.
I do not ever want to feel like this.

827
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.170
And ever since then I got a fucking gay.
I never had a game before I got to Ge.

828
00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:16.120
I started training with George Santiago,

829
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.250
my Jujitsu coach bill to every fucking morning.
And I was like,
Brian,
sorry,

830
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.610
give your black belt after he came in my black Bra.

831
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.260
And this is the thing is I never,
I never worried about that.

832
00:50:26.261 --> 00:50:27.860
I never worried about like yes,

833
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:32.780
I was freaking beaten up blue belts before I was even a white belt.
Like yeah,

834
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:35.900
cause I never did that skill trained.
Did you choose to skills?

835
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:40.690
But I knew how to grapple through certain things.
You know,

836
00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:44.660
I've been grappling at a high,
high level,
but it wasn't just Jujitsu.

837
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:49.670
So he kept challenging me.
Like I was always cause I want to be that guy.

838
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:52.100
I want him to be the freaking blue belt that freaking works.

839
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.780
All the brown and black belts.
But he would freaking promote me.
Is I purple belt?

840
00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.120
Because you've been training,
you trained in the [inaudible],

841
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.660
I'm going to promote you.
So he kept challenging me and challenging soul.

842
00:51:02.661 --> 00:51:03.980
Now people knew.

843
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:08.060
I felt like all it was doing was alerting people of what to expect when they

844
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:12.080
went with me and for them to try to a really fucked me up.

845
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.320
And so he promoted me.
Um,
I think a couple of years ago I was a brown belt.

846
00:51:17.321 --> 00:51:21.170
I proponent,
I think maybe two and a half,
three years ago.
And um,

847
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:24.170
and they promoted me to black.
He just asked me to come in and jam.

848
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.390
I didn't really even know.
I just felt like,
okay,
man,

849
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:28.250
he wants everyone to take pictures with the belt.

850
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:32.900
And he freaking gives me my black belt.
And another thing just floored me.

851
00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:37.340
I was like,
Shit.
I never knew.
I never expected all of this.

852
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.800
I just wanted to fucking compete.
Right?
I just wanted to be a martial artist,

853
00:51:41.801 --> 00:51:45.230
learn all this stuff and compete.
I never knew that I'd get a black belt.

854
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.830
I never knew that I would win the championship belt would be the best in the

855
00:51:48.831 --> 00:51:51.680
world at this,
at that time.
So I never knew all that.

856
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:56.030
How much did you adjust your training,
um,
to incorporate Jujitsu?

857
00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:01.040
Did you add more training sessions or did you substitute abso-freaking-lutely I

858
00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:04.970
would.
What I would do is,
cause I was living with Rashad at the time,

859
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.320
so what I would do is I would somehow get to the gym cause we saw was traveling

860
00:52:09.321 --> 00:52:13.820
a lot.
This was at the height.
He was doing a lot of different shows and stuff.

861
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.590
And so I would go to the gym at 7:00 AM 7:00 AM practice.
I think Monday,

862
00:52:18.591 --> 00:52:22.100
Wednesdays and Fridays George would have a class and I would go and take that

863
00:52:22.101 --> 00:52:24.230
class.
And then I would,
pro class was,

864
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:28.610
I think it was at nine so I would just stay at the gym while the pros came in

865
00:52:28.611 --> 00:52:33.320
for the practice at nine.
So I would go through that class as well.

866
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:34.640
And then after that,

867
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:39.730
whether lift on my own strength and condition and right after that and dumb ass

868
00:52:39.751 --> 00:52:42.440
me.
And that's what I'm saying,
I was 20 something at that time.

869
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:46.340
I wasn't eating in between all the sessions.
I wasn't doing any of this.

870
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:48.940
I was just freaking going,
going,
going,
going.

871
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:52.580
So you'd eat breakfast and that was it.
I think he breakfast at that time.

872
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.430
If you didn't even eat breakfast,
I didn't even eat breakfast.
I would get a cold,

873
00:52:55.431 --> 00:52:59.210
go to the gym,
workout.
Danny will go and roll into the next session of workout,

874
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:04.040
then roll into strangely condition or whatever I did on my own workout,
no food,

875
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.730
no food,
and then freaking go home,
eat a big meal,

876
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.200
snap,
then go back for the night session practice.

877
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:15.740
And that's how it was for a long,
long time.
And Rashad was,

878
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:17.660
would always come home and say,
hey man,

879
00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:19.850
why don't you come out with me this weekend?
Let's go,
let's go out,

880
00:53:19.851 --> 00:53:23.690
let's go do something.
And I was like,
man,
Oh man,
I got train on Monday,
man.

881
00:53:23.691 --> 00:53:27.570
I don't want to do all that.
I want to out or should I be like,
Bro,

882
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:31.350
you got to have balance in this.
It's gotta be a balance.

883
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:34.190
And I'll just thought at that time like,
Oh fuck that.

884
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.810
You say that because you had the top,
you cha you the best.

885
00:53:36.811 --> 00:53:40.950
So you say that my whole day was,
I'm just need to work.

886
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:43.980
I need to catch up.
I need to catch up to these guys.
I need to work.

887
00:53:43.981 --> 00:53:47.960
So I was just doing over time,
over time,
over time.
But you know,

888
00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:51.570
now I understand what Rashad was saying.
There has to be balanced.
Yeah.

889
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:56.280
And when did you adjust your eating?
I think,

890
00:53:56.281 --> 00:54:00.390
um,
we got a strength and conditioning coach Jake,

891
00:54:00.391 --> 00:54:03.480
but not but not cheat and Jake,
amazing coach man,

892
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:07.020
he woke with a lot of the Xtreme couture guys work with like Randy and those

893
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:10.900
guys back in the day.
And uh,
he's kind of started like,
you,

894
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:14.460
you got to fuel yourself.
He kind of started,
you know,

895
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:19.230
letting me in and I seek Nessa deigned by me.
I seek knowledge like I'm always,

896
00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:23.010
I always want to learn.
I always want to learn whatever I can.

897
00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:27.420
And I started learning like,
Oh shit.
No.
One day I was dead tired in that session.

898
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:31.740
No one had nothing left because I really didn't eat.
I had no fuel.

899
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.030
So I started kind of putting things in and the more and more,
like I said,

900
00:54:36.031 --> 00:54:40.050
it wasn't until my last two or three fights that I started working with
Trifecta.

901
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:43.170
And Clint Wittenberg and just,
you know,
I seek knowledge.

902
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.310
If whenever I can get knowledge I,
I take it.
So these trifecta folks,

903
00:54:47.311 --> 00:54:49.110
what kind of stuff they prepare for you?
Man,

904
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:53.460
they prepare my meals and they send it to me.
They send me the,
like I said,

905
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:57.450
I like to cook for myself.
Like a cooler,
a prepack.
Yeah,
they sent,

906
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.770
they send me the prepackaged shoe,

907
00:54:58.771 --> 00:55:01.750
but I'm not so much into the prepackaged stuff.
Like,
you know,

908
00:55:01.751 --> 00:55:04.410
I'm just throwing a microwave in need and I'm not so much like that cause I
like,

909
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.260
I like hot food.
I wanted to feel fresh.

910
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:12.170
So they'll send me like the package is like the protein and the chicken and the

911
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.790
steak or the fish and things like that.

912
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:18.300
And basically I'd taken out in my responsibility to take it off.

913
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:23.040
I think it's precooked but I take it out and I put it over the stove and make

914
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:27.540
some veggies with it and other stuff that I want with it.
And,

915
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.710
and I'll cook it that way.

916
00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:33.330
So it seems more like a fresh meal even though it's kind of pre made.

917
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:36.450
Just from my mind.
I get it,
I get it.
So um,

918
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.200
do they have it broken down with a certain amount of calories for each meal?

919
00:55:40.201 --> 00:55:43.320
Dependent upon what kind of working out you're doing?
Yeah,
man.
Clint,

920
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:44.220
Clint broke it down.

921
00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:49.020
I give him my schedule for the week and he breaks it down like this is what you

922
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:51.720
need to eat.
Four servings of protein,
four servings of carbs,

923
00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:56.430
fats and this and that.
Before your weightlifting session,
before you're sparring,

924
00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.480
before this,
you need this amount of sugar in this amount is this amount of,

925
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:02.940
that man made a big difference because I would,

926
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:07.410
there'd be certain practice I would lift and I'm like,
fucking,
yeah,
I feel good.

927
00:56:07.411 --> 00:56:10.860
I want to get out of there to where usually I hit a wall like boom,

928
00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:16.230
fucking this is miserable.
Yeah.
I just,
I just grind through it.

929
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.330
You UFC performance institute is amazing.

930
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.630
It's just incredible what they did when they were just talking about building

931
00:56:21.631 --> 00:56:24.110
that.
I was like,
what is this going to be like?
What do they do there,

932
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:27.190
<v 1>what over the spend a lot of money.
Who knows what the fuck is going to be.</v>

933
00:56:27.191 --> 00:56:29.050
But then they took me on a tour of it and I was like,

934
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:34.051
this is literally the ultimate training facility in 10 years it is still be g

935
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:40.840
uptodate and just still be like this thing is now catching up pods.

936
00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:48.880
They took me there.
I was like,
I live here.
I know you can literally live.

937
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:52.000
There were a lot of people relocated to Vegas just to make that the center of

938
00:56:52.001 --> 00:56:54.470
the training.
I see Claudia Goodell,

939
00:56:54.471 --> 00:56:57.820
he was down there and Francis and grinds his laundry of course.

940
00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.840
But he trained for his last fight in France I believe.
Yeah,
his,

941
00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:06.640
his last two fights.
He did it in France and um,
yeah,
we,
we,
you know,

942
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:10.680
like that's my boy.
Like we talk all the time and um,

943
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.340
that's the scariest heavyweight of all time.

944
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:17.260
Like I don't understand what people are a lot of people like especially after

945
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:21.670
those last couple of fights that Derrick Lewis,
five people were like these fans,

946
00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:24.940
man,
they were condemning him like this guy is.

947
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.950
And one of those things you just gotta give you gotta give him time to recover

948
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.560
from the steep a fight.
He has a psychological yeah,

949
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:38.440
got over it with,
with Curtis blades.
Yeah.
He stopped Curtis plates.

950
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:40.360
It was one of the best guys in the heavyweight division.

951
00:57:40.361 --> 00:57:44.980
Curtis is a big golf course was bs and,
and even for this fight,

952
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:49.180
who wins that Keynes going,
Kay's going to do,
Katie's going to do canes,

953
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:54.130
a better version of steep pay and,
and I get it.
Like I understand Cain.

954
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:58.330
Cain is the greatest we've ever heavyweight we've ever really seen.
You know,

955
00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.620
I mean,
you know DC right now that's an argument too,
you know.

956
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:07.420
But Cain was great but Keynes been gone for almost three years,

957
00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:08.240
two years,

958
00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:13.240
a long time and people are putting all this pressure on him that I expected him

959
00:58:13.391 --> 00:58:16.540
to come back and be the same old cane.
Like nothing happened.

960
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:20.650
And I'm like guys like,
and not to come back,

961
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:25.030
come back and gets the scariest heavyweight we've ever seen ever,

962
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:27.880
ever.
I made us friends slip you a little bit.

963
00:58:27.881 --> 00:58:30.550
The first time you lifted weights was with me.
What?

964
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:36.480
Frances never touched weights ever and,

965
00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.240
and that's a scary thing.
You go to Africa and they,

966
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:42.520
there's this millions of guys like,
like that walking around,

967
00:58:42.521 --> 00:58:44.440
I was saying that his story is like,

968
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:49.150
it's like the Kona and seen where Kobe was like pushing the wheel.
The,
he was,

969
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:52.540
he was working in a sand mine just digging in sand.
Yeah.

970
00:58:52.541 --> 00:58:55.210
And becoming this tank of a man.
It's crazy.

971
00:58:55.211 --> 00:59:00.211
It's obviously superior genetics on top of that because you don't get to be two

972
00:59:00.491 --> 00:59:05.290
65 naturally.
I mean you have to have fantastic genetics.

973
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:06.280
He's got that too.

974
00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:11.281
But his ability to land punches that just put people away with like he can graze

975
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:14.560
you and fuck you up.
Absolutely.

976
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:18.730
And they speed people.
Like I tried to,

977
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:23.780
I tried to swag with him.
I tried to with him once.
Yeah.

978
00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:26.900
Once 70 white spar with him.

979
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:29.720
I mean it was just playing around and that's the day in our room.

980
00:59:29.721 --> 00:59:33.740
Like everybody spotted with everybody and he loves sparring with smaller guys.

981
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:36.410
He loves it because it's,
and it's not yet because it's not,

982
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:38.390
he's not trying to hurt anyone,
but he's not trying to hurt you,

983
00:59:38.391 --> 00:59:42.890
but it's just he likes working on his speech.
He's so fast.

984
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:47.520
I think he's faster than me.
Forced like,
I mean,

985
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:52.160
it's an I'm like,
is that fast?
That much power.

986
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.620
I mean,
if he even,
I nicely,
what I say,

987
00:59:54.621 --> 00:59:57.620
if he touched anywhere near this circumference right here,

988
00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:59.750
you're going to wake up and ask what happened?
Well,

989
00:59:59.751 --> 01:00:01.850
that's what came was saying that he was,

990
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.880
he didn't remember what happened when Francis Francis apparently grazed him with

991
01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:08.930
the first punch near the back of his,

992
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:12.830
of his head and Canaan remember shit after that and then clipped him with that

993
01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:16.050
uppercut on the inside.
Everyone was saying like,
oh,
he hurt his knee.

994
01:00:16.051 --> 01:00:17.870
That's what it happened.
No,
he got hit with a punch in,

995
01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:22.580
there was a small shark punch.
All it takes with her,
but yeah.

996
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.370
Yeah.
What's,
what's amazing,
that steep pay weathered the storm.

997
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.930
That's what's amazing.
It was,
it goes,

998
01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.290
you got to give credit to steepen and steeper weather.

999
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:34.370
The storm when Francis was convinced he was going to put steep air way after the

1000
01:00:34.371 --> 01:00:38.930
Overeem destruction.
I mean,
he put over him into orbit.
Yeah.
To watch that.

1001
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:40.700
I was like,
Holy Shit.

1002
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:44.210
And you think that striking credentials of Allister,

1003
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:49.730
I mean Allister's glory,
heavyweight champion,
Strikeforce heavyweight champion,

1004
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:51.620
k one grom pre.

1005
01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:57.160
I mean he won the three of the most prestigious titles and combat sports.

1006
01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.270
And to have Francis clip him like that was just like cheeses and that goes

1007
01:01:02.271 --> 01:01:05.210
through test to MMA.
This is why the sports so great.

1008
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:10.070
It doesn't matter where you come from,
what you good,
it's well,
you're good at it.

1009
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.900
It doesn't matter.

1010
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:15.270
Those with those four ounce gloves and being able to wrestle him,

1011
01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.810
grapple and do all this,
everything changed.

1012
01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:20.570
It's an even playing field for everybody.
Yeah.

1013
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:23.780
Now if he just gets his wrestling on point,

1014
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:29.390
I mean he,
it's crazy that he's only been doing MMA all told for what,

1015
01:01:29.391 --> 01:01:33.560
five years now?
Yeah,
five,
six years.
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1016
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:38.560
I mean I made this switch around the same time we had our first official UFC

1017
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:43.430
fight the same time.
Wow.
Yeah.
In were was your first year of your first fight?

1018
01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:48.860
What was your first fight?
My first fight I think was in 2013 or 2012.

1019
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.370
So seven years ago.
Which is crazy.
Yeah.

1020
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.190
And how much striking and you'd done before you first fight?

1021
01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.250
Not a lot.
I mean,
I made,
the thing with me is like,

1022
01:01:58.251 --> 01:02:00.680
I used to watch videos when I was convinced myself,

1023
01:02:00.681 --> 01:02:04.090
like I was going to start doing this and this has been years in the making.

1024
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.730
Like I was,

1025
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:09.390
I coached on season 14 on the ultimate fighter with a Bisping and uh,

1026
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.360
may have Miller,
I was may hams wrestling coach.
So,

1027
01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:18.410
and that was the season with Tj Dillashaw,
John Dodson,

1028
01:02:18.411 --> 01:02:20.370
Dennis and all these guys.

1029
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:25.450
<v 2>And so at that point I had started to,
uh,
shout out to Ryan Parsis man,
uh,</v>

1030
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:30.420
Dr. Parsons one who brought me in.
He was managing Ma'am at the time.
And,

1031
01:02:30.421 --> 01:02:34.320
um,
I love Ryan.
Yeah.
Ryan is a good dude.
Super Good Guy,
man.

1032
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:38.250
I love drawing and uh,
and I was,
you know,
I'd fiddle with it.

1033
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:42.360
I throw up my hands a little bit like yeah,
do this one day.
You know,

1034
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:47.100
I just kind of playing around and playing around with it.
And so I love boxing.

1035
01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:49.620
I love watching and all that stuff.
I was like,
man,
you know,

1036
01:02:49.621 --> 01:02:51.240
maybe I'll do this stuff one day.

1037
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:55.500
But when I watched those guys go through the ultimate fighter being here in

1038
01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:58.830
Vegas,
it being in Vegas and in the house,
I was like yeah,
no way.

1039
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:03.240
I'm not doing that shit.
I'm never not doing it.

1040
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:05.340
Even back then you were thinking I'm just going to rustle.

1041
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.370
Yeah cause at that time I was living at the Olympic training center.

1042
01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:11.610
I was training for the Olympics.
I was like,
yeah,
I'm going to do this shit.
No,

1043
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:16.250
it's not wise.
What was it that flipped the switch?
Rashad really were shot.

1044
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:17.323
Um,

1045
01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:22.650
the same time I think 2011 I was still at the Olympic training center and I had

1046
01:03:22.651 --> 01:03:27.651
gone back and I'm just training and I was friends with King Mo.

1047
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.150
I've known King Mo ever since I was in high school.

1048
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:33.450
And funny thing is like,
man,

1049
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:35.880
like we were so connected because we were from similar,

1050
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:40.650
we're walking a similar paths,
king moles from like African descent.

1051
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.633
So Am I.

1052
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.180
And he wrestled in Texas and so was I in high school and then he's a division

1053
01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:52.260
two guy.
I went and division two,
he was an astro chip.

1054
01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:55.460
I was national champ and you know,
walk into similar paths.
I was,

1055
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.160
I just felt connected to king more so I would always talk to him.

1056
01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:03.000
I looked up to those guys,
king mourn in DC and they were like,
you know,
the,

1057
01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.210
the black dudes that you look up to because they want a lot of black wrestlers.

1058
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.320
So they was to do was that we looked up to was like,
yeah man,
Chemo.

1059
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.400
So he has been doing it for me.

1060
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:16.050
I think at that time he was the Strikeforce champion.
And so chemo calls me,

1061
01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:20.580
uh,
and my friend Jake Fisher,
who was a world team member at the time,
I,
Hey,

1062
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:25.040
you guys want to come down to Denver and train with us.
You know me,

1063
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:28.680
I'm going to train that night.
Of course I'm going to go training.

1064
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:33.000
We King Moma boy,
I get to see him,
you know,
so we go down,

1065
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:36.960
this is first time I've ever been starstruck in my life and this was now I've

1066
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:40.500
been watching them.
It may now,
you know,
I've done the show and all these things.

1067
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:44.760
So we get down there and we're an address for her mom.
You know,

1068
01:04:44.761 --> 01:04:47.190
I'm just thinking kick most coming in and we're going to work out with them.

1069
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.520
It was me,
Fisher,
TC Dantzler,

1070
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:56.060
and another kid named Bo and we're in the dressing room or changing and it was

1071
01:04:56.371 --> 01:05:01.290
Joe Warren's Jim.
We'll change Joe Warren,
Joe Warren,
man.

1072
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:04.620
Bad Ass.
It's a funny dude.
Yeah.
And we're,

1073
01:05:04.621 --> 01:05:08.430
we're changing and all of a sudden,
you know,
I'm changing.
I'll look back.

1074
01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:12.240
Rashad Evans walks in the fucking dressing room.
I had a,

1075
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.380
I had never been starstruck in my life.
I was inside.

1076
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.890
<v 5>That's
so of course</v>

1077
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:24.050
<v 2>play cool.
I ain't be that dual,
you know,
I ain't no fan boy.</v>

1078
01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:27.530
But I'm thinking in my motto,
Shit,
that's fucking Rashad Evans.

1079
01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.610
I just watched these dudes fight,
ran,
pays it.

1080
01:05:29.611 --> 01:05:34.010
And they did the ultimate fighter and all this joy like,
oh shit,
that was shot.

1081
01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:38.390
So we get,
we get back out and now we're training together,
we're wrestling.

1082
01:05:38.391 --> 01:05:40.850
And I just couldn't believe how,
you know,
good to this day.

1083
01:05:40.851 --> 01:05:45.470
He can fucking lie and say he took me down and didn't get one take down that

1084
01:05:45.471 --> 01:05:50.270
training session.
I freakin took him down several times,

1085
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:53.620
ran him off the mat.
But the one thing that I could,

1086
01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.480
I was impressed by how good of a wrestler he was.

1087
01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.480
And then I started doing my research.
I said,
oh,
he actually wrestled.

1088
01:05:59.481 --> 01:06:02.780
He used restaurant Michigan state.
He was a two times UCO champion.
Uh,

1089
01:06:02.781 --> 01:06:05.810
he was a wrestler that couldn't believe how good he was.

1090
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:10.520
But then after that session we sat on the Mat and we just talk.

1091
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:15.500
And the keeping in mind,
my whole mind is like,
shit,

1092
01:06:15.501 --> 01:06:17.300
I'm talking to a superstar here.

1093
01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:23.030
And he was at the top of the game and I couldn't believe like we talk like we

1094
01:06:23.211 --> 01:06:27.680
were brothers,
like we use homeys.
I,
we've been best friends,
great guy,
man.

1095
01:06:27.681 --> 01:06:32.450
I mean I could,
he floored me and I was just like,
shit,

1096
01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:33.483
I,

1097
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:38.300
that's Rashad Evans gave me his number after like give me his numbers.
Like,
Bro,

1098
01:06:38.301 --> 01:06:41.690
yeah,
me,
what'd you,
what you doing?
What are you going to do tonight?
I was like,

1099
01:06:41.691 --> 01:06:44.480
oh,
we got,
we got dropped by at to Colorado Springs.
He was like,
oh,
okay.

1100
01:06:44.481 --> 01:06:48.320
Well I'll be back in Denver.
I'm a hit you up,
you know,
talk like we were boys.

1101
01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.510
And of course I'm like,
it's like holding a piece of paper.
He's number on it.

1102
01:06:53.511 --> 01:06:55.090
I'm like,
Oh shit.
That's what shots number.

1103
01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.700
<v 5>So I go home,
it's like,
do I wait two days to text him?
Do I do I,</v>

1104
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.150
what do I do?
I do.

1105
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.480
Oh Shit.
There's upsides number.
It's just sitting on my desk.
I walked by it.

1106
01:07:12.481 --> 01:07:17.310
I look at it.
Oh good.
So,
uh,

1107
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.040
<v 2>he,
a week goes by and he frigging texted me.</v>

1108
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.000
He just texted me out of the blue like,
Yo,
what up man?
What's up?

1109
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:29.060
I'm going to be in Denver,
this niece in our next month or something like that.

1110
01:07:29.061 --> 01:07:32.680
Why don't you come to train with me?
I was like,
yeah,
yeah,
for sure.
For sure.

1111
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.120
So I went and traded with him again.
Um,
just,
you know,

1112
01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:41.970
hung out for a little bit and then he started at night.
It became regular.

1113
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.850
You texted me regularly like,
Hey,
I got a fight coming up by the fight,

1114
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.361
Phil Davis,

1115
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:49.270
I'm gonna Bring you down to Florida with me to train with me for two weeks.

1116
01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:54.190
Fuck you got fly me to Florida to try what you,
yeah,
yeah,
of course.
I'm down.

1117
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:59.200
So now I became like part of his training arsenal and every time that's it,

1118
01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:02.310
they want to show every time he would make fun of you and like,
you know,

1119
01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.940
like brothers do,
he'll poke fun at you.
You know,
you want to do MMA,
you know,

1120
01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.590
even want to do this.
You should be doing this here.
What are you over there?

1121
01:08:08.591 --> 01:08:09.940
Busting your button wrestling.

1122
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:13.390
Like you would train all through these whole risk Leslie camp,

1123
01:08:13.391 --> 01:08:15.980
go all the way to Russia or wrestle a tournament.
If you won the

1124
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.270
<v 1>tournament,
you got 1500 bucks and this guy's,</v>

1125
01:08:20.271 --> 01:08:22.940
I would help these guys train these guys,
go out and beat somebody up,

1126
01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:26.330
make 75 100,000 like what the fuck?

1127
01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:31.370
What am I in right now?
We're just going on.
And so he kept poking him.
He like,

1128
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:33.320
man,
you know you want to do this,
you really want to do that.

1129
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:38.350
So he slowly started to shift my motivation and my focus towards MMA instead of

1130
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.150
winning that Olympic goal.

1131
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:44.930
And then of course I was dealing with a lot of different injuries here and there

1132
01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:47.210
and tore up my knees on my back and I just,

1133
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.360
I started to feel like my chances of winning Olympic gold has started to

1134
01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:52.070
diminish more and more and more.

1135
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:55.160
And then I started falling in love with this sport here and there.

1136
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:59.450
And then I talked with him,
talk with Chemo and chemo was just like,
man,

1137
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:01.310
those straddle the fence man,

1138
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.140
because I straddle the fence and look what happened.

1139
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.140
Cause Chemo was supposed to be the Olympian and he was like,

1140
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:10.070
I straddled the fence and look,
I lost it.
The trials and no,
I mean,
I'm in May,

1141
01:09:10.071 --> 01:09:13.160
so if you go and do that,
just do that.
Or I was like,

1142
01:09:13.161 --> 01:09:16.730
I want you to come down in Florida.
I just freaking,
I was like,
man,
that's it.

1143
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:21.290
I'm done.
Wow.
Yeah.
No.
When we were talking about Cain Velasquez earlier,

1144
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:26.240
Kane has had a series of catastrophic injuries,
knee injuries,

1145
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:29.000
knee surgeries,
shoulder surgeries,
back surgery.

1146
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:32.510
When you think about your style,

1147
01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.480
that's kind of similar to his in a lot of ways,

1148
01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:39.440
and that you rely on pressure,
volume,

1149
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:42.730
mental toughness,
and wrestling,
all those things.
You're,

1150
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:44.660
you're constantly attacking.

1151
01:09:44.661 --> 01:09:48.810
You're constantly bombarding your opponent with,

1152
01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:50.510
with technique and with pressure.

1153
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.920
When you see that you've gone through all these surgeries and you see what

1154
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:56.690
happens with a guy like Cain,

1155
01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.900
whereas body just can't compete with his mental toughness anymore.

1156
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:00.733
It's almost like his book,

1157
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.840
his mind is too strong for his body and his body just breaks.
Yeah.
I mean,

1158
01:10:05.841 --> 01:10:10.520
it's cause it fuck with you at all.
It's a little bit because it's,
um,

1159
01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:14.390
it's like,
man,
you got to switch up because you want to have longevity.
Yes.

1160
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.930
I've had seven surgeries now.
So what's,

1161
01:10:17.931 --> 01:10:21.260
what have you done besides the five knee surgeries?
I've had fucking knees,

1162
01:10:21.261 --> 01:10:24.830
five knee surgeries and fat for meniscus on each four.

1163
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.180
Four she two on the left,
two on a ride.
And then I've also had a microfracture,

1164
01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:30.830
which is probably the one of the most,

1165
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:36.040
the biggest serious surgeries that I've had on my right knee now.
Is that one.

1166
01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:38.930
That one was ones where they try to regrow cartilage.
Yeah.
It's,

1167
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:42.290
I guess the process is they make break state.

1168
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.760
They make frank shores that condo to hopefully,

1169
01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:50.900
I guess you scar up,
you know,
generate a blood supply scar up.

1170
01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:54.170
So where it creates a little cushion but fucking it didn't work.

1171
01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:57.740
I feel like it set me back.
Ruined.
Yeah,
man.
Big Time.

1172
01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:03.010
You ever heard of a doctor Neil Riordan and a what they're doing down in Panama

1173
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:07.640
with a stem cells?
No,
I'm not.
No.
No.
I've never heard it.

1174
01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:08.990
I've heard of stem cells and I've,

1175
01:11:08.991 --> 01:11:12.850
I've actually had a round of stem cells and they're doing down in Panama.

1176
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:16.800
He talked to,
do you know Tj Dillashaw?
Yeah.
Know,
talk to him about it man.

1177
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:20.880
Cause he has some phenomenal actually sat my mom down there.
Yeah,

1178
01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.800
they were trying to get my mom and knee replacement surgery.
I was like,
wait,

1179
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:28.230
hold on mom.
Yeah,
let's,
let's see what we can do.
So I sent her down there.

1180
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:29.660
The Panama they can do he,

1181
01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:33.600
his office is in Dallas and I had them on with Mel Gibson.

1182
01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.480
Mel Gibson's dad when he sent them down,

1183
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:38.460
there was 92 when he was in a wheelchair.

1184
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:41.910
Now he's a hundred and he's walking around and wow.
According to melt.

1185
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:46.320
I didn't ask,
but according to Mel,
still getting hard ons.
I didn't ask.

1186
01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.070
I didn't,
I know the way

1187
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.380
he said.
Yeah.
I mean Mel's gone down himself and man,

1188
01:11:55.381 --> 01:11:57.930
I would go down if I had anything really wrong with me too.

1189
01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:01.350
I mean I've gotten a lot of stem cells done here in the states,

1190
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:03.690
but they can do some shit down there in Panama.

1191
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:07.500
They just cannot do here in terms of regulations and shit.

1192
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.520
And they're doing phenomenal work with regrowing cartilage and meniscus and all

1193
01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:14.340
kinds of shit.
Yeah,

1194
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:18.150
I mean I was basically a push right now while you're in recovery phase anyway,

1195
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:21.750
you should really should get in contact with them.
Yeah,
for sure.
I'm going to,

1196
01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:24.780
I'm definitely give that a try because they've,
they've helped TJ quite a bit.

1197
01:12:24.781 --> 01:12:26.990
I know other fighters have gone down there as well.
Yeah,

1198
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:30.690
that's something that definitely I'm going to look into because I knew,
you know,

1199
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.030
I mean when you're dealing with bone on bone,

1200
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:36.180
like I'm sure you probably are that I've been on for a long,
long time.

1201
01:12:36.181 --> 01:12:39.300
It's fucking hard to train a long time.

1202
01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:43.200
That's why it's so impressive your cardio because you can't run.

1203
01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:47.530
So you are you doing placebos as well?
Yeah,
I mean part of what?
Like,

1204
01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.490
like I said,
my strength and conditioning coach,
uh,
Corey,

1205
01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:54.660
we do a good job of adjusting to what I can or can't do.
And you know,

1206
01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:58.620
obviously back squats are not the biggest,
the best thing for me to be doing.

1207
01:12:58.621 --> 01:12:59.401
So we didn't modify.

1208
01:12:59.401 --> 01:13:04.020
We do different types of squats and things like that and we still get pretty

1209
01:13:04.021 --> 01:13:08.040
good results.
Do you do any swimming?
Yeah,
I play in the water a lot too.

1210
01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:08.850
And that that's,

1211
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:12.360
I do a lot of footwork stuff in the Lauder because it takes a lot of pressure

1212
01:13:12.361 --> 01:13:15.000
off.
I was forced like I can't,

1213
01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:18.840
I mean I'm not going to go in here and do backstrokes and all this crazy

1214
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:20.670
swimming techniques,
but you know,

1215
01:13:20.671 --> 01:13:24.160
I get in there to get that workout pool,

1216
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:26.520
dig into these friends.

1217
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.760
You said your shoulders are fucking with you two shoulders or,

1218
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:33.270
I mean I'm a wrestler,
you know,
shoulder's always gonna be banged up,
you know,

1219
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:38.010
but I haven't,
I've been fortunate,
no surgeries there yet.
But um,
yeah,

1220
01:13:38.011 --> 01:13:42.900
knees.
I've had surgeries five and then I tore this my index finger,

1221
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:44.580
that tendon right there.

1222
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:49.581
And I tore that my junior year in college and I tore that.

1223
01:13:51.651 --> 01:13:56.640
I had surgery with that to replace that repair that and then now this freaking

1224
01:13:56.910 --> 01:14:01.910
whole apparatus that I have going on in my lower abdomen Mesh.

1225
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.680
They do bro.
I,
um,
I did a little bit,
I told them cause they didn't,

1226
01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:09.210
the doc didn't want to work with Mesh that well cause he said that,
you know,

1227
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:12.130
there's good and bad results with the match.
You know,

1228
01:14:12.131 --> 01:14:16.450
I got this freaking drain coming out of me.
Right.
Oh Shit.
That,

1229
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.110
oh my goodness.
Look at that plus and stuff.

1230
01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:23.650
It was blood like it was basically the blood.
It's like a vacuum.

1231
01:14:23.651 --> 01:14:26.210
I think that's what they call it,
drain and blunt.
But now it's uh,

1232
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:28.540
it's coming down.
It's not that much blood coming out of there.

1233
01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:32.470
And how long ago was that?
Tuesday I got wow.
So yeah,
I've been,

1234
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:35.680
I have to walk around and maneuver,
wrote this thing in shoes.

1235
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.730
And the worst thing is the burning,
cause it's obviously sticking out of a hole.

1236
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:43.630
There's a hole in me.
So the burning sensation around it.

1237
01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.380
The third day I told the physical therapist the,
I was like,
Yo,

1238
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:49.010
I almost cut the shit off of it.
Says

1239
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:53.660
because I'm not big into the painkillers.
Right,
right know.

1240
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:57.430
So I'll take it maybe the day after I'll take it.
And,
you know,
maybe,

1241
01:14:57.570 --> 01:15:01.420
but they just don't do much for me.
It doesn't kill the paint.
I'm like,

1242
01:15:01.421 --> 01:15:04.770
why do they call these painkillers?
It doesn't kill the pain.
It does.
It does.

1243
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:09.260
It makes me a little loopy.
It makes me stupid as fuck.
I don't know either saw,

1244
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.360
I just have a bag of m and I just,
I don't want to do anything.
What about CBD?

1245
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:17.320
Do you use?
Uh,
I do man.
Shout out to all,
I'm sponsored by a love hemp.

1246
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:21.430
Beautiful love hemp is a UK companies.
Yeah.
Amazing.

1247
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:22.781
They're doing some really,

1248
01:15:22.781 --> 01:15:26.740
really big things and I'm big into like the oil I have and I have the rob and I

1249
01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.250
both,
I use those a lot.
So that's in my repertoire.
Yeah,

1250
01:15:31.251 --> 01:15:35.260
that's huge for anybody that's experiencing any kind of inflammation plus for

1251
01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:39.210
general anxiety and overall health.
CBD is fantastic.
Yeah.

1252
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:42.820
No psychoactive effects too,
you know,
cause that's the,
that's the,

1253
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:46.530
that's the freaking stigma behind it.
Like,
oh,
it's marijuana,
it's weed.

1254
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:51.540
And we were talking about marijuana before the podcast.
Like,

1255
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:55.830
oh,
I do it.
I'm like,
I'm coming on.
[inaudible] should I smoke?
No,

1256
01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:01.780
no.
We watch you watch,
you loose in here.
I want you to go into a hole.

1257
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.380
The problem is like when people don't get high and then they get high in a

1258
01:16:05.381 --> 01:16:09.160
pressure situation like this,
you're just like,
yeah,
go into that tunnel.

1259
01:16:09.161 --> 01:16:13.630
You're like,
oh my God.
Yeah.
It's um,
I've,
I've tried,

1260
01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:18.600
I've smoked four times in my life know how did it go?
Ah,
not good.
I mean,

1261
01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:27.160
the first time it was my 24th birthday,
24th birthday,

1262
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:30.220
uh,
I smoked with,
uh,

1263
01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:34.820
who has a couple of friends of mine at the Olympic Training Center and they

1264
01:16:34.821 --> 01:16:36.550
didn't do anything cause I don't even know how to,

1265
01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:41.170
I don't know how to hit the blind.
I don't know.
I didn't oil.
Yeah.
So it's like,

1266
01:16:41.171 --> 01:16:46.090
man,
this stuff don't affect me dying and do this.
So,
so,

1267
01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.540
so I did not even say,
screw that and you want to do it again.

1268
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:54.570
And then the next time was the year after with Jason Miller,

1269
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:58.630
my hand Miller.
Oh.
May Have knows how to hit that.
We had,
I was it,
we were doing,

1270
01:16:58.631 --> 01:17:01.390
it was doing the ultimate fighter when we were doing that.
And um,

1271
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:04.750
one thing we do at night is a lot of people expect like,
man,

1272
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:09.260
when he's not on his hat,
man,
super cool guy.

1273
01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:10.040
He's an amazing

1274
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.030
<v 2>dude.
I mean there's always like kind of like being around Mike Tyson and there's</v>

1275
01:17:14.031 --> 01:17:18.140
always like,
yeah,
there's always that edge to where you're in the room with the,

1276
01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.020
with the fricking lion.
Like,
yeah,
he's been the coolest lion ever.

1277
01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:24.860
But you still know what the fucking line and may hams like that you're in the

1278
01:17:24.861 --> 01:17:28.700
room,
everything's cool.
But he still has,
he can snap at any moment.

1279
01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:33.650
So we're sitting on the balcony at night and we'll just talk and he would just

1280
01:17:33.651 --> 01:17:37.310
talk about these.
And the weird thing about mayhem is he always watched,

1281
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:41.450
like he watched nothing but like smart shit.
Like the news,

1282
01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:45.380
like the Kobe or report or like things like that,
you know,
he wouldn't watch,

1283
01:17:45.381 --> 01:17:47.870
I would think he'd watch like nine oh two one o

1284
01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:53.680
or rigor,
the shows like that.
Like,
no man,
he,
you know,

1285
01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.530
he was very intelligent guy who would just sit there and talk at night.

1286
01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.040
And um,
he gave me that nickname that night too.
And freaking,

1287
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:06.620
he's like,
Bro,
you first name starts with a k,

1288
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.340
your last name is Bush,
man.
Oops,

1289
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:14.460
I'm going to fricking call you kush.
I'm calling you coach

1290
01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.300
fricking the next day on set,

1291
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:22.750
everyone calls me Kush till this day people call me Kush,

1292
01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.250
the Nigerian night free.
And at that time it wasn't born yet.

1293
01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.680
You know the name wasn't there cause that to start fighting yet.

1294
01:18:30.681 --> 01:18:34.940
But so I've had nicknames all through all throughout my life,
my career,

1295
01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:37.720
which is the whole been aspirin shit that he's trying to run with it though.

1296
01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:42.130
Is he crying you Marty,
Marty from the protocol.
The Marty from Nebraska.

1297
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.890
See this is the thing is when I started wrestling,
I started in high school.

1298
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:50.870
My coach was this big marine dude,
you know,
it was in shape bus.
Kurt.
Why Dude?

1299
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:55.430
And he comes up to me,
I'm five foot two a hundred pounds soaking wet.

1300
01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:00.650
And he's like,
oh.
He's like,
what's your,
what's your name,
kid?
I tell him buddy,

1301
01:19:00.651 --> 01:19:03.210
I don't even think he paid attention.
And he's like,
man,

1302
01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:05.390
what'd you to try to wrestling?
I'd never heard of wrestling.

1303
01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.100
All I've heard is WWE.
I'm like,
Nah man.
I try and get hit with chairs

1304
01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:10.600
<v 5>stuff.
I try to do that shit.</v>

1305
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.920
Ah,
okay.

1306
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.130
<v 2>We'll give it a shot.</v>

1307
01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:24.010
And our assistant wrestling coach was the assistant football coach,

1308
01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:27.230
so they kinda would poke at me.
Yeah,
you come try wrestling,
come try wrestling.

1309
01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.940
I'll do the football season.
Then the next year I freaking,

1310
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.140
I not it up and I freaking just sign up for wrestling.

1311
01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:40.360
I went in and,
um,
he looks at these reason role,

1312
01:19:40.361 --> 01:19:43.330
she calling names and he goes,

1313
01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:49.630
Kamar rude.
Who the fuck?
Who the fuck is this kid?

1314
01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:54.010
And uh,
as me coach,
and he's like,
that's your name.

1315
01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:56.561
He's like,

1316
01:19:56.561 --> 01:20:00.360
I'm not saying that because my whole full name is [inaudible] Kumar routine

1317
01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:05.360
Kamora dean.
And he's like,
I'm not going to say that.
Like,
C'mon commodity.

1318
01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:09.390
And in Kamar mark,
I'm going to call you Marty.
And I'm just like,

1319
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.490
yeah,
sure.
Coats.
I'm,
I'm fucking five foot,
300 pounds.

1320
01:20:13.491 --> 01:20:17.340
I'm just scared of this guy.
And I'm like,
sure,
let me your kid,
you don't care.

1321
01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:18.810
You're going to have nicknames all grown up.

1322
01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:23.340
So why does it UFC shorten your name to come on?
No,
I that's,

1323
01:20:23.341 --> 01:20:26.790
that's what my parents called me.
Oh yeah.
My parents call me tomorrow,

1324
01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:31.230
but the full,
it was like my,
my name is Joseph.
My parents call me Jo Jo.
Exactly.

1325
01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:33.750
Yeah.
So the,
you know,
so that it's,
it's Camaro.

1326
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:37.310
That's when my parents was calling me.
That's what I call myself.
Okay.
You know,

1327
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.310
but my full name is Joseph and you knows Camorra Dean.

1328
01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:45.420
So,
um,
so Marti,
yeah.
He's like,
I'm gonna call you Marty.

1329
01:20:45.421 --> 01:20:48.210
So fucking online now the whole team is calling me Marty

1330
01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.390
<v 1>and you know,
people are so fucked,</v>

1331
01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.020
man.
I love those names.
I love that coach,
man.
He essentially change,

1332
01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.720
essentially changed my life.
It changed the course of my life.

1333
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:05.600
That is such a funny thing though to do and call you.

1334
01:21:05.601 --> 01:21:10.100
Marty close starts with a totally different letter.

1335
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:14.060
I know,
but it seems to work.
It works so well

1336
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.490
<v 2>to where,
um,
this is the thing about nicknames.
If you fucking,</v>

1337
01:21:17.491 --> 01:21:21.120
if you're a guy like just a regular average guy,
you suck.

1338
01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:25.540
Your name dies with you,
you move on on care,
you know,

1339
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.630
but if you're doing something incredible,

1340
01:21:27.631 --> 01:21:32.040
something spectacular that named lives are so now Marty went from just now

1341
01:21:32.041 --> 01:21:36.240
everyone on the team call me Marty to where people know about the wrestling

1342
01:21:36.241 --> 01:21:38.010
around the wrestling cert kit,
you know,

1343
01:21:38.011 --> 01:21:40.980
in high school or calling me Marty or that Marty guy that did kids good.

1344
01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.450
And then our college coaches are calling like,
oh,
I want to recruit this kid.

1345
01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:50.450
You know,
this Kamari and kid.
And he's like,
oh Marty.
So now they,
oh no,

1346
01:21:50.451 --> 01:21:54.480
me as Marty.
So now I go to college and the coach is calling me Marty,

1347
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:58.620
and now the college team is calling me Marty.
Now here's the situation.

1348
01:21:58.621 --> 01:22:02.340
But this whole Ben asks,
one thing is like I just mentioned,

1349
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:06.300
if I was just a regular guy whose son,
no one cares.
No one knows your name,

1350
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:07.134
you die out.

1351
01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.280
But because I made waves like I was that Marty kid that wrestled at Nebraska

1352
01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.990
that's beaten the shit out of everyone.
Division One,
two,
three,

1353
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:19.890
Nai Juko does it matter?
Ben knows of me.

1354
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:24.090
So you know,
he's trying to cling on as something to bring it back.

1355
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:26.450
Like oh this is funny.
I'm trying to hide from it.
No,
no.

1356
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:31.470
<v 1>I really was Marty from Nebraska and everyone's at all as Marty from Nebraska.</v>

1357
01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:37.270
I really was that guy.
So you know,
for him to bring it up,
I thought it was silly.

1358
01:22:37.271 --> 01:22:39.450
But you know these fans,
Fans wanna they,

1359
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:42.400
cause Ben is a representative of the trolls.

1360
01:22:42.401 --> 01:22:45.860
Like most of the trolls look like Ben asked if I could give you any info.

1361
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:49.840
That's hilarious.
If I can give you any advice,

1362
01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:52.420
please don't pay attention.

1363
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:57.450
I don't pay attention to comments.
You know that glass jar?
Yeah.

1364
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.810
Once you smashed that,
scientists don't even put anything in there anymore,
man.

1365
01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:06.190
Don't,
nothing.
I,
and I've,
I've heard you say that so times like I um,

1366
01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:08.620
when I started paying attention to the show,

1367
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:12.550
I started watching the show and I watched the one you did with Tyron when Tyron

1368
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:15.090
was up here and,
and you so right.
Like some,

1369
01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:19.270
cause that's the one thing that I always felt like so unfair about Tyron is a

1370
01:23:19.271 --> 01:23:21.700
lot of people just gave him shit because,

1371
01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:24.610
and I think it started because he didn't take that belt.

1372
01:23:24.611 --> 01:23:27.830
They didn't dethrones George San Pierre.
So I,

1373
01:23:27.831 --> 01:23:31.620
I think a lot of it stemmed from that.
I know about that man.
I know it does it,

1374
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:35.420
it can be stopped.
Robbie Lawler if that didn't give him,
I understand but,

1375
01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:39.310
but George Saint Pierre still looping around is that there was a big champion

1376
01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:44.140
but sort of not because he retired.
He said I'm going to step away.
Yeah.
But he,

1377
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.250
he stepped away.
Yes.
I understand.
For you of being the,

1378
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:51.280
obviously you know so much about the sport,
you being in the sport for so long.

1379
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:53.650
Yes.
But for these fickle fans don't know shit.

1380
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.580
That's why he can't listen to all they know is it's George Saint Pierre Verse.

1381
01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.780
Epi was a champion.
He never lost Isabelle.

1382
01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:04.360
So I felt like Tyron and forgot his fair share necessarily.

1383
01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:05.890
I feel like the same because,

1384
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:10.290
because he never took the belt from George and he always wanted the Wonderboy

1385
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.180
fights.
I think the Wonderboy fights were so fucking hard.
Yeah.

1386
01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:16.780
But even even then before that,
fight Wonderboy,
that way,

1387
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.870
that is the way you fight that guy.
Yes.
You know,

1388
01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.500
unless you know someone like me comes in and doesn't eat,
what would you do it?

1389
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:25.060
What would you do?
I don't know.
I just do.

1390
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.810
I just do me cause he's still in the mix.
How would you do me?
You know,

1391
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:32.330
I will eventually get ahold of them.
I will eventually break him and you know,

1392
01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:36.010
eventually make it look easy and then people are going to just complain.

1393
01:24:36.011 --> 01:24:38.860
So it is what it is.
Yeah.
The,
the,
the,

1394
01:24:38.861 --> 01:24:42.830
the problem with him is he's so difficult to get close to me.

1395
01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.640
He's a different guy because his style so different,

1396
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:50.230
he'll stand totally sideways on you.
His hands will be down and he can wrestle.

1397
01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:52.450
I mean in terms of takedown defense,

1398
01:24:52.451 --> 01:24:56.410
he's got good take down defense and his strikes come from fucking weird angles,

1399
01:24:56.411 --> 01:24:59.260
man.
He moves like a snake.
Like he bends at the waist,

1400
01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:03.670
then pops forward watching kickbox and Africa and well,
but I saw that,
you know,

1401
01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:06.850
I knew it was a problem when he threw that one kick that came over the fucking

1402
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.220
shoulder and smacked question mark.

1403
01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.840
It was weird isn't off the front leg.
He's very good with it.
He just,

1404
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.130
you don't even know what's going on.

1405
01:25:15.131 --> 01:25:18.120
He think maybe he's going to kick you in the body.
Yep.
Surround,

1406
01:25:18.121 --> 01:25:21.730
surround comes over the top and it smacks you in the Fed.
Nah,
he's very talented.

1407
01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:23.710
Like I like wondering what law,
you know,

1408
01:25:23.711 --> 01:25:28.210
but like I just felt like I saw that show at I and you said the exact same thing

1409
01:25:28.211 --> 01:25:30.730
to them and that's what I said too.
And that's what I was thinking too.

1410
01:25:31.150 --> 01:25:35.260
But it is your centered none because partially what I,

1411
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:36.550
I got into this and why,

1412
01:25:36.551 --> 01:25:40.870
why I appreciate the platform that I have right now is the fact that you can

1413
01:25:40.871 --> 01:25:45.871
affect so many people at such a rapid amount of time because there's been an

1414
01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:52.690
instance to where,
I don't know if you ever remember that movie,

1415
01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:56.230
what women want and Mel Gibson,
Mel Gibson,

1416
01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:00.250
I didn't watch it and basically he could hear women's thoughts and things like

1417
01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:04.160
that.
And then there was a,
there was a girl in the office in the movie

1418
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.960
<v 2>who she was planning to kill herself because no one really paid attention to
her.</v>

1419
01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:11.450
She's like,
no one would care.
And she's walked around with books.

1420
01:26:11.451 --> 01:26:14.180
I applied for a job,
everyone blew me off.
No one cares.

1421
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:15.980
I'm going to kill myself this day.

1422
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:20.540
So she was planning to kill herself and he heard her because he could hear what

1423
01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:22.070
women think.
He heard a thoughts,

1424
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:26.210
but initially didn't really pay attention to it until later on he realized she

1425
01:26:26.211 --> 01:26:30.830
was missing from the office and then he like ran to go find her and essentially

1426
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:34.250
saved her life.
But my thing is,

1427
01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:37.670
and that's a quote that I live by with great power comes great responsibility.

1428
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:43.090
Like what if there's someone that's dealing with something at a certain time and

1429
01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:48.160
yes,
I didn't ask to be put in that position,
but they,
you know,

1430
01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:50.180
and they just decided,
oh,
I'm just going to reach out.

1431
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.540
I'll send a message before I kill myself this day.

1432
01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.470
No one's going to respond and one's going to care.

1433
01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:59.330
And I happened to read that message and talk to that kid off the ledge and that

1434
01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:02.000
kid becomes fucking,
you know,

1435
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:04.370
wins the Nobel peace prize later on in life.

1436
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:08.000
Like that's a responsibility that I have that I didn't,

1437
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:09.080
I didn't put that on myself,

1438
01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:13.340
but that I have with the gift that I've been blessed with to touch so many

1439
01:27:13.341 --> 01:27:14.174
people.

1440
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:19.460
And so how am I going to know that if I never read any of my messages or

1441
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:23.060
comments and things like that?
Yes,
of course.
I,
you know,
all the negative ones.

1442
01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:25.640
Yeah.
Blow and blow it up.
Well,
how do I know it's negative if I don't read it?

1443
01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.460
You all,
so that's what I'm saying.
It's easier said than done.

1444
01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:31.070
It's like I read this.
If now what I do is I read,

1445
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:35.510
if I even feel like it's getting negative dilly,
dilly,
dilly,

1446
01:27:35.511 --> 01:27:39.530
I can't read them all.
Cause after that fight fucking I got thousands,
I'm sure.

1447
01:27:39.531 --> 01:27:41.090
So you know,
I can't read them all.

1448
01:27:41.091 --> 01:27:44.360
But every now and again when I'm bored enough and I have time,

1449
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:48.380
like I'll read some of it because sometimes it is good,
good things,
but you know,

1450
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:50.750
<v 1>most of the time it's easy things</v>

1451
01:27:58.470 --> 01:28:02.290
there.
You know I shit you not.
And there was a,
yesterday I posted a picture,

1452
01:28:02.291 --> 01:28:07.291
there was one guy that responded to maybe 40 to 50 people are negative shit.

1453
01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:14.800
Oh yeah,
we'll give out as an Instagram do you are going to die in this.

1454
01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:18.130
And you know what I did is I just blocked him.
It's like,
Oh man,

1455
01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:21.160
you're going to get knocked the fuck out.
You're going to do this.
I'm just like,

1456
01:28:21.161 --> 01:28:25.470
oh my God.
Like Bro,
really?
You literally took your dead time out of your day.

1457
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.520
We sit here today,
just knocked and he saw your face.
Imagine.

1458
01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:33.820
Oh my God,
I wish.
I wish we could do that.

1459
01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.870
And he answered it gets who answers the door is bad ass grin.
He looks like

1460
01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:45.850
just fucking belly out like this.
Is there traded a day in his life.

1461
01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:49.900
What did you think?
You have the Robbie Lawler fight with Ben.
Oh Man.
Like I mean,

1462
01:28:49.901 --> 01:28:54.460
come on.
They got to run that back.
I was thinking when it was over,

1463
01:28:54.461 --> 01:28:57.250
the herb dean made a mistake,
but the more I watched it,

1464
01:28:57.251 --> 01:29:01.180
the more I think he didn't.
I think what happened was,
I think Robbie went out.

1465
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:04.770
I think his arm dropped and I think when herb came over,

1466
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:07.110
this is what Dan says too,

1467
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:11.450
that he loosened up the choke a little bit and Robbie came back to it and Robbie

1468
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:14.100
probably doesn't even know because Robbie's such a fucking savage.

1469
01:29:14.101 --> 01:29:16.990
She probably didn't even know he went out.
Yeah,
but okay then.
Yeah.

1470
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:20.370
This is the argument and this is why it has to be ran back.
Yeah.

1471
01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.200
There's a good argument.
He said that,
you know,

1472
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:26.160
this is a argument because first of all,
when when,

1473
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:30.780
when Robbie ran that truck through Ben's face like he was at,

1474
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:34.890
it's funny way of putting it.
He was out and welcome.
He recovered.

1475
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.500
I mean he got hit with some fucking bombs,
but we're freaking wrestlers.

1476
01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:43.110
The one thing about wrestlers at the elite level is you can be out of it,

1477
01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:47.660
but your body will naturally go through certain motions,
grab a leg,
pull up,

1478
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:49.920
probably was bombing on him.

1479
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:55.970
Robby ran a Mack truck through his face like that was undecided.

1480
01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:59.670
Like pull that fight up truck through his face.

1481
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.420
Like I feel like Robbie knocked him out,
woke him up,
knock him out.

1482
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:06.870
Like Robby was just savage mode and,

1483
01:30:06.871 --> 01:30:09.780
and that's the one thing about Ra and no one Robin now,

1484
01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:14.550
because I trained with him,
is it Robert is such a different guy.
Like he,
he's,

1485
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:20.430
well he,
you know,
the way handle handled the loss was so classy,

1486
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:24.240
but that's Robbie man.
That's the explanation.

1487
01:30:24.241 --> 01:30:27.180
This is the thing with the explanation is you can argue that fight should have

1488
01:30:27.181 --> 01:30:30.300
been stopped when Robbie was know bombing on him.

1489
01:30:30.330 --> 01:30:32.430
You could argue that for sure.

1490
01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:37.580
But at the same time a Rabi explains it is Robbie has so much experience and it

1491
01:30:37.581 --> 01:30:40.620
was a bulldog.
It's like big brother choke.
So you know,

1492
01:30:40.650 --> 01:30:45.030
it could have not been doing anything but Robbie explained it as I put my hand

1493
01:30:45.031 --> 01:30:48.090
down because this wasn't doing shit each chill,
relax,
you know,

1494
01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:50.550
cause I don't want to panic.
Robbie has that much experience.

1495
01:30:50.551 --> 01:30:53.490
He should know what to do with it.
Maybe that's what he was doing.
Good.

1496
01:30:53.491 --> 01:30:56.970
But the way he put his arm down,
it looked like it was owl.

1497
01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.860
But then when rob,

1498
01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:04.050
when herb dean came to check on him while he was giving a thumbs,
thumbs up,

1499
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.780
herb dean didn't really give him a chance to put the thumbs up and stops the

1500
01:31:06.781 --> 01:31:09.870
fight right then and there.
But as far as,
oh,
I loosened to choke.

1501
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:12.990
That's why he came to know was a fucking legal.
Loosen the choke until this,

1502
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.660
the ref pulls you off of him or you pop his head off.

1503
01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:19.770
He said it lightened up when herb came over because he thought that herb was

1504
01:31:19.771 --> 01:31:21.750
going to stop the fight cause he felt Robbie go limp.

1505
01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:24.300
You don't lighten up because you think someone's going to stop a fight.

1506
01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.850
You don't.
You don't.
You don't lie.

1507
01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:30.150
You know because you think you squeezed harder because you want to make him stop

1508
01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:32.100
the fight.
I see a point in also,

1509
01:31:32.190 --> 01:31:36.120
there is a difference between squeezing someone out and beaten on them when the

1510
01:31:36.121 --> 01:31:36.751
referees coming,

1511
01:31:36.751 --> 01:31:41.210
if the referee comes and you stop punching because that's one,

1512
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.600
that's one thing,
but you don't,

1513
01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.350
you have him in a bolt ear here in survival mode.

1514
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:49.020
You can't like really you were in survival mode,

1515
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:53.670
but boltok chokes are legit.
I mean they really do work.

1516
01:31:54.330 --> 01:31:56.460
Yeah,
I'm not going,
I'm not going to let you know.
Listen,

1517
01:31:56.461 --> 01:31:59.010
I'm not going to say it's lost the title.
Yeah.
Lips.

1518
01:31:59.030 --> 01:32:01.810
I'm not going say it and caught him in a bulldog choke.
Remember that?
Yeah.

1519
01:32:01.811 --> 01:32:04.480
I'm not going to say that.
Don't work.
I'm not going to say that.
I'm not going to,

1520
01:32:04.490 --> 01:32:06.280
you know,
he could've been out.
He could have knocked me out,

1521
01:32:06.281 --> 01:32:11.140
but the only way to to put that all to raz is to run it back.

1522
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:15.640
But what,
what kind of sucks is when you're like,
no,
I pass.
I,
I mean I might pass.

1523
01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:19.270
What do you what?
Come on Bro.
Relax.

1524
01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:22.360
He said he didn't want to fight him in the first place.
Well,
no,
Shit.
Yeah,

1525
01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:26.380
we'll probably looks sensational.
Robbie looked like a fucking Saturday.

1526
01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.380
We're going to watch it right now.
Here we go.
We're going to watch this shit.

1527
01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:33.200
Then look at the body.
You laughing.

1528
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:35.203
Come on and say

1529
01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:41.980
that's the ideal combat sports body.
Look at this.

1530
01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:46.540
But it is amazing that he's able to get ahold of Robbie.
I was stunned.
No,

1531
01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:50.140
I knew he was going to get ahold of rob right away.
They sat out.

1532
01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:53.950
Crazy savage moon.
Boom.
Not eat that.
Eat that.
Eat that.

1533
01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:59.160
He's a big shot,
Huh?
Huh?
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
I'm out.
Otis.

1534
01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:04.210
Geeky still there.
He's no evidence that these out.
See the hands?

1535
01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:05.620
No,
no,
I don't think so.

1536
01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:08.350
I think he's eating his shot and then he's got the clinch.

1537
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.820
I don't think he was ever out.
No,
there were certain moments he was.
He was,

1538
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:14.800
well he definitely ate some big shots,

1539
01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:19.160
but I don't think there's any evidence at all to me was out.
This is the thing,

1540
01:33:19.530 --> 01:33:21.220
like ban is toughest shit though.

1541
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:24.670
Like I give credit where credit is tough as hell.
Man.

1542
01:33:24.671 --> 01:33:28.090
He's tough as hell and right now he's just drunk driving right now.

1543
01:33:28.091 --> 01:33:31.420
He jumped out of it and he's a one truck drive.
The funny way to put it,

1544
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:32.630
he's just driving right.

1545
01:33:32.631 --> 01:33:35.620
And I look at this drunk driving but now Robbie books free.

1546
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:40.580
See I forget the actual strength scramble that led to the bulldog choke.
Yeah.

1547
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.080
It happens from when Robbie tries to get up cause he does get to take to,

1548
01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:47.320
oh look,
he's drunk driving.
Oh my God man.
A lot of blood.

1549
01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:52.300
You caught him with a nasty lefthand there.
Yeah.
Like we're just looking for,

1550
01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:56.600
we're looking for a bomb and Ben is just moving forward like a Zombie.

1551
01:33:56.650 --> 01:33:58.540
He grabs a hold of them was interesting.

1552
01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:01.120
Interesting that he was able to grab a hold of them because I would've thought

1553
01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:03.250
that Robert would have avoided that shit at all costs.

1554
01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.670
But that that's why he's able to grab a hold of someone and he's when someone is

1555
01:34:06.671 --> 01:34:07.830
so you know,

1556
01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:12.370
worried about you grabbing them and they each kind of shuts them down a little

1557
01:34:12.371 --> 01:34:14.980
bit.
Good needs of the body there by Robbie.
Yeah.

1558
01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:16.300
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.850
<v 1>That's the thing you did in the tire and fight those fucking body shots.</v>

1560
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:23.180
Good Lord.
I was trying to take that paper home.

1561
01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.940
You hit him with so many right hands to the body.

1562
01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:31.700
So here we see Ben Clinch.
Yeah,
he's doing a good job here is trying to,

1563
01:34:31.701 --> 01:34:35.470
he's trying to come to where he's trying to,
you know,
recover,
doing a good job,

1564
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:39.530
keeping it close.
Now you can get really get hit with big shots,
you know.

1565
01:34:39.531 --> 01:34:42.350
And he does get the take down at some point.
Yeah.

1566
01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:46.400
I do not remember how it happened or what was it?
Here it is.
Here it is.

1567
01:34:46.670 --> 01:34:47.570
He reaches down.

1568
01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.840
So he's got them in the clinch here.
He's got the under hook and the left side,

1569
01:34:56.670 --> 01:34:57.890
and so some were okay.

1570
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.450
<v 2>He grabs the leg.
I do.
It was this interesting,
I don't remember this.</v>

1571
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:07.220
All I remember is the open exchange and then the final exchange.
Yeah,

1572
01:35:07.810 --> 01:35:11.480
he see right now he's trying to go 201 yes.
Good job.

1573
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:15.140
So he's got the single single Robbie doing a good job.

1574
01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:16.550
Now he's got the hands class together.

1575
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.220
It's amazing to me how good of a wrestle he is.

1576
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:23.120
I'm going to be honest with you that it's just funky because it's like not

1577
01:35:23.121 --> 01:35:27.200
really muscles there.
It's just like Gumby,
but you know,

1578
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:31.460
it's not going anywhere,
but it's tricky.
Very tricky.
Yeah.
Very,

1579
01:35:31.461 --> 01:35:36.270
very sneaky.
Very chicken down.
And now Robbie's on his back.
He's,
it's,

1580
01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:40.550
yeah.
Sort of in talking to you.
Okay.
So now he's got an arm,
typical robberies.

1581
01:35:40.551 --> 01:35:44.990
He Robbie's just chilling.
Boom.
He started circles.
Owl.
He's got the headlock.

1582
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:49.170
Okay.
Now he's got the headlock,
and now watch that.
Right.
See this position.
Yeah,

1583
01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:53.720
but see this position,
she,
Robbie puts it down.
Yeah,
it's moving.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1584
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:57.110
Nope.
Yup.
See,
changed my mind again.
Yeah.
I like to see that's,

1585
01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.630
that's what's tricky about that since that's what's tricky about that.

1586
01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:02.000
I changed my mind again.
I don't think he was out.
No,
see,

1587
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:05.960
because you first get up to just to the arm going limp because the thing about

1588
01:36:05.961 --> 01:36:08.510
the arm going limp is the way it went.
Limp looked.

1589
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.920
It really looked like he was okay.
But this is it.

1590
01:36:11.921 --> 01:36:16.070
This is what I'm saying right here is initially in the situation.
Wait,

1591
01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:20.260
wait till he turns.
Wait till he turns when,
right.
Right.

1592
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:23.630
Wait to pull his arms out.
Boom.
Right here.
See,
this is uncomfortable.

1593
01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.250
This is very uncomfortable.

1594
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:27.860
Like you're spread out here and the guy's choking on your neck.

1595
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:30.020
You got to bring one down to relieve pressure.

1596
01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:33.160
Either that one down or take this one inside.
Yeah,
he was.

1597
01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:38.080
So Robbie did the approach right thing or the arm fell down whether he was out.

1598
01:36:38.110 --> 01:36:42.980
So man,
it,
it's a tough goal man.
One more time.
Let me see.

1599
01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:46.580
That arm drops his back it up just a little bit here.
So the way it drops,

1600
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:50.370
he'd like,
nobody moves immediately.
Boom.

1601
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:54.440
So hard to know.
Yeah,
he might,
he has been dealing with the choke.
Yup.
Yup.

1602
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:58.040
And that changed my mind.
And it's a typical Robbie man cause Robbie says,

1603
01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:02.270
Robby says,
man,
I experience,
he said,
man,
I knew that that was uncomfortable.

1604
01:37:02.271 --> 01:37:06.770
So I just put my arm down,
chillin.
Yeah,
that's,
and that's it.
No,

1605
01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:11.570
I'm on your side.
Fuck Bro.
There's only one.
You have to run that back.
I would,

1606
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:16.100
I would say so.
But the,
how much can the UFC tell him what to do?

1607
01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:20.390
Like what could the UFC,
what he said to Ben Aspirin,
listen,

1608
01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:25.420
this fight has to happen again.
That's like that's the sport we're hid.

1609
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.280
UFC,
the judge,
the jury.

1610
01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.060
And if they want the execution,
what did it Ben,

1611
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:34.220
what did a Dana white say after the fight?

1612
01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:36.470
He said he wanted Ben to fight him again,
right?
Yeah.

1613
01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:37.880
Dana said we're going to run that back.

1614
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:44.160
And Ben's like not pass man.
I Dunno Robbie.
He's like,
yeah,

1615
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:45.800
we gotta do it again.
Well,

1616
01:37:45.801 --> 01:37:47.840
I know Robbie was England for a fight with Darren till,

1617
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:52.260
but after Mazda all starch staring until,
which was nasty.
Nasty.

1618
01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:56.640
People sleep on Mazda though.
They do or do not know why I don't understand it.

1619
01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:01.260
Go back and watch those backyard fights.
That guy's been going at it a long time.

1620
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:02.750
Hey Man.
And he,
man,

1621
01:38:02.770 --> 01:38:07.440
that's he to better both backyard right now and that he just had again this

1622
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.400
weekend.
Yeah,
I know.
That was crazy.
It's about um,

1623
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:16.640
you know,
you can't just talk like nowadays it's this error.

1624
01:38:16.641 --> 01:38:19.650
You could just say whatever you feel like you could say what you want because

1625
01:38:19.651 --> 01:38:23.310
he's social media.
You want to get fans on your side and this and that.

1626
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:28.290
And he just happened to say it to the wrong guy at the wrong time.

1627
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:32.600
Like that.
That's the situation.
And you did it backstage to mass.

1628
01:38:32.690 --> 01:38:36.710
It don't give a fuck.
Like it's mutual.
I think I,

1629
01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:41.070
I think it's a mutual respect with me and mass with all I like I respect him,

1630
01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:43.800
you know?
I mean if we have to fight,
we have to fight one day.

1631
01:38:43.801 --> 01:38:47.700
But you know like we feel the same when it's like if you're going to talk shit

1632
01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:52.380
online when I see you keep the same energy.
Like when I saw Ben Astrin backstage,

1633
01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:55.740
the only thing that stopped me from pushing his head through that wall back

1634
01:38:55.741 --> 01:38:55.901
there,

1635
01:38:55.901 --> 01:39:00.000
it was the fact that I almost blacked out blacktop when I was walking towards

1636
01:39:00.001 --> 01:39:04.770
him.
Then I realize Dana was right behind.
So you were angry.

1637
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:09.720
It wasn't that I was angry.
It was the fact that Bro,
like if you're,
you're,

1638
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:12.540
you came at me online like you had a problem with me.

1639
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.780
Like you started talking mad shit to me.

1640
01:39:15.781 --> 01:39:19.020
Like you had a problem like saying things,
putting up means and all of this.

1641
01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.930
To me that means like you have a problem.
I don't know what I did to you,

1642
01:39:21.931 --> 01:39:24.750
but you've got a problem with me.
So when I see you now,

1643
01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:28.110
like I want you to still have that same energy.
Don't just act like we're cool.

1644
01:39:28.111 --> 01:39:31.590
Like what's up bro?
Yo,
we want to hug it out.
Don't look like that.

1645
01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:34.470
Act like you still have the problem.
Same problem.

1646
01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:38.160
But do you think he's just trying to market?
I mean Ben,
not ever,
but that's,

1647
01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:42.380
that's fun anger.
That's attitude towards them.
But that's what I'm saying.

1648
01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:42.901
That's the thing.

1649
01:39:42.901 --> 01:39:45.540
Like people are kind of letting them off with certain things now.

1650
01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.990
Now what happens if mass full doll would have started him like that backstage

1651
01:39:49.991 --> 01:39:52.950
because he did talk shit.
You got to what happened if that was him?

1652
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:57.270
Mass Woodall starts like that.
What happens?
Yeah.
You know,

1653
01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.510
so that,
that was my thing is I,
when I saw him backstage,

1654
01:40:00.511 --> 01:40:02.880
I almost wanted to push his head through the wall,

1655
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.590
but not really like Dennis behind me.
Brian's bye [inaudible] now in,
uh,
in,

1656
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:12.220
in England because they don't like that shit over there.
I don't know.

1657
01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.640
But I think he got away Scot free.
Really?

1658
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:18.270
I think I haven't heard anything and everything's fine.
He's in the backyard.

1659
01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:22.510
That's hilarious.
If that's the case,
cause that's the salt.
Yeah.

1660
01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:25.530
But I mean,
I guess it's hard.
It's hard.

1661
01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.480
It's hard to say a salt when you're dealing with UFC fighter.
Right.
And so hard.

1662
01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:34.310
He played basketball off the court.
Absolutely.
You know,
it's hard to say that.

1663
01:40:34.330 --> 01:40:36.510
So it's a tricky,
tricky situation.

1664
01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:39.280
But he struck them out in the parking lot and yeah,

1665
01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:44.910
I have to baseball but I think David and then Dana put out a statement saying

1666
01:40:44.911 --> 01:40:47.280
that that can't happen anymore.
We got to do a better,
something like that.

1667
01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:52.170
We should do a better job of having security around two separate guys.

1668
01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.130
They did it on my,
they

1669
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.810
<v 1>didn't let me near been aspirin or a cold dead.
Yeah.
There was one time,</v>

1670
01:40:58.870 --> 01:41:03.640
not before this fight,
but before a previous fight where you were backstage.

1671
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:07.060
It was actually,
was it a press conference?
It was a press conference.

1672
01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:10.600
And you were trying to talk to Colby like what's up man?
Shit.

1673
01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:13.960
Yeah I was scheduled to fight Santiago ponds in the bones.
That's right.

1674
01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:18.220
And we were doing a big press conference and they happened to have like,

1675
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:20.950
I didn't even know he was there cause they hit,

1676
01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.380
they had them hidden away the whole time.

1677
01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:27.040
It wasn't until we were going to get on the bus to go to the press conference.

1678
01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:30.490
He came downstairs like we were all meeting in the lobby and I saw him and right

1679
01:41:30.491 --> 01:41:33.310
away I told him I,
I don't know what it is.
I just,

1680
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:37.150
I stopped my boy and I just started your blood.
My blood just started bawling.

1681
01:41:37.151 --> 01:41:39.670
I started.to a read.
I was,
I read man,
this is not gonna work.

1682
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:41.750
This is not a word you all,
you gotta move and reuse.

1683
01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.110
We're getting them right now.
We're moving from and read,

1684
01:41:44.111 --> 01:41:45.670
but it puts them in a different car and every,

1685
01:41:45.671 --> 01:41:48.100
all the other fighters right together.
And this is what I mean,

1686
01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:50.860
he's already isolated.
That's so,
so we get there,

1687
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:53.350
but we have to line up to walk out.

1688
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:58.950
So he's lined up and he just happened to be my vicinity and Isaiah's free.

1689
01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.230
I was trying,
I was like,
yeah,

1690
01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.450
I'm not going to say at night and I'm not going to say I'm not going to say
nine.

1691
01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.140
I just look at him.
Yo,
I see you was talking all that shit online now.

1692
01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:11.230
Now we in person.
You can't talk.

1693
01:42:11.231 --> 01:42:14.560
What's up with all that shit you was talking online,
you thought she was tough.

1694
01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.190
What?
What's up with that was that tough guy now and he's just like,

1695
01:42:18.191 --> 01:42:21.160
I think he was reading his lines like what he was going to say when he got out

1696
01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:22.000
there and press called me,

1697
01:42:22.001 --> 01:42:25.720
they use this like weed and he heard me and he's like shit,

1698
01:42:25.721 --> 01:42:28.810
I don't want to say nothing.
Shit.
I could get my ass whooped right here

1699
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:34.930
and I could set all those thoughts was contemplating and Whitaker was standing

1700
01:42:34.931 --> 01:42:39.120
next to him and Whitaker does one of these joint like look wrote fuck this new

1701
01:42:39.121 --> 01:42:40.100
talk it too.

1702
01:42:41.410 --> 01:42:44.410
Cause I had to watch the video over and over where it could look bad.

1703
01:42:44.411 --> 01:42:48.610
Like he ain't talking to me and then saw Colby was like,

1704
01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.640
oh he's talking to Kolby so Whitaker just kindly slid off to the side and I'm

1705
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:56.740
get,
I'm like,
what's up with all that shit you was talking.

1706
01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.410
And then he's like quiet,
quiet.

1707
01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:04.470
And then he sees the security kind of cause then they heard me and security kind

1708
01:43:04.601 --> 01:43:08.730
of walks.
I didn't even know there was a camera back there.
Uh,

1709
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:11.980
and then security walks up and security,
he's like,
Yo,
you don't know.
No,

1710
01:43:11.981 --> 01:43:16.350
we don't need this.
We don't need this.
And this was,
uh,
what Prescott,

1711
01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.460
uh,
could be,
was about to fight.

1712
01:43:18.461 --> 01:43:23.110
This was after that Connor could be bus situation.
Yes.

1713
01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:26.170
And so they're like,
Yo,
we don't need this this week.
We don't need this.

1714
01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:30.580
And now once this security,
he goes,
he goes,
stick,

1715
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:35.710
stick to stick to a network television junior stick to this boy.
You not?

1716
01:43:35.770 --> 01:43:37.900
I'm like,
no,
don't worry.
Tell him.
And what does that mean?

1717
01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:43.420
Because I guess he was fighting in his first fight on now on paper view.
Oh,

1718
01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.160
but this is the thing.
You were on Fox.

1719
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:49.540
But this is the thing is he had never had line of car to this day.

1720
01:43:49.541 --> 01:43:53.300
I don't think he's ever headlined the card.
Yeah,
no,
he had line of card did he?

1721
01:43:53.301 --> 01:43:57.770
And not a paper view,
but um,
when he,
when he fought,
um,

1722
01:43:58.090 --> 01:44:00.570
Hofeld dos Anjos yeah.
That was the main thing.
It wasn't it.

1723
01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:05.040
That was a co main event under a Yoel Romero and Whitaker.

1724
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:07.970
Oh,
Chicago.
He's never headlined a card.

1725
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:13.610
Never,
never headlined a card.
Well you might be right.

1726
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:17.490
And I think it about it.
Yeah.
And he's like,
he's like stick to network.

1727
01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:21.440
I'm like fuck,
I'm fucking like Bro,
you never done shit.

1728
01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:25.280
And so he's trying to play that angle and all this and that.

1729
01:44:25.281 --> 01:44:29.180
And I was just saying you were right.
Look at that.
What do you and Romero too?

1730
01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:33.060
Yeah,
he's never had mine was Covington.
He followed Damien Maia on the undercard.

1731
01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:37.070
Well I think it was like on the main card,
but even seeing him Pumpkin,

1732
01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:40.190
Michael Jackson,
tremendous fight.

1733
01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:49.370
No,
it's man,
it,
I was impressed with him.
Pete and dos Anjos I really was.

1734
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:52.670
I thought that was impressive.
And what way?

1735
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:57.950
Well because he beat dos Anjos yet because the name yeah,
that I give that.

1736
01:44:58.130 --> 01:45:02.480
Yeah,
you beat Rda.
Rda is a name like that.
He was tough as hell.
Former champion.

1737
01:45:02.481 --> 01:45:04.400
Yes.
But I already get one rounds,

1738
01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.410
audio one fourth and fifth round audio is taking him down like you saw that

1739
01:45:09.411 --> 01:45:12.890
already took them down numerous times.
Well,
he didn't let me just clarify it.

1740
01:45:12.891 --> 01:45:17.140
He didn't beat him as impressive as you did.
That's true.
Yeah.
I shut up,
man.

1741
01:45:17.141 --> 01:45:19.730
I don't really care.
I don't really care about all that stuff.
Like man,

1742
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:24.620
it's my thing is overall the knowledge all like I've been on such a journey,

1743
01:45:24.630 --> 01:45:28.550
man,
my whole life I've been on such a journey.

1744
01:45:28.551 --> 01:45:31.580
I've dealt with so many things that I internalize man,

1745
01:45:31.581 --> 01:45:33.260
and now I don't really talk about.

1746
01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:37.700
So I don't really care what all these guys are doing,
man.
I've had a hard life.

1747
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:40.250
Not the hardest.
I'm not saying it's the hardest life,
but I've had,

1748
01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.430
I've had a lot of things happened to me in life to where I'm just saying I'm at

1749
01:45:43.431 --> 01:45:47.810
this point in life where a man I,
I don't,
I don't want to deal with all the hate.

1750
01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.460
I don't want to deal with all these other stuff.

1751
01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:52.100
I understand it's going to come with the sport that we do.
But man,

1752
01:45:52.610 --> 01:45:55.940
I got bigger shit going on in my mind that I haven't worried about rather than

1753
01:45:55.941 --> 01:45:58.940
all of that little things.
Man.
Good for you.
That's like I said,

1754
01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:02.860
your attitude in so many ways is so good that you're,
you're,

1755
01:46:02.861 --> 01:46:06.020
you're there to compete,
that you're,
you're there to do your best.

1756
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:10.610
You're not getting caught up in bullshit and petty nonsense and you know,

1757
01:46:10.611 --> 01:46:13.670
you're just putting pressure on yourself to be the best you could possibly be.

1758
01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:17.870
That's,
that's where,
that's where you see real greatness.
Yeah.
And I mean like,

1759
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:21.830
I like Tyron was,
man,
there's a,
there's this thing too where you,

1760
01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:25.970
you get to a point where you have to,
you're the guy who has to provide,

1761
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:28.250
you're the guy who asked to hold up.
And it's not,

1762
01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.070
not necessarily people saying you have to do it,
but you,
you,

1763
01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.810
you feel that sense of responsibility,
you know?
And,
and in,
in my family,
I,

1764
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:40.430
I felt that I feel that sense of responsibility.

1765
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:44.630
Like there's one that your family when you were growing up.
Yeah.
You know,

1766
01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:46.840
like I like when I say I come from humble beginnings,

1767
01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.500
all like being raised in Nigeria.
Like,

1768
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:53.850
<v 2>and it wasn't like the village village where we lived in huts and we had a
house,</v>

1769
01:46:53.851 --> 01:46:57.330
but it wasn't really,
we didn't have plumbing,
you know,

1770
01:46:57.331 --> 01:47:01.770
we had to go to the well or get water.
We electricity was ray.

1771
01:47:01.771 --> 01:47:04.260
That's a scarce thing,
you know,

1772
01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:07.980
and it to where we,
even when we came here,

1773
01:47:07.981 --> 01:47:10.350
when we immigrated here yet life got a lot better.

1774
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:13.380
How old were you when you came here?
About eight years old.

1775
01:47:14.130 --> 01:47:18.970
And it was hard to adjust to the school system,
you know,
because kids will,

1776
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.430
kids,
his kids are mean.

1777
01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.670
I had to talk with the funny accent and kids would tell you,
hey,

1778
01:47:23.671 --> 01:47:26.340
why don't you say this to the teachers?
Hey,
hey bitch,
call it.

1779
01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.970
And I was always in the principal's office because I had no idea what that means

1780
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:33.180
and things like that.
So kids would curl.
I had to,
I,
you know,

1781
01:47:33.181 --> 01:47:36.300
I dealt with all that.
Did you know in English when you came here?
Yeah,

1782
01:47:36.301 --> 01:47:40.440
we spoke English,
but it's pidgin English.
So we knew that,
you know,

1783
01:47:40.450 --> 01:47:42.060
were colonized by the European.

1784
01:47:42.061 --> 01:47:45.630
So the English has the word route or the words root words aren't from the

1785
01:47:45.631 --> 01:47:50.510
European.
So we knew English,
but it's just our take on it.
Uh,

1786
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.200
and so how much different is pretty different?
It's very different.

1787
01:47:55.201 --> 01:47:58.260
Like if I was talking with another Nigerian,
I was speaking patient English,

1788
01:47:58.261 --> 01:48:01.380
you would pick out words,
but it's a little different.
What did he say?

1789
01:48:01.381 --> 01:48:03.000
Something in pigeon English.
Yeah.

1790
01:48:03.110 --> 01:48:06.000
I said nothing my right now we just sit down here just to talk now.
You,

1791
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:11.060
you're not supposed to not judge did talk.
Just a Ui,
not be any tea.

1792
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.863
That sounds cool.

1793
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:17.580
It does it if like me and Israel out of zonules was talk and like it would be

1794
01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:20.910
mad cool Miller lite.
We speak it to each other.

1795
01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:25.720
So going from that to,
you know,
be in essentially raise and,
and,

1796
01:48:25.721 --> 01:48:30.510
and going through school.
And,
and one thing that,
um,
man,
I haven't,

1797
01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:34.560
I really haven't ever shared with anybody,
you know,
very,

1798
01:48:34.561 --> 01:48:35.880
very few people know,

1799
01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:40.530
is that my father has been incarcerated since 2009.

1800
01:48:41.930 --> 01:48:45.890
And,
and this is the first time really ever talked about it,

1801
01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:48.430
like been in caught.
My Dad was,
um,

1802
01:48:49.190 --> 01:48:52.370
it goes through a test is just the justice system here,
man.
It's so,
so,

1803
01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:57.120
so crooked and it's so backwards.
He has,
of course we're fortunate and like I,

1804
01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.710
there's so many things that we're thankful for live in here in this country
that,

1805
01:49:00.711 --> 01:49:01.041
you know,

1806
01:49:01.041 --> 01:49:03.860
you can sleep at night in your house and not worry about somebody breaking in,

1807
01:49:03.861 --> 01:49:08.770
robbing and killing you,
you know,
for the most par and to her.

1808
01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:11.290
And we're thankful for that.
We're thankful for the opportunities.

1809
01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:16.150
But my dad was a businessman and my dad built one of the,
uh,

1810
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:20.240
uh,
a very,
very big business in Dallas.

1811
01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:23.810
He owned like an ambulance company.
And

1812
01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:25.880
you know,

1813
01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:29.690
it comes to a certain point where people just don't want youth to be your,

1814
01:49:29.691 --> 01:49:33.170
you're an immigrant and you were succeeding in a certain business there where

1815
01:49:33.171 --> 01:49:36.470
it's kind of like people don't care about it.
People don't want you to be there.

1816
01:49:37.190 --> 01:49:38.490
And you know,

1817
01:49:38.491 --> 01:49:42.890
it was one of those situations where my dad hired the people that he thought

1818
01:49:42.891 --> 01:49:47.891
were the right people to do what he didn't know the job to run his company,

1819
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:51.790
<v 1>why he could tend to a certain date.
He's like us,
like his family day to day,</v>

1820
01:49:51.791 --> 01:49:55.480
different things that they cared about all to where they run the company into

1821
01:49:55.481 --> 01:49:58.420
the ground.
And now,

1822
01:49:58.421 --> 01:50:02.380
because my dad was the owner of the company,

1823
01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:06.370
they put it all on him,
even though the people that were doing,
you know,

1824
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:10.240
the things that were really wrong and the company admitted to doing the wrong

1825
01:50:10.241 --> 01:50:14.440
things.
But what the court is saying is that,
oh,
because you own the company.

1826
01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:17.200
So ignorance is,
it's not an excuse.

1827
01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:22.740
So because of that we're going to sentence you to 15 years.

1828
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:27.270
So he got sentenced when he did no crime.
Yeah,

1829
01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.120
it see the thing is the business again,
it,
my dad owned an ambulance company.

1830
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:32.500
An ambulance company.
Yes.

1831
01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:36.100
So it was a transportation for emergency and non emergency,
you know,

1832
01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.130
and one thing that they,
he hired these like a Duh,

1833
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.530
the paramedics,

1834
01:50:41.531 --> 01:50:45.580
the EMS to run the company because these people that they know the business.

1835
01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:49.690
So he had people that he hired from that acquire you acquire from a different

1836
01:50:49.691 --> 01:50:51.910
company.
But you know,

1837
01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:54.830
one thing that I would say is my dad's ignorance is,

1838
01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:58.360
is he didn't really do his research well enough on the guys that he hired.

1839
01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:02.770
So you hire a certain guys and now these guys were running the business and

1840
01:51:02.771 --> 01:51:04.360
these guys are like,
yeah,
we're going to make it,

1841
01:51:04.361 --> 01:51:07.660
we're going to help you grow this business.
Like any business,
man,
fuck yeah,

1842
01:51:07.690 --> 01:51:10.150
I hired the right people.
Yeah.
Helped me grow the business.

1843
01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:15.040
So now they're helping,
he's there doing that.
If he thinks,
okay,

1844
01:51:15.041 --> 01:51:18.430
I trust these guys,
they're taking care of the business and the,
the,

1845
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:22.630
the most disappointing heartbreak and thinking about the businesses.
My Dad,

1846
01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.280
they're not,
they're not the one who does the billing,

1847
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:27.730
the billing for the business.
They contract a difference,

1848
01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.450
an outside company to do the billing.
So it's not them doing it.

1849
01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:34.810
So they're doing the runs,
they're sending the notes to them.

1850
01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.820
This is the runs we did to you guys,

1851
01:51:36.821 --> 01:51:41.440
bill the government or whoever else to pay us.
My Dad is the owner.

1852
01:51:41.441 --> 01:51:44.920
He has people that are doing all this.
He's not,
they're running the day to day.

1853
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:50.950
So eventually they go under investigation.
Although we're investigating nick,

1854
01:51:50.951 --> 01:51:54.100
I think maybe like 15 patients or something like that.

1855
01:51:54.610 --> 01:51:59.470
I don't know the exact number I 15 patients we're investigating for these runs

1856
01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:02.440
or whatever that would build these billing on them.

1857
01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:06.310
And so they put it all in investigation and they're like,
okay.

1858
01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:09.410
After a while they come back and they said,
all right,

1859
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:12.430
we'll give you your stuff back.
Like,
we didn't really see anything,

1860
01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:16.690
but we'll give you your stuff back after they shut it down for a little while.

1861
01:52:17.170 --> 01:52:19.890
So damn,
now I gotta go back to bed.
So my dad's like,
oh,
fuck it.

1862
01:52:19.891 --> 01:52:22.810
I'm getting out of business.
They already killed my business for me.

1863
01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:25.510
So now it became one of the biggest company.

1864
01:52:25.511 --> 01:52:28.810
But you shut down for so long you've lost,
you know what you've worked for.

1865
01:52:28.811 --> 01:52:32.530
So now he's getting rid of it and getting out of it.
Then they come back later,

1866
01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:36.320
a few years later for the same thing that you've already said,
you're good here.

1867
01:52:36.321 --> 01:52:38.840
If you have your stuff back,
they come back and say,
Nah,
we're,

1868
01:52:38.850 --> 01:52:43.720
we're going to prosecute you for this.
So now those guys,

1869
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:46.160
I,
and I've,
I've seen it,
this is obviously

1870
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.620
<v 2>how the feds work now,
those guys that you call it,</v>

1871
01:52:48.621 --> 01:52:51.830
the EMS and these guys that were clearly did rule was wrong.

1872
01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:54.290
You gave them a deal and say,
hey,
we call it you guys,

1873
01:52:54.291 --> 01:52:56.780
because those guys started their own company doing the same shit.

1874
01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:01.130
So they get caught.
Now they're like,
okay,
we want that guy.

1875
01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:05.930
So you guys basically gave him a deal to say,
okay that guy,

1876
01:53:05.931 --> 01:53:10.700
it was in on it and my dad's life,
and I guess they offered my dad a deal,

1877
01:53:10.701 --> 01:53:11.390
a plea deal,

1878
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:13.970
which his lawyer didn't really tell them about cause he had a court appointed,

1879
01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:18.650
a lawyer,
a lawyer.
So he said,
no,

1880
01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.650
I didn't do shit wrong.
Why would I take that deal?

1881
01:53:22.130 --> 01:53:24.980
Which would have been I think maybe like five years it was a deal or something

1882
01:53:24.981 --> 01:53:28.610
like that.
My Dad's like,
no,
I didn't do shit wrong.
Why would I take five years?

1883
01:53:28.611 --> 01:53:33.380
So he goes to trial and brought,
we've seen murderers,

1884
01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:38.980
we've seen all these people that are defraud the government and like stuck more

1885
01:53:39.521 --> 01:53:44.090
head funny guys,
billions of dollars get bail.
They said no,

1886
01:53:44.091 --> 01:53:45.410
they wouldn't even grant him bail.

1887
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:49.250
My Dad's a citizen like turn over his passport and everything.
They said,
no,

1888
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:52.010
I'm not going to give you bill.
We're going to hold you when a freeze,

1889
01:53:52.011 --> 01:53:54.050
all your accounts,
you can't really fight the case.

1890
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:59.030
So you're stuck there and now your family's left with nothing,

1891
01:53:59.770 --> 01:54:02.600
with nothing,
no money in the account,
nothing.

1892
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:06.880
And so my dad is deal with that and they just threw the book at him.

1893
01:54:06.881 --> 01:54:08.600
They're like,
you know,
we'll give you 15 years.

1894
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:13.580
And this was 2009 and he's already been in for 10.

1895
01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:15.180
He has been in for 10 and,

1896
01:54:15.190 --> 01:54:19.490
and one thing that really killed me was um,

1897
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:24.650
one thing,
uh,
it was a part in a trial where,
um,

1898
01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:29.630
the lawyer would basically tell him the judge like this guy's an upstanding guy,

1899
01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.820
no care record,
you know,

1900
01:54:31.821 --> 01:54:34.430
he has kids and look at his kids and how well they're doing.

1901
01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:38.840
His older son is in college.
The second one is in college.

1902
01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:43.870
The youngest is about to being in college.
These kids are all scholarships,

1903
01:54:43.871 --> 01:54:46.040
student athletes,
great student athletes.

1904
01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:50.480
And the one thing that killed me was the prosecution was like,

1905
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:55.510
the reason that is is because he was defrauding the government from this money.

1906
01:54:57.890 --> 01:55:02.540
That's why they're in college.
And I was like,
wait,

1907
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:06.710
my dad is not paying for us to be in college.
We're all student athletes.

1908
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:08.030
We earn these.
We,

1909
01:55:08.031 --> 01:55:12.800
we worked hard earn scholarships as far as to being in college.

1910
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:15.860
The defense didn't say that.
They didn't fucking say like,

1911
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:19.240
you have a court appointed attorney.
I think he did borrow.

1912
01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:21.850
My Dad's just got railroaded man.
And it was like,

1913
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:26.690
and it was so heartbreaking to where you,
you're telling them,

1914
01:55:26.691 --> 01:55:30.740
man that has raised his family,
raised his kids to,
to work hard,

1915
01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.040
get to a place in life and you're telling him that the only reason he's there is

1916
01:55:34.041 --> 01:55:35.720
because he cheated.

1917
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:39.950
And it was just one of those things that added the chip on my shoulder at all.

1918
01:55:39.951 --> 01:55:44.130
Man.
There've been so many moments that added to put on my shoulder

1919
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.510
<v 1>with everything that I like.</v>

1920
01:55:45.511 --> 01:55:49.350
I've been through so much that I just internalize and I compete with all this

1921
01:55:49.351 --> 01:55:53.670
energy.
And so for that you,
you telling my dad that?
Yeah.

1922
01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:56.870
Like you're going to sit down and I just,
and,

1923
01:55:56.871 --> 01:55:59.970
and obviously of course I researched more and more into that because I was so

1924
01:55:59.971 --> 01:56:03.750
heartbroken after that.
Like,
like you're just going to,
for what?

1925
01:56:03.751 --> 01:56:07.670
For how much you're saying not even up to almost a million.

1926
01:56:07.690 --> 01:56:10.490
They would this day just piled a lot of money on.
They're like,
oh,
this,

1927
01:56:10.491 --> 01:56:14.790
this and that for a little over other sane little over a million total,

1928
01:56:14.791 --> 01:56:16.320
which is nowhere near that.

1929
01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:21.770
You gave him 15 years when these guys hedge fund guys that that you can found

1930
01:56:23.461 --> 01:56:28.260
guilty for manipulating these markets for billions.

1931
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:32.010
You give them six months house arrest if that,

1932
01:56:33.050 --> 01:56:35.400
and you were saying you're going to give him 15 years.
And I started researching,

1933
01:56:35.401 --> 01:56:35.671
I'm like,

1934
01:56:35.671 --> 01:56:40.671
a lot of these judges have stakes in these prisons and to what they do is they

1935
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:43.710
give a lot of time because they get paid per prisoner.
That's,

1936
01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:48.120
and you know that story about that guy in Pennsylvania who was uh,

1937
01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:51.560
who was a judge and he was doing that.
He was sending kids to jail.

1938
01:56:51.570 --> 01:56:55.470
He was extending their sentences and giving them sentences from nothing.

1939
01:56:55.471 --> 01:56:58.330
And it turned out he had been getting paid by the prison.

1940
01:56:58.650 --> 01:57:00.000
A lot of them down the river.
Yeah,

1941
01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:03.750
I heard a lot of them get collect kickbacks and different things from that.

1942
01:57:03.751 --> 01:57:07.230
And so to put people there,
as you become more and more famous,

1943
01:57:07.231 --> 01:57:11.250
you could shed more and more light on this.
Yeah,
man,
it's your dad do for parole,

1944
01:57:12.630 --> 01:57:17.040
man.
I don't,
I don't even know.
I think soon listen to this podcast alone.

1945
01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:22.100
You talking about this could very well bring someone forward that wants to help

1946
01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:26.210
you with the appeal.
Yeah,
man.
And my mom,
my dad actually wrote,

1947
01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:30.990
cause during the Obama administration there was that whole clemency deal when

1948
01:57:30.991 --> 01:57:32.850
they,
when they were doing,
and my dad actually wrote a letter,

1949
01:57:32.851 --> 01:57:34.650
I actually have that letter,
I don't know where it put it,

1950
01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:39.220
but he wrote a letter to him.
And it was when I read the letter,
man,
I,

1951
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:43.630
I can't help a cry about it because my,
my dad,
um,

1952
01:57:45.490 --> 01:57:49.770
it's my dad cares about his family so much and when I go see my dad because my

1953
01:57:49.771 --> 01:57:53.220
dad is so proud of me and uh,
and I'm so proud of him.
I mean,

1954
01:57:53.221 --> 01:57:56.310
he raised us so well and um,

1955
01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.620
to go see him in there.

1956
01:57:58.710 --> 01:58:01.170
And I mean it's not like he's sitting in the maximum security,

1957
01:58:01.171 --> 01:58:05.310
but for someone and tell you that you can't go home to your family at night for

1958
01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:08.530
telling.
You've got an year,
you got to sleep when we told you to sleep,
we got to,

1959
01:58:08.531 --> 01:58:12.360
you got to eat when we tell you to eat for 10 years.
And when you know,

1960
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:16.800
I didn't do anything wrong because I chose to say no,
I didn't do anything wrong.

1961
01:58:16.801 --> 01:58:18.720
I'm not going to take the sentence you give me.

1962
01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:23.040
They say okay fine then you are going to sit in there for 15 years and there's

1963
01:58:23.041 --> 01:58:27.100
nothing you can do about it.
Is it man,
it broke my heart man.

1964
01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:30.600
And then when I think about it something I just hold it in cause I,
you know,

1965
01:58:30.601 --> 01:58:33.570
I try not to cry about it,
which I'm just like screw it.

1966
01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.210
I've have different situations that happen in life.
I'm like,
you know,
but I,

1967
01:58:37.211 --> 01:58:39.630
I ate that one up on the shoulder.
I put that chip homes.

1968
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:41.950
You know what they're going to say that the reason

1969
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.430
<v 2>I'm here that was scholarship is because my dad,</v>

1970
01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:49.510
they're saying my dad got money.
A little bit of money.
Are you serious?

1971
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.630
What about the freaking hard work that I did to get here?

1972
01:58:52.810 --> 01:58:57.550
What about all the Times that I sat in a freaking hotbox might bathroom
upstairs,

1973
01:58:57.551 --> 01:59:01.000
which just trash bag on because I knew that I needed to get a pound off the next

1974
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.600
day in order to be able to wrestle at this JV tournament.
What about all that,

1975
01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:08.410
you know,
that didn't make any difference.
You know,
the reason,

1976
01:59:08.411 --> 01:59:09.910
the only reason it was there is because of that.

1977
01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.250
What about all the times my brother ran,

1978
01:59:12.251 --> 01:59:16.360
worked hard to make national team when he was playing soccer or my little

1979
01:59:16.361 --> 01:59:21.040
brother getting numerous scholarship for a division one football everywhere like

1980
01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:25.540
that.
What?
So all that put a chip on my shoulder,
Joe,
to where it was like,
man,

1981
01:59:25.541 --> 01:59:28.540
I've got to succeed at all costs.
I don't want to really care.
And where,

1982
01:59:28.541 --> 01:59:32.320
where did this happen?
Where was this trial?
Uh,
in Texas and Dallas,
Texas.

1983
01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:37.210
Not the best place to have that job,
but uh,
uh,

1984
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:39.490
it happened in a,
in a man,
a

1985
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:45.500
put a sour taste in my mouth,
but um,
file an appeal.
Oh Man.

1986
01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:48.430
He filed an appeal at one time.
They didn't even look at it,
man.

1987
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:51.670
It was like one of those things where it's like that judge,
they put you there,

1988
01:59:51.671 --> 01:59:55.330
you're there.
That was his domain.
They didn't even look at it like,

1989
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:57.240
who cares?

1990
01:59:57.240 --> 02:00:01.060
Because I just feel like in the system you are in the UFC welterweight champion.

1991
02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:04.270
But I think that they treated him like that because you're an immigrant.

1992
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:09.840
The system get in there and that's,
you know,
a Joe to wrap that,

1993
02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:10.510
put that on.

1994
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:15.400
That's part of what this next fight symbolizes to me is the attitude that a lot

1995
02:00:15.401 --> 02:00:19.210
of people have towards immigrants as people are forgetting that Americans or

1996
02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:22.790
immigrants in that conversation in the last podcast,

1997
02:00:22.810 --> 02:00:27.810
he pulled up forgetting that our countries to where people have this attitude to

1998
02:00:28.811 --> 02:00:33.250
where something we're Americans go back to your country.
You know,
you,
you know,

1999
02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:36.520
go back.
This is a free country.
You this and that.
People like,

2000
02:00:36.521 --> 02:00:39.930
I always heard that growing up,
I always heard that and I always I,

2001
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:44.350
the more I research,
I'm like,
what?
What are you talking about?
First of all,
this,

2002
02:00:44.351 --> 02:00:48.550
this whole attitude when you walk into a nail shop,
get your hand,
feet,

2003
02:00:48.551 --> 02:00:53.320
nails done.
Oh,
the majority of the people that run those nail shops,
Asians,

2004
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:56.590
I'm not saying all of them in the world,
in the country,

2005
02:00:56.591 --> 02:00:58.660
but the majority of them in Asians,

2006
02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.570
but there's a lot of people that look down on all of it.
Like,

2007
02:01:01.571 --> 02:01:05.530
I'm not washing your feet.
I'm not going to do your nails known as people.

2008
02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:09.490
I take pride in that because that provides for them.
You know,
they do that,

2009
02:01:10.450 --> 02:01:14.320
you know,
but people,
people condemn it.
That's not a job people want to do.

2010
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:17.710
When you go to these hotels and certain things,

2011
02:01:17.711 --> 02:01:20.770
who are the main people that are the maids that clean up the hotels?

2012
02:01:20.771 --> 02:01:21.910
A lot of them immigrants.

2013
02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:25.270
We take pride in them because now we're the country in a better place where we

2014
02:01:25.271 --> 02:01:30.070
can provide for families.
Those are jobs are a lot of people so called Americans.

2015
02:01:30.071 --> 02:01:35.050
The whole Colby,
Covington,
whole persona are like,

2016
02:01:35.051 --> 02:01:38.500
I'm above that.
I'm above that.
That's the persona.

2017
02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:43.130
But then at the same time,
people now want to cry all the here taking our jobs.

2018
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:46.970
Let's build a wall.
Let's keep them out.
They'd taken our job.
No,

2019
02:01:46.971 --> 02:01:49.610
they're providing.
They are helping this country get to its height.

2020
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:52.700
The fact that you could come here and have someone do your nails,

2021
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:54.800
so we'll clean your house and wash a car.

2022
02:01:54.801 --> 02:01:58.400
Someone do all this for you is part of what makes America so great.

2023
02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:02.930
One of the greatest nations in the world and the fact that they want to build a

2024
02:02:02.931 --> 02:02:05.300
wall.
You want to keep these people out.
You can't come here.

2025
02:02:05.301 --> 02:02:08.580
You can't bring your culture,
your stuff here is just,

2026
02:02:08.581 --> 02:02:12.500
it's saddens me and it upsets me as part of what this fight,

2027
02:02:12.501 --> 02:02:16.550
when it happens is Phi represents for me because I feel like that's the attitude

2028
02:02:16.551 --> 02:02:20.630
that this young man has.
He's entitled to,
I'm,
I should be USC champ.

2029
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:23.110
You're your soy boy.
You know you can't,
you don't want dessert.

2030
02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:26.000
You can't hand with me,
boy,
that's his attitude.
He can't do this boy,

2031
02:02:26.001 --> 02:02:29.090
first of all,
who's your born?
I'm a grown ass man.

2032
02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.080
Don't fucking talk to me like that.
And that's the attitude that he has.

2033
02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:37.370
I'm entitled to this.
I mean I should be the champion because I am this way.

2034
02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:41.150
I'm American,
I'm this and ah Bro,

2035
02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:43.760
we're all American here.

2036
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:48.740
And so that this fight is greater than than just me beating up a guy that's

2037
02:02:48.741 --> 02:02:51.680
talking a lot of shit.
There's a,
there's this fight means a lot to me.

2038
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:55.990
So when I get the chance to put my hands on that guy,
let's just know this,

2039
02:02:56.010 --> 02:03:00.740
the wrath of every immigrant that have stepped foot in this country that I'm

2040
02:03:00.741 --> 02:03:04.910
going to put on him was you and your family are the ideal immigrants.

2041
02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:09.770
Absolutely.
Over overachievers.
I mean this is what like first of all,

2042
02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:13.850
what is it about Nigerians that do so well in this country?

2043
02:03:13.851 --> 02:03:16.430
That's one of the things,
if you look at like Nigerian immigrants,

2044
02:03:16.431 --> 02:03:19.970
like successful ratios of,
of different immigration groups,

2045
02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:24.650
Nigerians in particular are extraordinarily successful upon immigrating to

2046
02:03:24.651 --> 02:03:28.460
America.
Yeah.
I think it's a family,
a family thing.
It's like when,

2047
02:03:28.461 --> 02:03:32.240
when her family's decided and we get the opportunity to move to a better place.

2048
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:36.980
The thing is that the whole persona is we're going to be able to sustain this

2049
02:03:36.981 --> 02:03:41.480
forever so my kids are not going to just play around and sports cause that's not

2050
02:03:41.481 --> 02:03:42.314
guarantee.

2051
02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:45.170
What is guaranteed is the fact that you're going to go to school when you're

2052
02:03:45.171 --> 02:03:47.780
going to become a doctor because you're going to get a job anywhere in the world

2053
02:03:47.781 --> 02:03:52.010
that you want.
That's why majority of them are doctors,
right?

2054
02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:55.730
Majority of doctors,
engineers,
because these are jobs that high demand jobs.

2055
02:03:55.731 --> 02:03:59.720
You always going to get a job anywhere and so that's all.

2056
02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:04.200
That's all we push.
You're going to be a doctor or you're going to be a a nine.

2057
02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:07.370
I'm an engineer.
None of them were saying,

2058
02:04:07.371 --> 02:04:10.970
you're going to be a professional athlete.
My parents,
hell no.

2059
02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:12.350
They didn't care for that.

2060
02:04:12.351 --> 02:04:14.960
Like I lied to them the first couple of years that I was wrestling.

2061
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:16.760
I didn't tell him that.
You know,

2062
02:04:16.761 --> 02:04:21.500
my brother is a doctor and pharmacy in Dallas.
My little brother,

2063
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:25.580
you know,
could have gotten the NFL.
It was a stellar football player.

2064
02:04:25.581 --> 02:04:28.730
Played at University of Houston and University of Arizona.
You know,

2065
02:04:28.731 --> 02:04:31.700
my sister now is in college.
She's in nursing school in college.

2066
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:33.380
Like that's just what we push.

2067
02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:37.620
We want you to get a job that you can provide for your family forever.
Yeah.

2068
02:04:37.621 --> 02:04:38.010
They remind

2069
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:40.470
<v 1>me of Koreans and a lot of ways.
Absolutely.
Yeah.</v>

2070
02:04:40.650 --> 02:04:45.650
Super hardworking and appreciate once they've gotten to a place like America

2071
02:04:46.501 --> 02:04:49.110
where there really is no ceiling on the possibility.

2072
02:04:49.111 --> 02:04:52.350
You could do anything you want once you get here,
if you work hard.
Absolutely.

2073
02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:53.340
And then this is,

2074
02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:57.750
that's another thing that's dear to my heart is one of your Nigeria like when

2075
02:04:57.751 --> 02:05:01.920
you're in a situation that we were sad.
My mom was a teacher.

2076
02:05:02.370 --> 02:05:06.910
My mom owned a store to to a little convenience store.

2077
02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.300
When we did the little jobs on the site,

2078
02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:14.160
we told certain things on the side and on top of a raising three boys,

2079
02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.890
rowdy boys like that.

2080
02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:21.970
That's what we and the school we would it,
it wasn't like all it is the car,

2081
02:05:21.980 --> 02:05:25.590
the bus is going to pick you up at three 7:00 AM to go to school.
Nah,

2082
02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:28.650
the school is two miles away.
Three miles away.
You walk in,

2083
02:05:29.370 --> 02:05:32.220
you ready to get going.
Don't be late.
Cause if you got it,
if he was late,

2084
02:05:32.250 --> 02:05:36.150
he was gonna get a whooping before school started.
That's how it was.

2085
02:05:36.810 --> 02:05:39.510
And especially the education system is so high because you miss,

2086
02:05:40.330 --> 02:05:42.240
you miss a couple of answers on a test.

2087
02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:46.500
You had to go out and get a sweat and you are going to get whipped in school for

2088
02:05:46.501 --> 02:05:50.520
the answers that you missed.
10 was beat you in school.
Yeah,

2089
02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:55.500
absolutely.
The teacher,
the teacher,
the teacher was on,
first of all,

2090
02:05:55.501 --> 02:06:00.150
it's not teacher,
his uncle and aunt,
that's your uncle and your aunt in school.

2091
02:06:00.570 --> 02:06:02.130
They knew your parents did or your family,

2092
02:06:02.131 --> 02:06:05.580
they were going to whip you in school if you decided to mess up.

2093
02:06:06.330 --> 02:06:10.330
And that's how it was.
So that's why there's a lot of these smart Nigerians.

2094
02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:14.640
They get out and if there's no freaking job,
look,
we got to somehow make money.

2095
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:16.830
It's so fucked up cause I don't want people to be kids,

2096
02:06:16.831 --> 02:06:20.070
but God damn when you put kids into that kind of pressure,

2097
02:06:20.910 --> 02:06:25.230
my parents put me in Catholic school for one year and I got excellent grades and

2098
02:06:25.231 --> 02:06:29.070
afterwards I was fucking terrible,
terrible man.

2099
02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:31.680
And I remember my stepfather said something May said,

2100
02:06:31.681 --> 02:06:34.100
your grades are only good when you were in Catholic school.
I was like,

2101
02:06:34.110 --> 02:06:38.010
Scott was fucking terrified.
I'm like,
it ain't a good move.
I mean,
it's not.

2102
02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:39.390
They're threatening me all the time.

2103
02:06:39.391 --> 02:06:43.200
They wanted to beat me and make me sit on a nail in the closet.
But it's this,

2104
02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:47.610
I don't,
I don't,
I would never want you to go through that.

2105
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:52.140
But the fact that you went through that is probably one of the reasons why

2106
02:06:52.141 --> 02:06:55.830
you're the man you are today.
That's humanity.
That's what I call humanity.

2107
02:06:55.831 --> 02:06:59.010
Because as human beings,
when we were growing like,

2108
02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:02.380
and you hear this all the time with parents want a better life for my kid.

2109
02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:06.690
I want a better life for my kids.
Yes,
absolutely.
That's what we want.

2110
02:07:06.691 --> 02:07:09.060
We want to present them with endless possibilities,

2111
02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:13.950
but you can't forget the fact that the reason you are the champion or the this

2112
02:07:13.951 --> 02:07:17.400
upstanding person that you are today's because you went to this hard things.

2113
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:20.400
All these hardships molded you and,
and,

2114
02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:24.510
and that's part of the situation now is like,
everyone's like,
oh no,

2115
02:07:24.511 --> 02:07:28.230
I don't want these kids who play these sports is too tough.
They're too rough.

2116
02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:30.380
You know,
they could get hurt,

2117
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:33.690
they can get that or that could could turn into a freaking champion.

2118
02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:38.020
He can get knocked on his butt times and that one's 51 at the time.

2119
02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:41.410
He gets up and says,
you know what?
Screw this.
I'm going to be a champion today.

2120
02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:45.040
All sold it.
You could do other things.
You could assign,

2121
02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:46.780
I think a guy like you could do anything.

2122
02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:50.950
But once you've achieved what you've achieved in,
in MMA and wrestling,

2123
02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:55.690
the kind of mindset that makes you push your body to the limit like that and

2124
02:07:55.691 --> 02:07:58.150
allows you to get your,
your you just,

2125
02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:02.290
just your body into the kind of condition that made you fight five rounds like

2126
02:08:02.291 --> 02:08:06.940
that against Tyron.
That's an extraordinary mind.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm thankful.

2127
02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:08.160
I'm thankful for a,

2128
02:08:08.170 --> 02:08:12.010
and this one thing that I always say is I'm thankful for every individual that

2129
02:08:12.011 --> 02:08:16.240
I've crossed paths with because when I really look back on my life and I

2130
02:08:16.241 --> 02:08:21.160
internalize a lot at things,
like how did I was a little,

2131
02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:26.340
I mean I was a freaking pipsqueak in Nigeria carrying this hot plate on my head

2132
02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:30.520
to go sell,
you know,
up and down the street.

2133
02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:32.800
God did I,

2134
02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:37.800
I never imagined that I would get to the point where I would run into all these

2135
02:08:37.811 --> 02:08:41.230
different wrestling coaches.
I would pour knowledge into me even if for every,

2136
02:08:41.290 --> 02:08:44.590
and this is just shout out to every coach.
If you ever saw me,

2137
02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:48.830
I was drilling a move and you came over and just corrected me or are you said no

2138
02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:53.540
on do it this way.
You know,
even if it's just a moment,
an inch in my life,
uh,

2139
02:08:53.541 --> 02:08:57.100
you did.
All of that contributed to the person that I am today,

2140
02:08:57.101 --> 02:08:58.990
to all those coaches,
all those people,

2141
02:08:58.991 --> 02:09:03.991
all my mentors that given me advice each and every one because I never knew that

2142
02:09:04.131 --> 02:09:07.720
I would cross paths.
Like,
look how crazy my life is.
I cross paths with John.

2143
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:09.760
First time I ever seen him.
If I was John Joan,

2144
02:09:10.150 --> 02:09:14.170
I won my belt on the same card as Jon Jones.
You know,
I stayed,

2145
02:09:14.171 --> 02:09:15.550
when I went to visit John Jones,

2146
02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:21.120
I stayed in the same room that Colby Covington stayed in the following year when

2147
02:09:21.521 --> 02:09:25.210
he went to school with John Jones.
How fucking crazy is that?

2148
02:09:25.330 --> 02:09:30.040
That's pretty fucking crazy.
John's roommate was Joe Soda,
who also is in the UFC,

2149
02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:34.490
like,
you know,
it went to the University of Nebraska Carnie.

2150
02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:39.230
It became a national champion.
Same is true.
Trevell wrestle with Trevell delong,

2151
02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:42.000
them,
Joe and Jake Ellenberger.
Jake Ellenberger and EOC,

2152
02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:43.240
Joel Ellenberger in the UFC.

2153
02:09:43.241 --> 02:09:48.241
Like I look at the past that I've crossed in this alive to get me to this point

2154
02:09:48.911 --> 02:09:52.300
here.
I'm extremely thankful,
man.
I,
at the end of the day,

2155
02:09:52.930 --> 02:09:56.960
there's nothing that I can do that I can't,

2156
02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.210
I gotta give it up.
Like this was a plan.
I didn't,
this wasn't me.

2157
02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:05.410
And in control this say,
you know what,
when I'm 25 and when I'm this age,

2158
02:10:05.411 --> 02:10:08.140
I'm going to do that and do that,
do that.
And it all come together like that.

2159
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:10.900
Like I've been blessed,
I've been very,

2160
02:10:10.901 --> 02:10:13.450
very blessed to cross paths with all these guys and,

2161
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:18.400
and has gotten me to this moment.
So I'm,
I'm so thankful.

2162
02:10:18.610 --> 02:10:22.900
Well,
I think it's both.
You definitely have been blessed as,
as all of us have.

2163
02:10:23.590 --> 02:10:27.700
But besides just being fortunate,
it's you,

2164
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:29.110
you went through the work,

2165
02:10:29.290 --> 02:10:32.830
you went through the work and you completed the process,
you know,

2166
02:10:32.831 --> 02:10:37.831
and that just the fact that you've fought Tyron motherfucking Woodley with a

2167
02:10:38.511 --> 02:10:43.511
broken foot in a hernia and still dominated him for five rounds is crazy.

2168
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:45.530
You don't,

2169
02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:50.530
you don't get to that without having you built your mind and your body and in a

2170
02:10:52.911 --> 02:10:56.870
very crazy way and in a way through the the,

2171
02:10:56.900 --> 02:11:00.140
the fires of hard work and discipline.

2172
02:11:00.141 --> 02:11:04.730
You forged a champion.
Yeah.
I mean,
thank you Joe.
Like that.

2173
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:08.390
That's it's all,
it all goes back to everything.

2174
02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:13.220
Like this is how my mind works is ever since I was little,
I'm one of those guys,

2175
02:11:13.221 --> 02:11:15.560
I sound silly,
but I'm a one trip kind of guy.

2176
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:19.430
When I go to the grocery store and I'm bringing all that shit in the house,

2177
02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:23.370
I'm a lunch of kind of carried it in one trip.
I'm going to do it all of them.

2178
02:11:23.380 --> 02:11:25.010
I don't matter.
I don't care how much it is.

2179
02:11:25.190 --> 02:11:28.790
I'm going to try to do it a one chip and this is one thing that I say to myself

2180
02:11:28.791 --> 02:11:33.190
when I'm carrying all that stuff inside.
Yeah.
It hurts.
Yeah.
It's heavy.
Yeah.
This,

2181
02:11:33.191 --> 02:11:38.120
this makes no sense.
The cows is literally 50 feet from the,
from the car.

2182
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:43.210
But my mind while I'm carrying all that heavy shit,
I'm just breaking.

2183
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:47.000
Yeah.
Would one trip.
One trip can tough it get tough but tough.

2184
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:50.720
I've been doing that since I was a kid.
Get tough.
Get tough.
You can do it.

2185
02:11:50.721 --> 02:11:55.500
You didn't do get tough or when I'm doing sets of of stuff reps in,
in the,

2186
02:11:55.501 --> 02:11:58.970
you know the coaches,
I had four sets of 10 I'm doing town.

2187
02:11:58.971 --> 02:12:03.490
When I get to like 10 I'm like,
oh I can do one more 11 let's get 11 boom,

2188
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:04.450
get an extra set in.

2189
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:09.790
I've been putting in extra set forever forever to where I feel like all that has

2190
02:12:12.831 --> 02:12:16.950
built me up to where my mind is today.
Where your mind is there,
but do you,

2191
02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:21.080
do you have a concern like what we were talking about before with Cain Velasquez

2192
02:12:21.081 --> 02:12:26.081
that your mind might be too strong for the tissue to strong for the ligaments,

2193
02:12:26.691 --> 02:12:31.130
too strong for the joints.
I mean this is what I worry about with a guy like you.

2194
02:12:31.190 --> 02:12:35.250
Yeah,
there's got to be mentally strong.
I have no fear of that at all.
No.

2195
02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:38.560
My concern was with a guy like Cain Velasquez got like,
there's,

2196
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:43.750
there's certain people that I worry that they might do too much or pushed too

2197
02:12:43.881 --> 02:12:44.151
hard.

2198
02:12:44.151 --> 02:12:49.151
But the fucking problem is the only way you become a Cain Velasquez or become

2199
02:12:50.481 --> 02:12:55.200
you is to have that mindset to begin with,
Joe.

2200
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:59.790
And how,
how else can you see Cain Velasquez fighting?
Can't say it,
can't stand,

2201
02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.230
can't see him training in any other way.
That's what made cane.
Yeah.
And,
and,

2202
02:13:04.231 --> 02:13:08.030
and I think that's all part of the plan.
Like there's a time for everybody.

2203
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:12.860
There's a time,
there was a time designed for Tyron Woodley to become champion,

2204
02:13:12.861 --> 02:13:16.910
to be champion.
There's a time for me to be champion and to reign as a champion.

2205
02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:20.450
There's a time for everybody.
Of course,
I'm,
and like I said,

2206
02:13:20.451 --> 02:13:24.260
I like to take all these different knowledge that I get and I like to put it all

2207
02:13:24.261 --> 02:13:27.770
together.
So of course my coaches aren't now that no one had told me,

2208
02:13:27.771 --> 02:13:31.160
y'all are just go home like you,
you look great.
You teach my mind,

2209
02:13:31.230 --> 02:13:33.930
want to freaking go harder than,
I don't know what you do.
You've done great.

2210
02:13:33.931 --> 02:13:37.290
Go home.
So where I'm listening and I'm giving them the lead on that,

2211
02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:42.740
but the way I train is what's gotten me here and the way cane train is what's

2212
02:13:43.291 --> 02:13:44.124
gotten them there.

2213
02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:48.540
Now it's the responsibility of not just cane but everybody else that's around

2214
02:13:48.541 --> 02:13:51.330
him that he really confides to,

2215
02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:56.310
to let him know when it's too much and when it's not too much.
With Kane,

2216
02:13:56.311 --> 02:14:00.300
there's so many issues now because of the surgeries have been so extensive and

2217
02:14:00.301 --> 02:14:05.100
back surgery,
knee surgeries and reconstructions,
not just meniscus like you,

2218
02:14:05.101 --> 02:14:08.250
but the actual structure of the knee itself.
One thing that,
yeah,

2219
02:14:08.251 --> 02:14:11.990
one thing that I would always say is Cain,
you,

2220
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.360
you can't always with with Kane,
with anybody else's,

2221
02:14:15.930 --> 02:14:20.400
the human body and the human mind is so powerful.
You can never say,

2222
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:23.100
Oh man,
that's it.
It's over for that guy.

2223
02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.000
Or that guy is never going to be the same.
I just never know.
You never know.

2224
02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:29.490
Like cane,
you know much respect to,
can't,
can't,

2225
02:14:29.491 --> 02:14:33.210
can't come back and be a savage and still run through guys for sure.

2226
02:14:33.211 --> 02:14:36.300
Next year or two for sure.
Never know that the fix,

2227
02:14:36.670 --> 02:14:41.120
I don't know what the extent of that injury was,
but yeah,
I'm,
you know,

2228
02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:45.000
I'm hopeful and optimistic that he's going to be back soon,
you know?
But there's,

2229
02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:49.110
I feel like there's a time for everybody and if cane doesn't fight like that,

2230
02:14:49.111 --> 02:14:53.340
can you imagine cane fight in any other way of fighting?
Cautious point fighting.

2231
02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:56.280
Oh,
let me,
you can't.
No,
you can't.
No one.

2232
02:14:56.281 --> 02:15:00.990
That's why there's an argument that is the best UFC heavyweight ever.

2233
02:15:00.991 --> 02:15:05.740
He's for,
so for sure one of the best UFC heavyweight summer.
Absolutely.

2234
02:15:05.741 --> 02:15:07.580
You know,
I mean not even a question.
Yeah.

2235
02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:11.880
Now when did they have you fighting Colby?
When is that supposed to take place?

2236
02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:15.840
I don't know.
You don't know?
I think it's a,

2237
02:15:17.010 --> 02:15:21.030
I have to get healthy furs for a long,
long time.
I'm in fighting her,

2238
02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:23.400
but I just like,
I don't want to send you down to Panama

2239
02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:29.670
and give you that guy's number.
We'll get off.
I'm going to contact Dr Reardon.

2240
02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.300
Give it to you.
I,
I've been fighting her for so long ago,

2241
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:35.470
like whether it's knee or there,

2242
02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:40.080
there has been training camp so I could barely walk.
Like what not training,
walk,

2243
02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:44.370
walk for I think the last two years my daughter laughs at me.

2244
02:15:44.371 --> 02:15:46.800
I come down the stairs backwards.
Really?

2245
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:49.560
I go down the stairs backwards because they at pressure on my knees,

2246
02:15:49.770 --> 02:15:54.600
Jesus Christ.
And my daughter laughs at me.
But I,
it was,

2247
02:15:54.601 --> 02:15:58.770
it was a time where I couldn't walk.
That's crazy.
Before the Leon Edwards fight,

2248
02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:03.570
I fought Leon Edwards years ago before that fight I could walk.

2249
02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:07.800
I mean I shit you not Joe walk down to and from the house,

2250
02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:12.060
from the car to the house.
It was,
it was in pain.
I walked on grass.

2251
02:16:12.061 --> 02:16:15.090
I couldn't walk on concrete because I felt like that relieved a little bit more

2252
02:16:15.091 --> 02:16:15.560
stressed.

2253
02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:19.440
It's like that's the extent of the pain that I've been in in some of these

2254
02:16:19.441 --> 02:16:23.220
fights.
That is fucking insane.
No,
this is during the camp,
during the camp,

2255
02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:24.800
just to make it to the flash.

2256
02:16:24.801 --> 02:16:28.590
Just walking on grass instead of concrete walking on grass instead of concrete.

2257
02:16:28.591 --> 02:16:30.220
Cause he's just,
it's Christ

2258
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:34.660
<v 2>and it does,
it is not as much hard,
hard surface to walk on.</v>

2259
02:16:34.690 --> 02:16:37.450
So just when the fight came on,
do you just put it all sides?

2260
02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:40.060
When I walk to that cage,
fuck it.
Let's go.

2261
02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:44.590
This is a matter of me getting maybe $10,000 to $20,000.
Let's go.

2262
02:16:44.591 --> 02:16:46.900
I chose to be here and instead of sitting in the front of it,

2263
02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:50.680
instead of sitting at a desk,
Ma earning money,
so providing for my family,

2264
02:16:50.681 --> 02:16:54.390
this is how I'm going to do it.
And like I said,
Jo,
like my daughter,

2265
02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:58.420
little freaking fire on me,
Joe.
Yeah man.
When I,

2266
02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:03.440
those are adorable man.
And you had her,
he carried her with the belt.

2267
02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:07.480
I want her to uh,
me.
She,
yeah,
when she grows up,

2268
02:17:07.481 --> 02:17:09.950
I want her to remember that forever because um,

2269
02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:14.610
she lit a fire eye part of them.
Remember we were talking about,
um,

2270
02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:16.360
that the tank that you have in there,

2271
02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:21.361
part of why I'm a little scared to be locked in those tank is because I'm,

2272
02:17:21.521 --> 02:17:24.400
I've never been claustrophobic ever in my life.
I never was.

2273
02:17:25.390 --> 02:17:28.420
But there was a time when I found out that I was going to have her,

2274
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:33.870
that my girl was pregnant with her at the time.
I,
um,

2275
02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:39.470
I'm freaking live with Rashad Evans.
I have no money in my bank account.

2276
02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:42.590
I'm broke as hell.
And

2277
02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:43.740
<v 0>yeah,</v>

2278
02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:45.080
<v 2>I am having a child.</v>

2279
02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:46.530
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2280
02:17:46.530 --> 02:17:49.710
<v 2>And I'm not married yet and these are,
especially,</v>

2281
02:17:49.711 --> 02:17:51.790
these are these principles or your African parents,
I,

2282
02:17:51.791 --> 02:17:54.930
you've got to be married and things like that.
I'm not married yet.

2283
02:17:54.931 --> 02:17:58.500
Of course her mom is phenomenal woman.
Phenomenal.

2284
02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:01.830
And I'm not married and all this things and is happening.

2285
02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:06.510
I was fucking my mind.
I was panicking and I fight before that I just lost,

2286
02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:08.100
this was right after I lost the second fight.

2287
02:18:08.190 --> 02:18:09.870
Now I'm getting ready for the third fight.

2288
02:18:10.350 --> 02:18:14.700
And there was his doctor doctor's office that we go in and sleep in the

2289
02:18:14.701 --> 02:18:18.450
hyperbaric chamber because we heard it better for your body and stuff like that.

2290
02:18:19.050 --> 02:18:22.100
So I'd be doing it here and then once a week I go in and sleep in the,

2291
02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:25.670
like the plastic ones is zip you up in there and it compresses up.

2292
02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:28.800
And I was in there at one time,

2293
02:18:28.801 --> 02:18:33.780
I was in there and I started thinking,
I usually pass out and when I,

2294
02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:35.520
it starts to decompress,
I wake up,

2295
02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.680
I'm in that day and I wake up,
you know,

2296
02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:43.650
but it hasn't decompress yet,
you know,
so I never really thought anything of it.

2297
02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:46.710
Don't risk got it in there and I'm in this office in this room,

2298
02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:48.180
it's dark because they're the nurses.

2299
02:18:48.181 --> 02:18:50.370
They flipped a light off and they go on about their business,

2300
02:18:50.371 --> 02:18:54.370
tending to other patients.
And I'm like,

2301
02:18:55.010 --> 02:18:58.740
Okay Shit.
I gotta fight this fight.
I got,
I got,

2302
02:18:58.750 --> 02:19:03.700
I got choked out my last fight.
Wow.
Okay.
This shit might happen again.
There's,

2303
02:19:03.701 --> 02:19:07.310
do they say this dude is tough these days?
They saying this dude's tough.

2304
02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:11.630
He could scribe
to have a daughter.
Shit,

2305
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:13.570
I'm proud.
Can I got no money?

2306
02:19:15.690 --> 02:19:20.340
I got to win this fight because I'm fighting for like $2,000 one at one.

2307
02:19:20.350 --> 02:19:24.850
If I went in $2,000 all this shit is going through my head.

2308
02:19:24.851 --> 02:19:29.090
Now this tech has in decompress.
The room is dark.
No,

2309
02:19:29.091 --> 02:19:33.830
I'm hearing nothing.
No nurses.
So now I start to get hot.

2310
02:19:34.310 --> 02:19:37.460
I mean the thing,
and I started getting a little hot in the Tang.
I'm like,
okay,

2311
02:19:37.461 --> 02:19:39.160
so now my body is getting a little hot.

2312
02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:43.580
I'm laying there now I start dripping it on my forehead is dripping sweat.

2313
02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:49.400
So I'm trying to control my relax bro.
You done this.
How many times relax,

2314
02:19:49.401 --> 02:19:53.180
you got this,
you got this takes,
you're good.
I can't see the clock.

2315
02:19:53.181 --> 02:19:57.120
So I don't know how much time's gone by now.
I'm freaking the fuck

2316
02:19:58.730 --> 02:20:03.440
my mind.
It's like I'm stuck in this too.
I didn't know what's going on.

2317
02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:05.960
I am I dying here.

2318
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:10.900
I don't know what's going on these cause you gotta get me out of here.
No.

2319
02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:15.440
So I'm like relax with that.
So I'm bringing my mind back.
I'm relaxed.

2320
02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:19.340
Take a deep breath.
You're good.
You Go.
What she taught you?
Worried about.

2321
02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:22.970
Now I'm having this conversation in my mind back and forth and my relax,

2322
02:20:22.971 --> 02:20:26.840
you're good.
So I relaxed.
I'm like,
Oh,
I think how you got knocked as do that.
Jab,

2323
02:20:26.841 --> 02:20:29.930
Jab,
want to bomb.
Okay,
so now I'm calm.
I'm calm.

2324
02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:33.140
But what if he coulda woulda left hand?
Boom.
Now you're knocked out.

2325
02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:39.260
Now I'm fucking sweating.
She says,
Joe,
I said,

2326
02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:41.420
know I was sweating so bad.

2327
02:20:41.610 --> 02:20:45.120
So I started tapping on the thing like,
you know,

2328
02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:47.810
I don't want to freak out because I still gotta be cool.

2329
02:20:47.811 --> 02:20:50.720
I want to let these nurses know,
like I'm freaking out.
I'm a fighter,

2330
02:20:50.721 --> 02:20:55.490
I'm freaking out in his tank.
So I'm tapping on the thing.
I'm like,
you know,

2331
02:20:55.491 --> 02:20:57.090
try to ask them like,
Hey,
uh,

2332
02:20:57.110 --> 02:21:01.160
how much time we got left just to at least hear another voice.

2333
02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:06.290
Nothing.
Nothing that they can't hear me cause it's loud.
The Tengiz loud and I'm

2334
02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:09.561
relaxed.

2335
02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:14.030
I'm full on panic attack in their full on panic attack and I'm trying to bring

2336
02:21:14.031 --> 02:21:14.781
myself back.

2337
02:21:14.781 --> 02:21:19.781
I'm calming myself down and I'm sweating heavily like profusely.

2338
02:21:21.081 --> 02:21:25.970
Now I'm dripping and all of a sudden I'm tapping this thing hard.

2339
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:29.870
And a nurse walks in.
As soon as she walks in and flips the light,

2340
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:35.810
I hear the machines start to decompress.
Oh fuck you,
thank God.

2341
02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:40.820
And I'm like,
ah,
she opens a you okay?
Like,
yeah,
I'm good.
You know,

2342
02:21:41.850 --> 02:21:46.820
just get a little hot,
but I had a full blown panic attack in there.

2343
02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:50.930
I have not been in a hole and a hyperbaric chamber said I tried it one time.

2344
02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:57.110
I probably could've done it,
but I just knew I couldn't really tell my body.

2345
02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:01.790
So damage at the time,
like I'm so crazy on my body,
I,
it's hard for me to tell.

2346
02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:04.640
It's supposed to heightened recoveries.
Yeah,
it's supposed to heighten it,

2347
02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:08.030
but I after that day,
like I,
I,

2348
02:22:08.031 --> 02:22:10.220
certain things kind of make me feel a certain way.

2349
02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:12.110
Like I've had tons of Mris after that,

2350
02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:15.620
but they freak me out because you put me in the Mri machine,

2351
02:22:15.621 --> 02:22:18.350
especially when you got to do the head ones.
I got to go in headfirst.

2352
02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:21.080
I don't like those.
I have to give my,

2353
02:22:21.081 --> 02:22:25.650
I have to give myself a pep talk and calm myself down and go in there to do

2354
02:22:25.651 --> 02:22:29.430
those now.
Like I just did one the other last week before I got my,

2355
02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:33.630
had my surgery and the lady's Trump put me,
I'm like,
Yo,
I just got an MRI.

2356
02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:36.450
I got the disk from the last one that I did last week.

2357
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:39.810
The doctor said I could just bring this,
this gain and I'm good.
She's like,

2358
02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:44.640
the doctor wants us to get a new one.
I'm like,
you sure about that?
Like

2359
02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:50.760
I already got the same this year.
I'm like,
no,
we got to do.
I'm like,

2360
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:54.930
how long is it going to be 40 minutes?
Fuck 40 minute.
Cause I,

2361
02:22:54.931 --> 02:22:58.190
my shoulders are wide,
so I'm in there tight.
Right.

2362
02:22:58.590 --> 02:23:03.590
And the machine is right here and it's making a noise and I,

2363
02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:07.830
and it's like,
yeah,
I'm just,
it's a,

2364
02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:12.730
I have to give my mind a pep talk and I'm just so relax bro.
Shoot me,
man.

2365
02:23:12.731 --> 02:23:17.590
Are you good?
You could,
you got this,
you can do this.
And I'll look at it.

2366
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:20.760
I'm like,
let's go.
Let's go,
let's do it.
Let's knock it out.
Boom.

2367
02:23:20.761 --> 02:23:23.750
Then we're doing it and God forbid I,

2368
02:23:23.751 --> 02:23:28.751
I freaking wake up or my mind starts wandering 20 minutes in that I'm just

2369
02:23:29.011 --> 02:23:32.730
fucking halfway panic attack through the rest.
But I'll get through it.

2370
02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:38.160
Yeah.
It's scary,
but you know it since that day,

2371
02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:42.320
you know?
Um,
and he was,
it was crazy.
Like I,

2372
02:23:42.321 --> 02:23:45.600
at that point when I was pregnant,
we were pregnant in my daughter.

2373
02:23:45.601 --> 02:23:49.920
I was just like,
fuck,
am I going to survive?
I can't keep asking.

2374
02:23:49.921 --> 02:23:54.210
This grown man Rashad,
that works hard to support me.
I can't do that.

2375
02:23:54.570 --> 02:23:58.110
I got to make my own.
I kind of do this.
So I was scared.
I was good.

2376
02:23:58.111 --> 02:24:01.380
I know what's going to happen.
And then all of a sudden,
you know,

2377
02:24:01.381 --> 02:24:05.850
right when we were having her,
we have her boom,
boom.
The opportunity comes up.

2378
02:24:05.851 --> 02:24:07.560
We're going to do the ultimate fighter.
I said,
no,

2379
02:24:07.561 --> 02:24:09.990
I don't want to do the ultimate fighter.
And they were shot.
I was like,
Yo Bro,

2380
02:24:09.991 --> 02:24:12.870
you got to do this.
I fucking end up doing the ultimate fighter.
Boom.

2381
02:24:12.871 --> 02:24:15.420
I win the ultimate fighter.
Boom.
I fight for the finale.
Boom.

2382
02:24:15.421 --> 02:24:19.380
I do this like roller coaster,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.
All the hard work,

2383
02:24:19.381 --> 02:24:21.900
everything that I'd been putting it,
boom.
Starts paying off,
paying off.

2384
02:24:22.140 --> 02:24:25.560
Now I'm making 10 and 10.
Okay.
You feel like that's,
that's enough to be able to,

2385
02:24:25.690 --> 02:24:28.090
you know,
sustain me until I got to fight again.
It got to fight again.

2386
02:24:28.091 --> 02:24:31.890
You gotta fight it.
Yeah.
Boom,
this happens,
this happens.
I get with,
you know,

2387
02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:35.160
amazing manager,
Aliyah Abdulaziz who freaking,
you know,

2388
02:24:35.161 --> 02:24:39.360
help just transform the career,
take it to the next level,
you know,

2389
02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:42.920
get with him and now things are going the way that I,
you know,

2390
02:24:42.930 --> 02:24:46.560
I've been wanting them to go boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
everything's ma'am.

2391
02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:48.970
And it was just,
it's just motivation to keep working like,

2392
02:24:49.710 --> 02:24:52.140
and every time I look at my daughter,
how innocent she is,

2393
02:24:52.141 --> 02:24:54.840
how sweet and wonderful she is,
man.
He just freaking,

2394
02:24:55.290 --> 02:24:58.500
it transforms me to where I'm at.

2395
02:24:58.530 --> 02:25:03.330
There's a video and I even have a video of,
of,
uh,
of her,

2396
02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:06.420
cause she's been coming to the gym with me ever since she was six months old.

2397
02:25:07.170 --> 02:25:10.290
I used to take her to the gym.
Mom's at work,
she'd come to the gym with me.

2398
02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:12.240
And when she comes to the gym,
she knows what I do.

2399
02:25:12.241 --> 02:25:16.230
She watches me do it all the time.
This is video where she's,
she'll has,

2400
02:25:16.231 --> 02:25:18.360
she has a gloves and she hits the bag too.
When I,

2401
02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:21.200
when I work out and I was doing a search,

2402
02:25:21.210 --> 02:25:25.810
I was getting ready for a fight and she's running around with me and she's chair

2403
02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:28.120
yours.
She's like,
let's go daddy.

2404
02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:33.280
I'm so proud of him at like tailored to my coach and she's like,
come on Daddy.

2405
02:25:33.281 --> 02:25:36.850
Like,
ah.
And I watch those videos and I'm just like,

2406
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:39.220
I was always one of those hard guideline,
man.

2407
02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:40.930
I ain't gonna be no sucker when I have kids.

2408
02:25:40.931 --> 02:25:42.400
Like that ain't going to be acting like that.

2409
02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:47.800
I can't watch a video with her and not smile is the craziest thing to me and

2410
02:25:47.801 --> 02:25:51.040
don't have children.
We'll never totally understand that.
I know it's a different,

2411
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:54.260
it's a different fire that they light underneath,
man.

2412
02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:56.530
And I'm not going to get motivated.
Once you have kids,

2413
02:25:56.531 --> 02:25:58.450
you're never going to get motivated to know that.

2414
02:25:58.451 --> 02:26:00.670
You probably shouldn't have just been doing that anyways.

2415
02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:05.110
It changed my life for sure.
Yeah,
she is.
Um,
she's,

2416
02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:08.440
she's sees my little,
she's my little rider.
She rides with me.
She,

2417
02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:12.880
I love her to death,
man.
I can't,
nothing can,
I can't explain it.

2418
02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:18.150
I can't explain it.
She is.
She's my,
she's my plus one.
That's what I class my bus.

2419
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:23.200
No matter whatever I do in life from now on,
she's a plus one.
She's with me.

2420
02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:24.843
That's amazing.

2421
02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:31.690
I got to find the video but it's so funny.
It's so funny when I'm,
I'm,

2422
02:26:31.691 --> 02:26:36.691
I'm doing like a circuit and I'm running around and you could see her running

2423
02:26:36.791 --> 02:26:40.990
around like,
come on Daddy.
I'm so proud of him.

2424
02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.350
So she's just hanging out and like no one's watching her.
No,

2425
02:26:44.351 --> 02:26:48.610
she just has this little girl like that was in two,
six months old.

2426
02:26:48.611 --> 02:26:51.790
I put it in a stroke in her car seat and just put her by the side of Matt.
Boom.

2427
02:26:51.791 --> 02:26:54.490
Should just watch me train for two hours.
Wow.

2428
02:26:54.610 --> 02:26:59.470
Two hours to when she got to a certain point where we had like a daycare in the

2429
02:26:59.471 --> 02:27:03.890
gym and she would go in the gym,
she would go to the daycare and she was,

2430
02:27:03.970 --> 02:27:07.420
she was good there.
And then to the point where now,

2431
02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:12.560
like the kids that are in our gym are around similar age and our coaches,

2432
02:27:12.821 --> 02:27:17.080
wife Henry Pooky,
she does a good job and she would just watch them,
you know?

2433
02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:18.420
But they govern themselves.

2434
02:27:18.430 --> 02:27:20.950
They're just play around and the other side and run around.

2435
02:27:20.951 --> 02:27:24.130
But it's not like they around harmful things in the jam,
you know?

2436
02:27:24.131 --> 02:27:27.490
They just have a good time.
That's great that you have that environment.
Yeah.

2437
02:27:27.540 --> 02:27:30.880
And she's like I said,
and like a lot of people are like,
Oh man,

2438
02:27:30.881 --> 02:27:33.910
she's so beautiful.
You know,
you,
you're going to meet.
Nah,
I'm not worried.

2439
02:27:33.911 --> 02:27:36.070
Like my daughter's going to have a nice one too,

2440
02:27:36.071 --> 02:27:40.060
and a hard low kick and whoever can deal with that.
Hey,

2441
02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:47.400
wow.
Yeah man.
But yeah,
she lit that fire and uh,

2442
02:27:48.130 --> 02:27:51.160
and I dreamt about that moment.
So it's still surreal,
Joel.

2443
02:27:51.161 --> 02:27:53.680
I think about that moment,
like when you were interviewing me,

2444
02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:58.270
like I freaking forgot your name.
I'm like,

2445
02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:01.750
Joe,
wait,
your name is Jay.
Yeah.
Your name is Joe.
Fuck.

2446
02:28:02.410 --> 02:28:05.620
That's gotta be surreal when they put that belt around you for the first time.

2447
02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:08.350
Yeah.
Because I imagine there's so many times,
no,
he'd be,
oh,

2448
02:28:08.351 --> 02:28:10.720
let me ask you some honestly,
do you like the new belt or the old bill?

2449
02:28:11.350 --> 02:28:14.930
Initially I used to talk sounds like man,
Nah,
cause that's the only picture,

2450
02:28:14.950 --> 02:28:19.000
that old picture.
And we're human beings.
People don't like change.
You know,

2451
02:28:19.001 --> 02:28:21.180
that was the thing.
I was like,
Oh man,
this shit look like a space.

2452
02:28:21.470 --> 02:28:22.340
But that fucking

2453
02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:25.100
<v 1>thing is phenomenal.
That's your belt.
Phenomenal.</v>

2454
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:30.050
I they knew belt now is phenomenal.
It's amazing.
Beautiful.
It's beautiful.

2455
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:32.510
Of course I always wanted that old bell,
you know.

2456
02:28:32.511 --> 02:28:34.850
But now it's like comparing it to it now.

2457
02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:39.120
Like this new belts got of this colors of this country flags on it and that

2458
02:28:39.121 --> 02:28:41.320
stones,
it's amazing.
I,

2459
02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:44.600
you know the people that are all the ones that are still hating on it and say,

2460
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:45.463
oh no,

2461
02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:49.760
wait till you put that belt on and you wait till you hold that thing and it's

2462
02:28:49.761 --> 02:28:54.140
super heavy and it's amazing.
It's amazing.

2463
02:28:54.470 --> 02:28:58.280
I love it.
What did you think about that?
Uh,
the deal today,
we're,

2464
02:28:58.281 --> 02:29:03.281
all the paper views are going to be on ESPN plus a fucking UFC baby.

2465
02:29:04.791 --> 02:29:09.140
These guys,
hey is always a way to cut out the middle man.
I guess so.

2466
02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:10.490
Yeah.

2467
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:15.050
Hopefully this is the thing is my hope is now the paper view scale for the

2468
02:29:15.051 --> 02:29:18.110
fighters bumps.
That's what I hope.

2469
02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:24.280
But I hope the numbers stay high because people have to subscribe now.

2470
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:28.520
Oh was I believe?
I'm not sure.

2471
02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:32.430
That can't be because if you're paying your money like all,

2472
02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:35.420
unless you get it free,
like,
because if you're going to put this chain,

2473
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:40.280
it says you have to subscribe to ESPN plus in order to get a paper view.

2474
02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:44.060
Well how does that work with people that are out of the country?

2475
02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:45.520
I believe it's cheaper than,

2476
02:29:45.530 --> 02:29:48.410
I think it's the same price you're paying at the end of the day.

2477
02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:51.440
Cause I think it was like 65 or 70.
But you know,

2478
02:29:51.441 --> 02:29:55.670
you get a subscription instead of 65 and he comes at the Sif Christian.
Right.

2479
02:29:55.671 --> 02:29:56.241
So you have,

2480
02:29:56.241 --> 02:30:00.050
but do you have to subscribe and you can cancel at anytime so you can subscribe.

2481
02:30:00.051 --> 02:30:00.650
So you have to re,

2482
02:30:00.650 --> 02:30:02.720
what if someone only wants to buy one or two paper views a year?

2483
02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:07.550
They resubscribe every time,
I guess.
Yeah,
I mean,
yeah,

2484
02:30:07.551 --> 02:30:11.210
I mean it's,
Eh,
it works.
I mean,
if you really want to,

2485
02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:14.390
I hope it doesn't mess with the numbers,
but the thing in sharp was in here,

2486
02:30:14.391 --> 02:30:17.750
so he could talk some shit and I can't talk some shit about this,

2487
02:30:17.930 --> 02:30:21.920
but if Shaw was here,
oh man.
Brandon,
Brandon,
another guy that's,

2488
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:26.750
I think Brendan's doing his shows got big.
It's huge.
Like I was doing phenomenal.

2489
02:30:27.290 --> 02:30:31.790
I went to one of his shows down in Florida,
West Palm,
Florida,

2490
02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:36.260
and um,
I fucking spend a shot,
but I didn't think he was funny.

2491
02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:41.330
I guess I was bored and I was like,
let's go to a Brenden's job show.

2492
02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:45.200
And I go,
he was freaking funny.
Like he told,

2493
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:48.800
he told the whole story man.
And I was impressed,
man,
man.

2494
02:30:48.801 --> 02:30:51.740
Hats off to Brendan Schaub like he was fun.
He basically,

2495
02:30:51.741 --> 02:30:53.930
all he did was tell his story of what's going on,

2496
02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:58.010
what went on in his life and his career.
But the shit,
the twist,

2497
02:30:58.011 --> 02:31:01.610
it was freaking funny.
I went backstage towards the end,
I was like,
man,

2498
02:31:01.611 --> 02:31:03.920
that shows funny.
I didn't think you were funny and without that was,

2499
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:05.090
that was amazing.
I loved it.

2500
02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:09.800
Well he's showing fighters if is a path outside of fighting.
Absolutely.

2501
02:31:09.801 --> 02:31:13.820
He makes way more money now than they ever made during fighting times and he's

2502
02:31:13.821 --> 02:31:16.730
doing well and he's happy and he's,
he fulfilled,

2503
02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:19.470
he's got two great podcasts and he's doing,

2504
02:31:19.471 --> 02:31:23.340
he does comedy shows just to just film to show time special and he's doing them.

2505
02:31:23.341 --> 02:31:27.000
That's amazing.
And which is,
oh excuse me.

2506
02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:31.890
Part of like all this whole shit people given tarnish it and giving him shit
for,

2507
02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:36.840
you know,
doing music or doing movies and all this stuff like that man.

2508
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:39.210
Naw Man.
More power to them.
I'm,

2509
02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:42.280
I'm glad that he's doing that because that's what we want.

2510
02:31:42.310 --> 02:31:45.690
You want all this different revenue streams where you don't have to get punched

2511
02:31:45.691 --> 02:31:49.500
in the face for 50 you got to have a dual strategy.
Yeah.
And I,

2512
02:31:49.501 --> 02:31:51.930
and I love that and I appreciate that.
That's what I want to do.

2513
02:31:52.170 --> 02:31:57.060
Like can you freaking imagined [inaudible] Francis in the next Black Panther?

2514
02:31:58.150 --> 02:32:02.820
Like you can see it,
right?
Like what?
Perfect.
Perfect.

2515
02:32:02.910 --> 02:32:06.900
We should definitely be in that.
Whoever's making that movie,
cast him for that.

2516
02:32:06.901 --> 02:32:10.710
Hey,
yeah,
Frances in Ghana,
you don't need the teachers' accidents at all.

2517
02:32:10.711 --> 02:32:14.100
Like I'm from,
I'm from Nigeria,
there's no team.
You have to teach me.

2518
02:32:14.290 --> 02:32:17.940
You have my accent.
You can teach them,
you know?
Yeah.
I can teach them.

2519
02:32:17.941 --> 02:32:22.830
So authentic.
Yeah.
So I commend them for that man.
You know,

2520
02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:27.830
one of the thing and exit strategy.
Absolutely.
I think I want to do all that.

2521
02:32:27.850 --> 02:32:30.450
Like I know I've been commentating,
I work with Titan.

2522
02:32:30.451 --> 02:32:33.810
They'll see down and south like tighten this amazing show to,
you know,

2523
02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:38.630
I come and take it out of there.
I mean they,
sometimes I'm watching Fox,

2524
02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:43.680
I'm like fuck these guys fought each other for a 101 crazy like good cause they

2525
02:32:43.811 --> 02:32:47.540
want to get into the big show.
Absolutely man.
Yeah.

2526
02:32:47.710 --> 02:32:52.080
I'll commentate for them.
That's how UFC fight pass,
right?

2527
02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:57.110
UFC fibers.
Yeah.
And so,
um,
yeah I want to get into movies.
I,
I've been,
you know,

2528
02:32:57.120 --> 02:32:59.940
practice and I,
I think I could do it.

2529
02:32:59.941 --> 02:33:04.140
Like I'm not in no way saying what they do is easy.
Like those actors,

2530
02:33:04.170 --> 02:33:07.980
I know they work hard to be able to transform and make people feel a certain way

2531
02:33:07.981 --> 02:33:10.740
and evoke certain emotions from different people with your characters.

2532
02:33:11.070 --> 02:33:14.400
That's a real art.
So I respect that and I want to learn more about that.

2533
02:33:14.401 --> 02:33:17.730
And Yeah,
I definitely want,
I want to do movies to get more famous.

2534
02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:21.330
Richard and I get punched in the face.
Oh for sure.
Absolutely.

2535
02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:25.710
What about doing a podcast?
You ever thought of that?
Yeah,
I would love it.

2536
02:33:25.850 --> 02:33:30.100
You know,
I just haven't been approached with the right,
you know,

2537
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:34.350
with the right situation.
Beautiful thing about podcasts.
You don't need anybody.

2538
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:38.220
Yeah.
You don't need shit,
you just need a fucking tape player.

2539
02:33:38.250 --> 02:33:40.770
You could use it on your phone,
you can record what you think.

2540
02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:46.040
There's great little tiny microphone that stick in the bottom of your iPhone and

2541
02:33:46.141 --> 02:33:49.860
it worked great and you just sit down and talk about shit.
Yeah,

2542
02:33:49.861 --> 02:33:52.790
we'll have to give that a try.
And when I don't want right now is,

2543
02:33:52.850 --> 02:33:57.570
it's strange that distract me from,
because I,
I'm not one of those guys who were,

2544
02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:00.430
oh yeah,
I've got to find out.
I got to be in training camp and you know,

2545
02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:04.110
and if I don't have a fight I'm just doing what the fuck I want to freaking

2546
02:34:04.111 --> 02:34:08.100
practice every day I'm going to practice cause I,
it's like my life right now.

2547
02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:10.500
Does he know?
I don't know what to do if I don't go to practice.

2548
02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:13.850
So you're recovering from the surgery?
Yeah,

2549
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:15.420
I'm going to try some different things.

2550
02:34:15.450 --> 02:34:18.970
Does it feel good though to just like slow down a little bit,

2551
02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:20.710
smell the roses?

2552
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:26.260
Not really because this whole week I couldn't freaking train.
Like,

2553
02:34:26.290 --> 02:34:29.910
I wanted to go to the gym and I at least hit the back.
Excuse me,

2554
02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:32.410
hit the bag or something.
Or just,
you know,

2555
02:34:32.411 --> 02:34:37.390
cause I think I'm an addict of that burn of course,
that,
that,
that,

2556
02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:41.890
that burn of an orc out and it's lifting or pushups or doing some pushing

2557
02:34:41.891 --> 02:34:46.000
yourself.
I'm an addict of that and so when I don't have that,

2558
02:34:46.001 --> 02:34:50.770
it's kind of like what's it doing you,
you,
and that's what made you the champion.

2559
02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:54.190
I mean that that engine that's inside you is what made you the champion.

2560
02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:58.690
It only makes sense.
Yeah.
If you,
if you really could just relax and kickback,

2561
02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:03.670
I'd be nervous.
Yeah.
Ugly like down shifting because that's what they say.

2562
02:35:03.671 --> 02:35:05.870
They're like,
oh you change,
you change.

2563
02:35:06.730 --> 02:35:09.820
Use different person now you know you don't got Hollywood on us.
You don't,

2564
02:35:10.090 --> 02:35:12.690
I fucking hate when people say that.
Yeah.
That's a gross thing.

2565
02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:17.620
People just love to come up with some excuses for why they don't do as well as

2566
02:35:17.621 --> 02:35:19.240
you are.
Why Oh,

2567
02:35:19.241 --> 02:35:23.080
when I was going to bring up too is that I saw you do a cause when I started

2568
02:35:23.081 --> 02:35:27.100
researching you and watching your stuff,
I saw the podcasts.

2569
02:35:27.101 --> 02:35:31.120
You deal with a freaking Jamie Foxx years ago or so.
He's amazing.

2570
02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:35.050
Fucking I,
I,
I mean I'm such a huge,
I'm a huge Jamie Foxx.

2571
02:35:35.051 --> 02:35:39.760
He's fucking talented.
I mean talking to about the triple threat,
he could do any,

2572
02:35:39.761 --> 02:35:44.320
how many people can do it does stand up comedy and like chicks are in trouble.

2573
02:35:44.350 --> 02:35:46.820
Sings incredible.
Yeah.
Women are in,

2574
02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:50.530
Oh my God can make you laugh.

2575
02:35:50.531 --> 02:35:54.750
He can say her name [inaudible] with his voice and he can freaking act and I

2576
02:35:54.751 --> 02:35:56.070
want to do is you're lucky he's not gay.

2577
02:35:58.470 --> 02:36:02.720
They me in trouble.
He's got an amazing man.
He's,

2578
02:36:02.721 --> 02:36:04.730
he's such a genuine guy too.

2579
02:36:05.130 --> 02:36:07.930
Cause I mean I've known him for a long time,

2580
02:36:07.931 --> 02:36:11.350
but he's a fucking academy award winning actor.

2581
02:36:11.740 --> 02:36:15.300
When he comes in and hangs out with you,
you would never imagine it.
I that's,

2582
02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:18.190
that's what I grabbed the energies like that is what I grabbed it to normal.

2583
02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:23.220
It's like Rashad Evans shot is the same way and those energies I really

2584
02:36:23.770 --> 02:36:25.990
gravitate towards and I love,

2585
02:36:26.290 --> 02:36:30.340
there are people who don't take themselves seriously,
but they do,

2586
02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:32.560
they do horse like they do,

2587
02:36:32.561 --> 02:36:36.910
but they don't pretend they're better than you or anything.
Like I ran into,

2588
02:36:36.940 --> 02:36:41.500
Jamie had a fucking gas station like a 66,
seven months ago.
Some guy.

2589
02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:44.590
What time was this normal time like during the day he was actually with his

2590
02:36:44.591 --> 02:36:47.740
daughter.
She was coming from a martial arts class and uh,

2591
02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:51.520
I'm getting gas and this guy pulls up in this crazy fucking car.

2592
02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:55.090
Like I never saw one of these things before.
I forget what it's called.

2593
02:36:55.330 --> 02:37:00.280
Some weird SUV.
It looks like it's from the future.
Like,
oh,
the Lamborghini.

2594
02:37:00.281 --> 02:37:02.740
Yes.
You know?
No,
it's not a Lamborghini.
It's some crazy.

2595
02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:05.560
He knows the guy who makes them crazy.
I mean,

2596
02:37:05.561 --> 02:37:07.810
I don't even know what the fuck it is.
I never saw him from like,

2597
02:37:07.811 --> 02:37:08.860
what is this thing?

2598
02:37:09.010 --> 02:37:12.340
And I'm looking at this thing and then the do rolls down the window.
It goes,

2599
02:37:12.341 --> 02:37:17.000
what's up Joe?
What's up Jamie?
I go into the fuck is this man,

2600
02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:19.570
he's so normal.
He jumps out of the car and starts talking.

2601
02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:23.420
People just start coming up to him and he's like,
Hey,
what's up?
How you doing?

2602
02:37:23.870 --> 02:37:27.230
Just totally normal.
I kind of,

2603
02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:32.060
I feel a little bit of that because it's tired cause I still do the same shit.

2604
02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:33.380
Like I,
I'm still,

2605
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:37.070
I still go to the same little nutrition shop that I go to get a protein shake

2606
02:37:37.071 --> 02:37:39.500
here and there and I still go to this thing.

2607
02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:43.640
Like I took my daughter to the movies before I left to go to the iPad and I just

2608
02:37:43.641 --> 02:37:47.350
roll in.
It's just me,
me and her.
Perfect.
You know what is freaking role in it?

2609
02:37:47.351 --> 02:37:51.260
As long as you can.
People I and people ask for pictures and uh,

2610
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:54.110
and I think one guy one time,
Zack Brock and fuck,

2611
02:37:54.111 --> 02:37:57.470
I can't believe you're here bro.
Like,
Bro,
you serious bro?

2612
02:37:57.471 --> 02:38:02.010
Like this one guy was like,
Bro,
you hear me?
Whose mom,
Bro,

2613
02:38:02.011 --> 02:38:04.950
can I get it bro?
Can I get a picture with you bro?
He almost like quiet.

2614
02:38:04.951 --> 02:38:09.170
And I was like,
I was like,
yeah bro.
Of course you can get it.
Yeah,

2615
02:38:09.171 --> 02:38:11.440
you want me to take it?
Which angle you want me to take a couple?

2616
02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:13.340
I'm just snapping a picture and I'm kidding.

2617
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:16.690
But it just couldn't believe the fact that I'm normally,

2618
02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:20.930
people are just normal people.
We're just normal.
People are just people.

2619
02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:21.793
They're just wonderful.

2620
02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:26.770
And I think one of the great things about someone who accomplished or something

2621
02:38:26.771 --> 02:38:31.771
it's pretty spectacular is that you didn't just do that and win the world title,

2622
02:38:32.930 --> 02:38:35.750
but you set a lot of people in motion.

2623
02:38:35.751 --> 02:38:39.740
You know how many people watch that and must been pumped up and excited about it

2624
02:38:39.741 --> 02:38:41.330
and then started doing things.

2625
02:38:41.331 --> 02:38:43.660
It's probably a lot of people that decided to start fighting because watch,

2626
02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:46.190
I mean millions of people watch that fight.

2627
02:38:46.250 --> 02:38:50.540
So stop and think about how many different people must have been inspired by

2628
02:38:50.541 --> 02:38:50.760
that.

2629
02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:54.590
How many different people saw the highlights on Instagram and on Twitter and on

2630
02:38:54.591 --> 02:38:57.170
Youtube and how many people got fired up because of that.

2631
02:38:57.230 --> 02:39:01.010
And that's what I'm thankful for.
I'm thankful for the opportunity.

2632
02:39:01.011 --> 02:39:06.011
Shout out to the UFC for creating such a business and a market now,

2633
02:39:06.051 --> 02:39:06.884
and two words,

2634
02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:12.020
you can touch so many people all across the world because that's in fighting is

2635
02:39:12.021 --> 02:39:13.850
one thing that's a universal language.

2636
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:18.440
It doesn't matter if you fucking speak Russian,
you speak English,
you speak,

2637
02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:23.090
you know,
equal or euro by doesn't matter.
You know,

2638
02:39:23.091 --> 02:39:27.490
fighting this,
this,
this,
nobody knows this.

2639
02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:30.290
You don't have to know the rules.
Everybody.
It's not like cricket.
Yeah,

2640
02:39:30.291 --> 02:39:33.790
it's universal.
So it's one of those things that that's a sport that's going to,

2641
02:39:33.791 --> 02:39:36.920
it's going to grow is only gonna get bigger and bigger.
Man,
shout out to the UFC,

2642
02:39:36.921 --> 02:39:40.460
Dana,
you know,
hundred all these guys,
Lorenzo Fertitta,

2643
02:39:40.461 --> 02:39:44.120
all these guys that created this and package it to the where it is now because

2644
02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:48.440
it's given us platforms to be able to touch people and yeah.
And that I truly am.

2645
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:52.600
I'm aware of what that could have done for certain people.
Certain people.
Yeah.

2646
02:39:52.601 --> 02:39:56.570
It might have not thought him in individual person,
but someone,
you know,

2647
02:39:56.571 --> 02:39:59.750
I might've inspired someone to start fighting that come from where I come from

2648
02:39:59.810 --> 02:40:04.530
or somewhere in China,
Indonesia,
anywhere in any world.
Yes.
I'm thankful.

2649
02:40:04.531 --> 02:40:09.290
I'm very thankful for that.
Yeah,
I mean that is a big part of what a champion is.

2650
02:40:09.291 --> 02:40:09.471
I mean,

2651
02:40:09.471 --> 02:40:13.470
we were talking earlier about Marvin Hagler or d different fighters that I

2652
02:40:13.471 --> 02:40:16.860
watched when I was a kid coming up.
Those people give you energy.
You know,

2653
02:40:16.890 --> 02:40:19.650
this is something about watching someone do something spectacular.

2654
02:40:19.651 --> 02:40:24.210
They give you energy and when you hear a story like yours,
you know,

2655
02:40:24.211 --> 02:40:27.450
a kid who immigrates to the United States at eight years old and goes through

2656
02:40:27.451 --> 02:40:30.270
all the shit that you went through and becomes a world champion.

2657
02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:34.440
People hear that man.
It makes it,
gets them off the fucking couch,
man.

2658
02:40:34.441 --> 02:40:38.340
It gets them to do things.
It does.
And,
and um,
uh,

2659
02:40:38.341 --> 02:40:42.210
thing about during that fight is there was two other guys at two special guests

2660
02:40:42.211 --> 02:40:46.470
that I had come to the fight and they were both Nigerian nightmares,

2661
02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:51.800
you know,
and they're respectful,
rise sports.
And write a Christian a coin,

2662
02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:53.473
you know,

2663
02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:57.540
Kansas city chiefs running back was called the Nigeria nightmare because he was

2664
02:40:57.541 --> 02:41:00.810
a fucking terror.
You know,
Chrissy,
you getting a whole Christina Coy,

2665
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:02.970
I don't know anything about football able itself.

2666
02:41:03.060 --> 02:41:07.590
Jamie's laughing man is with us.
Yeah,
he was a fucking monster man.

2667
02:41:07.591 --> 02:41:11.880
He was like,
uh,
I think he was 200 like 260 pound running back.

2668
02:41:12.780 --> 02:41:17.100
Like I'm talking Mack truck run into do boom,
boom,
boom.
And you know,

2669
02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:21.030
and he has speed and power.
So he was considered in Nigeria nightmare.

2670
02:41:21.031 --> 02:41:24.070
So he was one of those first guys that people really resignated as a Nigeria

2671
02:41:24.090 --> 02:41:28.650
nightmare in American sports.
And I never watched him play live,

2672
02:41:28.651 --> 02:41:29.484
of course not.

2673
02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.690
But these are the guys that they create such a legacy to where when you're

2674
02:41:33.691 --> 02:41:36.210
growing up somehow you hear about that legacy.

2675
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:40.740
And that inspired me to want to be great bearing that nickname.

2676
02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:44.900
And also Samuel Peter's aren't,
if,
you know Pete Samuel,

2677
02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:49.440
Peter have WBC heavyweight champion of the wall was at the fights and man,

2678
02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:53.460
these guys are,
man,
I didn't,
I never saw him fight live.

2679
02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.340
But he creates such a legacy to where I heard about him.

2680
02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:01.640
I had to research them and these guys inspired me to where now having that

2681
02:42:02.191 --> 02:42:05.940
nickname you gotta you know,
I have to hold it to the highest regards.

2682
02:42:05.941 --> 02:42:09.390
I have to do the best that I can to be able to inspire many,

2683
02:42:09.391 --> 02:42:13.830
many kids that are going to come,
you know,
in the future.
So man,
I,
I'm,
I'm,

2684
02:42:13.831 --> 02:42:18.130
I'm thankful for the opportunity and I'm just grateful as I'm,
I'm a,

2685
02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:23.700
I'm a humble,
a little kid from Nigeria,
you know,
I used to walk around barefoot,

2686
02:42:23.701 --> 02:42:26.460
step on nails,
glasses,
you know,
things like that.

2687
02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:30.510
And now look where we at now he rock his shoe designers,
baby

2688
02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:36.390
welterweight champion of the world.
Undisputed.
Yeah,
man.

2689
02:42:36.391 --> 02:42:39.890
And it's pretty incredible.
Yeah.
Does it feel real?
I mean,
I,

2690
02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:43.980
I'm still feel normal.
I don't feel anything,
but you know,
you're the champ.
Yeah.

2691
02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:47.500
I mean,
but I think part of why it feels the way it does it,
because I've,

2692
02:42:47.501 --> 02:42:52.410
I've known for a long time,
like I,
I felt like it for a long time.
I've,
I've,

2693
02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:56.250
I've known nothing's going to change the way I'm going to train for these fights

2694
02:42:56.251 --> 02:42:58.500
and I'm just going to train change in my mentality.

2695
02:42:58.510 --> 02:43:01.980
I'm gonna approach these fights all the same.
It's still a fight is a fight.

2696
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:05.160
It's not all I'm trying to defend this or I'm trying to hold onto this.

2697
02:43:05.161 --> 02:43:06.120
I don't give a shit.

2698
02:43:06.690 --> 02:43:09.510
I'm still going in there to dominate you from start to finish,

2699
02:43:09.511 --> 02:43:12.700
to break you mentally.
So you want to freaking fight me again.

2700
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:17.260
That's my approach to every fight.
So nothing changes.
I don't feel different.

2701
02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:20.350
Everyone,
the only thing now is as cord Pete.
Everyone's like,

2702
02:43:20.410 --> 02:43:23.380
treat me a little different.
People kind of,
you know,

2703
02:43:23.770 --> 02:43:25.780
people hold doors for me now and shit like that.

2704
02:43:25.781 --> 02:43:30.370
Hopefully you're making a shitload more money.
Well,
yeah,
let's,
let's,
uh,

2705
02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:35.860
Dana,
hopefully,
uh,
hopefully that,
but um,

2706
02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:38.560
that's the only difference.
Like I don't feel different.

2707
02:43:38.561 --> 02:43:41.510
I don't act any different.
I,
at least at home,
no.

2708
02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:46.120
When we were talking earlier about guys who like to trash talk and what trash

2709
02:43:46.121 --> 02:43:49.670
talking is kind of doing for the sport,
whether it's good or bad,
you know it's,

2710
02:43:49.671 --> 02:43:50.950
some guys are really funny with it.

2711
02:43:50.951 --> 02:43:54.520
Like Connor's fucking hilarious with it and they say something about that.

2712
02:43:54.521 --> 02:43:57.340
That is like when Jeremy Stevens said something about,
he was like,

2713
02:43:57.341 --> 02:43:59.640
who the fuck is that guy?
I mean

2714
02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:05.810
the most famous line if I again Emma that it's,

2715
02:44:05.980 --> 02:44:10.060
yeah,
I mean it's,
I mean,
oh man.
I mean how many times has that been repeated?

2716
02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:14.590
A shout out to Jeremy Stevens.
I guys come and scrap always.

2717
02:44:15.850 --> 02:44:20.850
But I think that that's not the only way a guy can sell a lot of paper views.

2718
02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:24.610
Guy Can also sell a lot of paper views by being exceptional.

2719
02:44:24.850 --> 02:44:26.590
And that was the case of George St Pierre.

2720
02:44:26.620 --> 02:44:30.460
Like George St Pierre was never a trash talker and it's still sold a shit load

2721
02:44:30.461 --> 02:44:33.970
of paper views,
I think.
I think we're as human and human beings,

2722
02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.690
humans can kind of tell the energy.
It's a fake energy.

2723
02:44:38.020 --> 02:44:40.600
See people can tell people are put off by it.

2724
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:44.990
Well people who are also a namerd of people that are exceptional,
you know,

2725
02:44:45.370 --> 02:44:47.950
if you just,
you can just be exceptional.

2726
02:44:47.951 --> 02:44:52.951
You don't have to just be talking shit all the time and pushing each other at

2727
02:44:53.051 --> 02:44:56.890
press conferences is not the only way.
No,
but then you get those,
you know,

2728
02:44:56.900 --> 02:44:58.370
you get the majority of the,

2729
02:44:58.371 --> 02:45:03.371
the the Shitty Fan who who likes that stuff wants to see a too.

2730
02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:07.480
Yeah.
There's a few.
So who,
even though they know it's fake,

2731
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:10.360
they just still like that.
They just,
well they want to see it,
you know,

2732
02:45:10.361 --> 02:45:13.930
so they put that pressure on people like you know,
you got to do this,

2733
02:45:13.931 --> 02:45:17.410
you have to do that because those are the guys that are going to tweet.

2734
02:45:17.411 --> 02:45:21.370
You don't,
do they tell you?
No.

2735
02:45:21.371 --> 02:45:26.350
I'll give you advice on how to talk or no.
I mean data's never once said,

2736
02:45:26.351 --> 02:45:30.010
you gotta talk,
you gotta do this.
You got no,
they don't do that.

2737
02:45:30.070 --> 02:45:35.020
Do you feel though that sometimes they show you that by favoring guys who do do

2738
02:45:35.021 --> 02:45:39.310
that?
Like,
like when Colby got a shot at the interim title before you.
Yeah,

2739
02:45:39.311 --> 02:45:44.311
because this is the thing is when someone starts doing that and they're starting

2740
02:45:44.531 --> 02:45:45.880
to trend a lot more,

2741
02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:49.210
of course the company gets behind them because the company is about money.

2742
02:45:49.570 --> 02:45:51.430
It's about green.
Like they gotta make money.

2743
02:45:52.010 --> 02:45:54.670
That's the one thing that I understand more than anything right now.

2744
02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:58.320
They are about green.
Like people will say,
oh Danny hates me cause this Natalie,

2745
02:45:58.530 --> 02:46:00.640
they didn't the only race day and cares about is green.

2746
02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:02.950
Like if you're going to make money,
Dana cares.

2747
02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:07.720
And so nothing that once someone starts doing it and they're starting to create

2748
02:46:07.721 --> 02:46:09.440
a little,
they started to have a little buzz.

2749
02:46:09.650 --> 02:46:13.280
Of course Dana is going to push because dag eyes my bring in money making more

2750
02:46:13.281 --> 02:46:16.370
money.
So I understand that aspect of it,
but it's not,

2751
02:46:16.610 --> 02:46:19.940
I don't think is Dana necessarily saying all may you got to act like does you

2752
02:46:19.941 --> 02:46:21.800
got to do this because this is what sells.

2753
02:46:21.801 --> 02:46:26.800
Know Conor did it and if Connor Connor became who he became,
so yeah,

2754
02:46:26.810 --> 02:46:30.770
Connor is going to be favored because Connor brings in millions and millions of

2755
02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:35.580
dollars.
Habib did it his way and now hubby brings him when he,

2756
02:46:35.610 --> 02:46:39.290
you know,
he's favored,
so he's going to bring in money and things like that.

2757
02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:43.070
But Dan is not going around saying,
Yo,
you gotta be like this guy.

2758
02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:45.890
You gotta be like that guy.
You know?
Bisbing did it his way,

2759
02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:49.310
home base being brought in money.
George did it his way.

2760
02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:52.940
It's just as long as you want to be real,
you,
what you choose to do,

2761
02:46:52.941 --> 02:46:55.700
you're going to be real with yourself.
Because at the end of the day,

2762
02:46:55.701 --> 02:46:57.740
you have to look at yourself in the mirror.
Yes.

2763
02:46:57.770 --> 02:47:01.280
If you can do what you want to do and then at the end of the day,

2764
02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:03.680
look in the mirror when everyone's gone,
it's just you.

2765
02:47:03.681 --> 02:47:06.260
You take a piss in the morning and then you wake up linking yourself and your

2766
02:47:06.261 --> 02:47:08.630
man.
You're like,
oh,
I'm all right then that's fine.

2767
02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:13.880
Do they do you beautiful?
Beautifully put.
You're a bad motherfucker.
Tomorrow.

2768
02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:17.090
My man,
thanks for doing this,
man.
Thank you.
It's a pleasure.

2769
02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:20.450
Thanks for telling me your story and inspiring people and I wish you nothing but

2770
02:47:20.451 --> 02:47:23.400
the best.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Tomorrow it was spawn,

2771
02:47:23.410 --> 02:47:24.680
ladies and gentlemen,
the champ.

2772
02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:32.733
<v 0>Hm.</v>

2773
02:47:35.330 --> 02:47:35.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>
