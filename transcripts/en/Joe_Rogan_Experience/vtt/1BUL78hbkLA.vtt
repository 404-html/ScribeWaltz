00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>but then over the course of the maybe three,</v>

3
00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.580
<v Speaker 1>four or five years or so,</v>

4
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:08.110
<v Speaker 1>they started having real issues</v>

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.820
<v Speaker 2>and they don't necessarily tie that to the Diet because they remember feeling so</v>

6
00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 2>much better when they first switched to it,</v>

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 2>so they don't think that what they're going,</v>

8
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 2>what's happening three or four years later,</v>

9
00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 2>it could be the cause of their problems.</v>

10
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I see this all the time with vegetarian and Vegan diets.</v>

11
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I want to</v>

12
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about in terms of that because most people who switched to a</v>

13
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian or Vegan Diet,</v>

14
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see some instant benefits because of the fact that you have much</v>

15
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>more nutrient dense foods.</v>

16
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>You're eating a lot of vegetables,</v>

17
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:38.684
<v Speaker 1>you're you're,</v>

18
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you're changing your die in a lot of ways to the positive or towards a positive</v>

19
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>away from what you were talking about,</v>

20
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>those primary foods and Americans tend to eat all the processed sugar,</v>

21
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

22
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>that just nonsense and chicken tenders and all that crap that people eat,</v>

23
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>which is just so goddamn common,</v>

24
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>So automatically over that you're going to see some longterm benefits.</v>

26
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that I've been reading is about people that have found</v>

27
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>that over the longterm,</v>

28
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.413
<v Speaker 1>the lack,</v>

29
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>this is contrary to what a lot of people think.</v>

30
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Lack of saturated fat and cholesterol,</v>

32
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>dietary cholesterol and saturated fat leads to hormonal imbalances,</v>

33
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.970
<v Speaker 1>leads to your body having a harder time producing sex hormones and all these</v>

34
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:27.221
<v Speaker 1>different issues with your health or your body almost starts robbing itself to</v>

35
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>make up for the nutritional deficiencies of your diet.</v>

36
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

37
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

38
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

39
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 2>we talked about this before,</v>

41
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>but humans are animals and we're,</v>

42
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.631
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

43
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 2>while we're omnivores and wait a minute,</v>

44
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I saw a video on youtube.</v>

45
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy that says there's no way that we are herbivores.</v>

46
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>And then if we were so fucking wacky,</v>

47
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:48.991
<v Speaker 1>dude was saying,</v>

48
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

49
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.981
<v Speaker 1>if you're really a,</v>

50
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

51
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>an Omnivore,</v>

53
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to eat a squirrel.</v>

54
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Just grab it and eat it raw and like,</v>

55
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.813
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

56
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

57
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it's just the most bizarre.</v>

58
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.240
<v Speaker 2>There's some strange arguments out there.</v>

59
00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like we shouldn't drink milk because you know,</v>

60
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 2>there were the only,</v>

61
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

62
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 2>we're the only animal in nature and in nature that drinks the milk of another</v>

64
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:11.530
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

65
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Well we're the only animal nature that uses iPhones too.</v>

67
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 2>I have a whole bit about this.</v>

68
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:17.110
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious you said that.</v>

69
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

70
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

71
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Appointing people do fly planes,</v>

72
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

73
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 2>call each other on the phone and tell each other how awesome milk is.</v>

74
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a ridiculous argument.</v>

75
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.893
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

76
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

77
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.371
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

78
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:28.204
<v Speaker 2>getting back to,</v>

79
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 2>to their ideological arguments more than scientific.</v>

80
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.741
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

81
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

82
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.140
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't stand up to scrutiny,</v>

83
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 2>but with,</v>

84
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

85
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.630
<v Speaker 2>with a vegetarian or Vegan Diet.</v>

86
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.730
<v Speaker 2>So there's lots of different ways to look at this.</v>

87
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 2>This starting with an evolutionary perspective,</v>

88
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 2>which I was getting at.</v>

89
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.713
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

90
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.550
<v Speaker 2>omnivores are opportunistic.</v>

91
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.540
<v Speaker 2>They will eat whatever is available and they'll eat the most nutrient dense</v>

92
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 2>foods that are available if they have a choice.</v>

93
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.361
<v Speaker 2>And that's just,</v>

94
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:52.661
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

95
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 2>that's survival.</v>

96
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.393
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

97
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 2>an animal that is able to utilize the nutrients that are available in its</v>

98
00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>environment to maximum advantage is going to survive compared to one that</v>

99
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>

100
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>That's basic evolutionary theory.</v>

101
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.393
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

102
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.743
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

103
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>if you study traditional peoples,</v>

104
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know,</v>

105
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:13.680
<v Speaker 2>still there's never been a traditional PE,</v>

106
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 2>group that that has ever been identified that voluntarily followed a Vegan or</v>

108
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 2>even vegetarian diet that I know of.</v>

109
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 2>So that should tell you something right there.</v>

110
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.971
<v Speaker 2>And ironically,</v>

111
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you and I are even having this conversation,</v>

112
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 2>this wouldn't even be happening if humans had not learned it's eaten meat</v>

113
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 2>basically where there are a lot of anthropologists who now believe that eating</v>

114
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 2>meat was essentially what made us human.</v>

115
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

116
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 2>we came down out of the trees and we developed the development of tools that</v>

117
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 2>could crack bones to give us access to the Merrill,</v>

118
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 2>which is super nutrient dance or to sliced meat,</v>

119
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 2>which allowed us to be able to digest the meat more quickly.</v>

120
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

121
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.241
<v Speaker 2>number one.</v>

122
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 2>And then to the development of fire,</v>

123
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 2>which allowed us to cook meat and cooking makes the nutrients in meat more</v>

124
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>bioavailable,</v>

125
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 2>allowed us to spend less time foraging for food.</v>

126
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.190
<v Speaker 2>So most large prime,</v>

127
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 2>it's like gorillas or chimpanzees span over 80% of their day foraging for food</v>

128
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 2>because most of the foods they eat are really not nutrient dense.</v>

129
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 2>So they have to eat a boatload of stuff and just sit there and chew on the</v>

130
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 2>plants all day to get enough nutrients.</v>

131
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

132
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and so this evolutionary theory is that we learn to extract and harvest much</v>

133
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>more nutrient dense foods from animals,</v>

134
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 2>fats and and other nutrients and the meats and organ meats.</v>

135
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 2>And we had,</v>

136
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 2>we could then spend a lot less of our time going around getting food,</v>

137
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 2>which allowed us and then develop bigger brains and you know,</v>

138
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 2>become human and have this conversation where we're talking about a vegetarian</v>

139
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 2>and Vegan diets.</v>

140
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

141
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>it is kind of an interesting,</v>

142
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>and it's also important to differentiate the difference between what you're</v>

143
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>saying is essentially this science behind the development of the human animal,</v>

144
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

145
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Versus the moral and ethical debates that lead and environmental debates,</v>

146
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>which is also moral.</v>

147
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>So we can,</v>

148
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

149
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about that too,</v>

150
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>which is what influences people to become vegetarians and vegans,</v>

151
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>which I totally respect.</v>

152
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I understand what they're saying.</v>

153
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.310
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is when they distort the reality of the scientific findings,</v>

154
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>the human animal and diet.</v>

155
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's an issue with a lot of people that are vegetarians and vegans that go</v>

156
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>on about how healthy they feel and how about how awesome,</v>

157
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>but they're not doing blood lipid profiles.</v>

158
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.471
<v Speaker 1>And when they do,</v>

159
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>like Sam Harris,</v>

160
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>who is kind of the forum for ethical perspective,</v>

161
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>for ethical reasons,</v>

162
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>is tried a Vegan diet and his health is suffering.</v>

163
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>He's getting real issues with his blood lipids.</v>

164
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 1>What can someone do if they want to file that diet?</v>

166
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.071
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

167
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>what is imperative as far as healthy fats as far as getting,</v>

168
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>making sure that your body doesn't have,</v>

169
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>you're not taking in too many simple carbohydrates like,</v>

170
00:05:58.701 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

171
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.381
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

172
00:05:59.381 --> 00:05:59.631
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

173
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>what steps need to be taking place?</v>

174
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And this is obviously not saying that you shouldn't fall Vegan Diet.</v>

175
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't follow a vegetarian diet.</v>

176
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>You should do whatever you want to do.</v>

177
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>But there's gotta be some ways to mitigate some of the health consequences,</v>

178
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

179
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

180
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.451
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>

181
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that I agree with you that people should be free to make their own</v>

182
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.711
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>

183
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I've never pushed a particular diet.</v>

184
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

185
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 2>people sometimes ask me,</v>

186
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 2>how do you convince someone to go Paleo?</v>

187
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

188
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.633
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

189
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't spend my time doing that.</v>

190
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 2>If someone wants my advice and ask me,</v>

191
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:28.371
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it to them,</v>

192
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going around proselytizing for a particular way of eating.</v>

193
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

194
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.981
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

195
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:34.701
<v Speaker 2>let's break this down.</v>

196
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about the evolutionary argument for eating animal products and</v>

197
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a scientific argument,</v>

198
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 2>which now is what we're talking about the issue with.</v>

199
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 2>And we should,</v>

200
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 2>we should even kind of distinguish between vegetarian and Vegan diets cause</v>

201
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

202
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 2>they're actually quite different.</v>

203
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.050
<v Speaker 2>And I think it is possible for some people to be healthy with a vegetarian diet.</v>

204
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a lot less likely with the Vegan Diet.</v>

205
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 2>And I guess I would say it this way.</v>

206
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

207
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.740
<v Speaker 2>if you have,</v>

208
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 2>if you're Vegan and you're eating a Vegan Diet,</v>

209
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 2>you need to have a perfect vegan diet to be healthy and you need to know what</v>

210
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 2>you're doing in terms of supplementation and how to meet the nutrient needs that</v>

211
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 2>aren't being met through diet.</v>

212
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 2>And at least in my experience,</v>

213
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 2>there are very few that actually do it right.</v>

214
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

215
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.480
<v Speaker 2>when it's done right,</v>

216
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible for some people to be,</v>

217
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

218
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 2>to be healthy and thrive.</v>

219
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's obvious because there are people like rich roll who's like out there.</v>

220
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 2>He's a Vegan triathlete who's out there doing centuries and killing it,</v>

221
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.933
<v Speaker 2>ultra marathon.</v>

222
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 2>He is just an amazing athlete and he's Vegan.</v>

223
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:41.451
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

224
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:42.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that it's not working for it and you can try to say that you're</v>

226
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 2>going help.</v>

227
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like he's 30 years older than me.</v>

228
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

229
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:51.250
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

230
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.041
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy.</v>

231
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 2>I've met him a couple of times.</v>

232
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

233
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

234
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:56.721
<v Speaker 2>so it certainly,</v>

235
00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 2>it works for some people,</v>

236
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:01.430
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of factors that determine whether it's going to work.</v>

237
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 2>So one is how well you do it too is you know,</v>

238
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 2>whether you know what you're dealing with,</v>

239
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 2>supplementation in terms of getting the necessary nutrients.</v>

240
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Three is genetics.</v>

241
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 2>So let me,</v>

242
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 2>there are genetic differences that determine how well we convert precursor</v>

243
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 2>nutrients into the nutrients that we actually need.</v>

244
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 2>And let me give three examples to make this more real.</v>

245
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>So one is EPA and Dha.</v>

246
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 2>These are these long chain of mega three fats that we've heard so much about</v>

247
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 2>that are crucial for brain function,</v>

248
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>cardiovascular function,</v>

249
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

250
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 2>And we primarily,</v>

251
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 2>you get them by eating fish.</v>

252
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 2>There are no sources of those in a plant based diet except for algae.</v>

253
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

254
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 2>but an algae is not the bioavailable.</v>

255
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And how many people do know that eat algae?</v>

256
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

257
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can,</v>

258
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you can cause that famous green supplementation stuff is,</v>

259
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you can use it as a supplement but very few people are eating it.</v>

260
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.763
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

261
00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

262
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

263
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 2>but there is something called Alpha linolenic acid,</v>

264
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 2>which is in walnuts and flax seed.</v>

265
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.680
<v Speaker 2>That's an a mega three plant fat and,</v>

266
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 2>and humans in theory can convert some of that plant based Omega Three into this</v>

267
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 2>long chain EPA and Dha that we need.</v>

268
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 2>But the thing,</v>

269
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.043
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

270
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.230
<v Speaker 2>only about five to 10% of that gets converted into EPA and even less to Dha,</v>

271
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 2>like two to 5%.</v>

272
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.560
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be chugging tablespoons of flax oil in order to get as much EPA</v>

273
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 2>or Dha Epa that you would get from eating just a little bit of fish.</v>

274
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's if everything is going well,</v>

275
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>because if you have deficiency of any nutrients that are involved in the</v>

276
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 2>enzymatic conversion of those plant based fats into the long chain fats,</v>

277
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 2>then you won't make those conversions at that optimal rate.</v>

278
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 2>It'll be even less.</v>

279
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.651
<v Speaker 2>And ironically,</v>

280
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:50.430
<v Speaker 2>many of those nutrients are nutrients that are not well represented in a Vegan</v>

281
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 2>or vegetarian diet.</v>

282
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's one example.</v>

283
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Another would be vitamin K two,</v>

284
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.250
<v Speaker 2>which is uh,</v>

285
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:56.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

286
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 2>a different form of vitamin K that's recently been discovered.</v>

287
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 2>And it's really important for cardiovascular and bone health.</v>

288
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 2>It basically puts,</v>

289
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 2>make sure that calcium gets in our bones and our teeth and our heart tissues</v>

290
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 2>where it belongs and keeps it out of the soft tissues like our arteries where</v>

291
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 2>calcium would make our arteries hard and increased the risk of a heart attack.</v>

292
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

293
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

294
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
<v Speaker 2>k two is only really in animal foods with the exception of some fermented foods</v>

295
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 2>like Natto,</v>

296
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:29.090
<v Speaker 2>which is a Japanese fermented soybean product that most people cannot stand.</v>

297
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

298
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.310
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

299
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a strong taste.</v>

300
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Not very many people are eating it here.</v>

301
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

302
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Kufier and,</v>

303
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.040
<v Speaker 2>and Sauerkraut and Kimchi have,</v>

304
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.880
<v Speaker 2>have k,</v>

305
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.713
<v Speaker 2>k two in it.</v>

306
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Kaffir I've been saying Kiefer my whole life,</v>

307
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.080
<v Speaker 2>that's how I've never heard it.</v>

308
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:44.430
<v Speaker 2>So that's how they say it,</v>

309
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 2>where [inaudible] is from.</v>

310
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Every other person I've ever met says Kiefer,</v>

311
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.831
<v Speaker 2>so don't worry about it.</v>

312
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

313
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And could fear from Nolan fear you'll be in the select few,</v>

314
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.281
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

315
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.980
<v Speaker 2>honestly I feel good about it already.</v>

316
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

317
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 2>you can feel superior.</v>

318
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

319
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.590
<v Speaker 2>can I stop you real quick just because we're going to,</v>

320
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I want to get a little bit,</v>

321
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

322
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

323
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.020
<v Speaker 2>onto this track of what you were describing.</v>

324
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Boats,</v>

325
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 2>fish oil and conversion and the difference between flax seed oil.</v>

326
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:15.550
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

327
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 2>what can vegans take in order to sort of recommend that vegans take micro algae</v>

328
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 2>because it has preformed Dha in it.</v>

329
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.520
<v Speaker 2>So you bypass that whole conversion issue and if they do take micro algae,</v>

330
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 2>is that sufficient or how much different is that than eating fish?</v>

331
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

332
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 2>it's quite different because fish have a lot of other nutrients aside from EPA</v>

333
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 2>and Dha.</v>

334
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.130
<v Speaker 2>They routine,</v>

335
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.310
<v Speaker 2>they have selenium,</v>

336
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of other bioavailable nutrients.</v>

337
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:44.220
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

338
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

339
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.660
<v Speaker 2>and the other disadvantage is you have to take a boat load of,</v>

340
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.760
<v Speaker 2>of LG boatload.</v>

341
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.603
<v Speaker 2>Give me a,</v>

342
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

343
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.883
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

344
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 2>There are different products have different amounts,</v>

345
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:57.350
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

346
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

347
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:02.611
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd have to take six to nine cups a capsules a day of the average</v>

348
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 2>algae supplement in order to meet your Dha.</v>

349
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.060
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

350
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>

351
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 2>It could,</v>

352
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely possible,</v>

353
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 2>but that would be a good way to be healthy with the Vegan Diet.</v>

354
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:19.111
<v Speaker 2>That would be one way to address the shortcoming of know of lack of Dha on the</v>

355
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Vegan Diet.</v>

356
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 2>There are other shortcomings,</v>

357
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:26.551
<v Speaker 2>other nutrients like B 12 which that's a big issue and vegans need to be</v>

358
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 2>supplementing with that.</v>

359
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 2>There's a myth out there that there are some plant sources of B 12 like seaweed</v>

360
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 2>and in spirit like spirulina and nutritional yeast,</v>

361
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 2>but those actually contain,</v>

362
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

363
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.700
<v Speaker 2>kind of phony forms of B 12 that that can block the absorption of true 12,</v>

364
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 2>which is only found in animal products or supplements.</v>

365
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 2>So a B 12 supplement would be really important.</v>

366
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's the source of a B 12 supplement.</v>

367
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.103
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

368
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.063
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

369
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.203
<v Speaker 2>it's synthetic,</v>

370
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 2>it's synthetic I think,</v>

371
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:00.850
<v Speaker 2>but they just,</v>

372
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 2>there's three forms.</v>

373
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 2>It'd be 12.</v>

374
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.500
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

375
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.300
<v Speaker 2>there's hydroxy Kabbalah,</v>

376
00:13:05.301 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 2>man and Methylcobalamin or f or four forms that you can supplement with</v>

377
00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:14.281
<v Speaker 2>Cyanocobalamin and Adenosylcobalamin and Cyanocobalamin is the synthetic form.</v>

378
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 2>And then the other ones are natural forms of B 12 that you would encounter in</v>

379
00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:18.784
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

380
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So people can supplement with any of those.</v>

381
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:21.880
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

382
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.860
<v Speaker 2>the natural forms are better to supplement with cause they're more bioavailable.</v>

383
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 2>But definitely if a Vegan,</v>

384
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend supplementing with B 12 because there aren't any sources of it</v>

385
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.211
<v Speaker 2>in the Diet.</v>

386
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:39.211
<v Speaker 2>And studies have shown that 68% of vegetarians are deficient in B 1280 3% of</v>

387
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 2>vegans are versus just 5% of omnivores.</v>

388
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

389
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's a big difference.</v>

390
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 2>We're not,</v>

391
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's a factor in,</v>

393
00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 2>in many different issues,</v>

394
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:48.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

395
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a factor in the production of muscle.</v>

396
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

397
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.000
<v Speaker 2>all production of all red blood cells depends on B12 and full eight and so on.</v>

398
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's pretty fundamental,</v>

399
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:58.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

400
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And then the Myelin Sheath requires be 12 and this is why B 12 deficiency can</v>

401
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:04.340
<v Speaker 2>mimic the,</v>

402
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.380
<v Speaker 2>the signs of Parkinson's or Alzheimer's to these and people who are aging.</v>

403
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 2>B 12 deficiency happens in elderly people,</v>

404
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:15.430
<v Speaker 2>not because they're on a vegan diet because they have low stomach acid and they</v>

405
00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 2>don't absorb the B 12 as well as we do when we're younger.</v>

406
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.870
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of people who are elderly who have no symptoms of Parkinson's or</v>

407
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:23.704
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's,</v>

408
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 2>they can sometimes be misdiagnosed with these conditions when they're actually</v>

409
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 2>just be 12 deficient.</v>

410
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:29.763
<v Speaker 2>So it's a series.</v>

411
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:30.521
<v Speaker 2>It's a real,</v>

412
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 2>really important nutrient.</v>

413
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:37.030
<v Speaker 2>How can vegans be assured that the B12 that they're buying does not have a</v>

414
00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 2>animal products?</v>

415
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

416
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.361
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>

417
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:45.361
<v Speaker 2>Do they have B12 when you bind a supplement that typically it's usually a,</v>

418
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the best person to ask about that because I'm,</v>

419
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a Vegan myself.</v>

420
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I was a macrobiotic at one point.</v>

421
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

422
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.331
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

423
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:54.164
<v Speaker 2>That's deep,</v>

424
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.273
<v Speaker 2>deep</v>

425
00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.890
<v Speaker 2>macrame macrobiotics is that is a whole nother system of way of looking at</v>

426
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 2>foods,</v>

427
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Speaker 2>a job and you know,</v>

428
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:03.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

429
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Japanese,</v>

430
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

431
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 2>approach and um,</v>

432
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

433
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.700
<v Speaker 2>the whole reason I came to do what I'm doing now.</v>

434
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 2>So I got really,</v>

435
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:17.801
<v Speaker 2>really sick and my twenties I almost died and I spent about 10 years just trying</v>

436
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:18.890
<v Speaker 2>to get back to health.</v>

437
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.120
<v Speaker 2>What did you pick from?</v>

438
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I was in Indonesia.</v>

439
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.631
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned earlier,</v>

440
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd traveled around the world and I was surfing and I got the classic tropical</v>

441
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:28.361
<v Speaker 2>illness.</v>

442
00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like immediate dysentery,</v>

443
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Giardia and blastocystis hominis so to parasites and an Amoeba and was just,</v>

444
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

445
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Speaker 2>coming out of both ends,</v>

446
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:38.931
<v Speaker 2>delirious,</v>

447
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 2>didn't remember really anything for three days.</v>

448
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

449
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.380
<v Speaker 2>luckily there was one other Australian guy in the village that I was in who had</v>

450
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 2>some antibiotics in his medical kit that kind of brought me back from the brink,</v>

451
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.230
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

452
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

453
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.210
<v Speaker 2>between the parasites and then the multiple rounds of antibiotics I had to take</v>

454
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 2>to get rid of the parasites after that,</v>

455
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.970
<v Speaker 2>it just wreaked havoc on my gut and it took me basically 10 years to recover my</v>

456
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Ho yeah,</v>

457
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 2>10 years.</v>

458
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:10.810
<v Speaker 2>It was like the last decade when I was at 10 years because you approached it in</v>

459
00:16:11.081 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 2>correctly and you could do it better now or was it just such a devastating round</v>

460
00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 2>of disease that I think a little of both.</v>

461
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

462
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:18.801
<v Speaker 2>so I was,</v>

463
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:23.801
<v Speaker 2>I'm 42 now and I was 25 when this first happened and we didn't know anything</v>

464
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.590
<v Speaker 2>about the gut and the microbiome compared to what we know now.</v>

465
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.000
<v Speaker 2>There was very little awareness on this topic,</v>

466
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.981
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

467
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:31.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

468
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Just in 15 years,</v>

469
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:32.721
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

470
00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:33.441
<v Speaker 2>or 20 years.</v>

471
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:33.670
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

472
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

473
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

474
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

475
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:41.291
<v Speaker 2>I took way more antibiotics than I would have done in retrospect because that's</v>

476
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 2>what the doctors were prescribing and saying,</v>

477
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:44.031
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

478
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:45.010
<v Speaker 2>you've got these parasites,</v>

479
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.040
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get rid of them.</v>

480
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 2>This is how you do it.</v>

481
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:48.140
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

482
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 2>and I think the antibiotics,</v>

483
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 2>if it could have been like the treatment was probably worse than the disease for</v>

484
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:54.550
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

485
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

486
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 2>after the number of courses of antibiotics that I took.</v>

487
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

488
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:03.250
<v Speaker 2>So along that path I tried to out every special diet you can possibly imagine</v>

489
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 2>including becoming a vegetarian and a Vegan and then a macrobiotic,</v>

490
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Vegan and raw food vegan.</v>

491
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.701
<v Speaker 2>I've been there,</v>

492
00:17:10.701 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>done that.</v>

493
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.470
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

494
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 2>so I'm completely sympathetic like to all,</v>

495
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.830
<v Speaker 2>and I'm also a longtime meditater and Buddhist.</v>

496
00:17:18.831 --> 00:17:21.500
<v Speaker 2>So I understand the ethical argument very well.</v>

497
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Many of my friends don't eat meat.</v>

498
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic and I care about the environment.</v>

499
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic to that argument.</v>

500
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not,</v>

501
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

502
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming to this from a place of I think a pretty balanced viewpoint.</v>

503
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.133
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

504
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.480
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

505
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.493
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

506
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>the issues for me,</v>

507
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.930
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I eventually brought animal products back into my diet with the</v>

508
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Aye,</v>

509
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>

510
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>It became clear that I needed to do that for my own health and I was able to</v>

511
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:54.030
<v Speaker 2>reach a level of</v>

512
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 2>understanding and,</v>

513
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

514
00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 2>about the moral,</v>

515
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 2>ethical and environmental choices that I was making.</v>

516
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

517
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

518
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 2>that I felt good about.</v>

519
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back to something you were saying about the,</v>

520
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:06.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

521
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 2>vegans and vegetarians and how to kind of optimize if you're doing that diet.</v>

522
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

523
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

524
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.540
<v Speaker 2>two things that wanted to address.</v>

525
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 2>One was you asked about mollusks.</v>

526
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I've actually argued that a vegetarian diet with shellfish and organ meats would</v>

527
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 2>be better than a Paleo Diet with no shellfish and organ meats.</v>

528
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.073
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

529
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's because of what we talked about earlier.</v>

530
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Muscle meats,</v>

531
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.860
<v Speaker 2>organ meats and shellfish are the two most nutrient dance classes of foods.</v>

532
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

533
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I've just been finishing the curriculum from my clinician training program where</v>

534
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

535
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.823
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

536
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 2>going through systematically every nutrient and I'm looking at,</v>

538
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

539
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.610
<v Speaker 2>in nutrition data what the most,</v>

540
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 2>the highest food sources of those nutrients are.</v>

541
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:53.784
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

542
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had the thing to just lay it out and show you.</v>

543
00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:57.324
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

544
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:02.070
<v Speaker 2>in almost every case it's an organ meat or a shellfish that's the highest source</v>

545
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:02.371
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

546
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:07.371
<v Speaker 2>whether you're talking about be 12 or iron or copper or zinc or full eight.</v>

547
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 2>It's always beef,</v>

548
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:09.241
<v Speaker 2>liver,</v>

549
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:09.631
<v Speaker 2>chicken,</v>

550
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:10.111
<v Speaker 2>liver,</v>

551
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 2>clams,</v>

552
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.641
<v Speaker 2>oysters,</v>

553
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:12.474
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

554
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And so if someone was a veggie vegetarian who's willing to fudge a little bit</v>

555
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:20.550
<v Speaker 2>and eat just organ meats and shellfish,</v>

556
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

557
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be a healthier approach than someone who's just eating lean</v>

558
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.613
<v Speaker 2>muscle meat.</v>

559
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

560
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.740
<v Speaker 1>organs get tossed out a lot.</v>

561
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

562
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.053
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

563
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem in the hunting world where,</v>

564
00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:32.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

565
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.520
<v Speaker 1>when people got an animal,</v>

566
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.050
<v Speaker 1>they leave the gut pile.</v>

567
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.410
<v Speaker 1>And there's even a gutless method that a lot of people use when the,</v>

568
00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:39.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

569
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.960
<v Speaker 1>they take on a big game animal,</v>

570
00:19:41.961 --> 00:19:43.190
<v Speaker 1>like an elk or something like that.</v>

571
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.000
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

572
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.020
<v Speaker 1>they leave it behind.</v>

573
00:19:45.021 --> 00:19:45.740
<v Speaker 1>They leave the heart,</v>

574
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.573
<v Speaker 1>they leave the liver.</v>

575
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.960
<v Speaker 1>But I saw this documentary on wolves and was really fascinating was one of the</v>

576
00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>ways that they distinguish who the alpha is.</v>

577
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:56.360
<v Speaker 1>And then wolf pack is the Alpha Wolf is the one who eats the liver,</v>

578
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.820
<v Speaker 1>the liver and the fascinating.</v>

579
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.270
<v Speaker 1>There are other animals that that's true.</v>

580
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was true in a hunter gather societies as well.</v>

581
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.310
<v Speaker 1>And someone was trying to say to me,</v>

582
00:20:04.311 --> 00:20:04.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

583
00:20:04.701 --> 00:20:06.290
<v Speaker 1>we'll livers process toxins.</v>

584
00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think they'd be filled with toxins?</v>

585
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:08.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a common</v>

586
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.470
<v Speaker 2>misconception.</v>

587
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.670
<v Speaker 2>The liver processes then,</v>

588
00:20:10.671 --> 00:20:11.150
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

589
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.380
<v Speaker 2>the fat stores them.</v>

590
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.160
<v Speaker 2>So if you're concerned about toxins in food,</v>

591
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.840
<v Speaker 2>you should make sure that you're eating pasture raised organic fats like butter</v>

592
00:20:20.841 --> 00:20:21.770
<v Speaker 2>and cream and things.</v>

593
00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>If you eat dairy products,</v>

594
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.013
<v Speaker 1>animal fats,</v>

595
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:24.860
<v Speaker 1>grass fed,</v>

596
00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:26.120
<v Speaker 1>grass fed butter,</v>

597
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

598
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.720
<v Speaker 1>if you eat lard or tallow or anything like that,</v>

599
00:20:29.721 --> 00:20:33.230
<v Speaker 1>it should come from pasture raised animals because the fat is where toxins are</v>

600
00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:33.710
<v Speaker 1>stored,</v>

601
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.470
<v Speaker 1>the liver processes then um,</v>

602
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.100
<v Speaker 1>so when you're,</v>

603
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to interrupt you boat.</v>

604
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So when you're eating anything that comes from an animal that's been fed grain,</v>

605
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with an animal that has the same sort of inflammation issues a</v>

606
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 1>person has</v>

607
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 2>from processing things that it's not naturally supposed to process like pat</v>

608
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.420
<v Speaker 2>processed wheat and the bleached flour and things besides antibiotic residue.</v>

609
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

610
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

611
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 2>So when you're taking in those animal products that we traditionally do,</v>

612
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 2>whether it's butter or milk or dairy or cheese or things along those lines,</v>

613
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 2>when you're taking those from an animal that's eating grain,</v>

614
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.270
<v Speaker 2>you are actually getting the fats.</v>

615
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.021
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>

616
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

617
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 2>it's less healthy than actually eating the liver of that animal.</v>

618
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

619
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.080
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

620
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.913
<v Speaker 2>it may be.</v>

621
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean the liver is more nutrient dense anyways,</v>

622
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

623
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.830
<v Speaker 2>pasture is animal fats,</v>

624
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

625
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 2>have a lot more nutrients than conventionally raised fats because the animals</v>

626
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 2>are eating grass and grasses way more nutrient dense than the grains that you</v>

627
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:35.620
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

628
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.960
<v Speaker 2>conventional animals are fed.</v>

629
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Also the Omega threes and sixes are different.</v>

630
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.590
<v Speaker 2>The ratio,</v>

631
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 2>the May mega six is the same but Omega three is three or four times higher in</v>

632
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:47.920
<v Speaker 2>pasture raised animals.</v>

633
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Why does that make it six to sign?</v>

634
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

635
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 2>It used to be,</v>

636
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:52.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:52.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

638
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

639
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.960
<v Speaker 2>the kind of a consensus was that Omega sixes would be higher in Omega threes it</v>

640
00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:58.601
<v Speaker 2>would be lower,</v>

641
00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 2>but actually it looks like and make a six is constant and Omega three is higher.</v>

642
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.330
<v Speaker 2>The Omega three is higher because of the grass probably has more alpha linolenic</v>

643
00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:07.721
<v Speaker 2>acid,</v>

644
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 2>which is the plant based form that day.</v>

645
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Then animal does a conversion.</v>

646
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the thing that's really interesting to consider here too is humans</v>

647
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:20.200
<v Speaker 2>are really inefficient and making these conversions of these less active</v>

648
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 2>nutrients to the more active ones.</v>

649
00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 2>We started talking about it with EPA and Dha,</v>

650
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.120
<v Speaker 2>k k vitamin K one is what's converted into k.</v>

651
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Two cows are experts at doing that.</v>

652
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.840
<v Speaker 2>They're really good at it.</v>

653
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Humans not so much.</v>

654
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.910
<v Speaker 2>So when we eat the animal and the animal is basically done the work for us and</v>

655
00:22:36.911 --> 00:22:41.830
<v Speaker 2>we get the preformed final nutrient that we need rather than having to do those</v>

656
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:43.120
<v Speaker 2>steps ourselves.</v>

657
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 2>And this is starting to rub,</v>

658
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.190
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

659
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 2>it's just a function of the adaptation of people developing while eating these</v>

660
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:48.941
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

661
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

662
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

663
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Beta carotenes and other example that's a precursor to active vitamin A or</v>

664
00:22:54.761 --> 00:22:58.480
<v Speaker 2>retinol and Beta carotenes have some benefits in our bodies,</v>

665
00:22:58.481 --> 00:23:00.370
<v Speaker 2>but retinols is the real thing.</v>

666
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

667
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.990
<v Speaker 2>We need more than anything.</v>

668
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.050
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

669
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.210
<v Speaker 2>that conversion is as low as three to 5% and some people,</v>

670
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.490
<v Speaker 2>and in fact there,</v>

671
00:23:07.491 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 2>there are some who don't make the conversion at all.</v>

672
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 2>And those are the people who turn orange after a carrot juice fast.</v>

673
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Ever seen anyone with like the orange palms?</v>

674
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.373
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>

675
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.370
<v Speaker 2>My friend Andy used to drink so much carrot juice that the inside of his hands</v>

676
00:23:21.371 --> 00:23:22.700
<v Speaker 2>and his skin would turn orange.</v>

677
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

678
00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 2>So he probably wasn't good at converting Beta carotene into retinol because we</v>

679
00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 2>should be able to do that,</v>

680
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:29.260
<v Speaker 2>but some people can't.</v>

681
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.050
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't just the mass quantity.</v>

682
00:23:31.051 --> 00:23:32.020
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

683
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean it could be that too.</v>

684
00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:34.310
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

685
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

686
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:40.030
<v Speaker 2>the retinol is only really present in organ meats and pasture raised fats.</v>

687
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:45.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not even really in muscle meats like lean ground beef or chicken breast,</v>

688
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 2>boneless chicken breasts or,</v>

689
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

690
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.210
<v Speaker 2>so in order to get retina,</v>

691
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.390
<v Speaker 2>we need to consume these pasture raise fats or we need to consume Oregon means.</v>

692
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 2>And as you pointed out,</v>

693
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 2>the organ meats have really fallen out of favor in the US.</v>

694
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And this is only recent,</v>

695
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:03.881
<v Speaker 2>like I bet you our grandparents ate a lot more organ meats then we eat still in</v>

696
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:04.450
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

697
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:04.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

698
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 2>many parts of the world.</v>

699
00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:06.800
<v Speaker 2>They still eat organ meats.</v>

700
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:07.530
<v Speaker 2>More try.</v>

701
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:07.990
<v Speaker 2>We do.</v>

702
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

703
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Liver and onions is a very famous dish.</v>

704
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

705
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

706
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Beef heart.</v>

707
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.470
<v Speaker 2>And so you'll see within the Paleo primal kind of world that organ meats are</v>

708
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 2>making a comeback because we understand now what the nutrient density of these</v>

709
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 2>foods is and there's less now,</v>

710
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 2>even in the mainstream world,</v>

711
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 2>there's less of a solid argument that can be made about these having cholesterol</v>

712
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

713
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.840
<v Speaker 2>high levels of saturated fat.</v>

714
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 2>They would prevent us from meeting them.</v>

715
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.611
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

716
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 2>what would be the difference in terms of the nutritional density of molluscs</v>

717
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 2>versus Oregon meat?</v>

718
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:41.660
<v Speaker 2>So like if you were trying to,</v>

719
00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:45.440
<v Speaker 2>if you had a vegetarian or a Vegan is on the fence and you know,</v>

720
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you made these arguments that are very rational and logical and he said,</v>

721
00:24:48.681 --> 00:24:49.170
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

722
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.380
<v Speaker 2>mollusks are essentially a very,</v>

723
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.590
<v Speaker 2>very primitive form of life that doesn't feel pain.</v>

724
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Speaker 2>And you could argue that there's more evidence that some plants feel pain and</v>

725
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 2>plants also have some very intense level of communication.</v>

726
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Where there,</v>

727
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

728
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 2>there's a really interesting,</v>

729
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:05.983
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

730
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:06.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

731
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 2>addition of radio lab recently where they went into this,</v>

732
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.980
<v Speaker 2>where they sort of are trying to understand the difference between,</v>

733
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

734
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.713
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

735
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.870
<v Speaker 2>not the difference rather,</v>

736
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.521
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

737
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

738
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.880
<v Speaker 2>the complicated relationship between these different plants and the mycelium and</v>

739
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 2>the soil and all of the different fungus in the soil that also acts as sort of a</v>

740
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:31.130
<v Speaker 2>transportation method for various nutrients and minerals.</v>

741
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.860
<v Speaker 2>And they're actually pulling these minerals out of the rock and they're getting</v>

742
00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:36.710
<v Speaker 2>sugars from the plants and they're exchanging them for minerals.</v>

743
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And that there's this really complex interaction that we have sort of just</v>

744
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:42.980
<v Speaker 2>looked at and said,</v>

745
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.101
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

746
00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:44.270
<v Speaker 2>there's dirt and there's plants.</v>

747
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.530
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot going on between these various life forms and one of them</v>

748
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.000
<v Speaker 2>being fungus,</v>

749
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.120
<v Speaker 2>which again is closer to an animal that it is still plant but is imperative for</v>

750
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:56.480
<v Speaker 2>the life of these plants.</v>

751
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 2>And then somehow or another,</v>

752
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 2>there were actually even sharing resources where if they find,</v>

753
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Speaker 2>or they're allotting resources to certain plants that are more deficient or</v>

754
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:07.280
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to channel resources to them.</v>

755
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.410
<v Speaker 2>So there's some form of communication.</v>

756
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.700
<v Speaker 2>And exchange here.</v>

757
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

758
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:11.571
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

759
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:12.900
<v Speaker 2>that's intelligence right there.</v>

760
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

761
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Paul Stamets has done amazing work on,</v>

762
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

763
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.340
<v Speaker 2>my youngest,</v>

764
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.350
<v Speaker 2>youngest in general.</v>

765
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

766
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:19.461
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

767
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:21.380
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's a really good option.</v>

768
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

769
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:22.703
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

770
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 2>when you look at nutrients like specific nutrients that it goes back and forth</v>

771
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:27.950
<v Speaker 2>between liver and,</v>

772
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:28.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Oregon meats and shellfish and some,</v>

774
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 2>some nutrients,</v>

775
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

776
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 2>organ meats are higher,</v>

777
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:36.920
<v Speaker 2>like vitamin A or iron and other nutrients.</v>

778
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Shellfish are generally higher like with zinc or copper.</v>

779
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

780
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 2>but certainly even,</v>

781
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.260
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

782
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.093
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

783
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 2>shellfish are higher in almost all of the key nutrients that we need.</v>

784
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Then a lot of the plant based food alternatives that they would be choosing</v>

785
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:53.911
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

786
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And so if this a Vegan was willing to eat molluscs I would say that that would</v>

787
00:26:57.931 --> 00:26:58.681
<v Speaker 2>be a great idea.</v>

788
00:26:58.681 --> 00:26:58.881
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

789
00:26:58.881 --> 00:26:59.260
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

790
00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

791
00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 2>the benefit there is you don't need to eat a lot like three ounces a single</v>

792
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:04.674
<v Speaker 2>serving,</v>

793
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

794
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.250
<v Speaker 2>can meet your copper requirement for the entire week.</v>

795
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:08.941
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

796
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Just one time.</v>

797
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.943
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

798
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.233
<v Speaker 2>Oysters.</v>

799
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.920
<v Speaker 2>And same with iron.</v>

800
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 2>I think if I'm going off the top of my head,</v>

801
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll iron and zinc,</v>

802
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 2>it can nearly meet your entire weekly requirement.</v>

803
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you have to eat a ton of these things.</v>

804
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:22.421
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

805
00:27:22.421 --> 00:27:22.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:26.820
<v Speaker 2>you have a serving of clams once a week and you have a serving of oysters once a</v>

807
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:27.654
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

808
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:28.471
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

809
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:28.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:29.784
<v Speaker 2>on top of,</v>

811
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

812
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.880
<v Speaker 2>getting as much nutrient density as you can,</v>

813
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

814
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 2>that should do,</v>

815
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 2>that's be 12.</v>

816
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:36.271
<v Speaker 2>That's iron,</v>

817
00:27:36.271 --> 00:27:36.990
<v Speaker 2>that sink,</v>

818
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Speaker 2>that's copper,</v>

819
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Speaker 2>EPA and Dha.</v>

820
00:27:39.601 --> 00:27:41.820
<v Speaker 2>The launching and Omega three fats are in these,</v>

821
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

822
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 2>in these malls cause as well.</v>

823
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

824
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.690
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

825
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 2>they're typically low on the toxicity,</v>

826
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

827
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.861
<v Speaker 2>scale too.</v>

828
00:27:49.861 --> 00:27:50.530
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

829
00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.230
<v Speaker 2>they don't tend to have a lot of mercury.</v>

830
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:55.440
<v Speaker 2>They don't bio accumulate a lot of toxins compared to some other,</v>

831
00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

832
00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Predator species of fish that are higher in the food chain that accumulated a</v>

833
00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 2>lot of toxins.</v>

834
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Is there any benefit to eating them cooked versus raw one way or the other?</v>

835
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

836
00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:06.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

837
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:07.200
<v Speaker 2>there's all,</v>

838
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.970
<v Speaker 2>there is the chance of disease and you know,</v>

839
00:28:09.971 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 2>eating raw wasters.</v>

840
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.413
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

841
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty minimal compared to some other risks,</v>

842
00:28:15.391 --> 00:28:15.871
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

843
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:16.740
<v Speaker 2>it is there.</v>

844
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:17.663
<v Speaker 2>And cooking,</v>

845
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

846
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Mitigates that.</v>

847
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.191
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

848
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I think in general,</v>

849
00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:26.850
<v Speaker 2>cooking makes the nutrients in meat and animal products more bioavailable rather</v>

850
00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:27.684
<v Speaker 2>than last.</v>

851
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

852
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.750
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

853
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

854
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.910
<v Speaker 2>and vegetables,</v>

855
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

856
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:32.390
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the vegetable and the,</v>

857
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

858
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 2>and the method of cooking.</v>

859
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:34.770
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

860
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

861
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.390
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

862
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:35.911
<v Speaker 2>it's a mix.</v>

863
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:36.840
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a mixed bag,</v>

864
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 2>but with [inaudible] me to genuinely improve the bioavailability.</v>

865
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:45.770
<v Speaker 2>So it really is in a lot of ways an ideological issue where it's sort of framed</v>

866
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

867
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:48.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

868
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to contribute to suffering,</v>

869
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.610
<v Speaker 2>but these things really don't suffer there.</v>

870
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

871
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.811
<v Speaker 2>But even there,</v>

872
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:55.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

873
00:28:55.111 --> 00:28:56.130
<v Speaker 2>as we talked about,</v>

874
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.700
<v Speaker 2>you're going to contribute to contribute to suffering and potentially more if</v>

875
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:01.920
<v Speaker 2>you're looking on the scale of individual lives.</v>

876
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 2>And it might sound like this is nit picky,</v>

877
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:05.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

878
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.080
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about actual lives,</v>

879
00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:07.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

880
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:07.951
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

881
00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:10.350
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to start evaluating like,</v>

882
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>is a cow more ascension are worth,</v>

883
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

884
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:18.270
<v Speaker 2>the life of a cow worth more than the life of a rabbit or a vole or the kinds of</v>

885
00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:19.680
<v Speaker 2>animals that are being killed.</v>

886
00:29:19.681 --> 00:29:20.900
<v Speaker 2>And in the end,</v>

887
00:29:20.901 --> 00:29:21.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

888
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.220
<v Speaker 2>in the production of these plant foods is,</v>

889
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.620
<v Speaker 2>it's a real question.</v>
