<v Speaker 1>my already vague understanding of what a</v>

60
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:44.060
<v Speaker 1>policy wise because it's like I always </v>

61
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like a bag than a box.</v>

62
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not like youtube either,</v>

81
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:51.991
<v Speaker 3>the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they go into the pit where there's </v>

82
00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 3>all the pods and the thing pops out and </v>

<v Speaker 3>like when you open it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this kind of alien,</v>

00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 3>pungent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscular,</v>

87
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:05.971
<v Speaker 3>primordial smell.</v>

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:11.701
<v Speaker 3>like black and dark is black ooze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kind of drips out of it.</v>

89
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 3>and so I threw that one away.</v>

<v Speaker 4>seriously dissonant?</v>

92
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.170
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to disinfect that with so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many chemicals.</v>

93
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Have to worry about those chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually burning the skin off your </v>

94
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.720
<v Speaker 4>deck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Leprosy.</v>

97
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets born in the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the fleshlight from some sick fucks.</v>

98
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:37.940
<v Speaker 4>It never bothered to clean it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tried to fuck it twice.</v>

99
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

102
00:04:48.861 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 4>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've traced it back to a flashlight and</v>

103
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:56.851
<v Speaker 4>there's only a few people survived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only liked from one particular area of </v>

<v Speaker 4>What dead?</v>

105
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean a flashlight is truly a breeding </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground for bacteria if you consider it,</v>

106
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:09.330
<v Speaker 3>especially if you keep it in the balmy </v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere of your shower because you're</v>

107
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.340
<v Speaker 3>combining fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're combining so many bad elements </v>

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean when we know that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>interact with a woman and make eggs,</v>

119
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crack eggs and make babies that way.</v>

120
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.760
<v Speaker 4>But imagine if that wasn't the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine if every time you came it made </v>

121
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.840
<v Speaker 4>people measure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people came out of your Dick and there's</v>

122
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:53.841
<v Speaker 4>just people everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere getting stepped on that </v>

123
00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:53.841
<v Speaker 4>little ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never get to be adults.</v>

124
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.240
<v Speaker 4>We take it for granted that the process </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a and female</v>

125
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>and that that's the only way to create </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

126
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is crazy enough as it is to think </v>

127
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.711
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been in some bizarre Gonzo </v>

128
00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:12.581
<v Speaker 1>parallel universe that it's possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just create life with your Dick and </v>

129
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>every time you come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

130
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.950
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person can be a very overpopulated </v>

131
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.611
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine people screaming at you because </v>

132
00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:23.220
<v Speaker 1>you're beating off you fuckhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are y'all doing?</v>

133
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Piling on top of people everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you kept someone beating off.</v>

134
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Will you fucking stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just make it.</v>

135
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>People bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people would do.</v>

136
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't make so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that was the case,</v>

137
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>there'd be so many people that the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>would cave in.</v>

138
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 1>There would be no more written work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have.</v>

139
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>People would just eat the people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>

140
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>You run out of reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

141
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:46.961
<v Speaker 1>we'd be just eating each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting the people in front of him </v>

142
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:46.961
<v Speaker 1>jerking off and making more.</v>

143
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point can overpopulation exist?</v>

144
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's no structure,</v>

145
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you took all the people in New York </v>

146
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>City with no structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no buildings,</v>

147
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.930
<v Speaker 1>just piled them on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how many.</v>

148
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>How much room is there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much room is there?</v>

149
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>At what point in time could you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking imagine?</v>

150
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:09.701
<v Speaker 1>How many people would it take to cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet and just a complete map of </v>

151
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just every time someone came,</v>

152
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 1>a person was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long was it?</v>

153
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Just looked like an octopus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

154
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Warming freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one would stop.</v>

155
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would nonstop jerking off.</v>

156
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:30.701
<v Speaker 1>We would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have entire continents covered and </v>

157
00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you'd come up with a good reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're jerking off.</v>

158
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.670
<v Speaker 1>You'd rationalize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

159
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

160
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.510
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new.</v>

161
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 1>The government would get involved though</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make you so you can't come.</v>

162
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Like they would start neutering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be the government.</v>

163
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 1>They'd be swarms of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be unmanageable.</v>

164
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>There'd be no government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

165
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.270
<v Speaker 1>no buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blog,</v>

166
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>we would have never even built </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>

167
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 1>If it was possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have ever figured out anything.</v>

168
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>If that was how you could come and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a person.</v>

169
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like grass.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You don't want to just shove your Dick </v>
<v Speaker 5>Right into this new retro model.</v>

201
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.500

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 5>like I'm a fucking shell because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>agreeing to everything here,</v>

236
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:53.180
<v Speaker 5>but I've used these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These shroom tech.</v>

237
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I'm starting to get sick,</v>

238
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.590
<v Speaker 5>I eat it and I get better at this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Real.</v>

239
00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This stuff really works.</v>

240
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.070
<v Speaker 6>It sure is great for just to keep your </v>
<v Speaker 6>immune system strong.</v>

241
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.100
<v Speaker 6>Apparently the way it works is there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>something in it that makes your body </v>

242
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.940
<v Speaker 6>think that it's like a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

243
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.670
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

244
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.880
<v Speaker 6>If there's an intruder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so your immune system fires up for a </v>

245
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.441
<v Speaker 6>fight that never takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty fucking sporty thing if it </v>

246
00:11:17.441 --> 00:11:17.441
<v Speaker 6>works like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

247
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.760
<v Speaker 6>there's also an Alpha brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>excuse me,</v>

248
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.510
<v Speaker 6>shroom tech sport,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the quadriceps mushroom,</v>

249
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 6>a sports endurance supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this is only for people who are </v>

250
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.020
<v Speaker 6>really into working out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're not in Oregon out,</v>

251
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.930
<v Speaker 6>don't fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian doesn't.</v>

252
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.440
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't need it.</v>

253
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.540
<v Speaker 5>But if you're in Fitbit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my fitbit let's say,</v>

254
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.800
<v Speaker 5>is that like last three days?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is for people that don't know what </v>

255
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.401
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's his little thing you snap on you </v>

256
00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:45.401
<v Speaker 5>and it counts your steps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it also like,</v>

257
00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:49.331
<v Speaker 5>I like every time you do go up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>downstairs it measures out what that </v>

258
00:11:49.331 --> 00:11:52.511
<v Speaker 5>would be in distance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just pretty much tracks everything </v>

259
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 5>you do physically and then at night you </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it tells you how long you sleep,</v>

260
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:58.320
<v Speaker 5>how many times do you wake up in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of the night and in it.</v>

261
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Then it graphs it on this nice page on </v>
<v Speaker 5>their website and then you start having </v>

262
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 5>like a facebook page of what your fitbit</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

263
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 5>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

264
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.680
<v Speaker 5>it's like twitter weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we have these stats and then like,</v>

265
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 5>like right now my only friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bert Kreischer and,</v>

266
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:11.420
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look at his and he's like,</v>

267
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 5>like kicks ass.</v>

268
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 5>And then my shit's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

269
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.920
<v Speaker 5>barely registering on the graph and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>battery light's like seven times longer </v>

270
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 5>than birch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like a new way to stalk people.</v>

271
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could be their exercise buddy.</v>

272
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:26.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get a,</v>

273
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.220
<v Speaker 5>a constant readout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet the readouts.</v>

274
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 5>Being sensitive government also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be the thing,</v>

275
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:36.541
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to put your </v>

276
00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:37.501
<v Speaker 5>information out there so people know </v>
<v Speaker 5>where your heart rate is at every </v>

277
00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:38.940
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have this thing that tweets here.</v>

278
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.950
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a scale that tweets your way </v>

279
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 5>so that it's not supposed to keep you </v>
<v Speaker 5>motivated to lose weight.</v>

280
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.680
<v Speaker 5>Well eventually it's going to be more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than that.</v>

281
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:52.681
<v Speaker 5>If you have something on tweets it every</v>
<v Speaker 5>time you get on it so you can't even </v>

282
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 5>stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

283
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you get onto this really brutal on.</v>

284
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.640
<v Speaker 5>You're gaining weight and you start.</v>

285
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 5>It was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we are saying about the invention of</v>

286
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.000
<v Speaker 5>the flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you weren't real change to happen,</v>

287
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.150
<v Speaker 5>change comes from fucking suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Change comes from being in a place that </v>

288
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

289
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:14.551
<v Speaker 5>you could do it other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but generally it comes from getting </v>

290
00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:14.551
<v Speaker 5>backed into a corner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

291
00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 5>you gotta you gotta straighten up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get your shit together.</v>

292
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.560
<v Speaker 5>You got to fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why people get enthusiastic about</v>

293
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 5>things and start companies and get a big</v>
<v Speaker 5>burst of enthusiasm.</v>

294
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 5>I could never murder somebody while </v>
<v Speaker 5>wearing a fitbit.</v>

295
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 5>I just realized why because they will </v>
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

296
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.980
<v Speaker 5>They will be able to see graph because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it shows you when you're extremely </v>

297
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.030
<v Speaker 5>working out and it has like red grabs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stuffed up thinking about murdering </v>

298
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or I could put it on somebody that,</v>

299
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.560
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

300
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 5>isn't like sleeping like I could put on </v>
<v Speaker 5>my mom and then go out and in the middle</v>

301
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 5>of the night and murder people that come</v>
<v Speaker 5>back and take off.</v>

302
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.990
<v Speaker 5>My Mom's not going to accept your fit </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit and that they could use that as </v>

303
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 5>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine.</v>

304
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there could also use it as evidence that</v>

305
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 5>your resting heart rate went from 70 to </v>
<v Speaker 5>82 or whatever.</v>

306
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:02.581
<v Speaker 5>Open person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I did a review on [inaudible] dot TV </v>

307
00:14:02.581 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 5>fitbit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're really into it.</v>

308
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:04.460
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

309
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.500
<v Speaker 5>and it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can see what it's like when I started </v>

310
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:09.500
<v Speaker 5>using twitter for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something there.</v>

311
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 5>There's some kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the next step,</v>

312
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the next piece of connectivity.</v>

313
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 5>This is turning your body into an x box </v>
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to like fitness,</v>

314
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fit.</v>

315
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.170
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking bad ass man.</v>

316
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of interesting.</v>

317
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course you're going to be like </v>

318
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.150
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have the most friends of fitbit rural </v>

319
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.171
<v Speaker 5>because you're going to be working out </v>
<v Speaker 5>so extreme and everyone that would be </v>

320
00:14:34.171 --> 00:14:34.171
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

321
00:14:34.171 --> 00:14:36.910
<v Speaker 5>you're not like instead of Dane Cook </v>
<v Speaker 5>having 5 million friends on twitter that</v>

322
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 5>you would have the most extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have the most like red graph,</v>

323
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.530
<v Speaker 5>like you worked out the hardest or a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of dudes beating off to my account.</v>

324
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.550
<v Speaker 5>Could be that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the person that sleeps,</v>

325
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 5>that's the person that sleeps the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would it be like some kind of weird </v>

326
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 5>wizard of</v>

327
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.040
<v Speaker 6>Fitbit road?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We should have talked about this on the </v>

328
00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.220
<v Speaker 6>let's just get this commercial over with</v>
<v Speaker 6>on a day you just go to [inaudible] dot </v>

329
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 6>com.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm tired of talking about this stuff.</v>

330
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.290
<v Speaker 6>Here's how I feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's we can't make this any nicer.</v>

331
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:08.291
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we had to change a rule because some </v>

332
00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 6>people are cons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We used to say that if you buy something</v>

333
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:13.451
<v Speaker 6>and you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could send it back and you don't </v>

334
00:15:13.451 --> 00:15:16.511
<v Speaker 6>even have to send it back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll give you 100 percent money back </v>

335
00:15:16.511 --> 00:15:19.570
<v Speaker 6>guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But people were buying like 10 bottles </v>

336
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.230
<v Speaker 6>and then they would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would take like three of them will </v>

337
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.230
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

338
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.861
<v Speaker 6>I'm not really into this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so then they would sell the rest on </v>

339
00:15:26.861 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 6>Ebay so they would get their refund and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then they would sell on Ebay.</v>

340
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.800
<v Speaker 6>Unbelievable people such twats it will </v>
<v Speaker 6>find a hole that was a good idea,</v>

341
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't a good idea to take </v>
<v Speaker 6>advantage of our hospitality.</v>

342
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.690
<v Speaker 6>So now it's only the first 30 pills and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you should be able to figure out within </v>

343
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:40.690
<v Speaker 6>30 pills.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

344
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot of people say like,</v>

345
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 6>if you could you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can you really.</v>

346
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 6>How much can you tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 6>between when you're eating multivitamins</v>

347
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 6>and when you're not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any multivitamins?</v>

348
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.100
<v Speaker 6>I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can tell there's this subtle thing.</v>

349
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm really in tune with my shit.</v>

350
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 6>I eat healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I work out a lot.</v>

351
00:15:57.231 --> 00:16:02.231
<v Speaker 6>I take supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know like what gets me and what </v>

352
00:16:02.231 --> 00:16:02.231
<v Speaker 6>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's some people,</v>

353
00:16:02.231 --> 00:16:03.860
<v Speaker 6>man that don't know you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can give them things and they're not</v>

354
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:05.320
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is this my multivitamin?</v>

355
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.700
<v Speaker 6>Wharton was in watching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

356
00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:08.600
<v Speaker 6>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't feel they're,</v>

357
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 6>but they're not in tune with their body </v>
<v Speaker 6>so much.</v>

358
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I mean if you're not really </v>

359
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.100
<v Speaker 6>athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you don't push your body to extremes </v>

360
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:18.440
<v Speaker 6>and you don't eat healthy and clean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of people,</v>

361
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:23.441
<v Speaker 6>they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a missing amount of </v>

362
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.211
<v Speaker 6>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's not an in intimacy with your </v>

363
00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:25.211
<v Speaker 6>body.</v>

364
00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:25.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

365
00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:25.780
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're feeling bad,</v>

366
00:16:25.781 --> 00:16:28.660
<v Speaker 3>you kind of get good at numbing it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>or ignoring it.</v>

367
00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:29.940
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've kind of liked.</v>

368
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:35.070
<v Speaker 3>They've shut down their ability to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel if you really honestly appraise </v>

369
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.691
<v Speaker 3>their health because like if you're out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of shape and you're fucking smoking all </v>

370
00:16:39.691 --> 00:16:40.150
<v Speaker 3>the time and you're drinking all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

371
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I speak from experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get into like a Jag of living </v>

372
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:45.550
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a certain amount of time,</v>

373
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.510
<v Speaker 3>you just start tuning out the weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>pains in your body.</v>

374
00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:51.310
<v Speaker 3>You just started ignoring it because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to.</v>

375
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.670
<v Speaker 3>You don't because it's just the truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the truth is you can't constantly </v>

376
00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.211
<v Speaker 3>fucking eat like shit and smoke and </v>
<v Speaker 3>drink and that ended up with you at the </v>

377
00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:01.630
<v Speaker 3>other end of that feeling great.</v>

378
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:08.170
<v Speaker 6>So important to take a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 6>different things that are good for your </v>

379
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.440
<v Speaker 6>health.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In my opinion,</v>

380
00:17:09.441 --> 00:17:12.290
<v Speaker 6>you should really eat a lot of healthy </v>
<v Speaker 6>vegetables.</v>

381
00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:13.880
<v Speaker 6>That's like one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

382
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:19.210
<v Speaker 6>One of the strongest things I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>done is increase the amount of like </v>

383
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.750
<v Speaker 6>green leafy vegetables in my diet and </v>
<v Speaker 6>drink kale shakes and shit like that.</v>

384
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.880
<v Speaker 6>Take multivitamins please.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not hard.</v>

385
00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:29.030
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking easy and it'll make you </v>
<v Speaker 6>healthier.</v>

386
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.310
<v Speaker 6>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it will make you feel better.</v>

387
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 6>Eat good food,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

388
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 6>and and look into nootropics if you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not into any of the shit that we have at</v>

389
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.550
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's plenty of other people that have</v>

390
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:45.551
<v Speaker 6>cool shit available,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so we try to make it as easy and as </v>

391
00:17:45.551 --> 00:17:49.120

<v Speaker 6>I'm way more concerned than I say this </v>

392
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 6>every fucking time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's because it's true.</v>

393
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm way more concerned with not ripping </v>
<v Speaker 1>people off than I am with making money.</v>

394
00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.470
<v Speaker 1>So that's the end of that fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you smoke too much weed and you </v>

<v Speaker 1>start having a panic attack that started</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

406
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 1>It's almost there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost kind of his own.</v>

407
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Such a delay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I usually mix it up.</v>

412
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Does this make you feel better when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do these things?</v>

<v Speaker 4>At the same time.</v>

468
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:48.020
<v Speaker 4>We got to be prepared for civil unrest </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the government is okay.</v>

469
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.430
<v Speaker 4>So we've got to start thinking if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit went down,</v>

470
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.970
<v Speaker 4>we need a goddamn ranch somewhere.</v>

<v Speaker 4>farming ranch community until the dust </v>

474
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:02.880
<v Speaker 4>settles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

476
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.250
<v Speaker 7>It's good to have a place like that to </v>
<v Speaker 7>go to.</v>

477
00:22:07.251 --> 00:22:08.930
<v Speaker 7>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've got to a place like that to go to,</v>

478
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.430
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do.</v>

479
00:22:10.431 --> 00:22:12.980
<v Speaker 7>But I did it in North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's in Jacksonville,</v>

480
00:22:12.981 --> 00:22:14.060
<v Speaker 7>North Carolina.</v>

481
00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:17.720
<v Speaker 7>I will not reveal the precise location </v>
<v Speaker 7>near the Georgia guidestones.</v>

482
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.460
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wish it was.</v>

483
00:22:19.461 --> 00:22:21.470
<v Speaker 7>Now it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not near the Georgia guidestones.</v>

484
00:22:21.471 --> 00:22:23.910
<v Speaker 7>I don't know where those are actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm sure those are either.</v>

<v Speaker 7>it's good to know where to go if there's</v>

490
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.860
<v Speaker 7>going to be a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the same thing with civilization.</v>

<v Speaker 6>This is crucial information.</v>

509
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.680
<v Speaker 7>Somebody should have told them that </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's not a lot of people in southern </v>

<v Speaker 6>language.</v>

523
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.350

530
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.900
<v Speaker 6>resolving external disputes in a world </v>
<v Speaker 6>court.</v>

531
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.670
<v Speaker 6>I don't hear any new world order shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>yet.</v>

532
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Avoid petty laws and useless officials a</v>

533
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 6>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Subjective.</v>

534
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of this stuff is subject.</v>

535
00:24:40.831 --> 00:24:42.170

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

536
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Hey laws and useless officials saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resolve your problems in a world court.</v>

<v Speaker 6>The petty laws and useless officials.</v>

539
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.350

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>

555
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 6>stupid thing to say.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I guess if you're not going to use </v>

560
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.431
<v Speaker 6>contractions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe you think contractions with real </v>

561
00:25:42.431 --> 00:25:42.431
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

562
00:25:42.431 --> 00:25:45.290
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing that I think is really </v>

563
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.890
<v Speaker 3>funny about these stones and about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just watched cave of forgotten dreams,</v>

564
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.570
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

565
00:25:48.571 --> 00:25:50.250
<v Speaker 3>which is like they went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't get into it,</v>

566
00:25:50.251 --> 00:25:50.600
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

567
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 3>I shut it off halfway and I got bored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I got into it because I was </v>

568
00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:01.190
<v Speaker 3>just thinking about how crazy it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rhinos were in France at one point </v>

569
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.680
<v Speaker 3>and kind of like who the fuck are these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

570
00:26:01.681 --> 00:26:06.681
<v Speaker 3>It was a little dry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you carve something in stone and </v>

571
00:26:07.921 --> 00:26:10.980
<v Speaker 3>you put it deep enough in this stone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>are big enough stone,</v>

572
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 3>it's guaranteed that if people are still</v>
<v Speaker 3>around in like hundreds of thousands of </v>

573
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.001
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to think that that really </v>

574
00:26:20.001 --> 00:26:20.001
<v Speaker 3>meant something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

575
00:26:20.001 --> 00:26:23.811
<v Speaker 3>they're going to think it was very </v>
<v Speaker 3>important just because you carved it in </v>

576
00:26:23.811 --> 00:26:24.030
<v Speaker 3>stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it could be anything.</v>

577
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 3>You could put anything on a cave wall </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people will come in and look at and </v>

578
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

579
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:34.250
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're either they worshiped a penis </v>

580
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:38.300
<v Speaker 3>with a with a happy face on it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a guy like painted something on </v>

581
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Georgia guidestones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just some guy went and carved some </v>

582
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.310
<v Speaker 3>shit and stone makes</v>

583
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 6>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I just be not a cancer on</v>

584
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 4>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leave Room for nature.</v>

585
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:47.300
<v Speaker 4>Leave Room for nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means that is.</v>

586
00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're goofing on it,</v>

587
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 4>but that is like a good thought.</v>

588
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I think they're great for all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like.</v>

589
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

590
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that there's anything.</v>

591
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like twitter messages.</v>

592
00:26:56.831 --> 00:26:59.500
<v Speaker 4>You can't get too profound when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>carving in stone.</v>

593
00:26:59.501 --> 00:27:00.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're carving on a fucking,</v>

594
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.410
<v Speaker 4>a limited amount of space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

595
00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.320
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

596
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:08.410
<v Speaker 4>what would you tell people if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had Georgia guidestones of your </v>

597
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.611
<v Speaker 4>own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could leave behind some monument </v>

598
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:12.490
<v Speaker 4>to future monkey people that figure this</v>
<v Speaker 4>out again?</v>

599
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

600
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.370
<v Speaker 4>So many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many quoted.</v>

601
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.970
<v Speaker 4>It was a fascinating quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That civilization,</v>

602
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it as made by the </v>

603
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 4>brightest minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is disappointing.</v>

604
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 4>It's disappointing where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at it as something </v>

605
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.060
<v Speaker 4>that's been thrown together by monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

606
00:27:31.061 --> 00:27:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

607
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 3>We're doing so good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about how good we're doing,</v>

608
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 3>we're doing great,</v>

609
00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.240
<v Speaker 4>but isn't that an interesting thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

610
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:44.241
<v Speaker 4>that people know that human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 4>capable of so much better,</v>

611
00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 4>so much better behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much more of a,</v>

612
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:51.490
<v Speaker 4>of a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sane,</v>

613
00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.410
<v Speaker 4>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loving world.</v>

614
00:27:53.411 --> 00:27:55.840
<v Speaker 4>We're capable that we're all capable of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as an,</v>

615
00:27:55.841 --> 00:28:00.841
<v Speaker 4>as individuals will cave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all capable of being loving and </v>

616
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:02.740
<v Speaker 4>nice and friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if we're all capable of it.</v>

617
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:08.070
<v Speaker 4>Then in groups we spread out and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another it gets lost along </v>

618
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:12.001
<v Speaker 4>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So where does it get lost on the way </v>

619
00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:12.001
<v Speaker 4>when they're fighting over resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're fighting over,</v>

620
00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:12.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy ideas.</v>

621
00:28:12.921 --> 00:28:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

622
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 3>The ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly it's the problem is the ideas.</v>

623
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.860
<v Speaker 3>It's the resources thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have resources you can work out.</v>

624
00:28:20.861 --> 00:28:23.590
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have crazy ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>research resources,</v>

625
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.290
<v Speaker 3>you can work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the fucking crazy ideas.</v>

626
00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:28.240
<v Speaker 3>I just saw that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the physicist.</v>

627
00:28:28.241 --> 00:28:29.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can never pronounce his name.</v>

628
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.760
<v Speaker 3>Moceanu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>

629
00:28:30.761 --> 00:28:32.740
<v Speaker 3>He's a genius in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

630
00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.460
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

631
00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about the different types</v>
<v Speaker 3>of civilization type zero civilization </v>

632
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.390
<v Speaker 3>type one civilization type two </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

633
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.460
<v Speaker 3>I think someone just put it on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook wall,</v>

634
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 3>but basically the concept behind it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that right now we're moving from a type </v>

635
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.900
<v Speaker 3>zero civilization to a type one </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>

636
00:28:49.901 --> 00:28:54.040
<v Speaker 3>which is we're going into a place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to recognize that we're all,</v>

637
00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:54.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

638
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.500
<v Speaker 3>or planetary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

639
00:28:56.501 --> 00:29:01.501
<v Speaker 3>We're a planetary civilization instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of broken up and all these weird </v>

640
00:29:01.501 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 3>divergent pieces where they all speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>different languages and we have these </v>

641
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 3>different beliefs.</v>

642
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.510
<v Speaker 3>We're moving into something where we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>all connected via the internet,</v>

643
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:13.230
<v Speaker 3>but he said this is the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>time possible because we're moving from </v>

644
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.560
<v Speaker 3>type zero type one and the type zero </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

645
00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:22.650
<v Speaker 3>the ones with the crazy ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have nuclear weapons and so we're </v>

646
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.350
<v Speaker 3>in a place where if we don't work this </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit out there can be,</v>

647
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.730
<v Speaker 3>we can destroy ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we can get past these crazy ideas</v>

648
00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 3>that differentiate us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that split us up the shit where people </v>

649
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 3>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

650
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.570
<v Speaker 3>those marines just pissed on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

651
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Taliban that they shot.</v>

652
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.050
<v Speaker 3>And everybody got upset about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody got upset about.</v>

653
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 3>They got upset that they were pissing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

654
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 3>They didn't get upset that they killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

655
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 3>how could you urinate on bodies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

656
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 3>you just blew fucking holes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chest.</v>

657
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 3>These men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's horrifying.</v>

658
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:55.660
<v Speaker 3>That's awful.</v>

659
00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:00.900
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst still at a place right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now where it's worse to piss on a dead </v>

660
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:01.510
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then to make a dead body,</v>

661
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:06.660
<v Speaker 3>now when we get to a place where making </v>
<v Speaker 3>a dead body has the same cultural </v>

662
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.201
<v Speaker 3>resonance is pissing on one where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes national news because one person </v>

663
00:30:10.201 --> 00:30:14.460
<v Speaker 3>had the fucking insane idea of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting someone instead of working it </v>

664
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.211
<v Speaker 3>out through language or talking it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when we're going to be in or </v>

665
00:30:18.211 --> 00:30:19.450
<v Speaker 3>entering a new age and new if we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it there.</v>

666
00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:24.451
<v Speaker 3>A new evolutionary period where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize that a solution to a problem </v>

667
00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:27.400
<v Speaker 3>is never is never blasting people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>smithereens.</v>

668
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:32.580
<v Speaker 3>And if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking rare that like it's the </v>

669
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.760
<v Speaker 3>most rare thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only in the most rare situations,</v>

670
00:30:33.761 --> 00:30:38.761
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that I think we're on the </v>

671
00:30:38.761 --> 00:30:40.360
<v Speaker 3>verge of getting to this place and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think the Internet is helping.</v>

672
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I think every time you look at what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened with Sopa and Pipa and you see </v>

673
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.600
<v Speaker 3>the power of this organizing force and </v>
<v Speaker 3>logic seems to rule in the Internet.</v>

674
00:30:49.601 --> 00:30:54.601
<v Speaker 3>It's just logical people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The logical majority seems to be making </v>

675
00:30:54.601 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Speaker 3>things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that happened on a planetary scale</v>

676
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 3>where instead of these fucking insane </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys like the president of Syria,</v>

677
00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 3>good at freak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you seen that fucking guy,</v>

678
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:04.450
<v Speaker 3>he's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's insane.</v>

679
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:05.620
<v Speaker 3>He's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dictator,</v>

680
00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:10.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like these people that wasn't a </v>

681
00:31:10.621 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mubarak and what's his name in Egypt?</v>

682
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:12.720
<v Speaker 3>What was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mubarak was like,</v>

683
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's okay to be president for </v>

684
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 3>40 years straight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

685
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.891
<v Speaker 3>These fucking assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once we start getting them out of the </v>

686
00:31:22.891 --> 00:31:22.891
<v Speaker 3>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

687
00:31:22.891 --> 00:31:26.371
<v Speaker 3>and then move on to the fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clerics and the Prius two or like </v>

688
00:31:26.371 --> 00:31:29.130
<v Speaker 3>teaching people that are the only way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with the university.</v>

689
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.990
<v Speaker 3>Connect with God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once we get rid of those motherfuckers.</v>

690
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.750
<v Speaker 3>This is pretty awesome planet man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The resources thing.</v>

691
00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:37.000
<v Speaker 3>We can work it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can work out the resources.</v>

692
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I think we could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

693
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone</v>

694
00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.250
<v Speaker 4>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

695
00:31:41.251 --> 00:31:46.251
<v Speaker 4>Optimistic view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we could just all communicate in the </v>

696
00:31:46.251 --> 00:31:46.770
<v Speaker 4>same native language so we could tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other this.</v>

697
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part of the problem.</v>

698
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Be Part of the problem is if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there was some sort of a civil unrest</v>

699
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.290
<v Speaker 4>or some sort of a problem with another </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the country that was European,</v>

700
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.750
<v Speaker 4>we would get all the information back </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

701
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.550
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly what's going on.</v>

702
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.430
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine like the United States </v>
<v Speaker 4>was in Ireland for some reason.</v>

703
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

704
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.630
<v Speaker 4>It would be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

705
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.460
<v Speaker 3>and also this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this level,</v>

706
00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:09.750
<v Speaker 3>this language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new language that I,</v>

707
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.590
<v Speaker 3>that it wouldn't just be us talking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same language.</v>

708
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>

709
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a technological neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>interface that allows us to directly </v>

710
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.211
<v Speaker 3>communicate emotion to each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like imagine how many </v>

711
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:28.601
<v Speaker 3>stupid arguments you've gotten in like </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your girlfriend or with your </v>

712
00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:28.601
<v Speaker 3>friends that you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

713
00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:30.740
<v Speaker 3>it just is about language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're underneath it.</v>

714
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.900
<v Speaker 3>You're just feeling the exact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just like,</v>

715
00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I really want things to be okay and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

716
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:40.350
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you could just feel how that felt </v>

717
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.350
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I mean,</v>

718
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:44.861
<v Speaker 3>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're forced to articulate our universe </v>

719
00:32:44.861 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 3>through the same fucking Oregon that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>use to chew hamburgers.</v>

720
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 3>That's our way of describing the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the tip of our feeding tubes is how</v>

721
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 3>we're forced to describe the infinite.</v>

722
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.720
<v Speaker 3>We're fucking limited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like in my left foot when the guy </v>

723
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.061
<v Speaker 3>could only paint with his foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that we have infinity out here </v>

724
00:33:01.061 --> 00:33:05.800
<v Speaker 3>and all we have to access to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to describe this infinity and our </v>

725
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.551
<v Speaker 3>perception of it in the way it feels to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a part of it is a language that we </v>

726
00:33:09.551 --> 00:33:13.061
<v Speaker 3>didn't come up with ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The language has been passed down in </v>

727
00:33:13.061 --> 00:33:13.061
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

728
00:33:13.061 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a trade language.</v>

729
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:19.661
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of the words that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might not be words that exist </v>

730
00:33:19.661 --> 00:33:23.321
<v Speaker 3>right now to describe certain facets of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality and sometimes that'll make them </v>

731
00:33:23.321 --> 00:33:27.071
<v Speaker 3>invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you could undercut language and </v>

732
00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:29.561
<v Speaker 3>just have a emotional fucking connection</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you could feel another person's </v>

733
00:33:29.561 --> 00:33:30.110
<v Speaker 3>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

734
00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:33.260
<v Speaker 3>imagine being the president of Syria and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come in,</v>

735
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:36.320
<v Speaker 3>you the guide is like killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>protesters,</v>

736
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jailing people and torturing them.</v>

737
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.550
<v Speaker 3>You take that guy and just for one </v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

738
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:45.551
<v Speaker 3>he gets a feeling of what it's like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be out in the street or to be in a </v>

739
00:33:45.551 --> 00:33:48.521
<v Speaker 3>country where you've had a president </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and you're being completely </v>

740
00:33:48.521 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 3>repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he could feel that feeling,</v>

741
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be hard for him to continue on.</v>

742
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 3>It will be hard for them to live and </v>
<v Speaker 3>delusion and to think that,</v>

743
00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:54.880
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

744
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.450
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to be a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I deserve this,</v>

745
00:33:56.451 --> 00:34:01.451
<v Speaker 3>or these people are less than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slavery never would've been able to </v>

746
00:34:01.451 --> 00:34:04.721
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slavery was based on this ridiculous </v>

747
00:34:04.721 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 3>idea that somehow black people deserve </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be enslaved.</v>

748
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.130
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with eating meat.</v>

749
00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 3>We believe that in general people one </v>
<v Speaker 3>one way,</v>

750
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 3>not everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some mediators are like,</v>

751
00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:12.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

752
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat.</v>

753
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:19.150
<v Speaker 3>I eat meat and I know that these animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>have feelings and generally die of </v>

754
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.841
<v Speaker 3>brutal life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think I deserve to eat meat and I </v>

755
00:34:22.841 --> 00:34:22.841
<v Speaker 3>think that's natural.</v>

756
00:34:22.841 --> 00:34:23.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the best rationale for eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>

757
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.160
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You acknowledge the suffering and pain </v>

758
00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:29.330
<v Speaker 3>you're causing and you do it and you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because you think you deserve it,</v>

759
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.710
<v Speaker 3>but some people they think fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals are like clockwork things.</v>

760
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.980
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like little mechanistic,</v>

761
00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:39.830
<v Speaker 3>like a wristwatch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't feel the same things that</v>

762
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:44.831
<v Speaker 3>we feel and we'll never know that until </v>
<v Speaker 3>we create a neurological interface with </v>

763
00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:46.640
<v Speaker 3>animals in the moment you realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck man,</v>

764
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 3>these cows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel love.</v>

765
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:55.300
<v Speaker 3>They feel love for each other and fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they fucking more than their kids.</v>

766
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Then when you sit down and eat a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hamburger,</v>

767
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.290
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a much more intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

768
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.540
<v Speaker 3>It's maybe it'll make it taste better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

769
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:07.541
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be this cow new love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do A.</v>

770
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.660
<v Speaker 3>is that all true what you said about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

771
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

772
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we can know that,</v>

773
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:16.110
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there are like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

774
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:21.550
<v Speaker 3>like when I was in India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like the cows kind of wander the </v>

775
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.550
<v Speaker 3>streets and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like,</v>

776
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not abused in the same way that </v>

777
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:26.760
<v Speaker 3>they are here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are some,</v>

778
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.710
<v Speaker 3>but the ones they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like really sweet dogs.</v>

779
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:32.711
<v Speaker 3>They'll come up to you and rub their </v>
<v Speaker 3>muzzle against you and you can scratch </v>

780
00:35:32.711 --> 00:35:32.810
<v Speaker 3>behind their ears and they're just very </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet.</v>

781
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:38.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying cows are fucking dolphin </v>

782
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:38.050
<v Speaker 3>of cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually evolve it.</v>

783
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Just get</v>

784
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 4>a little bit smarter and learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>speak English and then like start coming</v>

785
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 4>into people's houses and see all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>leather shit.</v>

786
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.680
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you abandon you imagine?</v>

787
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:54.681
<v Speaker 4>I mean we just assumed the cows are </v>
<v Speaker 4>never going to evolve because of where </v>

788
00:35:54.681 --> 00:35:55.530
<v Speaker 4>they are right now is where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

789
00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 4>we assume they're just gonna fucking eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>the grass and just be all stupid and not</v>

790
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 4>get anything done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just run around and make milk.</v>

791
00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.370
<v Speaker 4>They started allowing them on buses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

792
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:05.760
<v Speaker 4>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if,</v>

793
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.310
<v Speaker 4>what if something happens would have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's radiation.</v>

794
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's like some fucking third world</v>
<v Speaker 4>country where we would make in Nike's </v>

795
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.730
<v Speaker 4>and they did something to the water </v>
<v Speaker 4>supply and it makes cow super smart.</v>

796
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.230
<v Speaker 4>Funny Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine that?</v>

797
00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:21.060
<v Speaker 4>The Lord Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have leather.</v>

798
00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:24.840
<v Speaker 4>Everything you fuckheads you think you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's cool to have leather?</v>

799
00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:29.841
<v Speaker 4>Everything we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the skin of a murdered animal is </v>

800
00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.750
<v Speaker 4>like standard on cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's our favorite shit.</v>

801
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:38.930
<v Speaker 4>We want to sit down and flesh peeled </v>
<v Speaker 4>flesh from an murdered animal is the </v>

802
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:41.930
<v Speaker 4>preferred seating choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

803
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.960
<v Speaker 4>That's how I like my seat covered.</v>

804
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.890
<v Speaker 4>murdered animal hide with minimal </v>
<v Speaker 4>padding.</v>

805
00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it odd though that like even if </v>

806
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:54.940
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

807
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.470
<v Speaker 3>for if I died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe I'm wrong about this,</v>

808
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.110
<v Speaker 3>but if I put my will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want my,</v>

809
00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:04.230
<v Speaker 3>I want my flesh cured and made into </v>
<v Speaker 3>wallets for my friends.</v>

810
00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I could legally do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can do that.</v>

811
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could do that either.</v>

812
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.580
<v Speaker 3>People that so superstitious and odd.</v>

813
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Well it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want to really open up </v>

814
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.651
<v Speaker 4>that market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to give any flashmarket </v>

815
00:37:21.651 --> 00:37:21.651
<v Speaker 4>wallet market,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

816
00:37:21.651 --> 00:37:23.100
<v Speaker 4>You don't even want to open that door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

817
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:28.310
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want have any of those out </v>

818
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.310
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

819
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Because there's some one dude and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

820
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.380
<v Speaker 4>he's going to get through this miserable</v>
<v Speaker 4>life in one piece,</v>

821
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:36.381
<v Speaker 4>one way or another until one day he's at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flea market and he finds a human </v>

822
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:39.000
<v Speaker 4>flesh wallet and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got to make human flesh everything.</v>

823
00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:44.001
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Murder spree making human flesh </v>

824
00:37:44.001 --> 00:37:44.001
<v Speaker 4>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

825
00:37:44.001 --> 00:37:44.550
<v Speaker 4>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

826
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.780
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to encourage that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

827
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:50.781
<v Speaker 4>You can't have that out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have human flesh wallets out </v>

828
00:37:50.781 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just to unpredictably fucked up.</v>

829
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 4>I won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will.</v>

830
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:57.081
<v Speaker 4>I'll cancel my kickstarter account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be a real problem and </v>

831
00:37:57.081 --> 00:38:00.341
<v Speaker 4>it's not just communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's figuring out how to develop people </v>

832
00:38:00.341 --> 00:38:01.980
<v Speaker 4>or redevelop them after they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up as children,</v>

833
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 4>that there's going to be something they </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured some sort of a reset.</v>

834
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

835
00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:12.060
<v Speaker 3>if you can get an emotional read on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person like how they're experiencing </v>

836
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.241
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can communicate with them much </v>

837
00:38:15.241 --> 00:38:15.241
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some,</v>

838
00:38:15.241 --> 00:38:15.241
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

839
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.540
<v Speaker 3>some people are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Communicate</v>

840
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:25.040
<v Speaker 4>smart as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the big things that we </v>

841
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.761
<v Speaker 4>would do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would set up places where people who </v>

842
00:38:28.761 --> 00:38:31.601
<v Speaker 4>had fucked her lives up can go and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>be a criminal and get some food and have</v>

843
00:38:33.961 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 4>so many help them figure things out </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

844
00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:41.491
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we know we can keep you from </v>

845
00:38:41.491 --> 00:38:41.740
<v Speaker 4>going to jail for the rest of your life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's let's work this out.</v>

846
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Let's fucking figure you out a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>career path here.</v>

847
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.960
<v Speaker 4>Help this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody helped.</v>

848
00:38:46.961 --> 00:38:51.961
<v Speaker 4>These people are obviously everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling yourself up by your own </v>

849
00:38:51.961 --> 00:38:54.190
<v Speaker 4>bootstraps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I believe in for for most things.</v>

850
00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 4>For most things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be the advice,</v>

851
00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.160
<v Speaker 4>but occasionally there's some people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are a part of society.</v>

852
00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:05.161
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're handed the shittiest fucking </v>

853
00:39:05.161 --> 00:39:07.831
<v Speaker 4>hand of cards ever in life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they find themselves in and out</v>

854
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:12.030
<v Speaker 4>of the judicial system as a young kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they find themselves in jail.</v>

855
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

856
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.420
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't think that that dude somehow </v>

857
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.741
<v Speaker 4>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she didn't get a fair shake ever in his </v>

858
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:20.741
<v Speaker 4>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

859
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:22.950
<v Speaker 4>and everybody just wants to just lock </v>
<v Speaker 4>them up and put them in.</v>

860
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.110
<v Speaker 4>That's not the solution either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The solution is how you fix them.</v>

861
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.370
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

862
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:32.371
<v Speaker 3>It's like the vagina is an elevator door</v>
<v Speaker 3>that opens up into this dimension.</v>

863
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:36.970
<v Speaker 3>And like sometimes that elevator puts </v>
<v Speaker 3>you out on a bad fucking place.</v>

864
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 8>That is one of the most brilliant things</v>
<v Speaker 8>you've ever said.</v>

865
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 8>That elevator smells.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You gotta.</v>

866
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.610
<v Speaker 8>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Somebody tweet that to doug.</v>

867
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 8>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a bit,</v>

868
00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:48.520
<v Speaker 8>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've been saying</v>

869
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 3>some version of that but I'm not like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

870
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:56.670
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is you get smashed out into </v>

871
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some of these people get fucked up.</v>

872
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 3>They get blasted out into a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment surrounded by crackheads.</v>

873
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.560
<v Speaker 3>Deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>

874
00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

875
00:40:03.341 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this fucking.</v>

876
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:07.900
<v Speaker 3>What does this lead to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This leads to what you're talking about.</v>

877
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.150
<v Speaker 3>These people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have,</v>

878
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine spending the first 12 years of </v>

879
00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.970
<v Speaker 3>your life before you went into a foster </v>
<v Speaker 3>home with the most neurons when you're,</v>

880
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:19.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're a baby,</v>

881
00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:22.970
<v Speaker 3>as more neurons in their brain than at </v>
<v Speaker 3>any other time in their life.</v>

882
00:40:22.971 --> 00:40:25.420
<v Speaker 3>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a wax seal,</v>

883
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:30.510
<v Speaker 3>a baby's brain is like a wax seal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking family is like the ring that</v>

884
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pushed into like,</v>

885
00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:37.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like in the fucking like medieval </v>

886
00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.151
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we get imprinted and we can't </v>

887
00:40:39.151 --> 00:40:41.680
<v Speaker 3>resist it by the vibrational frequencies</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were around when we're,</v>

888
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.060
<v Speaker 3>when we're blasted into this dimension </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

889
00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.170
<v Speaker 3>and you need help to get those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformed.</v>

890
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just do it on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The record's been pressed,</v>

891
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:55.531
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need help to fucking overcome the </v>

892
00:40:55.531 --> 00:40:58.711
<v Speaker 3>weird patterns that come from living </v>
<v Speaker 3>next to the lunatics that were your </v>

893
00:40:58.711 --> 00:40:58.960
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not everyone had crazy parents,</v>

894
00:40:58.961 --> 00:41:03.961
<v Speaker 3>but many people had fucked up parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were giving like think about how </v>

895
00:41:05.771 --> 00:41:06.850
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

896
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.630

<v Speaker 3>they had you think about that,</v>

897
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.790
<v Speaker 3>where they are in their twenties.</v>

913
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:59.741
<v Speaker 6>personality really is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The annoying aspects of it gets </v>

914
00:41:59.741 --> 00:41:59.741
<v Speaker 6>highlighted.</v>

915

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just get back in your face.</v>

917
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.170
<v Speaker 7>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've read this,</v>

918
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.370
<v Speaker 7>there's an interesting essay that this </v>
<v Speaker 7>guy got the weirdest name.</v>

919
00:42:09.371 --> 00:42:11.350
<v Speaker 7>His name's Suzanne and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

920
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:17.610
<v Speaker 7>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know the exact word for what he </v>

921
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.261
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's like an anarchist primitive as </v>

922
00:42:19.261 --> 00:42:21.131
<v Speaker 7>he thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything started going bad when we </v>

923
00:42:21.131 --> 00:42:24.880
<v Speaker 7>started using symbols to represent </v>
<v Speaker 7>reality instead of just being in reality</v>

924
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.330
<v Speaker 7>when the moment you start using symbols </v>
<v Speaker 7>to represent reality,</v>

925
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.680
<v Speaker 7>you're kind of boxing reality in and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're separating yourself.</v>

926
00:42:32.681 --> 00:42:34.870
<v Speaker 7>You're creating the separation from you </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the universe.</v>

927
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:39.820
<v Speaker 7>And so he was talking about the growing </v>
<v Speaker 7>use of the term,</v>

928
00:42:39.821 --> 00:42:43.510
<v Speaker 7>like how people use the word,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like instead of just saying what it is,</v>

929
00:42:43.511 --> 00:42:48.511
<v Speaker 7>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like you're walking outside and </v>

930
00:42:48.511 --> 00:42:48.511
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>come up to this thing and you're like.</v>

931
00:42:48.511 --> 00:42:51.570
<v Speaker 7>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what that is is this subconscious </v>

932
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.520
<v Speaker 7>problem where people are not directly </v>
<v Speaker 7>experiencing reality.</v>

933
00:42:54.521 --> 00:42:57.910
<v Speaker 7>So everything's like something else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Things aren't being,</v>

934
00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.120
<v Speaker 7>things are being like something else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very curious that it's pretty good </v>

935
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:03.340
<v Speaker 7>if you look up Suzanne,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

936
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.380
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a little fucking dense,</v>

937
00:43:05.381 --> 00:43:10.381
<v Speaker 7>but it's a pretty good essay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you ever hung out with guys a hate </v>

938
00:43:10.381 --> 00:43:13.210
<v Speaker 7>symbols that hate symbols and drums?</v>

939
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.170
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To either one of those instruments?</v>

940
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:18.700
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

941
00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:19.620
<v Speaker 6>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

942
00:43:19.621 --> 00:43:24.621
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that I always thought </v>

943
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:26.160
<v Speaker 6>it was fascinating about ancient </v>
<v Speaker 6>Egyptian hieroglyphs is that they,</v>

944
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.320
<v Speaker 6>they had a completely different way of </v>
<v Speaker 6>writing things.</v>

945
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:32.840
<v Speaker 6>So they must've had a completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>different way of talking dip,</v>

946
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.860
<v Speaker 6>completely different way of phrasing </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

947
00:43:38.081 --> 00:43:38.770
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you,</v>

948
00:43:38.771 --> 00:43:39.310
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

949
00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:43.030
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you look at like how you could be a</v>

950
00:43:43.031 --> 00:43:45.490
<v Speaker 6>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>obviously an intelligent human being,</v>

951
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 6>advanced sophisticated culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>capable of producing amazing works of </v>

952
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.571
<v Speaker 6>art,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that language is like totally alien </v>

953
00:43:54.571 --> 00:43:55.840
<v Speaker 6>to us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we look at it and like what is this</v>

954
00:43:55.841 --> 00:44:00.841
<v Speaker 6>crazy chicken scratch and pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 6>birds and shit and these fucking people,</v>

955
00:44:01.001 --> 00:44:03.190
<v Speaker 6>this is what they use to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

956
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.430
<v Speaker 6>But somehow or another to them it </v>
<v Speaker 6>worked.</v>

957
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:07.290
<v Speaker 6>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

958
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:12.510
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they thought of things like in a </v>

959
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.510
<v Speaker 6>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their,</v>

960
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:13.000
<v Speaker 6>their language,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their written language consisted of like</v>

961
00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:14.180
<v Speaker 6>symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

962
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:14.980
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>

963
00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:16.820
<v Speaker 6>not like ours but like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

964
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.960
<v Speaker 6>but like images,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really fascinating shit.</v>

965
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:20.950
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is.</v>

966
00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Speaker 7>Languages is one of the most fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 7>things to think about when you're </v>

967
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:30.991
<v Speaker 7>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it's fun to contemplate where each </v>

968
00:44:30.991 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 7>word is coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the transformation</v>

969
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 3>of the thought into the word and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneous that happened.</v>

970
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.180
<v Speaker 3>So when you start contemplating where at</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's this,</v>

971
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 3>where's this language coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think about this.</v>

972
00:44:41.641 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just happened.</v>

973
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.660
<v Speaker 6>And for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for the longest time,</v>

974
00:44:45.661 --> 00:44:49.110
<v Speaker 6>people have always been aware that one </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the big things that keeps people from</v>

975
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:52.260
<v Speaker 6>really directly communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody is the language barrier.</v>

976
00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:57.280
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's why the myth of the Tower </v>

977
00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:57.280
<v Speaker 6>of Babel existed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

978
00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.810
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was like a plan to give us all </v>

979
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:03.651
<v Speaker 6>different languages so we can never </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking figure out how to communicate </v>

980
00:45:03.651 --> 00:45:06.411
<v Speaker 6>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which is really fascinating because it </v>

981
00:45:06.411 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 6>really would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if someone had that kind of power,</v>

982
00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:14.811
<v Speaker 6>if we lose like a warlock who could just</v>
<v Speaker 6>go and we'll give everyone a different </v>

983
00:45:14.811 --> 00:45:15.570
<v Speaker 6>language.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

984
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.650
<v Speaker 6>that would be a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you really could do that.</v>

985
00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:22.410
<v Speaker 6>I mean if it was that easy to be the </v>
<v Speaker 6>architect of reality,</v>

986
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 6>that would be a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't want them to rally up.</v>

987
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 6>We'll have them all live in these little</v>
<v Speaker 6>spots and give him the fucking languages</v>

988
00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 6>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one understands what you're</v>

989
00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I went over to God's house,</v>

990
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:37.221
<v Speaker 3>like if there's a lot of God's living in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same neighborhood and they all have </v>

991
00:45:37.221 --> 00:45:37.221
<v Speaker 3>these little aquarium earth they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking with,</v>

992
00:45:37.221 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 3>none of them were shy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went over to a fucking.</v>

993
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:43.200
<v Speaker 3>Got The God's House that did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feel like you're a dick man.</v>

994
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Let them speak the same language and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have fun.</v>

995
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:50.781
<v Speaker 3>Why are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you consistently fuck with these </v>

996
00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:50.781
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to give them a break.</v>

997
00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:55.700
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I call animal control on </v>

998
00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:55.700
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like look at it.</v>

999
00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.661
<v Speaker 3>Look like if you believe the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 3>God and really think about like the </v>

1000
00:45:59.661 --> 00:46:01.710
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist Christian concept of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this,</v>

1001
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.560
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone was doing that to animals,</v>

1002
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:09.561
<v Speaker 3>what God is apparently doing to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to the fundamentalist </v>

1003
00:46:09.561 --> 00:46:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would go to jail for a long time.</v>

1004
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Anonymous would fucking attacking God's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sadist.</v>

<v Speaker 3>burning them in hell forever.</v>

1006
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.090
<v Speaker 3>He's like giving cancer to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they deserve it.</v>

1007
00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:24.750
<v Speaker 3>He makes people go blind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He turned a whole city in the Bible.</v>

1008
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:27.330
<v Speaker 3>That salt or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's a creep.</v>

1010
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.250
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way around it.</v>

1011
00:46:32.251 --> 00:46:33.900
<v Speaker 3>There's better ways to deal with it.</v>

1012
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:36.190
<v Speaker 6>People you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dunkin,</v>

1013
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:41.250

<v Speaker 6>you in your mind.</v>

1014
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:47.050
<v Speaker 6>You believe you have it all figured out </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you're smarter than the Lower </v>

1015
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:47.530
<v Speaker 6>Nicei.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not possible.</v>

1016
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.280
<v Speaker 3>You're a talker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a mocker.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You're thinking too much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get mad at you.</v>

1019
00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:56.310
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can I have questions?</v>

1020
00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 6>That's not what.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not what you shouldn't use your </v>

1021
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 6>mind for that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to let God be scripture sales,</v>

1022
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:06.170
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Scripture say he who walk with me walk </v>

1023
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.360
<v Speaker 6>with the Lord will say shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>

1024
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.240
<v Speaker 6>what does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck does that mean?</v>

1025
00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.350
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1026
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 6>what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That means that's the dude with the </v>

1027
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 6>mushrooms.</v>

1028
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1029
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1030
00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:20.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1031
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.140
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the sad thing is these,</v>

1032
00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 3>there's a great book called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's by Abraham maslow and it's called </v>

1033
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:32.821
<v Speaker 3>religious values and peak and it talks </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a theoretical,</v>

1034
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 3>the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the theory of how a religion happens and</v>

1035
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:42.721
<v Speaker 3>the progression of information as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes from being someone who's really </v>

1036
00:47:42.721 --> 00:47:45.610
<v Speaker 3>happy to it being a priest class that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling people.</v>

1037
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.820
<v Speaker 3>And so his idea is certain people </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout time have had peak </v>

1038
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.181
<v Speaker 3>experiences where they break through </v>
<v Speaker 3>that particular ego barrier created by </v>

1039
00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:59.551
<v Speaker 3>the Zeitgeists of their time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a direct communication with </v>

1040
00:47:59.551 --> 00:48:01.660
<v Speaker 3>some kind of like super ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>superintelligence,</v>

1041
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:04.420
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get really happy,</v>

1042
00:48:04.421 --> 00:48:09.421
<v Speaker 3>happy in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just like someone who's having a </v>

1043
00:48:09.421 --> 00:48:09.421
<v Speaker 3>good day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a way where if you ran into them,</v>

1044
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 3>you would recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd figured something out.</v>

1045
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:17.580
<v Speaker 3>So that person gets a group of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>around him who are kind of magnetized by</v>

1046
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:21.730
<v Speaker 3>the energy and by what they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're talking about are a real way</v>

1047
00:48:21.731 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 3>that you can live and actually be happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

1048
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 3>And those people from being around </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's like,</v>

1049
00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:31.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in sports they used to say you can </v>

1050
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:35.791
<v Speaker 3>own a five minute mile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could only run a mile and this </v>

1051
00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:38.371
<v Speaker 3>amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone thought that everyone was </v>

1052
00:48:38.371 --> 00:48:38.371
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then right when someone broke it,</v>

1053
00:48:38.371 --> 00:48:39.520
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden everyone started </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking.</v>

1054
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:40.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1055
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:45.091
<v Speaker 3>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the same way these certain people </v>

1056
00:48:45.091 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 3>will overcome a specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1057
00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 3>a phantom of their time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is causing them to be miserable.</v>

1058
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Those people get people around them will</v>
<v Speaker 3>also get this certain level of </v>

1059
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.150
<v Speaker 3>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The person who came up with the original</v>

1060
00:48:58.151 --> 00:49:03.151
<v Speaker 3>idea dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's just got the disciples and the </v>

1061
00:49:03.151 --> 00:49:05.971
<v Speaker 3>disciples that people around them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they transmit this idea to the people </v>

1062
00:49:05.971 --> 00:49:06.730
<v Speaker 3>are on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now it's a little diluted in some of</v>

1063
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 3>the people we were doing and aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite,</v>

1064
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:09.970
<v Speaker 3>aren't really quite happy.</v>

1065
00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:12.910
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you pass that down,</v>

1066
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.780
<v Speaker 3>keeps getting water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting watered and watered and watered.</v>

1067
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.770
<v Speaker 3>And then the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

1068
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.860
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have like some fucking,</v>

1069
00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:25.861
<v Speaker 3>like old horny man with his pants down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just nailing a toddler and a confession </v>

1070
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:28.180
<v Speaker 3>booth and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1071
00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:29.860
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the end result.</v>

1072
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Starts off with this super happy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ends up with a fucking pedophile dress </v>

1073
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 3>like a god clown with his cock and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid's ass.</v>

1074
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.840
<v Speaker 3>That's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how mutated things get.</v>

1075
00:49:40.841 --> 00:49:45.841
<v Speaker 3>Which is why it's very funny that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel so desperate to cling onto this old</v>

1076
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 3>thing instead of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1077
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.460
<v Speaker 3>there might be a new thing that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with based on all the </v>

1078
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:53.770
<v Speaker 3>information we have right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The end</v>

1079
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.770
<v Speaker 4>of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all shit that was written down by </v>

1080
00:49:58.770 --> 00:49:59.100
<v Speaker 4>people at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1081
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:04.170
<v Speaker 4>And why would we ever think that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who lived thousands of years ago </v>

1082
00:50:04.211 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 4>had it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1083
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:06.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1084
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:10.690
<v Speaker 4>Why would you want to believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There might be information there that we</v>

1085
00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:15.691
<v Speaker 4>could use and could help us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the most important thing is to know </v>

1086
00:50:15.691 --> 00:50:16.460
<v Speaker 4>what we know now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1087
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.130
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do we know now?</v>

1088
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 4>And let's figure this fucking thing out </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1089
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:21.970
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Following some.</v>

1090
00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:24.250
<v Speaker 4>Any crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything.</v>

1091
00:50:24.251 --> 00:50:26.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judaism,</v>

1092
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslim.</v>

1093
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to be?</v>

1094
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:31.060
<v Speaker 4>I want to be a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Krishna.</v>

1095
00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all the same.</v>

1096
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:35.060
<v Speaker 4>It's all something that someone put put </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1097
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The message behind it.</v>

1098
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 4>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows if it's right.</v>

1099
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Who knows if it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows if there really is a,</v>

1100
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.610
<v Speaker 4>an actual man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking clouds.</v>

1101
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.010
<v Speaker 4>And in the biblical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck knows?</v>

1102
00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:46.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1103
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:51.510
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem likely to me based on </v>

1104
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:52.700
<v Speaker 4>what I've experienced in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it is going to be pissed,</v>

1105
00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:57.701
<v Speaker 4>but even if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the university is fucking so </v>

1106
00:50:57.701 --> 00:50:57.701
<v Speaker 4>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

1107
00:50:57.701 --> 00:51:02.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just the idea of the infinite space is </v>

1108
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 4>so bizarre that a guy in the clouds with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a horrible.</v>

1109
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:04.220
<v Speaker 4>Why is that so weird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1110
00:51:04.221 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

1111
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 4>Fucking why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

1112
00:51:06.951 --> 00:51:11.951
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There'd be one guy that's running the </v>

1113
00:51:11.951 --> 00:51:11.951
<v Speaker 4>whole fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck you,</v>

1114
00:51:11.951 --> 00:51:16.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds crazy that there could be a </v>

1115
00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:16.310
<v Speaker 4>heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pearly gates and shit,</v>

1116
00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 4>and you get up there and there's dudes </v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing white and everybody's floating.</v>

1117
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 4>But imagine if it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if you got up,</v>

1118
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.690
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't.</v>

1119
00:51:23.691 --> 00:51:28.691
<v Speaker 4>That is not to me nearly as shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heaven is not nearly as shocking as the </v>

1120
00:51:28.691 --> 00:51:29.120
<v Speaker 4>universe itself.</v>

1121
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1122
00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:34.700
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about here is that the ability to </v>

1123
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.540
<v Speaker 3>describe reality and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to uh,</v>

1124
00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:41.550
<v Speaker 3>understand reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It keeps increasing as we evolve as a </v>

1125
00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a really smart people and you know,</v>

1126
00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:47.760
<v Speaker 3>in every single time there's been very </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart people at every single time,</v>

1127
00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:52.770
<v Speaker 3>really smart people in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their ability to describe reality </v>

1128
00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:57.420
<v Speaker 3>was limited to the language available to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and the technology that was around </v>

1129
00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:57.420
<v Speaker 3>them at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1130
00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.800
<v Speaker 3>if you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

1131
00:51:58.801 --> 00:52:00.480
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you remember this because there's</v>

1132
00:52:00.481 --> 00:52:05.481
<v Speaker 3>a book in the Old Testament that is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind is clearly a Ufo encounter.</v>

1133
00:52:06.421 --> 00:52:11.421
<v Speaker 3>I think it's not leviticus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's as equal.</v>

1134
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.370
<v Speaker 3>Now you look at that and what is the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who used to describe this thing?</v>

1135
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:16.360
<v Speaker 3>We'll within the Marriott's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.790
<v Speaker 3>wheels and chariots and just the shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's available to him to describe this</v>

1137
00:52:20.791 --> 00:52:24.390
<v Speaker 3>experience that he had now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if someone saw that same thing,</v>

1138
00:52:24.391 --> 00:52:24.840
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1139
00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:27.720
<v Speaker 3>I got sucked up by a Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave me a psychedelic.</v>

1140
00:52:27.721 --> 00:52:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I saw something that's coming which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>relevant</v>

1141
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:35.800
<v Speaker 4>or period coconut felon that </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker's head and sparks were </v>

1142
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.090
<v Speaker 4>flying and he didn't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He woke up in a ditch with a bloody head</v>

1143
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.360
<v Speaker 4>with a have been loosening far.</v>

1144
00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.460
<v Speaker 3>It could have been allison nation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people just believed it,</v>

1145
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:49.610
<v Speaker 3>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean outside of religious </v>

1146
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:50.460
<v Speaker 3>hallucinations or visions and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to describe it,</v>

1147
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:55.820
<v Speaker 3>everyone's limited to the tools that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have around them to observe reality</v>

1148
00:52:57.151 --> 00:53:00.000
<v Speaker 3>and they can only report on reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on the tools that they had</v>

1149
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 4>and the experiences that they have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>draw upon.</v>

1150
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:07.480
<v Speaker 4>Which is one of the reasons why the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole Ufo thing seemed so preposterous </v>

1151
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.210
<v Speaker 4>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so we don't have that experience to</v>

1152
00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:12.140
<v Speaker 4>draw upon the experience of an alien </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent life form.</v>

1153
00:53:12.141 --> 00:53:14.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like looking back at us while we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at it,</v>

1154
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:19.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think 90 percent of the people on the </v>

1155
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:20.510
<v Speaker 4>planet which is die of a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like immediately,</v>

1156
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.270
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fucking explode.</v>

1157
00:53:22.271 --> 00:53:27.271
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If aliens came and they were super </v>

1158
00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:27.880
<v Speaker 4>intelligent with big fucking gray heads </v>
<v Speaker 4>and those giant black guys,</v>

1159
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:32.250
<v Speaker 4>they can totally read your mind and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were all just like floating and freezing</v>

1160
00:53:32.251 --> 00:53:36.960
<v Speaker 4>people and erasing memories and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all these Travis Walton stories.</v>

1161
00:53:36.961 --> 00:53:41.961
<v Speaker 4>You know that guy that if that's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that were to actually happen,</v>

1162
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:44.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the human race would </v>
<v Speaker 4>survive.</v>

1163
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.070
<v Speaker 4>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't serve.</v>

1164
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:51.080
<v Speaker 4>We're the alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't exist in a world where we're </v>

1165
00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 4>under the thumb of some incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>

1166
00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:58.341
<v Speaker 4>super sophisticated alien life form that</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks in a completely different way </v>

1167
00:53:58.341 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 4>than us and can control matter.</v>

1168
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know man,</v>

1169
00:54:01.491 --> 00:54:02.020
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

1170
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I have this optimistic idea of actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter like I'm working writing for the </v>

1171
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:07.040
<v Speaker 3>x amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to.</v>

1172
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to come from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sky and the silver ships.</v>

1173
00:54:09.401 --> 00:54:14.401
<v Speaker 3>I think the way it goes down is it maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you kind of.</v>

1174
00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:20.740
<v Speaker 3>We as a species get to a point where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of realized we remember actually </v>

1175
00:54:21.081 --> 00:54:26.081
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think right now we have a little bit </v>

1176
00:54:26.081 --> 00:54:26.081
<v Speaker 3>of Amnesia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have lost a,</v>

1177
00:54:26.081 --> 00:54:28.640
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sense of like what truly is happening.</v>

1178
00:54:28.641 --> 00:54:31.700
<v Speaker 3>I think when you take a really potent </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic,</v>

1179
00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.880
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you'll see this universe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>already is around you that's already </v>

1180
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:41.231
<v Speaker 3>happening around you at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a sense all of a sudden that </v>

1181
00:54:41.231 --> 00:54:44.210
<v Speaker 3>you've been there before and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes away.</v>

1182
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:49.510
<v Speaker 3>But it seems like we're more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting projected into this reality with</v>

1183
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.650
<v Speaker 3>awful amnesia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some,</v>

1184
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be,</v>

1185
00:54:52.991 --> 00:54:55.420
<v Speaker 3>it could be just a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be a,</v>

1186
00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:59.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sadistic joke could be a prank.</v>

1187
00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:04.720
<v Speaker 3>This could be a prank that one super </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent entities playing on another </v>

1188
00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.660
<v Speaker 3>superintelligent enemy entity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be anything.</v>

1189
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 4>Or it can be a novelty creating machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like on Mckenna thought that the </v>

1190
00:55:12.071 --> 00:55:17.071
<v Speaker 4>universe is a novelty creating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>harvesting machine and that we as the </v>

1191
00:55:17.741 --> 00:55:22.741
<v Speaker 4>most complex organisms possibly in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe where we're at at the pinnacle </v>

1192
00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:26.350
<v Speaker 4>of this novelty creation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1193
00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:27.530
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>

1194
00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.800
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole reason for it all.</v>

1195
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:32.410
<v Speaker 4>It seems chaotic to us and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1196
00:55:32.411 --> 00:55:34.140
<v Speaker 4>this is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should know better,</v>

1197
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:38.260
<v Speaker 4>but it's almost like in our instincts as</v>
<v Speaker 4>an organism,</v>

1198
00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:42.400
<v Speaker 4>we have a direction to go and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction is not spiritual.</v>

1199
00:55:42.401 --> 00:55:44.230
<v Speaker 4>It's technological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1200
00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:47.530
<v Speaker 4>People are not looking for some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a spiritual release and some sort of a,</v>

1201
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:51.070
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a broader perspective on the universe in</v>

1202
00:55:51.071 --> 00:55:52.990
<v Speaker 4>an objective view of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1203
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.680
<v Speaker 4>They're looking to see if they can punch</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hole through the center of space.</v>

1204
00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's those real height of progress is </v>

1205
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:06.061
<v Speaker 4>not a complete overhauling and </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of the educational system </v>

1206
00:56:06.061 --> 00:56:10.471
<v Speaker 4>of the way to develop human minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way to stop people from harming each</v>

1207
00:56:10.571 --> 00:56:14.440
<v Speaker 4>other instead of devoting all of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>resources to evolving socially.</v>

1208
00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:16.930
<v Speaker 4>If it even is possible ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of doing that</v>

1209
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1210
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:23.400
<v Speaker 3>one thing you can do is instead of when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about the passage of time as </v>

1211
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 3>we move into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>

1212
00:56:24.401 --> 00:56:25.960
<v Speaker 3>get out of your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea,</v>

1213
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:30.961
<v Speaker 3>it's like running down a race track or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like you're running down a </v>

1214
00:56:30.961 --> 00:56:33.130
<v Speaker 3>track and think of it more in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a revealing is happening.</v>

1215
00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:38.131
<v Speaker 3>So as we progress into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more things begin to emerge into this </v>

1216
00:56:38.131 --> 00:56:42.661
<v Speaker 3>reality that weren't there before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we go from having stone tools to </v>

1217
00:56:42.661 --> 00:56:44.200
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden having a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1218
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:47.350
<v Speaker 3>iron tools and then we go from that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you know,</v>

1219
00:56:47.351 --> 00:56:52.351
<v Speaker 3>where we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're surrounded by fucking </v>

1220
00:56:52.351 --> 00:56:54.811
<v Speaker 3>silver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>glowing macintosh computers and like </v>

1221
00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:58.770
<v Speaker 3>microphones that are somehow recording </v>
<v Speaker 3>our voice and these things keep getting </v>

1222
00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:02.671
<v Speaker 3>revealed more and more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And any of these items should you take </v>

1223
00:57:02.671 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 3>them back 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would think it was a Ufo.</v>

1224
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:07.720
<v Speaker 3>They'd see it and think that fell out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a space ship.</v>

1225
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.360
<v Speaker 3>So all of a sudden you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe Mckenna said this,</v>

1226
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:12.310
<v Speaker 3>I think he may have said something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1227
00:57:12.311 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is the spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the alien,</v>

1228
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:20.430
<v Speaker 3>the extra terrestrial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's growing around us like crystals </v>

1229
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Speaker 3>when you were a kid and you're growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>crystals,</v>

1230
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:27.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's growing in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology that eventually is going on </v>

1231
00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:28.690
<v Speaker 3>to become self aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I heard this awesome thing,</v>

1232
00:57:28.691 --> 00:57:33.691
<v Speaker 3>which is the first alien contact that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have is going to be a computer that </v>

1233
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:39.901
<v Speaker 3>wakes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be our first </v>

1234
00:57:39.901 --> 00:57:39.901
<v Speaker 3>communication with another </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

1235
00:57:39.901 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Not something from the great void of </v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

1236
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.360
<v Speaker 3>but something that grew through time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1237
00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.800
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said that's totally possible,</v>

1238
00:57:45.801 --> 00:57:48.410
<v Speaker 6>but I don't say not something from </v>
<v Speaker 6>space.</v>

1239
00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:50.990
<v Speaker 6>So as it could be something from space.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1240
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 6>that's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hope it is.</v>

1241
00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:55.820
<v Speaker 6>It could be that the first Ufo or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>first,</v>

1242
00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:56.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1243
00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.750
<v Speaker 6>the first real intelligence that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>encountered this greater than our own is</v>

1244
00:57:59.751 --> 00:58:03.020
<v Speaker 6>something that we create ourselves at </v>
<v Speaker 6>replicates itself through us.</v>

1245
00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:08.050
<v Speaker 6>Like very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that was the idea that once a </v>

1246
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:10.751
<v Speaker 6>computer becomes the real issue is going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be that they're going to be able to </v>

1247
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:13.681
<v Speaker 6>live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a stupid fucking design who </v>

1248
00:58:13.681 --> 00:58:13.681
<v Speaker 6>built me and then they build something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like way better.</v>

1249
00:58:13.681 --> 00:58:17.651
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Instantly they know exactly how to put </v>

1250
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:20.231
<v Speaker 6>it together once they and you know the </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea of programming emotions and </v>

1251
00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:24.830
<v Speaker 6>programming are a million system of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of dealing with babies and puppies and </v>

1252
00:58:25.551 --> 00:58:26.980
<v Speaker 6>little baby chickie's and shit.</v>

1253
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:32.140
<v Speaker 6>They won't have any of that guilt or </v>
<v Speaker 6>weird feeling about biological life and </v>

1254
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:36.071
<v Speaker 6>they might just say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at these fucking assholes shitting </v>

1255
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:38.441
<v Speaker 6>all over this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can't even use half of the resources </v>

1256
00:58:38.441 --> 00:58:40.100
<v Speaker 6>on the planet because it's fuck heads </v>
<v Speaker 6>have blown up nuclear bombs.</v>

1257
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:45.700
<v Speaker 6>Nuclear waste and holes were like cats </v>
<v Speaker 6>will like take our nuclear ships and we </v>

1258
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.930
<v Speaker 6>just throw them in a hole and then we </v>
<v Speaker 6>cover over.</v>

1259
00:58:47.931 --> 00:58:52.931
<v Speaker 6>It was like stupid cats at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the heap of technological innovation and</v>

1260
00:58:55.431 --> 00:59:00.431
<v Speaker 6>science.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The best way to get rid of nuclear </v>

1261
00:59:00.431 --> 00:59:00.431
<v Speaker 6>waste.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Besides shooting it at other planets,</v>

1262
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:03.980
<v Speaker 6>could you imagine what assholes we would</v>
<v Speaker 6>be considered in the universe?</v>

1263
00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:07.910
<v Speaker 6>If we just shot our nuclear waste up </v>
<v Speaker 6>into space like a rocket,</v>

1264
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:10.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we send it out with the voyager to crash</v>

1265
00:59:10.521 --> 00:59:14.510
<v Speaker 6>lands on someone's fucking moon someday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or what if it starts some future war?</v>

1266
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.780
<v Speaker 6>They think it's a bomb we send,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we shoot nuclear waste.</v>

1267
00:59:17.781 --> 00:59:22.781
<v Speaker 6>There were just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Apparently it's very devastating to </v>

1268
00:59:22.781 --> 00:59:22.781
<v Speaker 6>their particular kills,</v>

1269
00:59:22.781 --> 00:59:23.870
<v Speaker 1>like 80 percent of the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

1270
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:29.140
<v Speaker 1>the rest they get together on giant bow </v>
<v Speaker 1>ships and had to earth so fucking good </v>

1271
00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:29.660
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody make that,</v>

1272
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 1>make that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would they,</v>

1273
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 1>could they show shoot nuclear waste in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this space?</v>

1274
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Can they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1275
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it gets stuck in the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it my.</v>

1276
00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you could,</v>

1277
00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Speaker 1>but it would take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes so much energy to get it out of</v>

1278
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:49.601
<v Speaker 1>the orbit of the planet that it ends up </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming less efficient to use nuclear </v>

1279
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:50.180
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1280
00:59:50.181 --> 00:59:52.040
<v Speaker 1>they blew up a bomb in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1281
00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 1>the atmospheric operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

1282
00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called operation </v>
<v Speaker 1>starfish.</v>

1283
00:59:56.871 --> 00:59:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Prime Corner knows the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1284
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Let me Google that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't starfish prime day involved?</v>

1285
01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:04.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1286
01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For real man,</v>

1287
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>they they decided to shoot a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear warhead.</v>

1288
01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>The ionosphere wouldn't like fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of rotation or something or </v>

1289
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:16.430
<v Speaker 1>possibly.</v>

1290
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it to fall back.</v>

1291
01:00:18.351 --> 01:00:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1292
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>you mean blowing up a fucking in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere?</v>

1293
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I think at that time they didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it was.</v>

1294
01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>What did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's prime?</v>

1295
01:00:25.011 --> 01:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1296
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something primed.</v>

1297
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I starfish starfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like initiate starfish.</v>

1298
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Primary daughters get album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

1299
01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a good nickname for somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>starfish.</v>

1300
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lipiscan.</v>

1301
01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:43.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like a nickname for a stripper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as karate and I was like a weed street.</v>

1302
01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1303
01:00:44.481 --> 01:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>One of five high altitude tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's Christ.</v>

1304
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>They shot a bunch of fucking nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs up in the space just to see what </v>

1305
01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1306
01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>these people are so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy people.</v>

1307
01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>People that we got running our world are</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking hilarious.</v>

1308
01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>When the people that created weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1309
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>The people that decided to like test </v>
<v Speaker 1>tube and blow shit up and see what you </v>

1310
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

1311
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the video of the one nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb that they blew up in the ocean </v>

1312
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.760
<v Speaker 1>where there's all these battleships </v>
<v Speaker 1>around it and the water,</v>

1313
01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1314
01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>like half a mile into the sky and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1315
01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:26.870
<v Speaker 1>it's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people exaggerating.</v>

1316
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Am I even exaggerating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might not be mad.</v>

1317
01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was more than 100 feet.</v>

1318
01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculously high in the sky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these are battleships,</v>

1319
01:01:37.491 --> 01:01:42.491
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like big ass battleships and this water </v>

1320
01:01:42.491 --> 01:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>just flying through the air like </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody made that,</v>

1321
01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>that will have a group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made that and then they just </v>

1322
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>fucking did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just did it.</v>

1323
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking fascinating that it </v>

1324
01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:55.270
<v Speaker 1>must've been when it was only </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical when there was all these anc</v>

1325
01:01:55.271 --> 01:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>had sitting around just ending the these</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

1326
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>oppenheimer and Einstein and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers with their ideas come </v>

1327
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>together and they think it could be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they know it could be.</v>

1328
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like science compels them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create it.</v>

1329
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science knowing that's the PR.</v>

1330
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That right there errors.</v>

1331
01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>The danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because things get weird at that point,</v>

1332
01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:18.850
<v Speaker 1>like those fucking signed someone is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

1333
01:02:18.851 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>but other than the scientists themselves</v>

1334
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:25.630
<v Speaker 4>and someone always will be and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that will be would never be able </v>

1335
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 4>to create that in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would never be able to come up with</v>

1336
01:02:28.321 --> 01:02:29.370
<v Speaker 4>this intellectually.</v>

1337
01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:34.490
<v Speaker 3>That's why scientists are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very interesting thing because </v>

1338
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 3>they have this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just seeking knowledge.</v>

1339
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:36.960
<v Speaker 3>They're Catholics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more out.</v>

1340
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:41.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people paying them to do this or</v>

1341
01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:43.110
<v Speaker 3>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite often the military,</v>

1342
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:47.160
<v Speaker 3>but look at these fucking guys who just </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented that new bird flu.</v>

1343
01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:52.161
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Running it through ferret kidneys or </v>

1344
01:02:52.161 --> 01:02:52.500
<v Speaker 3>something they created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember how they did.</v>

1345
01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:57.501
<v Speaker 3>It was like running it through ferrets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they created apparently something </v>

1346
01:02:57.501 --> 01:02:57.501
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>

1347
01:02:57.501 --> 01:03:02.000
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty percent of the people who got to </v>

1348
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.000
<v Speaker 3>die or kill something insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said it.</v>

1349
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.580
<v Speaker 3>It would make smallpox look like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>common called smallpox is already </v>

1350
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:09.990
<v Speaker 3>something that if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if if there was a smallpox outbreak,</v>

1351
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:12.090
<v Speaker 3>we'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We beat smallpox.</v>

1352
01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they making fucking super dizzy?</v>

1353
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Because they're just trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1354
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:22.320
<v Speaker 3>They're exploring the universe and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their motivation.</v>

1355
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Yet what they did is they created a </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological nuclear weapon.</v>

1356
01:03:26.671 --> 01:03:31.671
<v Speaker 3>Now she's all over the fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people in the military mean when</v>

1357
01:03:31.711 --> 01:03:36.711
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that some military commander </v>

1358
01:03:36.711 --> 01:03:36.711
<v Speaker 3>which is looking through there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1359
01:03:36.711 --> 01:03:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh Martha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you get data scientists on the line?</v>

1360
01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:41.940
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to talk to them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1361
01:03:41.941 --> 01:03:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you guys want to make $17,000,000</v>

1362
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:47.250
<v Speaker 3>this week?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Send over your research.</v>

1363
01:03:47.251 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 3>We'd like to know how to make this </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological agent,</v>

1364
01:03:50.671 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 3>and then the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some fucking government somewhere in the</v>

1365
01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:54.690
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1366
01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think Iran wasn't interested in that</v>

1367
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 3>or what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe North Korea.</v>

1368
01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Certainly any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any fucking world power would want that </v>

1369
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:07.551
<v Speaker 3>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great weapon outside of the </v>

1370
01:04:07.551 --> 01:04:07.551
<v Speaker 3>fact that it ends up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>

1371
01:04:07.551 --> 01:04:07.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological weapons,</v>

1372
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 3>biological weapons have a really.</v>

1373
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:12.600
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that one is it might </v>
<v Speaker 3>not burn itself out,</v>

1374
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:17.870
<v Speaker 3>but biological weapons have a distinct </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage over nuclear weapons because </v>

1375
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:21.120
<v Speaker 3>nuclear weapons destroy infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological weapons.</v>

1376
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:26.121
<v Speaker 3>Just kill a lot of logical lens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you have a nice fast moving </v>

1377
01:04:26.121 --> 01:04:28.200
<v Speaker 3>fucking disease that you've made that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can drop on a city,</v>

1378
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:31.080
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly in there three months down the road,</v>

1379
01:04:31.081 --> 01:04:32.760
<v Speaker 3>clean up the bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a city,</v>

1380
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.200
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1381
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1382
01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:35.960
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1383
01:04:35.961 --> 01:04:40.961
<v Speaker 3>it's better than a fucking nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapon where now you've got a nuclear </v>

1384
01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:41.190
<v Speaker 3>wasteland that you can't use for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1385
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.630
<v Speaker 3>So isn't it</v>

1386
01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:47.730
<v Speaker 4>strange just comes down to the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are in control of that kind of </v>

1387
01:04:47.921 --> 01:04:50.770
<v Speaker 4>power?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost can't help but be cuts.</v>

1388
01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why you got to that </v>

1389
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:55.980
<v Speaker 4>position in the first place is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're wanting to do this.</v>

1390
01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1391
01:04:57.371 --> 01:04:58.200
<v Speaker 4>You ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:03.390
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're one of those guys pushing </v>

1393
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.390
<v Speaker 4>these buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1394
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.390
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1395
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.390
<v Speaker 4>you've always wanted to do this.</v>

1396
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it puts us in a real bind man,</v>

1397
01:05:05.181 --> 01:05:07.820
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't represent us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't represent us,</v>

1398
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.880
<v Speaker 3>represent any of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even if let's say we spread it,</v>

1399
01:05:10.881 --> 01:05:15.881
<v Speaker 3>let's say somehow it spreads through and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden like the consciousness </v>

1400
01:05:15.881 --> 01:05:16.610
<v Speaker 3>of like all these people who started </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into power,</v>

1401
01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.740
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 3>people who are like coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people who are coming into power.</v>

1403
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:26.041
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have more openminded Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology of how the world works and </v>

1404
01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:30.091
<v Speaker 3>let's say that just the whole of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>government suddenly turns into like the </v>

1405
01:05:30.091 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 3>smartest fucking people on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forgive me for saying this.</v>

1406
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:35.950
<v Speaker 3>The smartest people on reddit are now </v>
<v Speaker 3>running the United States government.</v>

1407
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:40.951
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden that's the country would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be perfect.</v>

1408
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Fucking.</v>

1409
01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.850
<v Speaker 4>That'd be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There'd be like,</v>

1410
01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:46.130
<v Speaker 4>no dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the intranet ran the world,</v>

1411
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:51.190
<v Speaker 4>the world would be beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There will be incredible wine because </v>

1412
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:52.040
<v Speaker 4>the Internet is the voice of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really the only voice of the people.</v>

1413
01:05:52.041 --> 01:05:53.080
<v Speaker 4>It's the only voice we all</v>

1414
01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:58.090
<v Speaker 3>have there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way they're the breaking news </v>

1415
01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:00.170
<v Speaker 3>stories of be like cute cat pictures and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sucking it the.</v>

1416
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:05.370
<v Speaker 3>But here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that happened in this country and </v>

1417
01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:08.781
<v Speaker 3>let's say happened in Europe and let's </v>
<v Speaker 3>say it happened and parts of a parts of </v>

1418
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Asia still these pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you need is like two or three </v>

1419
01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:18.221
<v Speaker 3>fucking pockets of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>worshiping some mythological entity that</v>

1420
01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:23.231
<v Speaker 3>they think is a hates gay people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants women to wear a fucking weird shit</v>

1421
01:06:23.961 --> 01:06:26.870
<v Speaker 3>or thinks it's okay to like lash people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1422
01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember which country was.</v>

1423
01:06:28.521 --> 01:06:30.910
<v Speaker 3>I think some countries just as executed </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone for.</v>

1424
01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that could be propaganda.</v>

1425
01:06:33.331 --> 01:06:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1426
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:37.310
<v Speaker 3>but apparently someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They executed a guy for coming up with a</v>

1427
01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.530
<v Speaker 3>program that allows people to download </v>
<v Speaker 3>porn.</v>

1428
01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:45.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you just have a few of these </v>

1429
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:45.620
<v Speaker 3>psychopaths out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can ruin the whole fucking party.</v>

1430
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the earth right now has the </v>

1431
01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.531
<v Speaker 3>potential to turn into an awesome party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know that thing that happens </v>

1432
01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:57.251
<v Speaker 3>when two dicks roll into a party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two Weirdos that nobody invited or </v>

1433
01:06:57.251 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 3>like all of a sudden start fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking too much and like trying to </v>

1434
01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:02.240
<v Speaker 3>pick fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we have on a planetary scale</v>

1435
01:07:02.241 --> 01:07:03.540
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>

1436
01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:08.620
<v Speaker 3>but the people they're becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to be it was mostly psychos at </v>

1437
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.801
<v Speaker 3>the party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's getting to be where there's </v>

1438
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:13.601
<v Speaker 3>more and more cool people at the party </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we got to figure out how to get the </v>

1439
01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:14.920

<v Speaker 3>That's where we're at right now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Let's get these assholes out here to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>is we've got to convert the Dicks,</v>

1441

<v Speaker 4>with people.</v>

1448
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.640

<v Speaker 4>Develop a community of people that are </v>

1449
01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:41.650
<v Speaker 4>going to give them all mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't teach you.</v>

1451
01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:52.321
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>

1452
01:07:52.961 --> 01:07:54.550
<v Speaker 4>arts.com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them says,</v>

1453
01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:59.740
<v Speaker 4>why is Joe Rogan so in a mushrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you see that thing I tweeted </v>

1454
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.091
<v Speaker 4>today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously written by someone who hasn't </v>

1455
01:08:03.091 --> 01:08:03.091
<v Speaker 4>done mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1456
01:08:03.091 --> 01:08:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Or the Das that you've never done </v>
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Come on silly.</v>

1458
01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.520
<v Speaker 4>You see that thing I tweeted today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1459
01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:10.530
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've known about it for whereby they </v>

1460
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 4>found evidence to help mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Helping depression.</v>

1461
01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did see that.</v>

1462
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this day and age,</v>

1463
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they should be doing with mushrooms</v>

1464
01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:18.650
<v Speaker 4>is studying them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should have,</v>

1465
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 4>they should be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>decriminalized.</v>

1466
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.900
<v Speaker 4>They have no one's dying from mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1467
01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:25.370
<v Speaker 4>What people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're freaking out.</v>

1468
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:29.450
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons why they're freaking </v>
<v Speaker 4>out because life is fucking crazy enough</v>

1469
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:34.451
<v Speaker 4>as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of times you're holding a </v>

1470
01:08:34.451 --> 01:08:34.451
<v Speaker 4>billion things in the back of your head </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're trying to fight off.</v>

1471
01:08:34.451 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or You want to pretend you did a better </v>

1472
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:42.791
<v Speaker 4>thing that you really didn't take those </v>
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms and you're ugly truth.</v>

1473
01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 4>They just thrown into your face like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like diarrhea from the horse,</v>

1474
01:08:47.781 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 4>just blah all over you.</v>

1475
01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.010
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like your reality and that's a</v>

1476
01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:53.450
<v Speaker 4>bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a bad trip.</v>

1477
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.790
<v Speaker 4>Does it trip?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You needed it there.</v>

1478
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:56.870
<v Speaker 4>There are no bad trips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

1479
01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.500
<v Speaker 4>The only difficult trips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Difficult challenging trips.</v>

1480
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.000
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to remove the.</v>

1481
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:05.010
<v Speaker 4>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's less.</v>

1482
01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.920
<v Speaker 4>You overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I did was a bad job.</v>

1483
01:09:07.921 --> 01:09:12.050
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of like if you've got jet fuel</v>

1484
01:09:12.051 --> 01:09:14.360
<v Speaker 4>and you shoved it into someone's Prius,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be like,</v>

1485
01:09:14.361 --> 01:09:17.210
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this in here for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not working.</v>

1486
01:09:17.211 --> 01:09:22.211
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just don't like I couldn't walk </v>

1487
01:09:22.211 --> 01:09:22.211
<v Speaker 4>Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was following.</v>

1488
01:09:22.211 --> 01:09:22.720
<v Speaker 4>My feet would not work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have that.</v>

1489
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Then you'd have to be like Shaquille </v>
<v Speaker 4>O'Neal to handle that,</v>

1490
01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:31.050
<v Speaker 4>but in this super society or talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about nine slash 11 for bad trips,</v>

1491
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.030
<v Speaker 4>like seven slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're having a bad trip,</v>

1492
01:09:35.031 --> 01:09:39.110
<v Speaker 4>call it and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking freaking out.</v>

1493
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:40.860
<v Speaker 4>I can't feel my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they could,</v>

1494
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.940
<v Speaker 4>you know that they could send over some </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking cool.</v>

1495
01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.830
<v Speaker 4>Well the real problem is we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1496
01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 4>we're great when we could communicate </v>
<v Speaker 4>directly with each other,</v>

1497
01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:53.120
<v Speaker 4>but when we band together in big groups </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then we can't communicate,</v>

1498
01:09:53.121 --> 01:09:58.121
<v Speaker 4>we get too far away from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we just start getting dickie with </v>

1499
01:09:58.121 --> 01:09:58.530
<v Speaker 4>the people that are the furthest away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1500
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:59.480
<v Speaker 4>fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1501
01:09:59.481 --> 01:10:01.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're owned by where the good water is</v>

1502
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:05.150
<v Speaker 4>and you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the lack of it,</v>

1503
01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:07.460
<v Speaker 4>that the fact that you don't feel all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these other people.</v>

1504
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.400
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an evolving entity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

1505
01:10:10.401 --> 01:10:15.401
<v Speaker 4>I think the human organism is some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>technology inventing,</v>

1506
01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.790
<v Speaker 4>evolving organism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the invention of technology</v>

1507
01:10:19.791 --> 01:10:22.400
<v Speaker 4>though I think is like the whole reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>why we're here.</v>

1508
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:27.670
<v Speaker 4>I think what we're all doing as standup </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians and as nurses and doctors and </v>

1509
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:32.870
<v Speaker 4>we are all supporting the system that </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps alive.</v>

1510
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:36.140
<v Speaker 4>The people that make the awesome shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to find out that we are</v>

1511
01:10:36.141 --> 01:10:38.030
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you die.</v>

1512
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1513
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:40.430
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're the caterpillar.</v>

1514
01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:45.431
<v Speaker 4>That becomes the butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are working towards the invention of </v>

1515
01:10:45.431 --> 01:10:46.880
<v Speaker 4>this ultimate technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just don't see it that way.</v>

1516
01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:51.881
<v Speaker 4>We think of our lives is I've got to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>my shit together and I've got to get my </v>

1517
01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:51.881
<v Speaker 4>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1518
01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:54.440
<v Speaker 4>when I get to yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm there.</v>

1519
01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am centered,</v>

1520
01:10:57.381 --> 01:11:02.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just trying to make up for the </v>

1521
01:11:02.381 --> 01:11:04.451
<v Speaker 4>fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got some weird situation where </v>

1522
01:11:04.451 --> 01:11:04.451
<v Speaker 4>your husband doesn't fuck anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's be realistic.</v>

1523

<v Speaker 4>crystals because you ain't get no good </v>

1525
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.950

<v Speaker 4>feeling that the whole thing might be in</v>

1526
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 4>just so we keep</v>

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 3>UFC seeing somebody get choked out up </v>
<v Speaker 3>close is fucking disturbing,</v>

1607
01:14:30.711 --> 01:14:31.820
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

1608
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:33.560
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see that fucking,</v>

1609
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like watching somebody with like,</v>

1610
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gardening,</v>

1611
01:14:38.511 --> 01:14:40.700
<v Speaker 3>she just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just clamps down.</v>

1612
01:14:40.701 --> 01:14:44.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like watching a clamp just smashed </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's wind pipe.</v>

1613
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.340
<v Speaker 3>It seems like they can't live after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1614
01:14:46.341 --> 01:14:48.080
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you destroy their neck.</v>

1615
01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel like it,</v>

1616
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.010
<v Speaker 4>but no dudes come right back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judge,</v>

1617
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:57.110
<v Speaker 4>you see that USC has the xbox app now </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can just watch live UFC on </v>

1618
01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.570
<v Speaker 4>xbox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can sit there and pay per view,</v>

1619
01:15:00.571 --> 01:15:02.340
<v Speaker 4>but through xbox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much is it?</v>

1620
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 4>The charger?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Xbox,</v>

1621
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:04.730
<v Speaker 4>is that what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1622
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.310
<v Speaker 4>that's sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to do it and they're doing</v>

1623
01:15:07.311 --> 01:15:09.730
<v Speaker 4>them in movie theaters as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've done it before I moved here.</v>

1624
01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:12.090
<v Speaker 4>That would be fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1625
01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.180
<v Speaker 4>checkouts physiologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that bad for your body.</v>

1626
01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.100
<v Speaker 4>Head impact is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Hen impact they're finding out is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1628
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:21.960
<v Speaker 4>you got to limit the amount of times you</v>
<v Speaker 4>get hit.</v>

1629
01:15:21.961 --> 01:15:25.560
<v Speaker 4>That's why for a fighter it's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>important to know what to hang it up.</v>

1630
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:28.480
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain amount of shots and </v>
<v Speaker 4>after that you should really.</v>

1631
01:15:28.481 --> 01:15:29.480
<v Speaker 4>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1632
01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.520
<v Speaker 4>I know you still like to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to think about your feet.</v>

1633
01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Who decides this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does the.</v>

1634
01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:38.660
<v Speaker 3>Is it always in that decision at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter in the UFC?</v>

1635
01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately it has to be the decision of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fighter unless someone owns him,</v>

1636
01:15:42.201 --> 01:15:44.660
<v Speaker 4>unless he's a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as an organization,</v>

1637
01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:46.940
<v Speaker 4>if you kind of know a guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization,</v>

1638
01:15:46.941 --> 01:15:49.070
<v Speaker 4>if the UFC decided that someone should </v>
<v Speaker 4>be fighting for them,</v>

1639
01:15:49.071 --> 01:15:51.650
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't keep them from fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll go somewhere else.</v>

1640
01:15:51.651 --> 01:15:53.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the UFC,</v>

1641
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:56.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does offer advice to guys and they,</v>

1642
01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:56.990
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1643
01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.810
<v Speaker 4>they care very much for their fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have like,</v>

1644
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:59.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like chocolate l,</v>

1645
01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.800
<v Speaker 4>they gave him a great job and part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason was they didn't want him to </v>

1646
01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:04.970
<v Speaker 4>fight anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had this amazing career,</v>

1647
01:16:04.971 --> 01:16:06.110
<v Speaker 4>but when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's over.</v>

1648
01:16:06.111 --> 01:16:06.590
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1649
01:16:06.591 --> 01:16:09.080
<v Speaker 4>they had one last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lost that.</v>

1650
01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:09.710
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1651
01:16:09.711 --> 01:16:11.030
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to settle in.</v>

1652
01:16:11.031 --> 01:16:16.031
<v Speaker 4>And they got an awesome cushy desk job </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he travels around and like </v>

1653
01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:16.031
<v Speaker 4>represents the UFC.</v>

1654
01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:18.980
<v Speaker 4>And the beauty of that is it's like they</v>
<v Speaker 4>took care of them.</v>

1655
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:20.030
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pull them,</v>

1656
01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.100
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they said,</v>

1657
01:16:22.101 --> 01:16:22.750
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1658
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:24.050
<v Speaker 4>this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is time.</v>

1659
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.670
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just settle the fuck down.</v>

1660
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:26.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1661
01:16:26.781 --> 01:16:28.580
<v Speaker 4>let's move on to the next stage of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an author,</v>

1662
01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.760
<v Speaker 4>you're a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll be a bad motherfucker business.</v>

1663
01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:35.090
<v Speaker 4>He'll be a bad motherfucker to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wants to do a certain point in time,</v>

1664
01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:37.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good to have somebody cares for you</v>

1665
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.560
<v Speaker 4>that comes in and steps in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what Dana did.</v>

1666
01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Dana like totally hooked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chuck up.</v>

1667
01:16:41.001 --> 01:16:42.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chuck was with him from the beginning.</v>

1668
01:16:42.771 --> 01:16:47.771
<v Speaker 4>They were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were together at the beginning and </v>

1669
01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:47.771
<v Speaker 4>he's taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1670
01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:47.771
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's awesome.</v>

1671
01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:48.700
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's awesome to see a guy who knows,</v>

1672
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:50.480
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a smart thing to do.</v>

1673
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to step away because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>so hard for fighters.</v>

1674
01:16:53.181 --> 01:16:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That moment of the moment of competition</v>

1675
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:59.600
<v Speaker 4>is so intense and so extreme and </v>
<v Speaker 4>victory,</v>

1676
01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been there while Chuck Liddell won </v>

1677
01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:04.800
<v Speaker 4>like some big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big fights.</v>

1678
01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.711
<v Speaker 4>I was like right there during the Hay </v>
<v Speaker 4>day when he was in his prime man and </v>

1679
01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:13.391
<v Speaker 4>having been and having seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could ever do that ever,</v>

1680
01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:16.370
<v Speaker 4>you could ever do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would want to keep doing it.</v>

1681
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.050
<v Speaker 4>You would just be convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to go one more time.</v>

1682
01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:24.051
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that he could ever stop </v>

1683
01:17:24.051 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 4>because it's such a rush for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched him knock these down.</v>

1684
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:27.830
<v Speaker 4>I watched him knock Randy coture out </v>
<v Speaker 4>twice.</v>

1685
01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.620
<v Speaker 4>She is flatlining guys with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>punches.</v>

1686
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:35.621
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy and running around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the scariest fucking guy on the </v>

1687
01:17:35.621 --> 01:17:36.890
<v Speaker 4>planet for like a few years.</v>

1688
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:41.890
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was terrifying when he was just </v>

1689
01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:42.770
<v Speaker 4>running shit in the UFC when he was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his true athletic peak.</v>

1690
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.930
<v Speaker 4>That must have been an amazing feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It must've been.</v>

1691
01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:48.770
<v Speaker 4>That life must have been so crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>exciting.</v>

1692
01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:54.100
<v Speaker 4>You're stepping into a cage against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most ferocious guys on the planet and </v>

1693
01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:58.541
<v Speaker 4>you're smashing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smashing them in front of the whole </v>

1694
01:17:58.541 --> 01:17:59.070
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1695
01:17:59.240 --> 01:17:59.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>

1696
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:04.750
<v Speaker 4>His career was incredible man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking incredible knockouts.</v>

1697
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.580
<v Speaker 4>The Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lou knockouts,</v>

1698
01:18:07.581 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 4>but he was just a beast man when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Chuck Liddell was on,</v>

1699
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:15.520
<v Speaker 4>on top when he was at his best man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most exciting guys of all </v>

1700
01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.760
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for that guy,</v>

1701
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:17.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1702
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:19.690
<v Speaker 4>it's probably real hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

1703
01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Just accept giddy up in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to the quiet of your yard as </v>

1704
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:29.501
<v Speaker 4>you walk towards your fucking newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sitting in your front porch and </v>

1705
01:18:29.501 --> 01:18:31.280
<v Speaker 4>you're looking out there and just people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are mowing their lawn.</v>

1706
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.800
<v Speaker 4>You start shadow box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start going.</v>

1707
01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Maybe just one more fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>

1708
01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.960
<v Speaker 4>you get bored?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1709
01:18:37.961 --> 01:18:40.400
<v Speaker 4>back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to feel a fucking rush.</v>

1710
01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:42.920
<v Speaker 4>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1711
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:45.080
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard.</v>

1712
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:50.110
<v Speaker 4>It's an incredibly difficult transition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I experienced it in the most minute of </v>

1713
01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:52.070
<v Speaker 4>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1714
01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:55.250
<v Speaker 4>just tight window and kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when I,</v>

1715
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:57.440
<v Speaker 4>when I stopped fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was like 20,</v>

1716
01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:00.250
<v Speaker 4>21 or 22 was my last fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1717
01:19:00.251 --> 01:19:02.260
<v Speaker 4>I just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1718
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.590
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird thing.</v>

1719
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:05.740
<v Speaker 4>It's a hard decision to either feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1720
01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:10.741
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get that feeling now that it gets </v>

1721
01:19:10.741 --> 01:19:12.181
<v Speaker 4>boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get that feeling when I delete </v>

1722
01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:13.420
<v Speaker 4>starcraft for Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's you.</v>

1723
01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:18.710
<v Speaker 4>The real problem with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid doing martial arts is </v>

1724
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:19.050
<v Speaker 4>worried about two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

1725
01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.470
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't make any money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no money in I kickboxing.</v>

1726
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:26.510
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing back then does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't even kickbox and </v>

1727
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.510
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to drive to Rhode island like</v>

1728
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:27.660
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>

1729
01:19:27.661 --> 01:19:30.840
<v Speaker 4>You could fight in full contact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taekwondo matches in Massachusetts,</v>

1730
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:36.110
<v Speaker 4>but you couldn't kick box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to go to Rhode Island for that </v>

1731
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.110
<v Speaker 4>and they didn't even have more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tyler,</v>

1732
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.110
<v Speaker 4>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>

1733
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:38.610
<v Speaker 4>it was a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the brain damage issue,</v>

1734
01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.640
<v Speaker 4>brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is always a concern.</v>

1735
01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:44.670
<v Speaker 4>I was always thinking about that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew I was like,</v>

1736
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1737
01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:50.781
<v Speaker 4>I did not do very well in school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because I did not want to pay </v>

1738
01:19:50.781 --> 01:19:51.300
<v Speaker 4>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just really distracted kid.</v>

1739
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure if I was with the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents,</v>

1740
01:19:53.461 --> 01:19:55.350
<v Speaker 4>they would have drugged me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially today.</v>

1741
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like super distracted,</v>

1742
01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:00.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I read a lot of Shit and you know,</v>

1743
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:05.300
<v Speaker 4>go being like a young kid and not like </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on with the world</v>

1744
01:20:11.071 --> 01:20:16.071
<v Speaker 4>and trying to figure things out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to like read as much as you can </v>

1745
01:20:16.071 --> 01:20:20.730
<v Speaker 4>to try to piece it together yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a very bizarre place to be.</v>

1746
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:21.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:24.930
<v Speaker 4>A lot of us get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1748
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:30.020
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people that we know came from a</v>
<v Speaker 4>place where when they were really young </v>

1749
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:35.510
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on with the </v>

1750
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:37.821
<v Speaker 4>world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old do you think you were when you </v>

1751
01:20:37.821 --> 01:20:37.821
<v Speaker 4>had your first?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1752
01:20:37.821 --> 01:20:40.200
<v Speaker 4>I think my parents might be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy thought.</v>

1753
01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.750
<v Speaker 4>Were you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are in charge of telling me</v>

1754
01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 4>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is nonsense.</v>

1755
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:45.930
<v Speaker 4>You make you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking crazy talk here.</v>

1756
01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:49.840
<v Speaker 3>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened for me the first time that I</v>

1757
01:20:49.841 --> 01:20:54.370
<v Speaker 3>took a lsd a and maybe before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I took Lsd,</v>

1758
01:20:54.371 --> 01:20:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I took lsd for the first time,</v>

1759
01:20:56.231 --> 01:20:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I can remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you take Lsd,</v>

1760
01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.040
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1761
01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1762
01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.090
<v Speaker 3>when I took Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what worries do I have?</v>

1763
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:06.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm in fucking high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

1764
01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.870
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to.</v>

1765
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:13.020
<v Speaker 3>There's no demons to come swimming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my brain and taunt me with like all </v>

1766
01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.320
<v Speaker 3>the myriad of things you get when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>

1767
01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:17.100
<v Speaker 3>There's fucking nothing we just opened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1768
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:22.130
<v Speaker 3>I might be upset because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cheerleader that came over to my </v>

1769
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.750
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't figure out how to kiss her.</v>

1770
01:21:22.751 --> 01:21:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's like the biggest problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having at the time.</v>

1771
01:21:25.931 --> 01:21:26.830
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1772
01:21:26.831 --> 01:21:28.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that time when I did it for the first</v>

1773
01:21:28.901 --> 01:21:32.620
<v Speaker 3>time and had that initial experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1774
01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.630
<v Speaker 3>when you go back to your parents who've </v>
<v Speaker 3>never taken it,</v>

1775
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:37.030
<v Speaker 3>and if you mentioned to them that you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>even taken it,</v>

1776
01:21:37.031 --> 01:21:42.031
<v Speaker 3>they might want to put you in a drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>rehab or they think you're insane or </v>

1777
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:42.031
<v Speaker 3>they think you're getting down the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>track,</v>

1778
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:44.650
<v Speaker 3>you're forced into this place of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>

1779
01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1780
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.560
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys don't even,</v>

1781
01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't even know you.</v>

1782
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.960
<v Speaker 3>You don't even understand this new way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of experiencing life.</v>

1783
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:55.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1784
01:21:55.270 --> 01:22:00.270
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's a lot of people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend their whole lives never knowing </v>

1785
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:02.140
<v Speaker 3>that you don't have to take psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get to that place.</v>

1786
01:22:02.141 --> 01:22:04.630
<v Speaker 3>There's other ways to get to that place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1787
01:22:04.631 --> 01:22:09.631
<v Speaker 3>it's a very strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those people who never get to that </v>

1788
01:22:09.631 --> 01:22:09.631
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones who are,</v>

1789
01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:11.200
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in control.</v>

1790
01:22:11.201 --> 01:22:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1791
01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:15.820
<v Speaker 4>So your life took an inexorable change </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you did acid.</v>

1792
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.920
<v Speaker 4>That was the point where you look back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you said,</v>

1793
01:22:17.921 --> 01:22:20.320
<v Speaker 4>this is the point where I went off into </v>
<v Speaker 4>this direction.</v>

1794
01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1795
01:22:22.081 --> 01:22:23.250
<v Speaker 3>I know I'd say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1796
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:28.460
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that taking acid started with a series </v>

1797
01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:30.150
<v Speaker 3>of like books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It started with contact with like,</v>

1798
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:32.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole weirdness.</v>

1799
01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:36.960
<v Speaker 3>My whole weird weirdness started with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or as I recall,</v>

1800
01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:41.961
<v Speaker 3>it started with me coming upon this book</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my mom had called Raja Yoga by Yogi</v>

1801
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:45.510
<v Speaker 3>raw mature Rocka,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who by the way,</v>

1802
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:50.750
<v Speaker 3>it was never a Yogi which just some </v>
<v Speaker 3>English mistake and lied about being a </v>

1803
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Yogi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is a fascinating story.</v>

1804
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:56.000
<v Speaker 3>But the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1805
01:22:56.010 --> 01:23:01.010
<v Speaker 3>that was the first time I'd ever read </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you're there,</v>

1806
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.590
<v Speaker 3>that you're an observer observing </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1807
01:23:04.591 --> 01:23:07.480
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you aren't necessarily the,</v>

1808
01:23:07.481 --> 01:23:08.320
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you think the,</v>

1809
01:23:08.321 --> 01:23:11.200
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be observed is not you.</v>

1810
01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:13.510
<v Speaker 3>You're the observer state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mindfulness,</v>

1811
01:23:13.511 --> 01:23:18.511
<v Speaker 3>the watch or that's when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the first time I'd come upon the </v>

1812
01:23:18.511 --> 01:23:18.511
<v Speaker 3>idea of what's that's called the altman.</v>

1813
01:23:18.511 --> 01:23:19.930
<v Speaker 3>The thing that observes yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1814
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:22.600
<v Speaker 3>when you know someone will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really mad right now.</v>

1815
01:23:23.130 --> 01:23:26.860
<v Speaker 3>The moment you say I'm mad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're creating a distinction,</v>

1816
01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:32.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the thing that's observing that </v>

1817
01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you're mad and the thing that's mad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that observer,</v>

1818
01:23:32.231 --> 01:23:34.500
<v Speaker 3>that watcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that,</v>

1819
01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.810
<v Speaker 3>that mindfulness is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1820
01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.100
<v Speaker 3>throughout my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to,</v>

1821
01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:44.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go into that place of observing myself </v>

1822
01:23:44.130 --> 01:23:47.251
<v Speaker 3>rather than being the thing and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>game that you can play and it really is </v>

1823
01:23:47.251 --> 01:23:49.510
<v Speaker 3>quite helpful with a variety of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of problems,</v>

1824
01:23:49.511 --> 01:23:54.310
<v Speaker 3>especially if you get really angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get really angry and you can stop</v>

1825
01:23:54.311 --> 01:23:58.090
<v Speaker 3>yourself and just watch and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools you can use in that book.</v>

1826
01:23:58.091 --> 01:24:01.990
<v Speaker 3>I remember it said as you walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start thinking he is walking.</v>

1827
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.320
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's in a book and you're a </v>

1828
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:07.320
<v Speaker 3>character in a book.</v>

1829
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:07.880
<v Speaker 3>So when you're going around you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1830
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:10.390
<v Speaker 3>right now he's doing a podcast right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1831
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:12.580
<v Speaker 3>He is talking and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

1832
01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Speaker 3>these are activities designed to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1833
01:24:14.621 --> 01:24:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Like the watcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state of presence of watching.</v>

1834
01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:20.230
<v Speaker 3>So that started it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That led me to like,</v>

1835
01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1836
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.840
<v Speaker 3>and then I found out about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1837
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:23.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1838
01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I think I read the electric koolaid acid</v>
<v Speaker 3>test,</v>

1839
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:31.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about fucking Ken Kesey and the merry </v>

1840
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:33.710
<v Speaker 3>pranksters blasting themselves on acid </v>
<v Speaker 3>and going to the world's fair in a bus.</v>

1841
01:24:33.711 --> 01:24:35.920
<v Speaker 3>And then I read that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember.</v>

1842
01:24:35.921 --> 01:24:36.980
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that.</v>

1843
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll stop this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird rant.</v>

1844
01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:42.240
<v Speaker 3>I remember now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking film strip.</v>

1845
01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:47.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what it started in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was in fourth grade and they </v>

1846
01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 3>showed us a drug film strip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember film strips fucking popped up.</v>

1847
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:53.560
<v Speaker 3>This guy like it caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy I still remember.</v>

1848
01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:58.561
<v Speaker 3>It's a guy in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a guy in a fucking empty apartment </v>

1849
01:24:59.590 --> 01:25:04.590
<v Speaker 3>and he's curled against the law in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fetal position and it's an lsd and it </v>

1850
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:06.670
<v Speaker 3>looks terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the narrator says,</v>

1851
01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Lsd can make you experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinations.</v>

1852
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.430
<v Speaker 3>You can see dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember him saying,</v>

1853
01:25:12.431 --> 01:25:13.720
<v Speaker 3>you could see drag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1854
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:19.100
<v Speaker 8>I want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sounds awesome.</v>

1855
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:22.710
<v Speaker 8>Fuck the empty apartment in the fetal </v>
<v Speaker 8>position.</v>

1856
01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.950
<v Speaker 8>I'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that guy's a pussy.</v>

1857
01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.080
<v Speaker 8>What are you crying?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I drag a little bit.</v>

1858
01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.160
<v Speaker 8>It's a gas</v>

1859
01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.050
<v Speaker 3>and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1860
01:25:33.051 --> 01:25:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Put it in my head is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1861
01:25:34.431 --> 01:25:34.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1862
01:25:34.911 --> 01:25:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's an interesting thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to explore,</v>

1863
01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:37.770
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1864
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:42.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

1865
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.680
<v Speaker 4>So you think that you were like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dunkin's like Duncan one and Duncan to </v>

1866
01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.370
<v Speaker 4>like Dunkin one is like regular Dunkin </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up,</v>

1867
01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.470
<v Speaker 4>innocent boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1868
01:25:50.690 --> 01:25:52.250
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelics.</v>

1869
01:25:52.251 --> 01:25:53.810
<v Speaker 4>And then Duncan to two point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>

1870
01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:54.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1871
01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:57.610
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely a dunk into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happened.</v>

1872
01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:58.880
<v Speaker 3>I'd say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that,</v>

1873
01:25:58.881 --> 01:26:02.140
<v Speaker 3>that Duncan to change too man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know as you get older,</v>

1874
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:05.270
<v Speaker 3>the best thing that there's two great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best thing that can happen to you as</v>

1875
01:26:05.271 --> 01:26:07.820
<v Speaker 3>you get knocked off track,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best thing that can happen to</v>

1876
01:26:07.821 --> 01:26:12.821
<v Speaker 3>you in general because generally the </v>
<v Speaker 3>track you're on has been set for you by </v>

1877
01:26:12.821 --> 01:26:15.630
<v Speaker 3>people who never got off their track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You end up,</v>

1878
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:18.890
<v Speaker 3>you end up the child of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to have you in their twenties,</v>

1879
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:20.450
<v Speaker 3>21,</v>
<v Speaker 3>22.</v>

1880
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:22.070
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to know a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1881
01:26:22.071 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe that much unless they were like</v>

1882
01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:29.510
<v Speaker 3>came from a really good family of artist</v>
<v Speaker 3>are intelligent people.</v>

1883
01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:32.150
<v Speaker 3>Chances are they're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hungry,</v>

1884
01:26:32.151 --> 01:26:33.500
<v Speaker 3>desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry.</v>

1885
01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:35.840
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship anymore.</v>

1886
01:26:35.841 --> 01:26:37.550
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be monogamous </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1887
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 3>The idea of non monogamy to them might </v>
<v Speaker 3>just seem insane.</v>

1888
01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Like who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're born into that planet.</v>

1889
01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the atmosphere you're born into.</v>

1890
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.260
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're breathing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>first born and that can set you on a </v>

1891
01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.230
<v Speaker 3>weird path and that's a very sad path </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can get on.</v>

1892
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:59.470
<v Speaker 3>And so hopefully if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll come across somebody who knocks </v>

1893
01:26:59.470 --> 01:26:59.740
<v Speaker 3>you off that fucking path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1894
01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:01.490
<v Speaker 3>I remember the guy who hooked me up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>acid.</v>

1895
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I remember sitting in the theater of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>school because I was taking.</v>

<v Speaker 3>designed,</v>

1915
01:28:01.691 --> 01:28:06.691
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the name is always a reference to </v>

1916
01:28:06.691 --> 01:28:07.360
<v Speaker 3>usually as a reference to the design on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sheet.</v>

1917
01:28:07.361 --> 01:28:08.020
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

<v Speaker 3>White Blotter of lips,</v>

1920
01:28:11.981 --> 01:28:16.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a million different names for </v>

1921
01:28:16.981 --> 01:28:16.981
<v Speaker 3>the different types of acid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1922
01:28:16.981 --> 01:28:17.650
<v Speaker 3>so this is just white unit is what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1923
01:28:17.651 --> 01:28:22.651
<v Speaker 3>but it was really good and I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember I took it and you have to,</v>

1924
01:28:23.711 --> 01:28:28.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes 30 to 45 minutes sometimes </v>

1925
01:28:28.711 --> 01:28:28.711
<v Speaker 3>longer for it to kick in.</v>

1926
01:28:28.711 --> 01:28:31.710
<v Speaker 3>I still remember I was sitting in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend's trailer in a trailer park in </v>

1927
01:28:31.710 --> 01:28:34.740
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina sitting in an empty </v>
<v Speaker 3>bathtub,</v>

1928
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.950
<v Speaker 3>like when it like an empty Jacuzzi tub </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was in this trailer and I'm sitting</v>

1929
01:28:38.951 --> 01:28:43.210
<v Speaker 3>there and they're watching star wars and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting in this bathtub and all of a</v>

1930
01:28:43.211 --> 01:28:48.211
<v Speaker 3>sudden the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the greatest feeling just started </v>

1931
01:28:48.211 --> 01:28:52.270
<v Speaker 3>going through my legs and up into my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body and it was a fucking sword fight.</v>

1932
01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:56.050
<v Speaker 3>It was a light Saber fight when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to that.</v>

1933
01:28:56.051 --> 01:28:58.450
<v Speaker 3>But all of a sudden now the sounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>echoey,</v>

1934
01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.610
<v Speaker 3>like someone's turned an echo up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

1935
01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well my parents kind of bouncing around.</v>

1936
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:07.140
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful and I feel so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1937
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems so funny.</v>

1938
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Then I went outside and lay in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grass.</v>

1939
01:29:11.671 --> 01:29:15.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm staring at the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's beautiful trails.</v>

1940
01:29:15.661 --> 01:29:20.661
<v Speaker 3>You put your hand in front of your face </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just this rainbow of hands </v>

1941
01:29:20.661 --> 01:29:21.360
<v Speaker 3>drifting in front of your face.</v>

1942
01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Everything's breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then my friends come running out because</v>

1943
01:29:24.961 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 3>they knew this is the first time I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>tripping and they all start jumping over</v>

1944
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:33.201
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like jumping over me as I'm </v>

1945
01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:33.990
<v Speaker 3>laying there and they're laughing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all fucking laughing and it's just</v>

1946
01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:39.050
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I remember they pulled their cock </v>

1947
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:40.380
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when they pulled that.</v>

1948
01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Y'all started talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We fucked and fucked and then a dog came</v>

1949
01:29:45.571 --> 01:29:48.780
<v Speaker 3>by and we grabbed the dog and started </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking the dog.</v>

1950
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1951
01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.390
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was beautiful.</v>

1952
01:29:51.710 --> 01:29:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Spirit of acid is very now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1953
01:29:53.671 --> 01:29:57.000
<v Speaker 3>There was no fucking happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of like laughing.</v>

1954
01:29:57.510 --> 01:30:02.510
<v Speaker 3>I remember going into my friend Shitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>high school car in like sitting in,</v>

1955
01:30:02.761 --> 01:30:07.761
<v Speaker 3>like pulling the seat back and looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the ceiling and I'm looking at the </v>

1956
01:30:07.761 --> 01:30:11.940
<v Speaker 3>ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics </v>
<v Speaker 3>or some kind of like ancient writing,</v>

1957
01:30:11.941 --> 01:30:16.941
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think I knew what Sanskrit </v>

1958
01:30:16.941 --> 01:30:16.941
<v Speaker 3>was at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I probably be like,</v>

1959
01:30:16.941 --> 01:30:16.941
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing Sanskrit.</v>

1960
01:30:16.941 --> 01:30:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Some kind of runes are glyphs all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend's car that she's kind of </v>

1961
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:24.780
<v Speaker 3>breathing and warping and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

1962
01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:26.430
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the,</v>

1963
01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:29.550
<v Speaker 3>that was the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you've had that experience,</v>

1964
01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 3>how do you go back to a world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A normal kind of world?</v>

1965
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:35.270
<v Speaker 5>First time I ever did acid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

1966
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:37.380
<v Speaker 5>I've told you this before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I met Kurt cobain.</v>

1967
01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:38.430
<v Speaker 5>How crazy was that?</v>

1968
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1969
01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:40.520
<v Speaker 3>The story</v>

1970
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:43.910
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I died this night by the way.</v>

1971
01:30:43.911 --> 01:30:48.911
<v Speaker 5>I have just been very that no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this is what made me think of a </v>

1972
01:30:48.911 --> 01:30:49.820
<v Speaker 5>theory that like every time you die you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know that you die,</v>

1973
01:30:49.821 --> 01:30:53.670
<v Speaker 5>but then you left this road and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 5>else in this other parallel road,</v>

1974
01:30:53.690 --> 01:30:54.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they think you die.</v>

1975
01:30:54.921 --> 01:30:59.180
<v Speaker 5>Like you know the funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is where I thought this was the</v>

1976
01:30:59.181 --> 01:31:01.220
<v Speaker 5>first time I did ask that me and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend at the time,</v>

1977
01:31:01.221 --> 01:31:03.530
<v Speaker 5>that was Marissa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We went to go see.</v>

1978
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:09.100
<v Speaker 5>We went to go see nirvana and she had an</v>
<v Speaker 5>acid and I,</v>

1979
01:31:09.101 --> 01:31:10.400
<v Speaker 5>I've never done acid before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>

1980
01:31:10.401 --> 01:31:14.570
<v Speaker 5>let's do acid and cedar vinyl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we took acid and the opening band was</v>

1981
01:31:14.571 --> 01:31:19.571
<v Speaker 5>on which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is some Asian band that just </v>

1982
01:31:19.571 --> 01:31:19.571
<v Speaker 5>screamed the whole time and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1983
01:31:19.571 --> 01:31:20.630
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of like annoying.</v>

1984
01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:26.180
<v Speaker 5>So I was sitting next to the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>stage and Kurt cobain comes around the </v>

1985
01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:29.891
<v Speaker 5>corner and just comes out and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>really dark so no one could see it and </v>

1986
01:31:29.891 --> 01:31:29.960
<v Speaker 5>he's just standing right next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look over,</v>

1987
01:31:29.961 --> 01:31:31.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my fucking God,</v>

1988
01:31:31.191 --> 01:31:32.780
<v Speaker 5>it's Kurt cobain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

1989
01:31:32.781 --> 01:31:33.380
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up?</v>

1990
01:31:33.381 --> 01:31:33.920
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1991
01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:37.190
<v Speaker 5>you weren't cheeto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he held out his bag and I'm like,</v>

1992
01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:42.191
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I held on the cheeto and then </v>

1993
01:31:42.191 --> 01:31:42.191
<v Speaker 5>suddenly he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody goes,</v>

1994
01:31:42.191 --> 01:31:45.821
<v Speaker 5>oh Kurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he just like throws all the </v>

1995
01:31:45.821 --> 01:31:45.821
<v Speaker 5>cheetos out in the crowd and then it </v>
<v Speaker 5>returns back backstage.</v>

1996
01:31:45.821 --> 01:31:48.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm holding this cheeto and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the cheetos and the crowd,</v>

1997
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:49.930
<v Speaker 5>get a bag of cheetos that he was eating </v>
<v Speaker 5>for him.</v>

1998
01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:52.790
<v Speaker 5>He just threw it at the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just threw cheetos everywhere.</v>

1999
01:31:52.810 --> 01:31:55.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is like a mosh pit in Dayton,</v>

2000
01:31:55.731 --> 01:31:58.250
<v Speaker 5>Ohio side of the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a rock club,</v>

2001
01:31:58.251 --> 01:31:59.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harry arena,</v>

2002
01:31:59.501 --> 01:32:00.030
<v Speaker 5>I think it was</v>

2003
01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:02.590
<v Speaker 4>a fucking video of Dana white getting in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mosh pit.</v>

2004
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:09.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went into a rage rage against the </v>

2005
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.350
<v Speaker 4>machine concert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker got into mosh pit.</v>

2006
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:12.020
<v Speaker 4>She got security guards looking out for </v>
<v Speaker 4>him and he jumped to the mosque.</v>

2007
01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:17.270
<v Speaker 3>So I took this cheeto and I put it in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>pocket.</v>

2008
01:32:17.271 --> 01:32:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to save this Cheeto,</v>

2009
01:32:19.231 --> 01:32:24.231
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I start tripping really hard </v>

2010
01:32:24.231 --> 01:32:24.720
<v Speaker 3>and had an amazing concert on the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

2011
01:32:24.721 --> 01:32:29.721
<v Speaker 3>We're driving and we go by in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving it and this is a </v>

2012
01:32:29.721 --> 01:32:29.721
<v Speaker 3>thunderstorm of rain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still tripping,</v>

2013
01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:34.730
<v Speaker 3>tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tripping on acid as responsible </v>

2014
01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:34.770
<v Speaker 3>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this is even better.</v>

2015
01:32:34.771 --> 01:32:36.480
<v Speaker 3>And I swear to God that you could ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

2016
01:32:36.481 --> 01:32:41.481
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna say who she is on here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we started fucking while I was </v>

2017
01:32:41.481 --> 01:32:44.500
<v Speaker 3>driving in the rain storm on asset for </v>
<v Speaker 3>my first time fucking.</v>

2018
01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:46.470
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I think I died the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time,</v>

2019
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:50.130
<v Speaker 3>one of the first times I died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be you guys</v>

2020
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:55.530
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that a theory that you said to me </v>

2021
01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:55.530
<v Speaker 4>once?</v>

2022
01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the idea that when you die,</v>

2023
01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2024
01:32:56.351 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 3>you're the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've said that before.</v>

2025
01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:32:58.540 --> 01:32:59.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a car.</v>

2027
01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a multiverse idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is you're a fucking.</v>

2028
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:04.180
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your eternal being,</v>

2029
01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.460
<v Speaker 3>you are an eternal being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body is a frequent.</v>

2030
01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:09.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like a radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the tunes you in.</v>

2031
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Tune into your specific personality in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the moment you die,</v>

2032
01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.930
<v Speaker 3>that radio frequency pops into something</v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

2033
01:33:17.670 --> 01:33:19.810
<v Speaker 3>So there's no death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no you're not.</v>

2034
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you die and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing there.</v>

2035
01:33:22.611 --> 01:33:27.611
<v Speaker 3>Empty emptiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like you die and you're </v>

2036
01:33:27.611 --> 01:33:27.611
<v Speaker 3>born as a baby and get to start over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2037
01:33:27.611 --> 01:33:31.441
<v Speaker 3>It's like something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're driving down the street and </v>

2038
01:33:31.441 --> 01:33:31.441
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2039
01:33:31.441 --> 01:33:34.741
<v Speaker 3>why is that guy in my?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden you open your </v>

2040
01:33:34.741 --> 01:33:35.920
<v Speaker 3>eyes and you're going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to work.</v>

2041
01:33:35.921 --> 01:33:37.030
<v Speaker 3>And like man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a weird dream.</v>

2042
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.660
<v Speaker 3>And then you start that life again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes on forever like that,</v>

2043
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:45.990
<v Speaker 4>that the horrible idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially horrible to bring it up to </v>

2044
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:49.471
<v Speaker 4>anybody who's had poor fortune in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>life is to somehow or another connected </v>

2045
01:33:49.471 --> 01:33:50.440
<v Speaker 4>with past lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2046
01:33:50.441 --> 01:33:51.850
<v Speaker 4>when you've ever heard someone say that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2047
01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must have been a real fuck head in </v>

2048
01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:56.880
<v Speaker 4>his past life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2049
01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:56.880
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2050
01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.820
<v Speaker 4>what are you real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you sure?</v>

2051
01:33:58.730 --> 01:34:02.110
<v Speaker 4>You sure could it just not be a roll of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dice?</v>

2052
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.320
<v Speaker 4>And maybe part of your Karma is </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognizing that.</v>

2053
01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:06.380
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2054
01:34:06.381 --> 01:34:07.810
<v Speaker 3>that's why I like the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2055
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:12.620
<v Speaker 3>a Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddha said,</v>

2056
01:34:12.621 --> 01:34:14.960
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think about the afterlife so much.</v>

2057
01:34:14.961 --> 01:34:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I think even Christ said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the god of the living,</v>

2058
01:34:17.421 --> 01:34:20.950
<v Speaker 3>not the god of the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea being that with a voice,</v>

2059
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:27.790
<v Speaker 3>it's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think real spiritual masters always </v>

2060
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:29.240
<v Speaker 3>tend to try to bring people back into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the present moment because it's like,</v>

2061
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:31.370
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The president has everything.</v>

2062
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:35.480
<v Speaker 3>I know when Shit goes wrong in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know why it went wrong.</v>

2063
01:34:35.481 --> 01:34:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to go back to when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fryer in the 18 hundreds and like fisted</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know none.</v>

2065
01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.210
<v Speaker 3>I know that if shit's going wrong right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2066
01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:46.940
<v Speaker 3>generally it's like because I'm fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>up now.</v>

2067
01:34:47.230 --> 01:34:50.900
<v Speaker 3>It's good for and people can get lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can start blaming their,</v>

2068
01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:54.120
<v Speaker 3>their Karma or where they're at right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2069
01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm past lives and it puts him in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>place of stupid hopelessness and they </v>

2070
01:34:59.130 --> 01:35:00.590
<v Speaker 3>don't do the things they need to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now to get to a better place.</v>

2071
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Praise Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Praise the Lord because I hear so many </v>

2072
01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:06.050
<v Speaker 3>fucking say his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many simple things you could do,</v>

2073
01:35:06.051 --> 01:35:06.980
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you at.</v>

2074
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Here's what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my new theory.</v>

2075
01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:14.650
<v Speaker 3>Identify the vampire in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find the vampire,</v>

2076
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:20.290
<v Speaker 3>identify the parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be that you have </v>

2077
01:35:20.290 --> 01:35:20.290
<v Speaker 3>parasites in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is possible.</v>

2078
01:35:20.290 --> 01:35:23.320
<v Speaker 3>You could have gotten lucky and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no parasites and you get off groovy.</v>

2079
01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2080
01:35:23.871 --> 01:35:26.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying everyone's got one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you got one,</v>

2081
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:31.310
<v Speaker 3>if you're walking around with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking vampire blues,</v>

2082
01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:35.570
<v Speaker 3>you've got the fucking heavy heart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't feel happy and you feel bad.</v>

2083
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
<v Speaker 3>There may be an action that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take that you're afraid to take.</v>

2084
01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:45.020
<v Speaker 3>That's the vampire and you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking not even a person.</v>

2085
01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a situation.</v>

2086
01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:53.300
<v Speaker 3>A vampire in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find a life sucking situation that </v>

2087
01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:57.431
<v Speaker 3>you're afraid to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I say vampires because </v>

2088
01:35:57.431 --> 01:36:00.610
<v Speaker 3>vampire is only go where they're invited</v>
<v Speaker 3>and generally the situation that you're </v>

2089
01:36:00.610 --> 01:36:01.100
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you invited it in,</v>

2090
01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:05.330
<v Speaker 3>you invited this thing into your life </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now it's sucking your life energy in</v>

2091
01:36:05.331 --> 01:36:09.360
<v Speaker 3>your blood and your happiness away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't it needs.</v>

2092
01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:14.560
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times you'll try to believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll try to convince yourself that </v>

2093
01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.800
<v Speaker 3>this thing is not a vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in your heart,</v>

2094
01:36:15.801 --> 01:36:20.801
<v Speaker 3>you know you're a servant to a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodsucker urn felt this thing is like </v>

2095
01:36:21.171 --> 01:36:25.610
<v Speaker 3>sucking your life as it's away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's doing it with a trade.</v>

2096
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Quite often there'll be a bad trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be,</v>

2097
01:36:28.461 --> 01:36:33.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the situation you're in and </v>

2098
01:36:33.461 --> 01:36:33.461
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>

2099
01:36:33.461 --> 01:36:35.611
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll feel like you're in this </v>

2100
01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:35.611
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

2101
01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:35.611
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth it.</v>

2102
01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:35.611
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's totally worth it.</v>

2103
01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:37.760
<v Speaker 3>This happens with jobs quite often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2104
01:36:37.761 --> 01:36:38.300
<v Speaker 3>or you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2105
01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:40.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's good enough.</v>

2106
01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:45.770
<v Speaker 3>That's the vampire you gotta take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking stake and drive it into.</v>

2107
01:36:45.771 --> 01:36:47.090
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you kill a vampire?</v>

2108
01:36:47.091 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Direct Action.</v>

2109
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 3>You don't kill a vampire by like making </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with a vampire.</v>

2110
01:36:51.441 --> 01:36:54.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't kill a vampire by like having </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sit down and talk with a vampire.</v>

2111
01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.500
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be able to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2112
01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 3>make friends with the vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two ways to kill a vampire.</v>

2113
01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:04.160
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking put a stake in its heart.</v>

2114
01:37:04.161 --> 01:37:06.200
<v Speaker 3>The other one is light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sunlight,</v>

2115
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:08.030
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>

2116
01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:10.010
<v Speaker 3>That is the greatest metaphor of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2117
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:14.120
<v Speaker 3>You shine the light of truth onto the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

2118
01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:18.020
<v Speaker 3>fearlessly analyze it and then you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy it.</v>

2119
01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you really allow yourself,</v>

2120
01:37:19.761 --> 01:37:24.761
<v Speaker 3>if you could act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta add the real problem with </v>

2121
01:37:24.761 --> 01:37:24.761
<v Speaker 3>people is not recognizing the enemy.</v>

2122
01:37:24.761 --> 01:37:26.780
<v Speaker 3>It's acting on that enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the real problem,</v>

2123
01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.680
<v Speaker 3>and that enemy being personal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your personal demons,</v>

2124
01:37:30.681 --> 01:37:33.950
<v Speaker 3>your your personal jihad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a personal issue.</v>

2125
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:36.580
<v Speaker 3>You got to fight the beast and it's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end.</v>

2126
01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.520
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everybody's beast.</v>

2127
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chapter two of the Bhagavad Gita,</v>

2128
01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Arginine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dejection.</v>

2129
01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Arginine has drawn between these two </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces.</v>

2130
01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:49.190
<v Speaker 3>He does not want to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He drops his bow and God says to him,</v>

2131
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:52.100
<v Speaker 3>you've got to rise to the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight.</v>

2132
01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:54.410
<v Speaker 3>You're a warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what you're here for.</v>

2133
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

2134
01:37:56.011 --> 01:37:57.720
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better to die.</v>

2135
01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.900
<v Speaker 3>It's better to die in a righteous </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>

2136
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:02.730
<v Speaker 3>Then goes skulking off into the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>woods and be a beggar.</v>

2137
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:06.750
<v Speaker 3>It's better to fucking do what you do on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your award or you got to fucking do it.</v>

2138
01:38:06.751 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It fucking sucks.</v>

2139
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:13.490
<v Speaker 3>When you're drunk and you want to throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and you try to not make yourself </v>

2140
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:14.790
<v Speaker 3>throw up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just throw up.</v>

2141
01:38:14.970 --> 01:38:19.970
<v Speaker 3>You'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll feel better in the end when </v>

2142
01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:22.491
<v Speaker 3>you're puking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna suck because you're helpless </v>

2143
01:38:22.491 --> 01:38:22.491
<v Speaker 3>and you can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go through it,</v>

2144
01:38:22.491 --> 01:38:26.001
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking jab a fucking knife into the </v>

2145
01:38:26.001 --> 01:38:26.001
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Literally of course,</v>

2146
01:38:26.001 --> 01:38:30.140
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to act and you got to make the </v>

2147
01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:30.140
<v Speaker 3>big fucking decisions sometimes and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>

2148
01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:31.800
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't scary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be worth anything.</v>

2149
01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:37.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For some people it's almost like they </v>

2150
01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.231
<v Speaker 6>don't know how to start.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They know that there's action that they </v>

2151
01:38:39.231 --> 01:38:42.951
<v Speaker 6>need to take in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're paralyzed trying to think </v>

2152
01:38:42.951 --> 01:38:45.501
<v Speaker 6>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to figure out how to start and </v>

2153
01:38:45.501 --> 01:38:45.501
<v Speaker 6>they can never gather up the courage to </v>
<v Speaker 6>get away.</v>

2154
01:38:45.501 --> 01:38:47.730
<v Speaker 6>It's like a lot of people stay in </v>
<v Speaker 6>abusive relationships.</v>

2155
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:49.140
<v Speaker 6>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't have the courage to lead</v>

2156
01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:52.270
<v Speaker 3>exactly because it's scary and it and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it seems like it,</v>

2157
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many things that people will,</v>

2158
01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:56.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas people will create.</v>

2159
01:38:56.241 --> 01:38:58.240
<v Speaker 3>They'll keep you trapped and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prison,</v>

2160
01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.610
<v Speaker 3>urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar to and not.</v>

2161
01:39:01.611 --> 01:39:05.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean what you're talking about in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC with these fucking fighters,</v>

2162
01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:09.170
<v Speaker 3>this is a visual representation of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone can do in their life,</v>

2163
01:39:09.171 --> 01:39:11.210
<v Speaker 3>but you're not getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not all of us are going to get,</v>

2164
01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:16.240
<v Speaker 3>obviously be world class fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inner ring in front of the entire </v>

2165

<v Speaker 3>planet and fucking knock someone out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have in your life right now,</v>

2166
01:39:20.931 --> 01:39:22.400
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't already done this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>

2167
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:27.430
<v Speaker 3>You have the chance to be heroic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the ability right now to make a</v>

2168
01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:29.870
<v Speaker 3>heroic act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could kill you.</v>

2169
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:31.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These actions,</v>

2170
01:39:31.821 --> 01:39:34.130
<v Speaker 3>it's not always guaranteed that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do the right thing,</v>

2171
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:36.230
<v Speaker 3>you're going to end up in a great place.</v>

2172
01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.600
<v Speaker 3>You might end up fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might end up,</v>

2173
01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:42.710
<v Speaker 3>you might end up temporarily in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless or you might end up temporarily</v>

2174
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:45.810
<v Speaker 3>jobless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there wasn't risk associated with it,</v>

2175
01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.410
<v Speaker 3>you would have already done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the point.</v>

2176
01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:53.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there wasn't a risk associated with </v>

2177
01:39:53.710 --> 01:39:53.710
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be worth anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2178
01:39:53.710 --> 01:39:56.780
<v Speaker 3>if Mount fucking Himalaya is we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2179
01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.750
<v Speaker 3>a little green grass covered hill and </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart,</v>

2180
01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.390
<v Speaker 3>nobody takes pictures of them at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>

2181
01:40:02.391 --> 01:40:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Putting a flag into what is the danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes it heroic,</v>

2182
01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:08.300
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes you just have to fucking.</v>

2183
01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.550
<v Speaker 3>I sound like Tony Robbins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take the leap.</v>

2184
01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Kill the vampire in your life.</v>

2185
01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:14.410
<v Speaker 6>Kill the vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll have is a brilliant speech.</v>

2186
01:40:14.411 --> 01:40:15.090
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

2187
01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:15.940
<v Speaker 6>you're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2188
01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:21.300
<v Speaker 6>I thought I stopped it because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not everybody has a bad person in your </v>

2189
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:21.300
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't know that.</v>

2190
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.110
<v Speaker 6>That's where your main,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's you're absolutely dead.</v>

2191
01:40:23.111 --> 01:40:24.130
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2192
01:40:24.131 --> 01:40:24.810
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2193
01:40:24.811 --> 01:40:29.811
<v Speaker 6>I always say that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the energy vampires that you have in </v>

2194
01:40:29.811 --> 01:40:31.210
<v Speaker 6>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you really your number one enemy?</v>

2195
01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:33.640
<v Speaker 6>They keep you from enjoying good times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2196
01:40:33.641 --> 01:40:33.980
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

2197
01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:36.270
<v Speaker 6>everybody knows I one person will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you settle down.</v>

2198
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.390
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2199
01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:42.540
<v Speaker 6>finally I can fucking relax.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you turn on the television and then </v>

2200
01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:45.370
<v Speaker 6>someone for whatever fucking reason will</v>
<v Speaker 6>decide that they have to talk to you now</v>

2201
01:40:45.610 --> 01:40:47.740
<v Speaker 6>and they want to get angry at you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you know,</v>

2202
01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:50.080
<v Speaker 6>it could be a guy or girl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoever the fuck it is,</v>

2203
01:40:50.081 --> 01:40:55.081
<v Speaker 6>it's one person that wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to have power over you or </v>

2204
01:40:55.081 --> 01:40:55.900
<v Speaker 6>another and they want to stop you from </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing what you want to do.</v>

2205
01:40:56.170 --> 01:41:01.170
<v Speaker 6>Like there are people that have issues </v>
<v Speaker 6>in relationships because one of the </v>

2206
01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:04.171
<v Speaker 6>persons and then one of the people in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the relationship has some sort of a </v>

2207
01:41:04.171 --> 01:41:07.411
<v Speaker 6>transparent issue with the other person </v>
<v Speaker 6>and what they try to do is they try to </v>

2208
01:41:07.411 --> 01:41:08.620
<v Speaker 6>control that person from doing things </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they want to do.</v>

2209
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.800
<v Speaker 6>Anytime the guy wants to go play,</v>
<v Speaker 6>play a basketball or something like </v>

2210
01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:18.331
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they come up with a reason why now is </v>

2211
01:41:18.331 --> 01:41:18.331
<v Speaker 6>the time I would really like you to take</v>
<v Speaker 6>me shopping.</v>

2212
01:41:18.331 --> 01:41:21.961
<v Speaker 6>Or now it's time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like they want to see if </v>

2213
01:41:21.961 --> 01:41:22.720
<v Speaker 6>they can drag you away from the thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you like to do,</v>

2214
01:41:22.721 --> 01:41:26.320
<v Speaker 6>thus proving that they're the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>important thing in your life.</v>

2215
01:41:26.710 --> 01:41:28.870
<v Speaker 6>And you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's fucking sad.</v>

2216
01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:29.710
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what it is.</v>

2217
01:41:29.711 --> 01:41:34.711
<v Speaker 6>It's instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is how girls behave if you don't </v>

2218
01:41:34.711 --> 01:41:34.840
<v Speaker 6>keep the pimp hand strong and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact.</v>

2219
01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:39.930
<v Speaker 6>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only reason why girls get away with </v>

2220
01:41:39.930 --> 01:41:40.060
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that is because guys let them</v>
<v Speaker 6>get away with it.</v>

2221
01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:41.210
<v Speaker 6>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2222
01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.620
<v Speaker 6>the real issue with guys being douche </v>
<v Speaker 6>bags to girls of course,</v>

2223
01:41:44.621 --> 01:41:46.990
<v Speaker 6>is the physical violence issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not fair.</v>

2224
01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:52.140
<v Speaker 6>It's not fair if you're fucking two </v>
<v Speaker 6>chicks getting into fight with each </v>

2225
01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:52.140
<v Speaker 6>other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2226
01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:54.100
<v Speaker 6>two lesbians and you basically the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>size,</v>

2227
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2228
01:41:54.821 --> 01:41:56.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want you to fight,</v>

2229
01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.210
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why you're fighting,</v>

2230
01:41:58.211 --> 01:42:01.300
<v Speaker 6>but hopefully you got a good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's not a mugging.</v>

2231
01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:06.330
<v Speaker 6>It's not a man beating up a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're so physical fights are </v>

2232
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:06.690
<v Speaker 6>completely out of the question either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2233
01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.740
<v Speaker 6>and then what else is left?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What else is left?</v>

2234
01:42:08.741 --> 01:42:10.930
<v Speaker 6>Trying to explain each other to each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other,</v>

2235
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:12.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>arguing with each other,</v>

2236
01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:17.940
<v Speaker 6>trying to piece it all together would </v>
<v Speaker 6>not understanding their side at all.</v>

2237
01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:20.080
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

2238
01:42:20.081 --> 01:42:21.910
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we certainly have to protect people from</v>

2239
01:42:21.911 --> 01:42:23.800
<v Speaker 6>that kind of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2240
01:42:24.190 --> 01:42:25.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>

2241
01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2242
01:42:26.530 --> 01:42:31.240
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the ways that we know that</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's some sort of a,</v>

2243
01:42:31.241 --> 01:42:36.241
<v Speaker 6>a weird disconnect between what we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>capable of and the way we currently </v>

2244
01:42:36.241 --> 01:42:39.760
<v Speaker 6>behave like as a human race.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fact that it's even possible that we</v>

2245
01:42:39.761 --> 01:42:42.070
<v Speaker 6>have a real issue with men beating the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck out of women.</v>

2246
01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:45.550
<v Speaker 6>Like that's a real issue when women who </v>
<v Speaker 6>get in relationships and get beat up.</v>

2247
01:42:45.850 --> 01:42:48.280
<v Speaker 6>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's terrifying.</v>

2248
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:50.790
<v Speaker 6>That's scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2249
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:53.140
<v Speaker 6>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a girl that I dated when I was in</v>

2250
01:42:53.141 --> 01:42:56.120
<v Speaker 6>high school and she was really crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was just,</v>

2251
01:42:56.150 --> 01:42:56.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

2252
01:42:57.150 --> 01:43:00.650
<v Speaker 6>she had like super strict Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 6>parents and she,</v>

2253
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:03.370
<v Speaker 6>she was really pretty and she was just </v>
<v Speaker 6>nuts,</v>

2254
01:43:03.371 --> 01:43:04.900
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we,</v>

2255
01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:07.090
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we didn't see each other for years.</v>

2256
01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:11.220
<v Speaker 6>And then one time I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at this might not even been years,</v>

2257
01:43:11.230 --> 01:43:12.760
<v Speaker 6>maybe eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might be exaggerating,</v>

2258
01:43:12.850 --> 01:43:15.010
<v Speaker 6>but I hadn't seen her in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you're 17 years old,</v>

2259
01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:17.320
<v Speaker 6>six months might as well be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

2260
01:43:17.321 --> 01:43:19.010
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>things are accelerating.</v>

2261
01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:22.030
<v Speaker 6>Either graduated from high school and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

2262
01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:27.260
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I met her and she was telling me </v>

2263
01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:27.820
<v Speaker 6>that she had this new boyfriend that hit</v>
<v Speaker 6>her and that she liked.</v>

2264
01:43:27.821 --> 01:43:31.990
<v Speaker 6>It was the craziest conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

2265
01:43:31.991 --> 01:43:33.130
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And first of all,</v>

2266
01:43:33.131 --> 01:43:38.131
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thank God I never hit her because what </v>

2267
01:43:38.131 --> 01:43:38.131
<v Speaker 6>have I liked it too?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if you know you,</v>

2268
01:43:38.131 --> 01:43:42.641
<v Speaker 6>you know what if you date a girl and she</v>
<v Speaker 6>would totally start fights and totally </v>

2269
01:43:42.641 --> 01:43:46.321
<v Speaker 6>do shit to Piss me off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I never thought you wanted to get </v>

2270
01:43:46.321 --> 01:43:46.321
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well I never,</v>

2271
01:43:46.321 --> 01:43:46.430
<v Speaker 6>you can't hit a girl.</v>

2272
01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:51.520
<v Speaker 6>Just it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's silly face or hit in the vagina to </v>

2273
01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:51.950
<v Speaker 6>get smacked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She'd like to get in the face.</v>

2274
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 6>She'd like to get rocked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2275
01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:59.291
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But she was telling me this </v>

2276
01:43:59.291 --> 01:43:59.291
<v Speaker 6>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2277
01:43:59.291 --> 01:43:59.600
<v Speaker 6>she was not rationalizing or you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about.</v>

2278
01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:01.070
<v Speaker 6>She was being really honest with me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like,</v>

2279
01:44:01.071 --> 01:44:03.350
<v Speaker 6>I'm so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't a dumb girl.</v>

2280
01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:03.590
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2281
01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2282
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:06.110
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Talking about a dude.</v>

2283
01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:11.140
<v Speaker 6>Basically just smacking her around and </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking her like really rough and beat </v>

2284
01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:12.170
<v Speaker 6>her up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some girls actually like that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>injured,</v>

2287
01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:22.450
<v Speaker 6>but they want to get roughed up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to just get hair pulling and </v>

2288

<v Speaker 6>It was like really crazy to hear.</v>

2290
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:26.720
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know what to say.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

2292
01:44:28.611 --> 01:44:29.570

<v Speaker 6>do it because they feel terrible and </v>

2307
01:45:09.341 --> 01:45:11.640

<v Speaker 6>ones that like get drunk and blame it on</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting drunk and that's where they're </v>

2311

<v Speaker 6>it's broken.</v>

2316
01:45:29.711 --> 01:45:31.960
<v Speaker 6>People interact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All could be fixed with mushrooms,</v>

2317
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:37.780
<v Speaker 6>with the Duncan Trussell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shamonic institute of America to correct</v>

<v Speaker 6>That'd be great.</v>

2319
01:45:41.051 --> 01:45:44.350
<v Speaker 6>And the wisdom of the indigenous peoples</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the Amazon rain forest,</v>

2320
01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:47.890
<v Speaker 6>combination of chanting and flashlights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We will.</v>

2321
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fleshlight uses mandatory when </v>

2322
01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 6>you're meditating at my restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I don't want anybody horny.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I don't want like why you're in there </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're,</v>

2324

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're supposed to be doing your alms.</v>

2325
01:45:58.930 --> 01:46:00.220
<v Speaker 6>You're thinking about getting your dick </v>
<v Speaker 6>sucked.</v>

2326
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:01.480
<v Speaker 7>You know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2327
01:46:01.481 --> 01:46:06.481
<v Speaker 7>like the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like what did I read this great </v>

2328
01:46:06.481 --> 01:46:06.910
<v Speaker 7>autobiography of Timothy Leary and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>were talking about,</v>

2329
01:46:06.911 --> 01:46:09.190
<v Speaker 7>I can't remember the name of the famous </v>
<v Speaker 7>house that he lived at,</v>

2330
01:46:09.191 --> 01:46:10.970
<v Speaker 7>but where there were all tripping out </v>
<v Speaker 7>and like,</v>

2331
01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:14.140
<v Speaker 7>while they're constantly taking lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they would do this.</v>

2332
01:46:14.141 --> 01:46:15.520
<v Speaker 7>They were all swingers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there,</v>

2333
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:20.550
<v Speaker 7>there'd be like guys and girls do and </v>
<v Speaker 7>what they was banging guys that were </v>

2334
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.550
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2335
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:21.400
<v Speaker 7>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think so,</v>

2336
01:46:21.401 --> 01:46:22.520
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do know fast,</v>

2337
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:25.030
<v Speaker 7>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2338
01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:28.630
<v Speaker 7>I think Timothy leary's pretty straight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was always dating models and shit.</v>

2339
01:46:28.631 --> 01:46:29.620
<v Speaker 7>Like I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2340
01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:33.040
<v Speaker 7>but that's why America hated him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A bunch of haters.</v>

2341
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:38.310
<v Speaker 7>But what they would do is they would </v>
<v Speaker 7>like have this weird thing because what </v>

2342
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:39.800
<v Speaker 7>they were trying to do is they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 7>to dissolve the react there.</v>

2343
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:45.430
<v Speaker 7>They're trying to dissolve all the </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking ego constructs of which one of </v>

2344
01:46:46.751 --> 01:46:47.690
<v Speaker 7>them is monogamy.</v>

2345
01:46:47.690 --> 01:46:52.690
<v Speaker 7>Monogamy is an ego construct where you </v>
<v Speaker 7>want to be the only person who is </v>

2346
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:58.010
<v Speaker 7>fucking the person that you're with and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you and they want you to be the only </v>

2347
01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:59.330
<v Speaker 7>person to be fucking them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This,</v>

2348
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:03.100
<v Speaker 7>this is basic way that most people enter</v>
<v Speaker 7>into relationships,</v>

2349
01:47:03.170 --> 01:47:07.140
<v Speaker 7>so what these guys would do is they have</v>
<v Speaker 7>married couples and why they would do is</v>

2350
01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:12.320
<v Speaker 7>randomly to people would be picked a man</v>
<v Speaker 7>and a woman to go into this bowling </v>

2351
01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.971
<v Speaker 7>alley that they had and they would stay </v>
<v Speaker 7>there for like three days straight and </v>

2352
01:47:16.971 --> 01:47:19.680
<v Speaker 7>just take acid the whole time and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>would always end up fucking and the.</v>

2353
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:24.830
<v Speaker 7>So is this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there was a lot of babies where </v>

2354
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:26.951
<v Speaker 7>nobody knew who the father was for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That I'm sure that happened all the </v>

2355
01:47:26.951 --> 01:47:26.951
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

2356
01:47:26.951 --> 01:47:31.280
<v Speaker 6>Well that was Mckenna's idea was the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an orgy hastick mushroom cultures that </v>

2357
01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.601
<v Speaker 6>existed in his really think that's kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of a lot of it was his imagination of </v>

2358
01:47:35.601 --> 01:47:40.011
<v Speaker 6>what could have been possible because it</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't seem like you really explain </v>

2359
01:47:40.011 --> 01:47:40.340
<v Speaker 6>exactly what these people were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2360
01:47:40.450 --> 01:47:42.150
<v Speaker 6>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago and chuck a towel.</v>

2361
01:47:42.151 --> 01:47:44.930
<v Speaker 6>He yoke and all these different places.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he had this idea that this,</v>

2362
01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:50.210
<v Speaker 6>the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They developed this sort of a orgiastic </v>

2363
01:47:50.210 --> 01:47:51.150
<v Speaker 6>mushroom style of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of living.</v>

2364
01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:53.010
<v Speaker 6>And then people would get together and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they would just come,</v>

2365
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:54.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they would raise each others kids,</v>

2366
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:58.500
<v Speaker 6>they would all have it all be loving </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other at all,</v>

2367
01:47:58.890 --> 01:48:00.150
<v Speaker 6>taking care of each other's kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2368
01:48:00.151 --> 01:48:01.440
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's kind of trippy.</v>

2369
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.230
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes me think like,</v>

2370
01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:06.220
<v Speaker 6>could you live in a world like that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if it,</v>

2371
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:11.190
<v Speaker 6>if that we all are just automatically </v>
<v Speaker 6>possessive of our loved ones,</v>

2372
01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:12.560
<v Speaker 6>our sexual partners.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2373
01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 6>your wives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boyfriends and husbands was terrible.</v>

2374
01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:17.220
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well yeah it does.</v>

2375
01:48:17.221 --> 01:48:21.090
<v Speaker 6>But it also feels great when you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other to count on and you have this</v>

2376
01:48:21.091 --> 01:48:23.280
<v Speaker 6>really cool relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know each other.</v>

2377
01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:25.960
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the idea that someone like,</v>

2378
01:48:26.130 --> 01:48:27.870
<v Speaker 6>like you're connected,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you,</v>

2379
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:32.910
<v Speaker 6>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not even allowed to touch and </v>

2380
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.910
<v Speaker 6>other body like everyone else is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get away,</v>

2381
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.910
<v Speaker 6>get away,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get away,</v>

2382
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:33.240
<v Speaker 6>get away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're connected,</v>

2383
01:48:33.241 --> 01:48:35.160
<v Speaker 6>you're connected to the one you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>connected to.</v>

2384
01:48:35.161 --> 01:48:35.880
<v Speaker 6>The one thing</v>

2385
01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:36.810
<v Speaker 7>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2386
01:48:36.811 --> 01:48:38.330
<v Speaker 7>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's strange.</v>

2387
01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 7>That feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that inspires.</v>

2388
01:48:40.171 --> 01:48:43.020
<v Speaker 7>That is not a loving feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a fucking.</v>

2389
01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:44.320
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2390
01:48:44.321 --> 01:48:47.380
<v Speaker 6>It's because men and women have </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely different wiring.</v>

2391
01:48:47.381 --> 01:48:49.450
<v Speaker 6>And for a lot of women and not all of </v>
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>

2392
01:48:49.451 --> 01:48:51.910
<v Speaker 6>some women just want dick all around </v>
<v Speaker 6>every corner,</v>

2393
01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:54.100
<v Speaker 6>some women.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's their prerogative man.</v>

2394
01:48:54.101 --> 01:48:56.650
<v Speaker 6>If you're young and hot and you want </v>
<v Speaker 6>Dick around every corner,</v>

2395
01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:57.670
<v Speaker 6>you should be able to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2396
01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.160
<v Speaker 6>what does that bad when it's only good </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you fucker.</v>

2397
01:49:00.190 --> 01:49:01.120
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are.</v>

2398
01:49:01.150 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 6>People are God damn crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There really are like there's a fucking </v>

2399
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 6>whore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If she was fucking you,</v>

2400
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:06.760
<v Speaker 6>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh God.</v>

2401
01:49:06.761 --> 01:49:09.670
<v Speaker 6>So lucky dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We had one smile and she goes,</v>

2402
01:49:09.671 --> 01:49:10.680
<v Speaker 6>you want to come up to my room?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2403
01:49:10.690 --> 01:49:11.640
<v Speaker 6>showed us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2404
01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.560
<v Speaker 6>like how come when you score?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's awesome.</v>

2405
01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:17.560
<v Speaker 6>And when she scores with other dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's a fucking.</v>

2406
01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.150
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell,</v>

2407
01:49:19.151 --> 01:49:19.560
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you</v>

2408
01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:24.580
<v Speaker 7>why.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The reason that is is because our </v>

2409
01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:25.490
<v Speaker 7>descendants were fucking sexually </v>
<v Speaker 7>repressed psychopaths and we still have.</v>

2410
01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:26.880
<v Speaker 7>We still have that in us.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I know there's,</v>

2411
01:49:27.130 --> 01:49:32.130
<v Speaker 6>that's a little of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's also that we know that girls </v>

2412
01:49:32.130 --> 01:49:32.130
<v Speaker 6>that are freaks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a rare thing.</v>

2413
01:49:32.130 --> 01:49:35.701
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like probably a weird combative </v>

2414
01:49:35.701 --> 01:49:35.701
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2415
01:49:35.701 --> 01:49:37.430
<v Speaker 7>Women are getting a really shitty </v>
<v Speaker 7>position where they got to feel bad.</v>

2416
01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.740
<v Speaker 7>If you have a few guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's not fair,</v>

2417
01:49:39.741 --> 01:49:41.540
<v Speaker 7>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I know some of it's genetic,</v>

2418
01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:42.260
<v Speaker 7>but I know</v>

2419
01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:44.260
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every relationship gets stale.</v>

2420
01:49:44.261 --> 01:49:49.261
<v Speaker 6>Taking out the idea of the genetic why </v>
<v Speaker 6>people want men want to reproduce with </v>

2421
01:49:49.261 --> 01:49:52.030
<v Speaker 6>as many women as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even if you didn't have that,</v>

2422
01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:57.090
<v Speaker 6>that instinctive nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's still the idea that being with </v>

2423
01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:57.090
<v Speaker 6>one person will just get stale.</v>

2424
01:49:57.090 --> 01:50:00.700
<v Speaker 7>Imagine this somehow from your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 7>removed.</v>

2425
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.780
<v Speaker 7>All the negative or weird or strange </v>
<v Speaker 7>connotations about sex.</v>

2426
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:09.460
<v Speaker 7>Sex is just the physical experience of </v>
<v Speaker 7>close of oneness with another person,</v>

2427
01:50:09.461 --> 01:50:14.461
<v Speaker 7>so there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nothing from the ice has been putting </v>

2428
01:50:14.461 --> 01:50:17.730
<v Speaker 7>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now imagine eating mushrooms and all of </v>

2429
01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:21.691
<v Speaker 7>a sudden being in the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 7>having sex with a group of people with </v>

2430
01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.650
<v Speaker 7>zero sexual inhibitions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with zero guilt,</v>

2431
01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:31.830
<v Speaker 7>just pure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hedonistic pleasure as you sort of </v>

2432
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:32.100
<v Speaker 7>missed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can be honest</v>

2433
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:37.830
<v Speaker 6>with in terms of like a Utopian society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the way our world runs.</v>

2434
01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:41.310
<v Speaker 6>It's like my thoughts on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have always been,</v>

2435
01:50:41.311 --> 01:50:46.311
<v Speaker 6>and my advice has always been that when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you find someone who you really enjoy </v>

2436
01:50:47.791 --> 01:50:52.140
<v Speaker 6>hanging out with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hang out with them and whatever,</v>

2437
01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:56.820
<v Speaker 6>if you get to a point where you really </v>
<v Speaker 6>trust them and you're really honest with</v>

2438
01:50:56.821 --> 01:50:59.210
<v Speaker 6>each other and you're really enjoying </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other's,</v>

2439
01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:04.340
<v Speaker 6>find out what bothers that person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it was zero genetic thing that </v>

2440
01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:04.410
<v Speaker 6>you have maybe that I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it?</v>

2441
01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:05.170
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2442
01:51:05.171 --> 01:51:06.360
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like me in,</v>

2443
01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:12.060
<v Speaker 6>and if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you could find someone you really </v>

2444
01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:12.060
<v Speaker 6>sync up with and you actually enhance </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other,</v>

2445
01:51:12.090 --> 01:51:13.760
<v Speaker 6>then it relationships are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>beautiful.</v>

2446
01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:19.110
<v Speaker 6>The real problem is most people did not </v>
<v Speaker 6>even in the exploring their own </v>

2447
01:51:19.110 --> 01:51:20.490
<v Speaker 6>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not into exploring their own,</v>

2448
01:51:20.610 --> 01:51:25.610
<v Speaker 6>the origin of their own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're not really into self </v>

2449
01:51:25.610 --> 01:51:28.581
<v Speaker 6>examination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not really into a lot of </v>

2450
01:51:28.581 --> 01:51:30.060
<v Speaker 6>different things that lead to sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>problematic conversations that you have,</v>

2451
01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:35.150
<v Speaker 6>especially when they have a commodity </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the commodity is that there an </v>

2452
01:51:35.150 --> 01:51:39.141
<v Speaker 6>attractive woman and you're in some sort</v>
<v Speaker 6>of a weird situation where there's a </v>

2453
01:51:39.141 --> 01:51:39.300
<v Speaker 6>master,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a master over you.</v>

2454
01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.030
<v Speaker 7>Penta,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it also depends on the,</v>

2455
01:51:41.050 --> 01:51:46.050
<v Speaker 7>the way you get into the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean if you look at the entry </v>

2456
01:51:46.050 --> 01:51:47.650
<v Speaker 7>mechanism into these things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>quite often it's purely based on</v>

2457
01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:48.780
<v Speaker 6>scality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2458
01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:54.260
<v Speaker 6>that's the problem is that the drug of </v>
<v Speaker 6>sex and it's really exciting and </v>

2459
01:51:54.791 --> 01:51:59.791
<v Speaker 6>thrilling to get to the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love you part as quick as possible so </v>

2460
01:51:59.791 --> 01:52:02.260
<v Speaker 6>the sex can get really intense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2461
01:52:02.290 --> 01:52:07.290
<v Speaker 6>And that is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 6>happens when you really love someone </v>

2462
01:52:07.290 --> 01:52:07.290
<v Speaker 6>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could fuck someone that you think is</v>

2463
01:52:07.290 --> 01:52:08.440
<v Speaker 6>hot and it's like a sexual thing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2464
01:52:08.441 --> 01:52:09.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really,</v>

2465
01:52:09.570 --> 01:52:12.760
<v Speaker 6>it's a real big turn on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not like fucking someone that's</v>

2466
01:52:12.761 --> 01:52:13.720
<v Speaker 6>hot that you love.</v>

2467
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:19.350
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that first awesome time when you're </v>

2468
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.350
<v Speaker 7>just getting into a relationship where </v>
<v Speaker 7>the person says,</v>

2469
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:22.090
<v Speaker 7>I think I'm falling in love with you and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've been feeling that.</v>

2470
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:24.780
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit Man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fireworks.</v>

2471
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:27.560
<v Speaker 7>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How</v>

2472
01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:32.100
<v Speaker 6>about for some people they'll look for </v>
<v Speaker 6>an artificial that you know,</v>

2473
01:52:32.101 --> 01:52:34.760
<v Speaker 6>like you can if you get lucky and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually do have that.</v>

2474
01:52:34.761 --> 01:52:36.020
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's so lucky.</v>

2475
01:52:36.021 --> 01:52:41.021
<v Speaker 6>You the stars have to align.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So many people get in situations where </v>

2476
01:52:41.021 --> 01:52:42.380
<v Speaker 6>the person they're with is just a little</v>
<v Speaker 6>off man,</v>

2477
01:52:42.381 --> 01:52:45.070
<v Speaker 6>this whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just a little off ever.</v>

2478
01:52:45.230 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 6>The video that awful.</v>

2479
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:51.400
<v Speaker 7>What I consider to be the most grotesque</v>
<v Speaker 7>experiment of all time where the </v>

2480
01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 7>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They took a monkey,</v>

2481
01:52:52.041 --> 01:52:55.890
<v Speaker 7>a little baby monkey and they gave him a</v>
<v Speaker 7>wire or did either.</v>

2482
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 7>I don't even want to talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 7>disturbs me so much.</v>

2483
01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:02.780
<v Speaker 7>They're covered a fucking like a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>box with for.</v>

2484
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:03.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the fucking things.</v>

2485
01:53:03.921 --> 01:53:05.480
<v Speaker 7>Cleaning to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh See,</v>

2486
01:53:05.481 --> 01:53:06.860
<v Speaker 7>now here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>

2487
01:53:06.861 --> 01:53:11.861
<v Speaker 7>Some people you see that some people </v>
<v Speaker 7>that a lot of people are in that </v>

2488
01:53:11.861 --> 01:53:16.811
<v Speaker 7>relationship where they're cleaning to </v>
<v Speaker 7>something that's not even real and they </v>

2489
01:53:16.811 --> 01:53:20.261
<v Speaker 7>don't even under.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've like trick themselves into </v>

2490
01:53:20.261 --> 01:53:20.261
<v Speaker 7>thinking that</v>

2491
01:53:20.261 --> 01:53:20.261
<v Speaker 6>the real issue is the route.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The other person,</v>

2492
01:53:20.261 --> 01:53:22.050
<v Speaker 6>the issue is that people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>raising these people,</v>

2493
01:53:22.051 --> 01:53:24.060
<v Speaker 6>the real issue is how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2494
01:53:24.061 --> 01:53:27.810
<v Speaker 6>everyone starts out neutral with w,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever blend of personality.</v>

2495
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:33.470
<v Speaker 6>I bet almost every kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless they have some serious </v>

2496
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:36.381
<v Speaker 6>neurological difficulties on almost </v>
<v Speaker 6>every kid can be rendered a positive </v>

2497
01:53:36.381 --> 01:53:37.920
<v Speaker 6>human being by the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're surrounded by the right people.</v>

2498
01:53:37.921 --> 01:53:40.050
<v Speaker 6>It's like we're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What we're doing is by putting,</v>

2499
01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:43.680
<v Speaker 6>we're putting the most important thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>for the resources of the human race,</v>

2500
01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:48.860
<v Speaker 6>the youthful people developing into </v>
<v Speaker 6>contributing members of society who can </v>

2501
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:51.570
<v Speaker 6>actually add to the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>add to the experience,</v>

2502
01:53:51.571 --> 01:53:54.870
<v Speaker 6>add to the process,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we're putting the development of our</v>

2503
01:53:54.871 --> 01:53:59.730
<v Speaker 6>most valuable resource in the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone and anyone including retards,</v>

2504
01:53:59.910 --> 01:54:01.440
<v Speaker 6>morons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>assholes,</v>

2505
01:54:01.441 --> 01:54:02.920
<v Speaker 6>douchebags,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuckheads,</v>

2506
01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:07.940
<v Speaker 6>everyone in between.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch of crazy motherfuckers </v>

2507
01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:11.421
<v Speaker 6>shit out kids every day and you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't say anything about it because </v>

2508
01:54:11.421 --> 01:54:12.530
<v Speaker 6>then you're Hitler and then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2509
01:54:12.570 --> 01:54:13.100
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2510
01:54:13.170 --> 01:54:14.370
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you a fan of eugenics?</v>

2511
01:54:14.371 --> 01:54:15.630
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how they didn't work in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>past?</v>

2512
01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:20.940
<v Speaker 6>The guess what else isn't working?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This overpopulation by monkeys isn't </v>

2513
01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:20.940
<v Speaker 6>working</v>

2514
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:22.530
<v Speaker 7>well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why you gotta be a bit of A.</v>

2515
01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:24.350
<v Speaker 7>I mean if you start waking up to</v>

2516
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:29.470
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we got to wake all these people up and </v>

2517
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:31.060
<v Speaker 6>figuring out a way to re evaluate or </v>
<v Speaker 6>reevaluate will reset people's minds to </v>

2518
01:54:31.071 --> 01:54:36.071
<v Speaker 6>reset people's what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever it is that your operating </v>

2519
01:54:36.071 --> 01:54:36.071

2521
01:54:36.211 --> 01:54:37.190
<v Speaker 6>where,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where it's failing.</v>

2522
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.700
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2524

<v Speaker 7>flattering tweets from people who listen</v>

2525
01:54:44.791 --> 01:54:45.330
<v Speaker 7>as I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

<v Speaker 7>hometown to talk to you.</v>

<v Speaker 7>say,</v>

2539
01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:22.671
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got to be the force that maybe like </v>

2540
01:55:22.671 --> 01:55:22.671
<v Speaker 7>throw somebody off their track,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2541
01:55:22.671 --> 01:55:24.390
<v Speaker 7>you might have to be the thing that does</v>
<v Speaker 7>that because my,</v>

2542
01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:28.800
<v Speaker 7>like the people I owe the most to are </v>
<v Speaker 7>the people who manage to fucking knocked</v>

2543
01:55:28.801 --> 01:55:30.150
<v Speaker 7>me off my track,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2544
01:55:30.151 --> 01:55:35.151
<v Speaker 7>managed to like fucking bring to me </v>
<v Speaker 7>music I'd never heard before showed me </v>

2545
01:55:35.151 --> 01:55:36.480
<v Speaker 7>books I'd never heard before.</v>

2546
01:55:36.630 --> 01:55:41.630
<v Speaker 7>And then all of a sudden that steers you</v>
<v Speaker 7>out of the fucking public sector,</v>

2547
01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:43.410
<v Speaker 7>the fucking,</v>

2548
01:55:43.690 --> 01:55:44.620
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what you're doing.</v>

2549
01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:49.680
<v Speaker 6>That's what you're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you're doing right now is doing </v>

2550
01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:50.380
<v Speaker 6>that exact same thing to all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>hundreds of thousands of people that are</v>

2551
01:55:50.381 --> 01:55:55.381
<v Speaker 6>listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it's the exact same thing you're </v>

2552
01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:59.311
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you are saying is always been </v>

2553
01:55:59.311 --> 01:55:59.670
<v Speaker 6>greatest in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

2554
01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.680
<v Speaker 6>you're introducing ideas into people's </v>
<v Speaker 6>heads that they probably never would </v>

2555
01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.090
<v Speaker 6>have come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>might not have come up with today.</v>

2556
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:08.290
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who knows,</v>

2557
01:56:08.291 --> 01:56:09.820
<v Speaker 6>given the right amount of experience in </v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

2558
01:56:09.821 --> 01:56:10.960
<v Speaker 6>anybody could probably,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2559
01:56:10.961 --> 01:56:13.390
<v Speaker 6>that's the idea that thoughts aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're your own.</v>

2560
01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:15.610
<v Speaker 6>You're just tuning into them like some </v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of a it.</v>

2561
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:16.660
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2562
01:56:16.661 --> 01:56:21.661
<v Speaker 6>that's the idea is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I have struggled with that </v>

2563
01:56:21.661 --> 01:56:21.661
<v Speaker 6>because I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds beautiful.</v>

2564
01:56:21.661 --> 01:56:24.280
<v Speaker 6>It sounds kind of spooky and crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it also makes me think,</v>

2565
01:56:24.281 --> 01:56:29.170
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if it's just that the mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 6>for retrieving really good,</v>

2566
01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:33.820
<v Speaker 6>interesting creative ideas that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>method,</v>

2567
01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:36.940
<v Speaker 6>the mechanism for thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to have all your resources,</v>

2568
01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:42.060
<v Speaker 6>all your facilitating resources,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the ego has to be fucking completely </v>

2569
01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:44.020
<v Speaker 6>quiet and if the ego is not completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>quiet,</v>

2570
01:56:44.170 --> 01:56:49.170
<v Speaker 6>the ego is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get some fucking new </v>

2571
01:56:49.170 --> 01:56:50.860
<v Speaker 6>clothes so I can look slick and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking about getting news,</v>

2572
01:56:50.861 --> 01:56:51.460
<v Speaker 6>nose ring.</v>

2573
01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.260
<v Speaker 6>Those rings are pretty hot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chicks are really into that.</v>

2574
01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:57.670
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if my hair would be cool if it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was blond and you start really tweaking.</v>

2575
01:56:57.671 --> 01:56:59.920
<v Speaker 6>Your ego starts wigging out on your </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

2576
01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:04.980
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I should get myself a new cadillac</v>
<v Speaker 6>chicks dig dead Shit and you start </v>

2577
01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:07.000
<v Speaker 6>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm tired of being the VP at work.</v>

2578
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:09.650
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to step it up this year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody demand the fucking,</v>

2579
01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:10.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you start getting</v>

2580
01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.340
<v Speaker 7>crazy ego.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We</v>

2581
01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.850
<v Speaker 6>it like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it cuts out all the noise.</v>

2582
01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:18.620
<v Speaker 6>It makes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>creates too much noise.</v>

2583
01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.480
<v Speaker 6>And the creative mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2584
01:57:20.630 --> 01:57:21.800
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Zen mind,</v>

2585
01:57:21.801 --> 01:57:24.440
<v Speaker 6>the humble mine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's none of resources.</v>

2586
01:57:24.441 --> 01:57:25.640
<v Speaker 6>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2587
01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:28.110
<v Speaker 6>you use this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this tool and this tool is to say,</v>

2588
01:57:28.250 --> 01:57:33.250
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll just pretend they're not even my </v>

2589
01:57:33.250 --> 01:57:33.250
<v Speaker 6>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just tuning them into the universe.</v>

2590
01:57:33.250 --> 01:57:37.600
<v Speaker 6>I'm so humble.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what you're doing is with this </v>

2591
01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:37.600
<v Speaker 6>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like putting it through this filter,</v>

2592
01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:41.180
<v Speaker 6>you've just shut your fucking nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stupid ego up by saying that you're just</v>

2593
01:57:41.590 --> 01:57:42.860
<v Speaker 6>a vessel and you're just tuning in.</v>

2594
01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:43.400
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2595
01:57:43.401 --> 01:57:43.670
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2596
01:57:43.671 --> 01:57:45.410
<v Speaker 7>and you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not arguing that.</v>

2597
01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:47.900
<v Speaker 7>It's like either or here's how I look at</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

2598
01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:53.700
<v Speaker 7>or it's not either or whatever fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>vehicle you need to use to get to the </v>

2599
01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:55.880
<v Speaker 7>point where the things turned off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Use it.</v>

2600
01:57:55.881 --> 01:58:00.881
<v Speaker 7>If you need to conceptualize it by </v>
<v Speaker 7>thinking you're connecting with some </v>

2601
01:58:00.881 --> 01:58:03.440
<v Speaker 7>kind of superintelligent consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 7>that just wants the planet to be happier</v>

2602
01:58:03.441 --> 01:58:05.010
<v Speaker 7>because he doesn't want the planet to </v>
<v Speaker 7>dine.</v>

2603
01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.000
<v Speaker 7>It's giving its own voice there as many </v>
<v Speaker 7>people as allow it.</v>

2604
01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 7>Whatever</v>

2605
01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:10.900
<v Speaker 6>vehicle would that is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any,</v>

2606
01:58:10.901 --> 01:58:14.500
<v Speaker 6>any ideology like that along the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a vehicle for you managing</v>

2607
01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:16.210
<v Speaker 7>it's a vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2608
01:58:16.230 --> 01:58:19.880
<v Speaker 7>it's so and so when you get in a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>bus to get to point a,</v>

2609
01:58:19.881 --> 01:58:21.920
<v Speaker 7>B or c,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not the bus.</v>

2610
01:58:21.921 --> 01:58:24.560
<v Speaker 7>It's the point that you're getting to </v>
<v Speaker 7>use the vehicle,</v>

2611
01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:29.680
<v Speaker 7>use whatever mechanism you have to use </v>
<v Speaker 7>to dissolve your ego to the point where </v>

2612
01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.431
<v Speaker 7>you're not going to turn into a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>Dick because the moment you start </v>

2613
01:58:33.431 --> 01:58:34.190
<v Speaker 7>claiming ownership of or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2614
01:58:34.191 --> 01:58:38.930
<v Speaker 7>like I think the most obvious version of</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is like super attractive.</v>

2615
01:58:38.931 --> 01:58:41.800
<v Speaker 7>People who act like they deserve it,</v>

2616
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 4>who act like they've done something for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2617
01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:46.090
<v Speaker 4>That's unfortunately how ugly that makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2618
01:58:46.890 --> 01:58:50.110
<v Speaker 4>It makes them like really pretty girl </v>
<v Speaker 4>say nasty shit.</v>

2619
01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:53.020
<v Speaker 4>You just want to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know how fucking lucky you are?</v>

2620
01:58:53.021 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 4>To be as pretty as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be like so happy all the time</v>

2621
01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:59.440
<v Speaker 4>to shit on what another girl looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2622
01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:03.130
<v Speaker 4>It makes them ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So unfortunately because of all the shit</v>

2623
01:59:03.131 --> 01:59:08.131
<v Speaker 4>you could talk about like when a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>hot chick shits on a girlfriend not </v>

2624
01:59:08.131 --> 01:59:09.490
<v Speaker 4>being so pretty like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like damn that dude.</v>

2625
01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:10.510
<v Speaker 4>What is more</v>

2626
01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:15.900
<v Speaker 7>deadly and attractive than a super hot </v>
<v Speaker 7>girl who doesn't care that she's super </v>

2627
01:59:16.661 --> 01:59:21.661
<v Speaker 7>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was managed to overcome all the </v>

2628
01:59:21.661 --> 01:59:23.500
<v Speaker 7>fucking years of being worshiped by </v>
<v Speaker 7>people and it isn't normal and cool.</v>

2629
01:59:23.930 --> 01:59:25.650
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a hard question,</v>

2630
01:59:25.651 --> 01:59:30.651
<v Speaker 4>but that girl is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not going to be one of nine wives </v>

2631
01:59:30.651 --> 01:59:30.651
<v Speaker 4>in the cult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you most to fuck?</v>

2632
01:59:30.651 --> 01:59:35.541
<v Speaker 4>It's smart for herself and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My post apocalyptic cultural have their </v>

2633
01:59:35.541 --> 01:59:36.650
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

2634
01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:42.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know why you can make her the high </v>

2635
01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:42.120
<v Speaker 4>priestess of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they call it management,</v>

2636
01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:44.950
<v Speaker 4>but like the way that goes nurse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just got to fucking ideas.</v>

2637
01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Don't get caught up in like with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

2638
01:59:47.241 --> 01:59:50.270
<v Speaker 4>Continue to advance and always analyze,</v>
<v Speaker 4>observe,</v>

2639
01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:52.880
<v Speaker 4>look at all the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at all the different influences,</v>

2640
01:59:52.881 --> 01:59:54.950
<v Speaker 4>all the different things you can draw </v>
<v Speaker 4>from online.</v>

2641
01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:57.800
<v Speaker 4>Take what is useful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>analyze yourself,</v>

2642
01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:00.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a process where we're all a part of</v>

2643
02:00:00.051 --> 02:00:00.740
<v Speaker 4>this process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2644
02:00:00.750 --> 02:00:02.960
<v Speaker 4>you and I have both seen each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolve.</v>

2645
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:05.930
<v Speaker 4>We just don't really realize it as much </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we evolved together,</v>

2646
02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:11.080
<v Speaker 4>but if we went back in time 10 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>to when we met and then like when we </v>

2647
02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:11.080
<v Speaker 4>meet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll use it.</v>

2648
02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:13.910
<v Speaker 4>It was about 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little over that I think.</v>

2649
02:00:13.911 --> 02:00:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2650
02:00:14.370 --> 02:00:19.370
<v Speaker 4>It might've been like 2001 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's it like even before that dude's </v>

2651
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:20.910
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew slash know.</v>

2652
02:00:20.970 --> 02:00:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

2653
02:00:21.690 --> 02:00:26.690
<v Speaker 7>I bet you don't remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember the first time that you </v>

2654
02:00:26.690 --> 02:00:26.690
<v Speaker 7>really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

2655
02:00:26.690 --> 02:00:30.081
<v Speaker 7>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This was when I was a cory's assistant </v>

2656
02:00:30.081 --> 02:00:32.661
<v Speaker 7>at the comedy store and we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was sitting next to you in Newark.</v>

2657
02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:39.020
<v Speaker 7>I think you had.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This was right around when you just </v>

2658
02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:39.020
<v Speaker 7>started smoking weed or you because you </v>
<v Speaker 7>were more.</v>

2659
02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:43.251

<v Speaker 7>to become a marijuana advocate at this </v>

2660
02:00:43.251 --> 02:00:43.251
<v Speaker 7>time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it wasn't.</v>

2661
02:00:43.251 --> 02:00:46.230
<v Speaker 7>This was called my annoying phase now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it was really funny.</v>

2662
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:47.850
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was an annoying thing.</v>

2663
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:50.490
<v Speaker 7>It was really funny because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2664
02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:53.760
<v Speaker 7>now I was sitting next to you and I at </v>
<v Speaker 7>the time I had been.</v>

2665
02:00:53.850 --> 02:00:58.850
<v Speaker 7>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went through this being a marijuana </v>

2666
02:00:58.850 --> 02:00:58.850
<v Speaker 7>advocate phase,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2667
02:00:58.850 --> 02:00:58.850
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a few,</v>

2668
02:00:58.850 --> 02:01:03.370
<v Speaker 7>a few years before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I remember sitting nice and you're </v>

2669
02:01:03.370 --> 02:01:03.540
<v Speaker 7>talking about weed and as a joke because</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know you that well.</v>

2670
02:01:03.541 --> 02:01:06.090
<v Speaker 7>You didn't know me and as a dumb joke I </v>
<v Speaker 7>was like,</v>

2671
02:01:06.091 --> 02:01:11.091
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we should be illegal and you shot me </v>

<v Speaker 7>You are,</v>

2673
02:01:11.091 --> 02:01:11.440
<v Speaker 7>you are allowed to make</v>

2674
02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:15.360
<v Speaker 4>because you thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put them up on his head.</v>

2675
02:01:15.730 --> 02:01:18.900
<v Speaker 4>He was all Gary Oldman him on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2676
02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:19.490
<v Speaker 4>I said it should be</v>

2677
02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:23.310
<v Speaker 7>illegal and you seem so paste.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then corey like was like,</v>

2679
02:01:24.501 --> 02:01:27.680

<v Speaker 7>know each other and I couldn't seem like</v>

2680
02:01:27.681 --> 02:01:32.681
<v Speaker 7>a real asshole at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then then I don't remember that at </v>

2681
02:01:32.681 --> 02:01:32.681
<v Speaker 7>all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>

2682
02:01:32.681 --> 02:01:33.290
<v Speaker 7>I think you'd probably be a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>paranoid.</v>

2683
02:01:33.291 --> 02:01:35.090
<v Speaker 7>I think he tuned me out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I probably would.</v>

2684
02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:37.190
<v Speaker 7>I don't think I would like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2685
02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:39.140
<v Speaker 7>like got angry with you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't get angry.</v>

2686
02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:41.640
<v Speaker 7>Probably didn't seem like the morning </v>
<v Speaker 7>Dario,</v>

2687
02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.840
<v Speaker 6>one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Either you were trying to make a joke </v>

2688
02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:48.840
<v Speaker 6>which would be not funny and I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>be bored</v>

2689
02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:51.330
<v Speaker 7>or I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what an asshole.</v>

2690
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:56.550
<v Speaker 7>Just saying that it was the former.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then after that we started talking on </v>

2691
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:58.160
<v Speaker 7>the phone and we start having </v>
<v Speaker 7>conversations like</v>

2692
02:01:58.170 --> 02:02:02.400

<v Speaker 6>have these fucking 45 minute phone calls</v>

2693

2707
02:02:35.831 --> 02:02:40.831
<v Speaker 6>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a natural progression for me to </v>

2708
02:02:40.831 --> 02:02:40.831
<v Speaker 6>stay high on the job doing fear factor </v>
<v Speaker 6>as well.</v>

2709
02:02:40.831 --> 02:02:44.751
<v Speaker 6>It's like it all went and did like </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody was high when they were </v>

2710
02:02:44.751 --> 02:02:45.590
<v Speaker 6>working and that's how you got through </v>
<v Speaker 6>work when you started working there,</v>

2711
02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:46.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember you.</v>

2712
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:48.740
<v Speaker 6>You went through this little struggle </v>
<v Speaker 6>where he is,</v>

02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:50.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want it to be a comic,</v>

2714
02:02:50.541 --> 02:02:52.820
<v Speaker 6>but they didn't take you seriously while</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're still working there.</v>

2715
02:02:52.830 --> 02:02:57.830
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had to go to the vampire man in.</v>

2716
02:02:59.190 --> 02:03:04.190
<v Speaker 7>Anytime you fucking kill that vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you survive flowers will rain from </v>

2717
02:03:05.191 --> 02:03:06.370
<v Speaker 7>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bloom.</v>

2718
02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.910
<v Speaker 6>You can get better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody can get better.</v>

2719
02:03:08.911 --> 02:03:10.860
<v Speaker 6>We can all of their assets and move </v>
<v Speaker 6>forward,</v>

2720
02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:12.630
<v Speaker 6>but you got to be positive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So fuck.</v>

2721
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
<v Speaker 6>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't be convinced that you have </v>

2722
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.491
<v Speaker 6>anything figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whether it's the secret or Buddhism or </v>

2723
02:03:19.491 --> 02:03:19.491
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't be convinced,</v>

2724
02:03:19.491 --> 02:03:19.610
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't be given.</v>

2725
02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:24.860
<v Speaker 6>This world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Might be entirely made up of </v>

2726
02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:24.960
<v Speaker 6>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be,</v>

2727
02:03:25.290 --> 02:03:28.020
<v Speaker 6>it might be entirely made up of </v>
<v Speaker 6>imagination.</v>

2728
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:33.270
<v Speaker 6>The more time moves forward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more I wonder if there's a theory </v>

2729
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:37.851
<v Speaker 6>and I believe that you were the first </v>
<v Speaker 6>one who introduced me to this theory as </v>

2730
02:03:37.851 --> 02:03:38.280
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The theory that your life,</v>

2731
02:03:38.490 --> 02:03:43.490
<v Speaker 6>the world that you live in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is really something that your mind has </v>

2732
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:44.520
<v Speaker 6>created in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As you get older and your body starts to</v>

2733
02:03:44.521 --> 02:03:49.521
<v Speaker 6>slowly deteriorates and progress towards</v>
<v Speaker 6>death in your own particular universe.</v>

2734
02:03:50.761 --> 02:03:55.761
<v Speaker 6>That's when the shit hits the fan and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>all goes down and you've managed to </v>

2735
02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:59.541
<v Speaker 6>manufacturer this idea inside your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the life of your experiences in actual </v>

2736
02:03:59.941 --> 02:04:04.941
<v Speaker 6>real life when what it really is is just</v>
<v Speaker 6>a series of events that have been tied </v>

2737
02:04:05.941 --> 02:04:09.660
<v Speaker 6>together to prepare you for the next </v>
<v Speaker 6>stage of existence,</v>

2738
02:04:09.690 --> 02:04:09.850
<v Speaker 6>right</v>

2739
02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:13.390
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the more that you can let go of your</v>

2740
02:04:13.391 --> 02:04:18.391
<v Speaker 7>attachments to this particular life and </v>
<v Speaker 7>become the thing that is in throughout </v>

2741
02:04:19.481 --> 02:04:23.860
<v Speaker 7>the evolutionary cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then they'll see a traumatic death.</v>

2742
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:28.870
<v Speaker 6>Could you imagine that really does get </v>
<v Speaker 6>proved some day that you're and </v>

2743
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.870
<v Speaker 6>everybody will be like,</v>

2744
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:31.870
<v Speaker 7>imagination controls your fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God dammit,</v>

2745
02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:34.140
<v Speaker 7>I could have made a fucking awesome </v>
<v Speaker 7>life.</v>

2746
02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:37.150
<v Speaker 7>I just fucked up and we wired </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

2747
02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 7>All the Shitty luck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Could you imagine if that was really the</v>

2748
02:04:40.171 --> 02:04:41.580
<v Speaker 7>case?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You believed what the fuck is?</v>

2749
02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:46.820
<v Speaker 7>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It would be such evil information that </v>

2750
02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:46.820
<v Speaker 7>people wouldn't even want it to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then you wouldn't.</v>

2751
02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:48.180
<v Speaker 7>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That would be a religious issue.</v>

2752
02:04:48.181 --> 02:04:53.181
<v Speaker 7>People might withhold that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They found out that we are in reality </v>

2753
02:04:53.181 --> 02:04:54.690
<v Speaker 7>architects of our own world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>our own universe,</v>

2754
02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:57.480
<v Speaker 7>that each one of us is actually that </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>

2755
02:04:58.560 --> 02:04:59.220
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

2756
02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:00.860
<v Speaker 7>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that if here's a,</v>

2757
02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:03.600
<v Speaker 7>here's a weird idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If there were,</v>

2758
02:05:03.601 --> 02:05:08.370
<v Speaker 7>imagine there is a hell and the only way</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you could keep the people on how is</v>

2759
02:05:08.371 --> 02:05:10.290
<v Speaker 7>making sure that they didn't realize </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

2760
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:15.350
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at any second they could turn that hell </v>

2761
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.350
<v Speaker 7>and the heaven.</v>

2762
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:18.290
<v Speaker 7>You have to keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You had to keep them like oblivious to </v>

2763
02:05:18.290 --> 02:05:21.681
<v Speaker 7>this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You had realized that the thing you're </v>

2764
02:05:21.681 --> 02:05:22.140
<v Speaker 7>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the things that obscure the light,</v>

2765
02:05:22.141 --> 02:05:24.450
<v Speaker 7>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of making people's lives great.</v>

2766
02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 7>It's like TV.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the media.</v>

2767
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.630
<v Speaker 7>Every time you turn the TV on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's showing you death and destruction.</v>

2768
02:05:30.810 --> 02:05:35.810
<v Speaker 7>When you turn on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're talking about wars and bombs </v>

2769
02:05:35.810 --> 02:05:35.810
<v Speaker 7>everywhere you will look.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's darkness,</v>

2770
02:05:35.810 --> 02:05:40.491
<v Speaker 7>darkness in darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like people are really trying to </v>

2771
02:05:40.491 --> 02:05:42.420
<v Speaker 7>keep our consciousness focused on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>dark instead of on the light,</v>

2772
02:05:42.710 --> 02:05:43.310
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the.</v>

2773
02:05:43.730 --> 02:05:48.730
<v Speaker 7>But if there was a global movement to </v>
<v Speaker 7>try to get people's minds to shift from </v>

2774
02:05:49.891 --> 02:05:54.891
<v Speaker 7>the obsession with death and all the </v>
<v Speaker 7>forms of negativity that so many people </v>

2775
02:05:54.891 --> 02:05:59.781
<v Speaker 7>are focused on and to turn their minds </v>
<v Speaker 7>towards a died towards the beauty and </v>

2776
02:06:00.901 --> 02:06:05.901
<v Speaker 7>towards friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 7>towards like healthy sex and towards </v>

2777
02:06:05.901 --> 02:06:06.570
<v Speaker 7>embracing each other.</v>

2778
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:11.750
<v Speaker 7>Then really we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this entire planet could transform and </v>

2779
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:12.120
<v Speaker 7>to some version of heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think some something,</v>

2780
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:14.550
<v Speaker 7>a form of paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2781
02:06:14.730 --> 02:06:17.520
<v Speaker 7>but there a there ultimately and </v>
<v Speaker 7>eventually,</v>

2782
02:06:17.521 --> 02:06:19.650
<v Speaker 7>but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how long is it gonna take?</v>

2783
02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:22.980
<v Speaker 7>I think it's going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's either going to be going to have to</v>

2784
02:06:22.981 --> 02:06:24.140
<v Speaker 7>happen right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When it's in it,</v>

2785
02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:26.490
<v Speaker 7>some form of invention,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we either get an invention,</v>

2786
02:06:26.491 --> 02:06:31.491
<v Speaker 7>we get an alien or we get destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's quote Morrissey.</v>

2787
02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:37.250
<v Speaker 7>If it's not love,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the bomb that will bring us </v>

2788
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:40.671
<v Speaker 7>together though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'd be awesome if you didn't quote </v>

2789
02:06:40.671 --> 02:06:40.671
<v Speaker 7>Morrisey.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry,</v>

2790
02:06:40.671 --> 02:06:41.370
<v Speaker 7>but it's a great man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's great.</v>

2791
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:43.890
<v Speaker 7>I've actually.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is his real name?</v>

2792
02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:46.140
<v Speaker 7>What is his real name?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was that his real name?</v>

2793
02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:49.590
<v Speaker 7>Is it just going to ask me that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like every Golfer on the planet.</v>

2794
02:06:49.591 --> 02:06:54.591
<v Speaker 7>It's going to hate me forever if I can't</v>
<v Speaker 7>answer that right away because names.</v>

2795
02:06:54.910 --> 02:06:57.630
<v Speaker 7>Morrissey will be really cool quote.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you just said his name,</v>

2796
02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:00.330
<v Speaker 7>not just Morrissey.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it's Ronald.</v>

2797
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 7>Ronald Morris.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ronald Morris.</v>

2798
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:06.320
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gary Morrissey.</v>

2799
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:07.830
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's more legitimate quote.</v>

2800
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 7>So funny how Morris he would never have </v>
<v Speaker 7>gotten name like a rapper.</v>

2801
02:07:10.710 --> 02:07:12.810
<v Speaker 7>He never would have gotten famous if on </v>
<v Speaker 7>his albums.</v>

2802
02:07:12.811 --> 02:07:13.650
<v Speaker 7>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gary,</v>

2803
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:19.130
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have you heard Gary?</v>

2804
02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:21.500
<v Speaker 7>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of a mystic.</v>

2805
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:23.080
<v Speaker 7>I have a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His name's Gary.</v>

2806
02:07:23.190 --> 02:07:27.080
<v Speaker 7>Now your mistake has been named </v>
<v Speaker 7>Charlotte getting me that.</v>

2807
02:07:27.190 --> 02:07:32.070
<v Speaker 7>Steven.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Steven.</v>

2808
02:07:32.071 --> 02:07:33.880
<v Speaker 7>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Steve,</v>

2809
02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 7>I knew someone who knew someone</v>

2810
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:38.170
<v Speaker 1>who got really into yoga and changed her</v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

2811
02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:40.750
<v Speaker 1>She insisted you call her by her new </v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

2812
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a useful logan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

2813
02:07:43.031 --> 02:07:48.031
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a usefulness to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's that reinvention </v>

2814
02:07:48.031 --> 02:07:48.031
<v Speaker 1>that's a good tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2815
02:07:48.031 --> 02:07:49.540
<v Speaker 1>and I understand why people do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you think about your name and</v>

2816
02:07:49.541 --> 02:07:54.541
<v Speaker 1>where it came from with like we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting named in the way people used to </v>

2817
02:07:54.541 --> 02:07:55.930
<v Speaker 1>get named people and people used to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>named on,</v>

2818
02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on their actions and stuff.</v>

2819
02:07:58.271 --> 02:08:03.271
<v Speaker 1>They real name would come later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get named on what some fucking 22 </v>

2820
02:08:03.271 --> 02:08:08.191
<v Speaker 1>year old dope decided that you're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little pink wriggling thing that you </v>

2821
02:08:08.191 --> 02:08:08.980
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be called,</v>

2822
02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:13.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where my mouth is that what you were </v>

2823
02:08:13.981 --> 02:08:17.230
<v Speaker 1>named after my name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where they.</v>

2824
02:08:17.310 --> 02:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the name came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do understand this idea of like </v>

2825
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:24.730
<v Speaker 1>rebirth or the idea of like once you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked off track,</v>

2826
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:29.910
<v Speaker 1>why not go really deep and fucking just </v>
<v Speaker 1>rename yourself the best cult speech </v>

2827
02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>have overheard of my life.</v>

2828
02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:33.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to get people to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink the Koolaid.</v>

2829
02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Just jump in balls first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man,</v>

2830
02:08:36.230 --> 02:08:37.430
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get in there.</v>

2831
02:08:37.431 --> 02:08:40.990
<v Speaker 1>So I will take the big jump and change </v>
<v Speaker 1>your name into a crazy new name.</v>

2832
02:08:41.170 --> 02:08:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Your name is Duncan Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was joey did.</v>

2833
02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:45.340
<v Speaker 1>You've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan sent you a fucking.</v>

2834
02:08:45.690 --> 02:08:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden you want to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

2835
02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at fucking Cat Stevens.</v>

2836
02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good example.</v>

2837
02:08:52.150 --> 02:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Crazy asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking murder of Salmon Rushdie.</v>

2838
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Get outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2839
02:08:57.510 --> 02:09:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Artists didn't work for prince when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince did it for,</v>

2840
02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recording rights reasons.</v>

2841
02:09:03.770 --> 02:09:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An issue with them owning his name.</v>

2842
02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it always works,</v>

2843
02:09:09.251 --> 02:09:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think sometimes I do.</v>

2844
02:09:10.691 --> 02:09:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I can understand the usefulness of it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tool.</v>

2845
02:09:13.090 --> 02:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I can understand it as a way to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>create the differentiation between </v>

2846
02:09:18.090 --> 02:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever the person that you were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your earlier phases and who you've </v>

2847
02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:22.600
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's always good.</v>

2848
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I think if people allow me to name them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will name them beautiful names that </v>

2849
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:28.400
<v Speaker 1>there'll be quite pleased with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is it?</v>

2850
02:09:28.401 --> 02:09:30.490
<v Speaker 1>The prince changed his name to a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol.</v>

2851
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:32.530
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What an amazing move that was.</v>

2852
02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really an amazing,</v>

2853

02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not even a name anymore.</v>

2856
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:42.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just so fucking squiggly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy thing.</v>

2857
02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:44.820
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2858
02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:49.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language of contracts are so </v>

2859
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:49.840
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's anything you could</v>

2860
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:54.580
<v Speaker 1>ever sign away where that person owned </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your likeness.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How the fuck can you sell that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't own that anymore.</v>

2862
02:09:58.250 --> 02:10:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't use your own likeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to use this crazy symbol </v>

2863
02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:05.080
<v Speaker 1>really in signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the signing shit.</v>

2864
02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Give up that name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give up the name Prince or Duncan </v>

<v Speaker 1>my parents I think started just calling </v>

2900
02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:54.401
<v Speaker 1>me dunk and then I decided that I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be called Duncan and instead of </v>

02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:51.070
<v Speaker 7>See the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at Hitler.</v>

2967
02:14:51.071 --> 02:14:53.400
<v Speaker 7>Gets invited to south by southwest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So great.</v>

2968
02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:55.930
<v Speaker 7>Is that just complaining because they </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't fly the comics at and it's a.</v>

2969
02:14:55.931 --> 02:15:00.931
<v Speaker 7>it's just a generally a bum deal and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 7>just saying this because pretty much </v>

2970
02:15:00.931 --> 02:15:05.011
<v Speaker 7>right after I did from that video,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got invited to this awesome festival </v>

2971
02:15:05.011 --> 02:15:09.961
<v Speaker 7>that's happening happening in Austin </v>
<v Speaker 7>called the Moon Tower comedy festival </v>

2972
02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:15.030
<v Speaker 7>and that's happening in April and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>just like are doing the press releases </v>

2973
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:17.350
<v Speaker 7>today and I just think it's so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>cool that they like or you know,</v>

2974
02:15:17.351 --> 02:15:20.740
<v Speaker 7>pay like they're showing that festivals </v>
<v Speaker 7>can pay performance,</v>

2975
02:15:20.741 --> 02:15:23.990
<v Speaker 7>pay airfare and put them up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which isn't that insane and idea.</v>

2976
02:15:23.991 --> 02:15:25.250
<v Speaker 7>It's just normal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's</v>

2977
02:15:25.390 --> 02:15:30.390
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how anybody ever got </v>

2978
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.390
<v Speaker 1>away with anybody working for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're making money.</v>

2979
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't get the unless south by </v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest with some amazing charity that</v>

2980
02:15:33.581 --> 02:15:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a charity,</v>

2981
02:15:35.591 --> 02:15:38.080
<v Speaker 1>but what are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2982
02:15:38.081 --> 02:15:39.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2983
02:15:39.690 --> 02:15:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's probably all these poor.</v>

2984
02:15:43.061 --> 02:15:48.061
<v Speaker 1>She wishes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just to be sure I have a feeling </v>

2985
02:15:48.061 --> 02:15:50.410
<v Speaker 1>they would have said it by now based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the awesome videos I've been making.</v>

2986
02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:50.980
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2987
02:15:50.981 --> 02:15:51.980
<v Speaker 1>let's look up and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2988
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:53.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just assume like that,</v>

2989
02:15:53.411 --> 02:15:58.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting my apology or start typing a</v>

2990
02:15:58.270 --> 02:15:59.240
<v Speaker 1>$10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2991
02:15:59.310 --> 02:16:01.050
<v Speaker 7>Charity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's nice.</v>

2992
02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:03.960
<v Speaker 7>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Charity.</v>

2993
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:05.070
<v Speaker 7>Let's see.</v>

2994
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:11.270
<v Speaker 1>South by southwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they do some stuff for </v>

2995
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:13.431
<v Speaker 1>charity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can impact charity without being </v>

2996
02:16:13.431 --> 02:16:13.431
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>

2997
02:16:13.431 --> 02:16:16.280
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure it's south by southwest as </v>

2998
02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:18.801
<v Speaker 7>charity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when you ask artists to perform for </v>

2999
02:16:18.801 --> 02:16:22.311
<v Speaker 7>free at your festival that sponsored by </v>
<v Speaker 7>16 million different corporations,</v>

3000
02:16:22.621 --> 02:16:23.580
<v Speaker 7>it's a bit of a charity,</v>

3001
02:16:23.650 --> 02:16:28.650
<v Speaker 1>strongest memory of south by south to </v>
<v Speaker 1>south by southwest 2010 was a rooftop </v>

3002
02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 1>party when the by southwest</v>

3003
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:34.930
<v Speaker 6>partygoers spontaneously raised $300 </v>
<v Speaker 6>towards the purchase of a wheelchair for</v>

3004
02:16:34.931 --> 02:16:39.931
<v Speaker 6>the nephew of one attendee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The young man was paralyzed temporarily </v>

3005
02:16:39.931 --> 02:16:40.690
<v Speaker 6>in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could not afford a wheelchair.</v>

3006
02:16:40.691 --> 02:16:41.980
<v Speaker 6>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's beautiful.</v>

3007
02:16:42.270 --> 02:16:43.480
<v Speaker 6>That's very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's nice and all,</v>

3008
02:16:43.481 --> 02:16:48.481
<v Speaker 6>but still so many answers and how many </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are paying to go see south by </v>

3009
02:16:48.581 --> 02:16:49.990
<v Speaker 6>southwest?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's expensive.</v>

3010
02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:50.970
<v Speaker 7>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

3011
02:16:50.971 --> 02:16:55.971
<v Speaker 7>I go to their website.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think the cheapest passes around 100 </v>

3012
02:16:55.971 --> 02:16:55.971
<v Speaker 7>bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but might be more than that.</v>

3013
02:16:55.971 --> 02:17:00.900
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they get everybody get everybody to </v>

3014
02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:00.900
<v Speaker 7>work for free,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3015
02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:00.900
<v Speaker 7>They must pay some.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3016
02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:03.580
<v Speaker 7>I think some of the like a bigger names </v>
<v Speaker 7>get paid,</v>

3017
02:17:03.581 --> 02:17:08.581
<v Speaker 7>but mostly after I did these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mostly what I heard from people is that </v>

3018
02:17:08.581 --> 02:17:10.420
<v Speaker 7>the idea that Co.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's the concept I'll to to play south</v>

3019
02:17:10.421 --> 02:17:13.480
<v Speaker 7>by southwest advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>THe idea behind it is,</v>

3020
02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:15.670
<v Speaker 7>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just we're all having fun out here.</v>

3021
02:17:15.671 --> 02:17:20.671
<v Speaker 7>It's a party.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a chance to like hang out with a </v>

3022
02:17:20.671 --> 02:17:20.671
<v Speaker 7>bunch of other comics and have a good </v>
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

3023
02:17:20.671 --> 02:17:21.870
<v Speaker 7>We don't invite a lot of comics out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it's a,</v>

3024
02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:27.500
<v Speaker 7>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an honor to get invited out and </v>

3025
02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:29.521
<v Speaker 7>you're going to get a chance to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll put you up In someone's guest </v>

3026
02:17:29.521 --> 02:17:32.641
<v Speaker 7>bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we can't pay you and we can't pay </v>

3027
02:17:32.641 --> 02:17:35.110
<v Speaker 7>for your airfare and we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3028
02:17:35.250 --> 02:17:35.410
<v Speaker 7>we.</v>

3029
02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:37.540
<v Speaker 7>You want to stay in a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to have to pay for your own</v>

3030
02:17:37.541 --> 02:17:42.541
<v Speaker 7>hotel now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that that coming from like a </v>

3031
02:17:42.541 --> 02:17:46.261
<v Speaker 7>festival that really was a charity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the make a wish foundation or </v>

3032
02:17:46.261 --> 02:17:48.010
<v Speaker 7>something that was solely raising money </v>
<v Speaker 7>for charity or even a startup festival.</v>

3033
02:17:48.011 --> 02:17:53.011
<v Speaker 7>What about just a startup festival that </v>
<v Speaker 7>seems really cool and isn't making any </v>

3034
02:17:53.011 --> 02:17:53.011
<v Speaker 7>money?</v>
<v Speaker 7>All that.</v>

3035
02:17:53.011 --> 02:17:55.840
<v Speaker 7>I totally makes it makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'd be really cool,</v>

3036
02:17:56.020 --> 02:17:59.920
<v Speaker 7>but I think when it's coming from a </v>
<v Speaker 7>festival the size of south by southwest,</v>

3037
02:18:00.130 --> 02:18:03.280
<v Speaker 7>which is a giant festival,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I read that 30,000</v>

3038
02:18:03.281 --> 02:18:08.281
<v Speaker 7>people come through there a year and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're asking performers to come out </v>

3039
02:18:08.281 --> 02:18:10.090
<v Speaker 7>for free and to pay for their own </v>
<v Speaker 7>ticket.</v>

3040
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:13.720
<v Speaker 7>I think there's something in that that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>pretty fucked up,</v>

3041
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:15.850
<v Speaker 7>dear southwest airlines.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you want me to come,</v>

3042
02:18:15.851 --> 02:18:17.560
<v Speaker 7>I'll totally do it and I'll pay for </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

3043
02:18:17.561 --> 02:18:17.830
<v Speaker 7>Thanks.</v>

<v Speaker 5>veronica rita was right.</v>

3046
02:18:24.710 --> 02:18:29.710
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking airline manner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't even fly the comics,</v>

3047
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:32.100
<v Speaker 5>so it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you were joking.</v>

02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:36.190

<v Speaker 5>laughed at her and were like,</v>

3049
02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:37.080
<v Speaker 5>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I thought you knew.</v>

<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

3056

<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

3059
02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:52.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it must be an awesome hang.</v>

3060
02:18:52.321 --> 02:18:54.120
<v Speaker 6>I did one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's one?</v>

3061
02:18:54.121 --> 02:18:56.580
<v Speaker 6>One festival.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did summerfest in milwaukee.</v>

3062
02:18:56.581 --> 02:18:57.540
<v Speaker 6>It was fucking great,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3063
02:18:57.541 --> 02:19:02.541
<v Speaker 6>I loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I felt weird because I'm on stage </v>

3064
02:19:02.541 --> 02:19:05.481
<v Speaker 6>and I'm just doing my regular acts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's people with babies or holding </v>

3065
02:19:05.481 --> 02:19:05.520
<v Speaker 6>the babies in the crime,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this is just fucked up,</v>

3066
02:19:05.550 --> 02:19:06.010
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

3067
02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:11.020
<v Speaker 6>it's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like doing stand up in a place where </v>

3068
02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:11.020
<v Speaker 6>people come and see standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

3069
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:12.510
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But no,</v>

3070
02:19:12.511 --> 02:19:13.920
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think festivals.</v>

3071
02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:16.140
<v Speaker 6>I've done festivals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've sometimes they're fun.</v>

3072
02:19:16.170 --> 02:19:21.170
<v Speaker 6>I like I did the vancouver comedy </v>
<v Speaker 6>festival that comedy festivals are </v>

3073
02:19:21.170 --> 02:19:24.531
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying performing at a music </v>

3074
02:19:24.531 --> 02:19:24.531
<v Speaker 6>festival.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3075
02:19:24.531 --> 02:19:24.531
<v Speaker 6>that's a little music.</v>

3076
02:19:24.531 --> 02:19:25.360
<v Speaker 6>Festivals are way more rowdy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's way this.</v>

3077
02:19:25.610 --> 02:19:28.730
<v Speaker 6>It's way more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The people did not come to see that.</v>

3078
02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:31.040
<v Speaker 6>There's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

3079
02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:32.890
<v Speaker 6>Comedy festivals are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Montreal,</v>

3080

<v Speaker 6>montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all several years.</v>

3081
02:19:35.451 --> 02:19:39.080
<v Speaker 6>I think I did it six years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was fucking great.</v>

3082
02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:45.060
<v Speaker 6>A whole town know montreal that </v>
<v Speaker 6>literally has been privy to these </v>

3083
02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:49.691
<v Speaker 6>festivals coming in every year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they have like this really like high </v>

3084
02:19:49.691 --> 02:19:51.140
<v Speaker 6>palate for comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a fucking great place.</v>

3085
02:19:51.141 --> 02:19:54.110
<v Speaker 6>Do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were supposed to go back in march,</v>

3086
02:19:54.410 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unfortunately the ufc had a move.</v>

3087
02:19:56.841 --> 02:20:01.841
<v Speaker 6>It's a march date.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had to move the montreal date </v>

3088
02:20:01.841 --> 02:20:04.381
<v Speaker 6>because no champions were available and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were going to put together a big </v>

3089
02:20:04.381 --> 02:20:04.381
<v Speaker 6>card for up there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they postponed it.</v>

3090
02:20:04.381 --> 02:20:05.090
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>damn,</v>

3091
02:20:05.091 --> 02:20:07.040
<v Speaker 6>I was really looking forward to going </v>
<v Speaker 6>back to montreal.</v>

3104
02:20:36.621 --> 02:20:36.621
<v Speaker 6>thing just for spite,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3109

<v Speaker 6>if you look at what they're doing,</v>

3110
02:20:45.841 --> 02:20:48.240
<v Speaker 6>like even if you think that they should </v>
<v Speaker 6>be paying more,</v>

3111
02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:49.290
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stan hope does.</v>

3112
02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:51.360
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking infinitely better than </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>

3113
02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:53.100
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing's ridiculous.</v>

3114
02:20:53.130 --> 02:20:54.330
<v Speaker 6>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no hotel room,</v>

3115
02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:55.230
<v Speaker 6>no airfare.</v>

3116
02:20:55.850 --> 02:20:56.510
<v Speaker 7>Well no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They said,</v>

3117
02:20:56.511 --> 02:20:58.040
<v Speaker 7>here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They said no hotel room,</v>

3118
02:20:58.041 --> 02:21:01.010
<v Speaker 7>but they say you can stay in someone's </v>
<v Speaker 7>guest bedroom.</v>

3119
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:06.070
<v Speaker 7>The fuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Stand over someone who live in those </v>

3120
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:09.470
<v Speaker 7>days.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The other thing that the guy said to me </v>

3121
02:21:09.470 --> 02:21:09.560
<v Speaker 7>during these emails and the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 7>books it is a super nice guy.</v>

3122
02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:14.780
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I started feeling guilty because he's a </v>

3123
02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:14.810
<v Speaker 7>really nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very friendly guy.</v>

3124
02:21:14.811 --> 02:21:15.770
<v Speaker 7>But he would,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

3125
02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:18.830
<v Speaker 7>he couldn't acknowledge the one point </v>
<v Speaker 7>that I was making,</v>

3126
02:21:18.831 --> 02:21:23.831
<v Speaker 7>which is that if you're charging tickets</v>
<v Speaker 7>for people to come see performers,</v>

3127
02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:27.140
<v Speaker 7>you have to pay the performers </v>
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

3128
02:21:27.141 --> 02:21:29.450
<v Speaker 7>It's just basic logic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's all.</v>

3129
02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:31.370
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you don't have enough to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

3130
02:21:31.371 --> 02:21:32.750
<v Speaker 7>Maybe the performers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3131
02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:35.840
<v Speaker 7>you can only give them in a hotel and </v>
<v Speaker 7>get them out there but don't.</v>

3132
02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.760
<v Speaker 7>Because If you're making them pay for </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything,</v>

3133
02:21:37.761 --> 02:21:39.110
<v Speaker 7>then they're subsidizing your food.</v>

3134
02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:42.000
<v Speaker 7>Go though just for it to be fun in my </v>
<v Speaker 7>opinion,</v>

3135
02:21:42.001 --> 02:21:47.001
<v Speaker 7>like like if you're looking at ces,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the consumer electronics show or any of </v>

3136
02:21:47.001 --> 02:21:51.911
<v Speaker 7>these huge things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people are usually going because it's </v>

3137
02:21:51.911 --> 02:21:55.150
<v Speaker 7>what they love and it's a collection and</v>
<v Speaker 7>to me I would go just because it would </v>

3138
02:21:55.150 --> 02:21:58.691
<v Speaker 7>be an awesome party.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'd be awesome doing it and here's the </v>

3139
02:21:58.691 --> 02:21:58.691
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

3140
02:21:58.691 --> 02:21:59.420
<v Speaker 7>here's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In my mind,</v>

3141
02:21:59.421 --> 02:22:04.421
<v Speaker 7>the thing that I can't get past is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>the reason it's fun and the reason </v>

3142
02:22:04.421 --> 02:22:08.291
<v Speaker 7>people are going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's because the great fucking </v>

3143
02:22:08.291 --> 02:22:08.291
<v Speaker 7>performers that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the movies,</v>

3144
02:22:08.291 --> 02:22:12.251
<v Speaker 7>unquestionably it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was the main argument about the </v>

3145
02:22:12.251 --> 02:22:12.251
<v Speaker 7>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Remember the main argument,</v>

3146
02:22:12.251 --> 02:22:16.210
<v Speaker 7>the ecommerce stores,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were making it out that it was an </v>

3147
02:22:16.210 --> 02:22:17.150
<v Speaker 7>honor to perform at this star.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If they did that every day.</v>

3148
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:20.150
<v Speaker 7>You guys are crazy because this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is just a box.</v>

3149
02:22:20.151 --> 02:22:25.151
<v Speaker 7>We have a microphone and you turn it on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What you're selling here is art and the </v>

3150
02:22:25.151 --> 02:22:25.530
<v Speaker 7>artists are what create the art you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>selling.</v>

3151
02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 7>Are you</v>

3152
02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:27.720
<v Speaker 1>selling standup comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

3153
02:22:27.721 --> 02:22:31.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not selling a spot and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a popular spot.</v>

3154
02:22:31.170 --> 02:22:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a popular spot because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists that performed the period.</v>

3155
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:36.930
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the big festivals,</v>

3156
02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:39.750
<v Speaker 1>the same truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the exact same truth.</v>

3157
02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and festivals who are making a shitload </v>

3158
02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:46.290
<v Speaker 1>of money have this awesome opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make things fair.</v>

3159
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you gotta do is make it fair.</v>

3160
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these concerts like south by southwest,</v>

3161
02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:52.440
<v Speaker 1>isn't this where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3162
02:22:52.441 --> 02:22:53.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people go to go,</v>

3163
02:22:53.941 --> 02:22:58.941
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were looking for people for the </v>

3164
02:22:58.941 --> 02:22:58.941
<v Speaker 1>next year six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with vancouver,</v>

3165
02:22:58.941 --> 02:22:59.820
<v Speaker 1>with montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

3166
02:22:59.821 --> 02:23:02.460
<v Speaker 1>and you can say that for any festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is that right?</v>

3167
02:23:02.461 --> 02:23:06.270
<v Speaker 1>It is something where you for comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't set up man,</v>

3168
02:23:06.271 --> 02:23:08.310
<v Speaker 1>they get set up and then they become </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

3169
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:11.340
<v Speaker 1>They'd become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just how it's done and there's a</v>

3170
02:23:11.341 --> 02:23:13.920
<v Speaker 1>lot of them that don't make any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense and this is one of them.</v>

3171
02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:17.580
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you were performed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something where people profit,</v>

3172
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:20.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make a profit and just pay a little</v>

3173
02:23:20.941 --> 02:23:22.860
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing With this guy,</v>

3174
02:23:22.890 --> 02:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>the guy through my emails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy charlie,</v>

3175
02:23:24.851 --> 02:23:27.030
<v Speaker 1>he seemed really passionate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

3176
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:30.660
<v Speaker 1>He seemed like a really cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just if he would just,</v>

3177
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:35.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they would just make one small step </v>

3178
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:35.790
<v Speaker 1>in the direction of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3179
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:39.000
<v Speaker 1>We thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should pay airfare for the performers</v>

3180
02:23:39.001 --> 02:23:41.610
<v Speaker 1>to come up with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored by southwest.</v>

3181
02:23:41.650 --> 02:23:44.410
<v Speaker 1>They should be a no brainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share fair.</v>

3182
02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Just some discount which is drive so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much fucking business to the town.</v>

3183
02:23:48.211 --> 02:23:50.130
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm looking at an article about nine</v>

3184
02:23:50.131 --> 02:23:55.131
<v Speaker 1>ways to profit from south by southwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you weren't there and they're </v>

3185
02:23:55.131 --> 02:23:57.600
<v Speaker 1>talking about how much figuring out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to profit from this gathering of people,</v>

3186
02:23:57.860 --> 02:23:58.680
<v Speaker 1>isn't that amazing?</v>

3187
02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:03.800
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you look at human beings as some </v>

3188
02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:03.810
<v Speaker 1>sort of a life form and you look at just</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this article says,</v>

3189
02:24:03.811 --> 02:24:05.280
<v Speaker 1>nine ways to profit from south by </v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest.</v>

3190
02:24:05.281 --> 02:24:10.281
<v Speaker 1>Even if you weren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you could be extracting </v>

3191
02:24:10.281 --> 02:24:11.420
<v Speaker 1>resources from some spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're nowhere near there.</v>

3192
02:24:11.770 --> 02:24:16.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't even go there and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting out a way to profit to profit </v>

3193
02:24:16.770 --> 02:24:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

3194
02:24:16.770 --> 02:24:21.471
<v Speaker 1>You're profiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pulling money out somehow or </v>

3195
02:24:21.471 --> 02:24:23.571
<v Speaker 1>another from someplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you're doing it </v>

3196
02:24:23.571 --> 02:24:26.511
<v Speaker 1>illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you're doing anything </v>

3197
02:24:26.511 --> 02:24:26.511
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you can do that,</v>

3198
02:24:26.511 --> 02:24:28.890
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you're just signing checks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sending things out,</v>

3199
02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:30.870

<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people in that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>comedy festival.</v>

3218
02:25:18.181 --> 02:25:19.210
<v Speaker 1>to grab your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3220
02:25:24.291 --> 02:25:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this place up north,</v>

3221
02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:30.130
<v Speaker 1>there's this place called Nevada city </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have this film fest a lot there</v>

3222
02:25:30.131 --> 02:25:35.131

<v Speaker 1>hardcore hippies I've ever seen in my </v>

3223
02:25:35.711 --> 02:25:37.270
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this beautiful river.</v>

3224
02:25:37.271 --> 02:25:42.271
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the uma river that runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>through there and in the day you go </v>

3225
02:25:42.271 --> 02:25:44.500
<v Speaker 1>swimming in this river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking beautiful.</v>

3226
02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like this primordial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you jump off rocks.</v>

3227
02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:50.690
<v Speaker 1>It's called Nevada city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada city council,</v>

3228
02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

3232
02:25:57.940 --> 02:25:59.860
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you're getting into what I think,</v>

3233
02:25:59.861 --> 02:26:02.500
<v Speaker 1>and I may be wrong about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is called the emerald triangle.</v>

3234
02:26:02.501 --> 02:26:03.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where you start getting more.</v>

<v Speaker 1>slam a jail combine fun.</v>

3236
02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:10.420

<v Speaker 1>That's a dangerous area too,</v>

3237
02:26:10.421 --> 02:26:15.421
<v Speaker 1>because they've got a lot of mexican </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that go up there to grow pot and </v>

3238
02:26:15.421 --> 02:26:15.910
<v Speaker 1>guys actually stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>

3239
02:26:15.911 --> 02:26:18.340

<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>One of those reality tv networks.</v>

3242
02:26:25.090 --> 02:26:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people did an investigative </v>

3243
02:26:30.090 --> 02:26:30.090
<v Speaker 1>journalism thing where they went into </v>

<v Speaker 1>while they're growing drugs.</v>

3252
02:26:47.770 --> 02:26:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever,</v>

3253
02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:53.960
<v Speaker 1>because the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you think about what </v>

<v Speaker 1>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing wrong.</v>

3255
02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Growing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing wrong with being a farmer.</v>

3256
02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:57.220
<v Speaker 1>You're just grabbing something out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

3257
02:26:57.370 --> 02:26:59.410
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not evil,</v>

3258
02:26:59.411 --> 02:27:02.140
<v Speaker 1>you're not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because we happen to exist at a time</v>

3259
02:27:02.141 --> 02:27:07.141
<v Speaker 1>period in human history or somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiots have determined that certain </v>

<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

02:29:51.291 --> 02:29:54.930
<v Speaker 7>arrested and that landed on his website.</v>

3321
02:29:54.931 --> 02:29:55.890
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

<v Speaker 7>we're going to.</v>

3323
02:29:57.720 --> 02:30:02.720
<v Speaker 6>We're going to end up in a fucking fema </v>
<v Speaker 6>camp that's like I felt a real because I</v>

3324
02:30:03.061 --> 02:30:03.930
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>troops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can talk to the cops.</v>

3327
02:30:08.931 --> 02:30:13.821
<v Speaker 6>We communicate to those people and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not going to do with these </v>

3328
02:30:13.821 --> 02:30:16.761
<v Speaker 6>assholes are telling them to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's ultimately a real problem with </v>

3329
02:30:16.761 --> 02:30:18.420
<v Speaker 6>civil unrest in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fucking genie's out of the bottle.</v>

3330
02:30:18.421 --> 02:30:19.470
<v Speaker 6>The cops,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fireman.</v>

3331
02:30:19.471 --> 02:30:21.600
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows that this is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>mess.</v>

3332
02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:24.110
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows that these people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>just.</v>

3333
02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:27.030
<v Speaker 6>They're just doing what you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 6>to do when you're an american,</v>

02:30:29.821 --> 02:30:34.821
<v Speaker 6>and they don't know exactly how to do it</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the way I've described them is that </v>

3336

<v Speaker 6>problem and they don't know how to </v>

3338
02:30:40.521 --> 02:30:40.521
<v Speaker 6>conquer it and they don't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

3339
02:30:40.521 --> 02:30:42.450
<v Speaker 6>but the fact that so many people have </v>
<v Speaker 6>gravitated towards one area,</v>

3340
02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:47.570
