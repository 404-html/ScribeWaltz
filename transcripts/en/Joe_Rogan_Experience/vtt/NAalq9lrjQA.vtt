<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Godfather.</v>

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>How are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You too.</v>

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up with you?</v>

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we start for Easter,</v>

9
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People ask me,</v>

10
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>how do you define wealth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You define wealth when you're young.</v>

11
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:26.634
<v Speaker 1>Daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you step on the Joe Rogan </v>

12
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writes this to you.</v>

13
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>She wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

14
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>That's very cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wealth.</v>

15
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Other billionaire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't say it's wealth.</v>

17
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I think not being accurate with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

18
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will probably keep this forever bore.</v>

19
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.861
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

20
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>definitely don't put in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you sweat on it?</v>

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave it to you.</v>

22
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.613
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

23
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.593
<v Speaker 1>we were talking right before the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>started about what I was just talking </v>

25
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>about in the previous podcast about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patriot and what Patrion is done.</v>

26
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.173
<v Speaker 1>Two d platform Sargon of a cod in what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we both agree was sloppy use of </v>

27
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>language on his part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

28
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe he was saying something </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

29
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.083
<v Speaker 1>He was using a racist word though it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>using it to describe someone who is </v>

30
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:19.914
<v Speaker 1>actually using it against white </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalists against white supremacists </v>

31
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.284
<v Speaker 1>and and saying how ridiculous they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in that they were being exactly </v>

32
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.143
<v Speaker 1>what they describe and when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using racist terms to describe black </v>

33
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:34.224
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did it using those terms and it </v>

34
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.993
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a good speech like what he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I'd said on </v>

35
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>the previous podcast is when you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

36
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not mapping out what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say.</v>

37
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.413
<v Speaker 1>You're free flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes words come out clunky and I </v>

38
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:52.884
<v Speaker 1>think that was what what was going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case with him in this particular </v>

39
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.533
<v Speaker 1>conversation that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't even on his page and </v>

40
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.883
<v Speaker 1>patriot and decided to ban him and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think for him that was something to the </v>

41
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>tune of a $12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more a month.</v>

42
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So quite a bit of his income.</v>

43
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of us then suggested that people </v>

44
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:14.904
<v Speaker 1>move to subscribe star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a another platform that came </v>

45
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>out of nowhere and they've now been shut</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

46
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>How'd they get shut down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the details,</v>

47
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.054
<v Speaker 1>so I hope I'm not misspeaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think paypal and stripe decided </v>

48
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.064
<v Speaker 1>that somehow they're violating their </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of their terms of service for </v>

49
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.064
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently any payouts that have gone </v>

50
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>out are safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

51
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>it won't happen through paypal or </v>
<v Speaker 1>through stripe,</v>

52
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>so you have to find some alternate </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform,</v>

53
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I think pioneer or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.943
<v Speaker 1>so it's getting difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to even receive the generous donations </v>

55
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:53.724
<v Speaker 1>from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people that are doing </v>

56
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>podcasts and doing these youtube shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they operate</v>

57
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v Speaker 2>on donations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a really fair way to do things </v>

58
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.413
<v Speaker 2>because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If say if you have a subscription based </v>

59
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.184
<v Speaker 2>service and you're asking people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>save for Sirius satellite radio or </v>

60
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.624
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not be happy with the content </v>

61
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:18.664
<v Speaker 2>and you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might choose to cancel your </v>

62
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:21.544
<v Speaker 2>subscription,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these people can get what they get </v>

63
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 2>already for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

64
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 2>They choose to donate because they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's valuable to them.</v>

65
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Which was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that,</v>

66
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>that format,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that model,</v>

67
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.803
<v Speaker 2>because for the longest time people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how could you make </v>

68
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 2>money off the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

69
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:41.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was advertising revenue and Sam</v>

70
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.013
<v Speaker 2>Harris has a lengthly rant that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate about this that he puts on his </v>

71
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>podcast may often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a seven minute rant explaining</v>

72
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.034
<v Speaker 2>why he doesn't use ads and why he </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefers to have people just donate what </v>

73
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:55.654
<v Speaker 2>they were like.</v>

74
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 2>And he was one of the biggest patrion </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

75
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the biggest accounts on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriot.</v>

76
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.530
<v Speaker 2>He pulled his Patriot on two days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

77
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a huge statement because to him</v>

78
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:08.074
<v Speaker 2>that is incredibly valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really curious to know what Jack </v>

79
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Conte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the founder of the have patriot,</v>

80
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.093
<v Speaker 2>what his ultimate trajectory is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be as someone who teaches psychology of </v>

81
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.074
<v Speaker 2>decision making was studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision making who's housed in a </v>

82
00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 2>business school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

83
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.673
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be a wonderful case </v>

84
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.614
<v Speaker 2>analysis down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the Harvard will teach it of </v>

85
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>whether he just doubles down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it seems like this is what they're</v>

86
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:34.024
<v Speaker 2>doing because they released a statement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't seem to suggest that there </v>

87
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 2>was any sort of possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection on their part.</v>

88
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a sense of whether the </v>
<v Speaker 2>market will allow him to sort of realign</v>

89
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.294
<v Speaker 2>his thinking or do you think he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to double down all the way to </v>

90
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 2>hell?</v>

91
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to weather the storm </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to be completely honest,</v>

92
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 2>not what I would like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I would like is for them to support</v>

93
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:56.584
<v Speaker 2>free speech and for them to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiation between what is the </v>

94
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 2>actual hate speech and what is a clunky </v>
<v Speaker 2>use of language,</v>

95
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 2>which is what I think Sargon did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

96
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 2>It was a clunky use of language and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think Sargon is a very intelligent guy.</v>

97
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I've had him on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to him.</v>

98
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 2>He's a very bright and he had been on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show several great point.</v>

99
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very smart guy.</v>

100
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was on it,</v>

101
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 2>just what is on someone else's show </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

102
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:26.674
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the things I said in </v>

104
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:28.384
<v Speaker 2>the last podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if people decide that what </v>

105
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:32.284
<v Speaker 2>he did was offensive to them to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where they decided to not renew </v>

106
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 2>their subscriptions or not continue to </v>
<v Speaker 2>send him money through patriots,</v>

107
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the best use of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>format and the best way for them and the</v>

108
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 2>market to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>

109
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it should be done.</v>

110
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regarding the n word,</v>

111
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure Jamie will now double check</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying as he always does a,</v>

112
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>there was a dean</v>

113
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>at some university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think out maybe in Seattle,</v>

114
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at some point had suggested a,</v>

115
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.333
<v Speaker 1>someone had asked which book a student </v>
<v Speaker 1>that asks which book should I read or I </v>

116
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:10.904
<v Speaker 1>can't remember the exact story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the title of the book was </v>

117
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had,</v>

118
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I think the dean was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a woman,</v>

119
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

120
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>had simply recommended that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she said the word out loud said,</v>

121
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or she,</v>

122
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person's sex got into trouble.</v>

123
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we shouldn't just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>demystify this word in an if,</v>

125
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

126
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>if people weren't so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have to now say the n word,</v>

127
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to say the r word.</v>

128
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.104
<v Speaker 1>I got banned from twitter for 12 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>because at one point I was interacting </v>

129
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:55.901
<v Speaker 1>with some schmuck who I called retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the generate a whatever it was.</v>

130
00:06:59.121 --> 00:06:59.954
<v Speaker 1>I can remember the exact combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consulting and I was banned for using </v>

131
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 1>the r word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

132
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.380
<v Speaker 1>where does this anime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

133
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>how many more words do we have to remove</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the lexicon?</v>

134
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give these words so much power.</v>

135
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sensitive.</v>

136
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we've talked about these kinds of</v>

137
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 1>issues in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does it not seem too outrageous that</v>

138
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.180
<v Speaker 1>someone who recommends a book with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>title being the n word</v>

139
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.970
<v Speaker 3>gets into trouble and made some saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

140
00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:24.804
<v Speaker 3>as an even better one netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an executive at Netflix that </v>

141
00:07:28.111 --> 00:07:28.944
<v Speaker 3>was forced to resign due to my friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Seger is comedy special and my </v>

142
00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:39.861
<v Speaker 3>friend Tom Segura has a bit in his act </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how there's certain words that are</v>

143
00:07:42.241 --> 00:07:46.650
<v Speaker 3>just gone you can't use anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he says retard.</v>

144
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.760
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that word.</v>

145
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.920
<v Speaker 3>You can't use that word anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

146
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 3>and it's not about using that word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

147
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.420
<v Speaker 3>He's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not like,</v>

148
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.943
<v Speaker 3>he's not justifying the use of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just simply stating that this is a </v>

149
00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:00.864
<v Speaker 3>word that you could no longer use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they get attacked a bunch of letter </v>

150
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:09.030
<v Speaker 3>writing campaign from mental health </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations and you know,</v>

151
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:12.130
<v Speaker 3>people dealing with people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>disabilities and are saying that you're,</v>

152
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.183
<v Speaker 3>you're being abelist and your being </v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminatory and all these different </v>

153
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:16.620
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

154
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.360
<v Speaker 3>And they're basically trying to silence </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

155
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Even though if you look at the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>bid itself,</v>

156
00:08:21.031 --> 00:08:21.864
<v Speaker 3>he's not using it to describe a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just essentially it acknowledging </v>

157
00:08:25.921 --> 00:08:26.754
<v Speaker 3>that the word exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy who was an executive at </v>

158
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:30.534
<v Speaker 3>Netflix says in a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't use that word because that </v>

159
00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:36.084
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying nigger around black </v>

160
00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

161
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Just says that you're going to get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble now.</v>

162
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:44.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said it in the earlier show too.</v>

163
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying when I read Sargon of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our cods thing,</v>

164
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 3>I said it's preposterous to say the n </v>
<v Speaker 3>word and I've said the n word before and</v>

165
00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 3>in most cases I say it,</v>

166
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>but he actually said the word and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why he said the word,</v>

167
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:00.783
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I just said the word is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was trying to demonstrate </v>

168
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.733
<v Speaker 1>that this is an offensive thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like saying retard is just like saying </v>

169
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:08.874
<v Speaker 1>that he gets fired for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for simply making this comparison that </v>

170
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking about uncensored </v>

171
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

172
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.873
<v Speaker 1>this is a network that features that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were prominently on several different </v>

173
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>comedy specials in multiple situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's cat williams,</v>

174
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 1>multiple uses of the word Dave </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle.</v>

175
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean that word gets thrown about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a beach ball at a fucking concert.</v>

176
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.323
<v Speaker 1>That word gets tossed around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy saying it because he's </v>

177
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He enough of your work here,</v>

178
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of comedy and sort of political</v>

179
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 1>correctness with comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.493
<v Speaker 1>and in my forthcoming book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a section where I talk about </v>

181
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 1>professors who got into Trello.</v>

182
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.743
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've all heard about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians getting into trouble for </v>

183
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.340
<v Speaker 1>violating some politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim,</v>

184
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>but professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many cases,</v>

185
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.633
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high profile professors getting in </v>

186
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:08.154
<v Speaker 1>trouble for incredibly innocuous jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually I brought a list of names </v>

187
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>because I thought I might not remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

188
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Can I mentioned a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few of the cases.</v>

189
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 1>So Lasar Greenfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the,</v>

190
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:19.494
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president elect of the American College </v>

191
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Speaker 1>of surgeons and the editor and chief of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a journal called General Surgery News.</v>

192
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.403
<v Speaker 1>W had written an editorial a few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago where he was talking about the </v>

193
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.433
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant benefits of coming in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with sperm and other words at </v>

194
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.193
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was based on a peer reviewed </v>

195
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 1>scientific paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

196
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 1>two of the authors of that paper are </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks that I know quite well,</v>

197
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 1>friends of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had demonstrated that women who</v>

198
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:53.664
<v Speaker 1>have protected sex versus unprotected </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex and up scoring differently on these </v>

199
00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 1>depressive measures.</v>

200
00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.813
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some sort of protective </v>

201
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.720
<v Speaker 1>element to actually being exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sperm and so in his editorial,</v>

202
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 1>he made a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't during Valentine's,</v>

203
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.673
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now there is a gift that a man can </v>

204
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 1>give a woman that's beyond flowers or </v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolates or something to that effect.</v>

205
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.840
<v Speaker 1>He had to step down from being president</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the American College of surgeons.</v>

206
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:22.703
<v Speaker 1>He had to step down from being an editor</v>
<v Speaker 1>in chief because a whole bunch of women </v>

207
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 1>were very offended by that sperm joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

208
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:29.094
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

209
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.993
<v Speaker 1>the authors of the paper and question </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a brilliant response response </v>

210
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.050
<v Speaker 1>where they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

211
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.983
<v Speaker 1>how could he be treated in this way when</v>
<v Speaker 1>all he was doing is actually literally </v>

212
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:41.904
<v Speaker 1>reporting the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the findings from our peer reviewed </v>

213
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one example.</v>

214
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Another example is a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

215
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Hunt,</v>

216
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:53.380
<v Speaker 1>who was a Nobel Prize winner in 2001.</v>

217
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

218
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.760
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

219
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>who he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a speaking fee in Korea at a,</v>

220
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in science conference where he </v>

221
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.310
<v Speaker 1>very in a jocular way said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem when you have women </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your lab.</v>

223
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>They fall in love with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall in love with them,</v>

224
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 1>and so it's better to have segregated </v>
<v Speaker 1>labs.</v>

225
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 1>His wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

226
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:16.414
<v Speaker 1>is a staunch feminist who's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>prominent scientist and she confirmed </v>

227
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:21.100
<v Speaker 1>that he's hardly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:24.890
<v Speaker 1>a rabid sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went through all sorts of health.</v>

229
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

230
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And he was joking and he was joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I.</v>

231
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 1>In the book I discussed several other </v>
<v Speaker 1>other of these examples,</v>

232
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:31.894
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine you would think that a </v>

233
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.073
<v Speaker 1>unblemished exemplary career as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist up to getting a Nobel prize </v>

234
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.163
<v Speaker 1>could potentially protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one comment that someone decides </v>

235
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.353
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can unleashed a tsunami of outrage and </v>

236
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:48.964
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>

237
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is reacting to the </v>

238
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>people that are reacting to the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the common itself,</v>

239
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 1>it's the cowards that are running things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that give into that.</v>

240
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And the Netflix thing is particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing because it was internal,</v>

241
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.353
<v Speaker 1>it was people that were working in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>department that apparently went and </v>

242
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:08.584
<v Speaker 1>protested and they just decided that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>use was egregious and he shouldn't be </v>

243
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:15.140
<v Speaker 1>able to say those sounds with his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

244
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.243
<v Speaker 1>see I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of letters from people </v>

245
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:18.410
<v Speaker 1>asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

246
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm facing a similar situation.</v>

247
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:21.940
<v Speaker 1>What should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A professors out?</v>

248
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.163
<v Speaker 1>And my answer is fight back hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've had a couple of these </v>

249
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy on twitter,</v>

250
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:30.064
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who many refer to as a retard </v>

251
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started contacting my university,</v>

252
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.613
<v Speaker 1>trying to get me fired when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it wasn't working with his tagging </v>

253
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 1>my university on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually contacted the HR department,</v>

254
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Human Resources Department at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

255
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a random person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a troll?</v>

256
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.890
<v Speaker 1>You got in touch with a troll and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave him what he wanted attention.</v>

257
00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:55.510
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started to run with it.</v>

258
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 1>You basically gave him an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>score.</v>

259
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 1>It's playing a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

260
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.213
<v Speaker 1>But now here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university's hr person contacts me </v>

261
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:04.114
<v Speaker 1>after hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned this actually recently on </v>

262
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:07.390
<v Speaker 1>the Rubin report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

263
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.020
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

264
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 1>the lady in question contacts me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

265
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.430
<v Speaker 1>here's a complaint that's been filed </v>
<v Speaker 1>against you now.</v>

266
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>My first instinct was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

267
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:20.161
<v Speaker 1>someone in my job as a professor at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university has complained about me,</v>

268
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:22.150
<v Speaker 1>which I couldn't think who that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

269
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.860
<v Speaker 1>but I would think that that's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

270
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.850
<v Speaker 1>the template of their influence over me </v>
<v Speaker 1>would reside.</v>

271
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:28.803
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had actually taken seriously a </v>

272
00:14:31.361 --> 00:14:32.194
<v Speaker 1>random person on twitter contacting them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and filing a complaint under the guise </v>

273
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Speaker 1>of he's a student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

274
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:39.450
<v Speaker 1>he's not my student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

275
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a student,</v>

276
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs me in an alley to Mug me,</v>

277
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't fight back because Bruh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a student or I'm allowed to,</v>

278
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>to deck him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

279
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So this is a guy that I'm just having </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

280
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it</v>

281
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 2>with a smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going back and forth the size that</v>

282
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.890
<v Speaker 2>he's willing to go as far as try to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>me fine now,</v>

283
00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:58.724
<v Speaker 2>let's suppose that he had succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's suppose that I hadn't fought back </v>

284
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.220
<v Speaker 2>because basically what I did with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

285
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.073
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you literally thinking that it is </v>

286
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:06.284
<v Speaker 2>reasonable for you to be monitoring what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do on my twitter account and the </v>

287
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:12.140
<v Speaker 2>example I gave her as an analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

288
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.543
<v Speaker 2>if if I see you coming out of a pharmacy</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your daughter and I feel that </v>

289
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:17.924
<v Speaker 2>you're speaking to her in a current </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner that I don't agree with as a </v>

290
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 2>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I report you to the university?</v>

291
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And that pretty much ended the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation very quickly,</v>

292
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:26.324
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they felt sufficiently</v>
<v Speaker 2>embolden to actually reach out to me to </v>

293
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 2>address this complaint shows you how </v>
<v Speaker 2>chilling the environment is.</v>

294
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.080
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

295
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.490
<v Speaker 2>but let's play devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

296
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.583
<v Speaker 2>If I was someone who was taking your </v>
<v Speaker 2>class or if I was someone who is very </v>

297
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:48.734
<v Speaker 2>sensitive or someone who has certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideals and morals and the professor </v>

298
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 2>who's teaching the class that I take </v>
<v Speaker 2>called somebody a retard,</v>

299
00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just being honest and I love you.</v>

300
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.540
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

301
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is this guy doing that?</v>

302
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.813
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a stupid thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why are you engaging with these </v>

303
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:12.071
<v Speaker 2>people online and these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these base insults like that distasteful</v>

304
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 2>insults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

305
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.733
<v Speaker 2>And why engage with people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean literally the reason I do it </v>

306
00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:19.784
<v Speaker 2>as once in a while my wife falls asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like working on my </v>

307
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 2>scientific papers or my boat crash or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

308
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:26.084
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired and I'm on twitter and I hated</v>
<v Speaker 2>your advice to try to not engage with </v>

309
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

310
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Some idiots catches my eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gee,</v>

311
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.213
<v Speaker 2>I used the word idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to say idiot for some </v>

312
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:36.520
<v Speaker 2>strange reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

313
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.070
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't call them.</v>

314
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>So someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone or where it catches my attention</v>

315
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 2>and I decided to spar with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

316
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:44.594
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like to get into the octagon and do </v>

317
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.860
<v Speaker 2>an aspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go on twitter and I have fun with some</v>

318
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 2>idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

319
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 2>But when I just enjoy it and usually we </v>
<v Speaker 2>both laugh it off and we move on.</v>

320
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:55.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just part of my personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

321
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.603
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fun guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be deadly serious and very </v>

322
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 2>academic and scientific and as you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly pointed in the past,</v>

323
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 2>I could not take myself seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be just one of the guys,</v>

324
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.013
<v Speaker 2>so this is a manifestation of that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this person felt sufficiently in </v>

325
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 2>bolden and his indignation that he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to fire me.</v>

326
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 2>That's where you should be focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>

327
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:17.234
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he really felt so </v>

328
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:21.494
<v Speaker 2>emboldened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what it was is he recognized </v>

329
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 2>that there is a climate today where a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person like yourself,</v>

330
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.004
<v Speaker 2>who is a professor who uses a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>word that is deemed to be offensive by </v>

331
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:31.934
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he can call you on that word and </v>

332
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:34.454
<v Speaker 2>get you caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got caught up in a net of your own </v>

333
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

334
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

335
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still here smiling and looking fan,</v>

336
00:17:41.431 --> 00:17:43.380
<v Speaker 2>so that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do look tan?</v>

337
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.643
<v Speaker 2>Do you regret using that word at more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything I regret that ever get </v>

338
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 2>sucked</v>

339
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 3>into these battles?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it as much because again,</v>

340
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:55.810
<v Speaker 3>it's a slippery slope today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's retard tomorrow.</v>

341
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 3>It's more on the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's schmuck.</v>

342
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

343
00:17:58.231 --> 00:17:59.064
<v Speaker 3>that is true in terms of like were </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't understand calling someone </v>

344
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:04.344
<v Speaker 3>a retard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you're a 30 year old person </v>

345
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 3>today or 25 year old person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's try 25.</v>

346
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.760
<v Speaker 3>You realize that that is a forbidden </v>
<v Speaker 3>taboo when you and I were 25,</v>

347
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:16.770
<v Speaker 3>that word was nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

348
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 3>That word you would to get called it by </v>
<v Speaker 3>your teacher.</v>

349
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.983
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was new and it was known to be </v>

350
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:25.884
<v Speaker 3>someone who was retarding your growth or</v>
<v Speaker 3>retarding the class or saying things </v>

351
00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 3>that were retarding development of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

352
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.120
<v Speaker 3>and logic moving forward that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

353
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 3>you're a roadblock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a pile of rocks in the road,</v>

354
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking retard.</v>

355
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how people talked about it.</v>

356
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.823
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how they said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it's become a new word that's </v>

357
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:52.074
<v Speaker 3>victim to this war on words because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not saying you have down </v>

358
00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:56.604
<v Speaker 3>syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

359
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying is you're a dumb </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

360
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that terminology,</v>

361
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 3>like especially the word retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is not even used medically.</v>

362
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.883
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a word and the to say that </v>

363
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.813
<v Speaker 3>there's no nuance and this word cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>be used again about a really stupid </v>

364
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:16.850
<v Speaker 3>fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

365
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

366
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.213
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

367
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.063
<v Speaker 3>you probably know because I've sent you </v>
<v Speaker 3>some clips of my infant of soccer </v>

368
00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:23.640
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

369
00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I used to be a very serious soccer </v>
<v Speaker 3>player.</v>

370
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Now if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

371
00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:30.370
<v Speaker 3>you know this as someone who follows the</v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA,</v>

372
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of trash talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

373
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.970
<v Speaker 3>So the amount of nine this time nominate</v>
<v Speaker 3>professor and so on.</v>

374
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 3>But the amount of trash talking that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>both dished out and was the recipient of</v>

375
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.040
<v Speaker 3>actually allowed me to be a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>person today.</v>

376
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a form of antifragility,</v>

377
00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.271
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean by.</v>

378
00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:47.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

379
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.640
<v Speaker 3>so when you create a sanitized </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

380
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 3>you're creating a fragile system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're creating fragile human beings.</v>

381
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.730
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>

382
00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:57.683
<v Speaker 3>if the worst stain in my 54 years on </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth is that I use the word retard on </v>

383
00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:02.610
<v Speaker 3>this person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing pretty well.</v>

384
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's not the worst day,</v>

385
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.390
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

386
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.253
<v Speaker 3>It's not that it's not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason why it's a big deal is </v>

387
00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 3>because the climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

388
00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.900
<v Speaker 3>You know what you're saying is this is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid person.</v>

389
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.210
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not accusing him of having a.</v>

390
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.073
<v Speaker 3>you're not mocking a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mental disease or disorder genetic </v>

391
00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:20.334
<v Speaker 3>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not what you're saying and </v>

392
00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:22.734
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just decided that this is a </v>

393
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:24.654
<v Speaker 3>new word that is now taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A new sound you can't make with your </v>

394
00:20:26.881 --> 00:20:28.450
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

395
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 3>I want to move onto other chore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first I wanted to say that I was very</v>

396
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:34.890
<v Speaker 3>excited last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely different.</v>

397
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:38.790
<v Speaker 3>This is a very hard segue with last </v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

398
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:43.791
<v Speaker 3>one of my former professors at Cornell </v>
<v Speaker 3>won the Nobel Prize in economics.</v>

399
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.340
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First semester</v>

400
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 1>at Cornell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took his course.</v>

401
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 1>His name is Richard Thaler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should look into inviting them</v>

402
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:53.660
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

403
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll add an ofi he does a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

404
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:56.410
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

405
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.243
<v Speaker 1>he should do your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he won the Nobel prize for really </v>

406
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.453
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the area that I started off in before I </v>

407
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 1>developed all the evolutionary stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm most known for.</v>

408
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I came out of a tradition called </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral decision theory.</v>

409
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that ring a bell at all?</v>

410
00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that is at all?</v>

411
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

412
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.760
<v Speaker 1>So classical economists have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

413
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.130
<v Speaker 1>if you like stylized homo economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

414
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.003
<v Speaker 1>this vision of how someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational ought to behave and they are </v>

415
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 1>these axioms of rational choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

416
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.000
<v Speaker 1>if I prefer car a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>car B,</v>

417
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.160
<v Speaker 1>and I prefer carby to Carsey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must prefer car,</v>

418
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:36.650
<v Speaker 1>a third car.</v>

419
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.620
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

420
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.573
<v Speaker 1>that's called the transitivity action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who doesn't abide by this is </v>

421
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:43.720
<v Speaker 1>behaving irrationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I tell you,</v>

422
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.440
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of this hamburger that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has 90 percent fat free,</v>

423
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing as telling you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this hamburger has 10 percent fat.</v>

424
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Those are two isomorphic statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't alter your preference.</v>

425
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.323
<v Speaker 1>Yet we see repeatedly that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave in the manners prescribed by </v>

426
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.810
<v Speaker 1>classical economic theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

427
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.703
<v Speaker 1>by homework analogous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Dick Thaler is the gentleman who </v>

428
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.953
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated how many of these axioms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational choice are violated in </v>

429
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:13.930
<v Speaker 1>behavioral finance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for that,</v>

430
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:14.764
<v Speaker 1>he won the Nobel Prize in economics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he came after the ones who originally </v>

431
00:22:19.061 --> 00:22:24.061
<v Speaker 1>wanted in 2002 Daniel Conaman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably know his book thinking fast</v>

432
00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:25.740
<v Speaker 1>and slow is I ring the bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

433
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Daniel Conaman and his collaborator,</v>

434
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Amos Tversky were the pioneers of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

435
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's really the tradition that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out of.</v>

436
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.443
<v Speaker 1>My doctoral supervisor was part of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gang of guys who spent their careers </v>

437
00:22:38.771 --> 00:22:41.560
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating that classical economists </v>
<v Speaker 1>are wrong.</v>

438
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.873
<v Speaker 1>In my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became frustrated with that whole </v>

439
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:46.660
<v Speaker 1>paradigm because it became clear that </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

440
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 1>economists have it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many more demonstrations can we show</v>

441
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:51.664
<v Speaker 1>that they are wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was much more interested in knowing </v>

442
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 1>why the brain is structured the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is enhanced.</v>

443
00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.030
<v Speaker 1>That's how I got into evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

444
00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.313
<v Speaker 1>but I just thought that I would give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a shout out since he was a former </v>

445
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:02.680
<v Speaker 1>professor of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty awesome.</v>

446
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.543
<v Speaker 1>I'm just happy there's people out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure these things out so I </v>

447
00:23:05.681 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 1>can read what they say and repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm talking about.</v>

448
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back to target things being</v>

449
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:14.920
<v Speaker 1>fragile and antifragile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

450
00:23:14.921 --> 00:23:15.754
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really important point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Develop and I don't mean develop thick </v>

451
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:19.444
<v Speaker 1>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like become accustomed to racism or </v>

452
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:24.370
<v Speaker 1>sexism or homophobia or rudeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

453
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.463
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that we should just </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate those things and we shouldn't </v>

454
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.190
<v Speaker 1>seek to improve our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We definitely should.</v>

455
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.850
<v Speaker 1>But as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this celebration of all things,</v>

456
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>triggering this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting upset at every single thing</v>

457
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.750
<v Speaker 3>that comes your way and making it out to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be some massive complication.</v>

458
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.140
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a direct result of how easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>society is and how simple our lives are.</v>

459
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Complicated in intellectual ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated in emotional ways,</v>

460
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.413
<v Speaker 3>complicated in psychological ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think a lot of the way people </v>

461
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:08.234
<v Speaker 3>live their life is very unnatural but </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple in terms of not worrying about </v>

462
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 3>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not worrying about real violence,</v>

463
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:15.830
<v Speaker 3>not worrying about real strive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never worrying about food.</v>

464
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.963
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very rare that people in this </v>

465
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this day and age are starving.</v>

466
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.903
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge problem for most of human </v>

467
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:26.234
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of human civilization people had a </v>

468
00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 3>struggle to find food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

469
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:31.274
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very rare and I think all of these </v>

470
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:35.114
<v Speaker 3>things have led us to seek enemies where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are none and to go out and find </v>

471
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.350
<v Speaker 3>these problems that really are not that </v>
<v Speaker 3>big and make them out to be huge.</v>

472
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.223
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're fragile and you know </v>

473
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that let's.</v>

474
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why I like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression snowflake,</v>

475
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.373
<v Speaker 3>like some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people get really upset if you </v>

476
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:56.264
<v Speaker 3>throw that word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that every snowflake is </v>

477
00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:00.670
<v Speaker 3>unique and special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

478
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>

479
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 3>And that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are unique and special.</v>

480
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're just lazy.</v>

481
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.860
<v Speaker 3>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know this.</v>

482
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:14.861
<v Speaker 3>This is our word for word and say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>either</v>

483
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.543
<v Speaker 4>I could link what I just mentioned about</v>
<v Speaker 4>classical economists to the social </v>

484
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:25.210
<v Speaker 4>justice warrior ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So classical economists viewed the human</v>

485
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:30.140
<v Speaker 4>condition through very cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>calculational calculus.</v>

486
00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:33.770
<v Speaker 4>You certainly like humans are these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

487
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:34.853
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they instantiate these algorithms </v>

488
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 4>without any emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

489
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 4>If I prefer to be up for paccar beater </v>
<v Speaker 4>car seat,</v>

490
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 4>I much prefer a two car seats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All axioms of rational choice.</v>

491
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.523
<v Speaker 4>There are no emotions in these models.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the other end of that continuum lies </v>

492
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:51.074
<v Speaker 4>the social justice warrior because all </v>
<v Speaker 4>of life is through only the triggering </v>

493
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.023
<v Speaker 4>of the emotional system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no engagement with your </v>

494
00:25:58.821 --> 00:26:02.090
<v Speaker 4>cognitive resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all about outrage,</v>

495
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.920
<v Speaker 4>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frustration,</v>

496
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.500
<v Speaker 4>and so in a sense they're antithetical </v>
<v Speaker 4>to each other.</v>

497
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:09.340
<v Speaker 4>The classical economists and his world </v>
<v Speaker 4>view,</v>

498
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.273
<v Speaker 4>there are no emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The social justice warrior in his </v>

499
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 4>worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no cognition.</v>

500
00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:15.314
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the the right way to be is somewhere in </v>

501
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:18.044
<v Speaker 4>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The right way to be is to know when to </v>

502
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 4>engage your cognition and went to engage</v>
<v Speaker 4>your emotions.</v>

503
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the issue,</v>

504
00:26:23.681 --> 00:26:24.514
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that there's always the middle and </v>

505
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.280
<v Speaker 3>that things are rarely black and white </v>
<v Speaker 3>or one and zero often very complicated.</v>

506
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

507
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.550
<v Speaker 4>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going back to aristotle had argued about</v>

508
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.240
<v Speaker 4>sort of what we now with color,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would call the inverted u shape.</v>

509
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.160
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if most things,</v>

510
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 4>the middle is the right place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All things in moderation,</v>

511
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have too little of something,</v>

512
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 4>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have too much of something,</v>

513
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:50.784
<v Speaker 4>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somewhere in the middle is where the </v>

514
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:56.940
<v Speaker 4>right virtuous and aristotle had thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that several thousand years ago.</v>

515
00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:57.774
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you a specific example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if I've mentioned that </v>

516
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In this podcast.</v>

517
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 4>Perfectionism right follows an inverted </v>
<v Speaker 4>u shape.</v>

518
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.873
<v Speaker 4>If you have too little audit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not sufficiently detailed </v>

519
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:09.600
<v Speaker 4>oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your work suffers.</v>

520
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.640
<v Speaker 4>If you have too much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I'm happy not happy on.</v>

521
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:14.723
<v Speaker 4>This police report is me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it could be stunting because I </v>

522
00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:19.284
<v Speaker 4>checked my work 73,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>times before I sent it off because God </v>

523
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:23.604
<v Speaker 4>forbid I might have a comma wrong that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there is some happy medium of proof </v>

524
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 4>on the perfectionism scale where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>should all strive to be.</v>

525
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:33.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aristotle said that for most traits,</v>

526
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 4>that's where the optimal is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the inflection point is.</v>

527
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.400
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

528
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.623
<v Speaker 3>I'm not one to argue against aristotle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were gonna say you're not </v>

529
00:27:46.351 --> 00:27:47.184
<v Speaker 3>one to argue against me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not one to argue against either one </v>

530
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:51.820
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

531
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.653
<v Speaker 3>I just think most issues that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing for or against one of the real </v>

532
00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 3>problems is that they are married to </v>
<v Speaker 3>their initial point.</v>

533
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they argue that looking for a </v>

534
00:28:05.661 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 3>victory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to move a ball across the</v>

535
00:28:07.951 --> 00:28:11.250
<v Speaker 3>line and they do it by any means </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary,</v>

536
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:12.563
<v Speaker 3>including by mislabeling people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by mischaracterizing your positions on </v>

537
00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:18.264
<v Speaker 3>things and categorizing you in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>really easy to dismiss place like you </v>

538
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:25.500
<v Speaker 3>are all right or you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

539
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.633
<v Speaker 3>you're a fringe right person or I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people have been called a Nazi </v>

540
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 3>over the last couple of years you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been called the Nazi.</v>

541
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.560
<v Speaker 4>So when I was supposed to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and August 2017,</v>

542
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.213
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a event titled The stifling of Free </v>

543
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Speech on university campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was on a university campus.</v>

544
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 4>It was shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The irony was hilarious.</v>

545
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.470
<v Speaker 4>It was with myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson,</v>

546
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.433
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another clinical psychologist or an MFA </v>

547
00:28:54.781 --> 00:28:56.130
<v Speaker 4>and faith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goldie,</v>

548
00:28:56.131 --> 00:28:57.810
<v Speaker 4>a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

549
00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.400
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

550
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.210
<v Speaker 4>and then we held the event about three </v>
<v Speaker 4>months later,</v>

551
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:08.270
<v Speaker 4>but the people who shut us down had put </v>
<v Speaker 4>out a facebook page where they said,</v>

552
00:29:08.521 --> 00:29:13.170
<v Speaker 4>we don't want these white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nazis and Toronto.</v>

553
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.440
<v Speaker 4>This is to a Jewish person who escaped </v>
<v Speaker 4>persecution in Lebanon.</v>

554
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.023
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

555
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.460
<v Speaker 4>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cute.</v>

556
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.700
<v Speaker 3>It's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

557
00:29:22.701 --> 00:29:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't,</v>

558
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.050
<v Speaker 3>they can't be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is not,</v>

559
00:29:26.051 --> 00:29:27.620
<v Speaker 3>they don't honestly believe what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

560
00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:29.990
<v Speaker 3>but they don't care because they're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to move that ball.</v>

561
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:30.883
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that that's tolerated in </v>

562
00:29:33.141 --> 00:29:33.974
<v Speaker 3>that not just tolerated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it actually influenced your speech </v>

563
00:29:37.131 --> 00:29:41.240
<v Speaker 3>and you guys weren't allowed to put on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that event being shame.</v>

564
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.290
<v Speaker 3>Shame on the university for giving in </v>
<v Speaker 3>shame on them,</v>

565
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:45.124
<v Speaker 3>for not putting their foot down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shame on them for not examining who you </v>

566
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who Jordan is,</v>

567
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.570
<v Speaker 3>who one of those people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and realizing,</v>

568
00:29:51.571 --> 00:29:53.380
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're lying you,</v>

569
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:54.243
<v Speaker 3>you are a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You calling these people white </v>

570
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:57.004
<v Speaker 3>supremacists and Nazis your a problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're a liar and you're defaming </v>

571
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 3>these per.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is defamation.</v>

572
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 3>This is your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your light bulb.</v>

573
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.733
<v Speaker 3>This is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is something that we </v>

574
00:30:07.451 --> 00:30:08.284
<v Speaker 3>should shun,</v>

575
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.433
<v Speaker 4>but I think it speaks to what you said </v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier when you said it's all about </v>

576
00:30:11.721 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 4>winning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting the ball across a.</v>

577
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:14.703
<v Speaker 4>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another thing that I talk about </v>

578
00:30:15.891 --> 00:30:16.724
<v Speaker 4>in the book is the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ontological ethics and </v>

579
00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:20.384
<v Speaker 4>consequentialist ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The anthological ethics is where you </v>

580
00:30:22.641 --> 00:30:26.390
<v Speaker 4>have moral absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is always wrong to lie.</v>

581
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.980
<v Speaker 4>That will be at the into logical </v>
<v Speaker 4>statement.</v>

582
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.770
<v Speaker 4>A consequentialist bent would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

583
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:34.130
<v Speaker 4>it depends on what the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the liat is,</v>

584
00:30:34.131 --> 00:30:34.650
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

585
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.610
<v Speaker 4>if it were to spare someone's feelings </v>
<v Speaker 4>than it might've been okay to lie.</v>

586
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I argue that a lot.</v>

587
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.863
<v Speaker 4>The problem with a lot of these enemies </v>
<v Speaker 4>of reason is that they have a </v>

588
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.480
<v Speaker 4>consequentialist relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth,</v>

589
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:50.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if you violate truth,</v>

590
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.720
<v Speaker 4>if there is some greater goal that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are pursuing.</v>

591
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.840
<v Speaker 4>Whereas I come from a deontological </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective when it comes to truth.</v>

592
00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Truth is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter who,</v>

593
00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.523
<v Speaker 4>whose feelings it hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I truly think certainly as a </v>

594
00:31:02.691 --> 00:31:03.524
<v Speaker 4>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you truly have to have a the </v>

595
00:31:05.571 --> 00:31:06.404
<v Speaker 4>anthological relationship with truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is precisely why when a lot of </v>

596
00:31:09.291 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 4>people ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think that there is for a bit,</v>

597
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.320
<v Speaker 4>and I think we even mentioned that last </v>
<v Speaker 4>time I was on your show 16 months ago.</v>

598
00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.483
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there any forbidden knowledge that </v>

599
00:31:17.601 --> 00:31:18.434
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't do as a scientist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my answer is always an unequivocal </v>

600
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:25.100
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as you are a honest,</v>

601
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:26.703
<v Speaker 4>adherent to the scientific method,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be allowed to traverse any </v>

602
00:31:30.621 --> 00:31:32.690
<v Speaker 4>intellectual landscapes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Intellectual</v>

603
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:33.543
<v Speaker 3>landscapes can be problematic when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with things that are very </v>

604
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:39.160
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A big one is Iq,</v>

605
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:40.383
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant one and that one has </v>

606
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.560
<v Speaker 3>triggered so many accusations of racism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

607
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:52.370
<v Speaker 4>whether it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a gentleman,</v>

608
00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:54.950
<v Speaker 4>I just covered him on my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my youtube channel.</v>

609
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His name is.</v>

610
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.880
<v Speaker 4>I think noah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carl.</v>

611
00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:03.470
<v Speaker 4>He's a young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think postdoc at Cambridge University,</v>

612
00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.693
<v Speaker 4>who from all I know is a very reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 4>gentleman who had been invited to speak </v>

613
00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:13.790
<v Speaker 4>at a conference on intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because of that,</v>

614
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.923
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of folks decided to put together</v>
<v Speaker 4>an open letter arguing that Cambridge </v>

615
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.640
<v Speaker 4>University should not hire this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so on.</v>

616
00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.880
<v Speaker 4>This has now become the standard way by </v>
<v Speaker 4>which the baits are our resolve.</v>

617
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 4>You signed these open letters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for,</v>

618
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.940
<v Speaker 4>had another guy on and you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely check this guy out.</v>

619
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.170
<v Speaker 4>His name is Alice stromeyer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

620
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:41.030
<v Speaker 4>he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know this case?</v>

621
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.163
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a physicist at the University of </v>

622
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Pisa who was also a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a research scientist at cern,</v>

623
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nuclear research center in Geneva.</v>

624
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.310
<v Speaker 4>He was invited to speak at a gender and </v>
<v Speaker 4>theoretical physics conference.</v>

625
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Everything is about identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course the narrative was going to</v>

626
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:03.280
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

627
00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:05.670
<v Speaker 4>women are discriminated against in </v>
<v Speaker 4>physics and you know,</v>

628
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 4>we need to help them improve their lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>and physics and so on.</v>

629
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:13.880
<v Speaker 4>So he got up and he presented </v>
<v Speaker 4>bibliometric data.</v>

630
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:15.320
<v Speaker 4>So let me just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for your viewers,</v>

631
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 4>explain what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll metric data is,</v>

632
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:22.340
<v Speaker 4>is a data that quantifies science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

633
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:25.880
<v Speaker 4>if I want to know which disciplines </v>
<v Speaker 4>sites,</v>

634
00:33:25.881 --> 00:33:26.714
<v Speaker 4>which other discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will look at citation patterns across </v>

635
00:33:29.091 --> 00:33:31.090
<v Speaker 4>disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does economics oversight physics,</v>

636
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.800
<v Speaker 4>physics oversights a economics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

637
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.753
<v Speaker 4>So bibliometric data is a way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>parametrized science and so what he did </v>

638
00:33:38.211 --> 00:33:40.820
<v Speaker 4>is he looked at for a given job in </v>
<v Speaker 4>physics,</v>

639
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.210
<v Speaker 4>if a woman gets a job versus if a man </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets a job,</v>

640
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.670
<v Speaker 4>how many citations did they have?</v>

641
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:48.110
<v Speaker 4>Citations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>

642
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 4>How many other people have cited your </v>
<v Speaker 4>work when you published it?</v>

643
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.270
<v Speaker 4>So you and I might have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have published 50 papers each,</v>

644
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.160
<v Speaker 4>but you've been cited 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

645
00:33:55.161 --> 00:33:55.994
<v Speaker 4>I've been cited 2000 times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore your work is more influential </v>

646
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.280
<v Speaker 4>even though we've both published the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same amount of papers and he,</v>

647
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.420
<v Speaker 4>he showed through very objective data </v>
<v Speaker 4>that for a given position,</v>

648
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:10.630
<v Speaker 4>women were getting the jobs at much </v>
<v Speaker 4>lower citations while that was construed</v>

649
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:12.644
<v Speaker 4>as terribly offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terribly sexist Nazi like and so over </v>

650
00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:22.901
<v Speaker 4>1600 scientists using the the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Appalachian particles for justice.</v>

651
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.073
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you can go particles for just </v>

652
00:34:30.381 --> 00:34:31.640
<v Speaker 4>young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie can check it out.</v>

653
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:32.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can,</v>

654
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:35.270
<v Speaker 4>you can read their letter and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>includes,</v>

655
00:34:35.271 --> 00:34:40.271
<v Speaker 4>I think one or two of your former guests</v>
<v Speaker 4>who have become a very antiphonal auntie</v>

656
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.700
<v Speaker 4>fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not Antifa,</v>

657
00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:44.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

658
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 4>because to me they're sounding like </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual cowards and Fools.</v>

659
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:50.510
<v Speaker 4>Who were these people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

660
00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:53.370
<v Speaker 4>I think one of them is Sean Carroll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

661
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:54.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

662
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:56.160
<v Speaker 4>I think he's been on several times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

663
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.480
<v Speaker 4>So he's on that list and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to misspeak,</v>

664
00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:02.210
<v Speaker 4>but I think maybe Neil degrasse Tyson is</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>

665
00:35:02.211 --> 00:35:03.380
<v Speaker 4>but maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that one,</v>

666
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.530
<v Speaker 4>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

667
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll hold off on that one.</v>

668
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.590
<v Speaker 4>But definitely Sean Carroll is on it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've even tagged him and I said,</v>

669
00:35:09.591 --> 00:35:10.460
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on my show.</v>

670
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:11.294
<v Speaker 4>That's discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the letter was basically it starts </v>

671
00:35:14.211 --> 00:35:17.360
<v Speaker 4>off and it says we will not tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

672
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:18.940
<v Speaker 4>Someone within our community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

673
00:35:18.941 --> 00:35:19.774
<v Speaker 4>I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will question the humanity of anyone </v>

674
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 4>based on their race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their gender,</v>

675
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 4>their gender orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did no such thing.</v>

676
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.023
<v Speaker 4>All he did was report bibliometric data </v>
<v Speaker 4>to either support the contention that </v>

677
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 4>women in physics were being </v>
<v Speaker 4>discriminated against or not.</v>

678
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 4>That</v>

679
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 2>should not yield a an open letter that </v>
<v Speaker 2>chastises him and the way that they did,</v>

680
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.520
<v Speaker 2>not the only thing that he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrectly and my view,</v>

681
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 2>and he's admitted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came on my show recently at one point</v>

682
00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:53.334
<v Speaker 2>during the presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he showed his bibliometric profile </v>

683
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Speaker 2>versus to other women that had gotten a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job over him,</v>

684
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.820
<v Speaker 2>so he personalized it and and and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

685
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Some people thought that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate and that's fair.</v>

686
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:10.104
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not a nice thing to do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>present your cv versus someone else and </v>

687
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:17.790
<v Speaker 2>a public conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can discuss that,</v>

688
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.953
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that we can't use </v>
<v Speaker 2>bibliometric objective scientific data </v>

689
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:27.620
<v Speaker 2>to either prove or disprove a narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>is insane and yet 1600 people decided to</v>

690
00:36:28.681 --> 00:36:30.600
<v Speaker 2>sign that letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That does seem ridiculous,</v>

691
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:32.850
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's an accusatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

692
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.340
<v Speaker 2>You're accusing people of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination and then the,</v>

693
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 2>the scientific data shows otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what they're looking for,</v>

694
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:41.520
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

695
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.353
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for an equal amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>female physicists and solid that that's </v>

696
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 2>you just you're not going to get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>equal amount of people interested in it,</v>

697
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:50.034
<v Speaker 2>so then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to show is you have to </v>

698
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:52.074
<v Speaker 2>determine that there's been something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's holding those people back from </v>

699
00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:55.314
<v Speaker 2>achieving that goal because if some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a concerted effort to keep women out </v>

700
00:36:57.901 --> 00:36:58.734
<v Speaker 2>of that field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what should be demonstrated and </v>

701
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:03.930
<v Speaker 2>when you demonstrate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think here's the,</v>

702
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.420
<v Speaker 2>here's the glass half full version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

703
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at that big blue biblio </v>
<v Speaker 2>metric data.</v>

704
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.523
<v Speaker 2>What that shows is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraging women to get into this </v>

705
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 2>because it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That instead of them being held back,</v>

706
00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:17.451
<v Speaker 2>they're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

707
00:37:17.451 --> 00:37:21.240
<v Speaker 2>they're looking to even out the playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>field and help these women along.</v>

708
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.690
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is then it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>it look like the women aren't as capable</v>

709
00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:25.524
<v Speaker 2>as the medics that were not as effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the men with their work and you know </v>

710
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.610
<v Speaker 2>that's bad for everybody.</v>

711
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.640
<v Speaker 2>That's bad for women and for men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for science because it makes it</v>

712
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:35.250
<v Speaker 2>look like you're not being objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what all we want.</v>

713
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Every everyone who's not a scientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>like myself,</v>

714
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:42.270
<v Speaker 2>what I want more than anything is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you're.</v>

715
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:43.104
<v Speaker 2>If you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know that what you're telling </v>

716
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:45.894
<v Speaker 2>me is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I don't want is your own political </v>

717
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:50.274
<v Speaker 2>spin on that fact because you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be criticized at work by radical </v>

718
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:53.964
<v Speaker 2>feminists or radical leftist or any </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that might in some way </v>

719
00:37:57.481 --> 00:38:02.481
<v Speaker 2>potentially misconstrue your actions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts as being sexist or what,</v>

720
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.500
<v Speaker 2>or fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobic,</v>

721
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:05.430
<v Speaker 2>transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

722
00:38:05.431 --> 00:38:06.960
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>scared of.</v>

723
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.153
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I want to hear is that you're </v>

724
00:38:10.111 --> 00:38:10.944
<v Speaker 2>looking at reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are brilliant women out there </v>

725
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:14.723
<v Speaker 2>that's brilliant men out there and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those brilliant women choose not to </v>

726
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:22.281
<v Speaker 2>do the same fields is brilliant men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as no one's holding them back,</v>

727
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.233
<v Speaker 2>that shouldn't be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is got to be in someone </v>

728
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.500
<v Speaker 2>being held back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone discriminating,</v>

729
00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:32.334
<v Speaker 2>someone trying to keep you out and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to demonstrate </v>

730
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure</v>

731
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 1>that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that exists.</v>

732
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's women out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are hearing this right now that have </v>

733
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 1>experienced all sorts of discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual discrimination,</v>

734
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:43.894
<v Speaker 1>sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have their own personal </v>

735
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is true,</v>

736
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 1>but that is not necessarily why the data</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflects that.</v>

737
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 1>There's more men that are successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>

738
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.393
<v Speaker 1>It could seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what people are really </v>

739
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.040
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously represented.</v>

740
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 1>There's differences in the sexist and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that's so hard to.</v>

741
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:04.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so hard from the first time I </v>

742
00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 1>think that I came on your show when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably first discussed my evolutionary</v>

743
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 1>psychology research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

744
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:11.584
<v Speaker 1>it's a fundamental tenant of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary theory that there are </v>

745
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:16.960
<v Speaker 1>sexual dimorphism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I appeared in front of the Canadian</v>

746
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.793
<v Speaker 1>Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to sit there and lecture these </v>

747
00:39:19.021 --> 00:39:21.460
<v Speaker 1>senators that there is such a thing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>male or female,</v>

748
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:22.743
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while many of them scoffed and laughed </v>

749
00:39:24.491 --> 00:39:26.370
<v Speaker 1>and tried to mock me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

750
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.230
<v Speaker 1>it turns out a few days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's now an elementary school.</v>

751
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:33.190
<v Speaker 1>You're teaching young kids that boys to </v>
<v Speaker 1>menstruate.</v>

752
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.270
<v Speaker 1>So literally every satirical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every s,</v>

753
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.283
<v Speaker 1>I always joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say that I have prophetic </v>

754
00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:45.271
<v Speaker 1>satire because every time I try to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>for something that is so outlandish that</v>

755
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 1>it can enter into my satire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two months,</v>

756
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:50.500
<v Speaker 1>three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight months later,</v>

757
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:51.760
<v Speaker 1>it proves to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

758
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:52.594
<v Speaker 1>at one point I argued that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete in the octogenarian under 120 </v>

759
00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:00.274
<v Speaker 1>pound category in the judo cause you </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify first because I that the files </v>

760
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 1>add 20 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also I'm trans gravity.</v>

761
00:40:07.181 --> 00:40:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I set my weight at whatever my weight is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there therefore,</v>

762
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.093
<v Speaker 1>and then because I can change my </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity on a daily basis because </v>

763
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:15.934
<v Speaker 1>Harvard University thought is that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>later going to fight in the under 18 </v>

764
00:40:20.841 --> 00:40:22.030
<v Speaker 1>year old category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

765
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Harvard allows you to change it on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily basis.</v>

766
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.713
<v Speaker 1>Harvard University came out that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually discussed this in my Canadian </v>

767
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Senate testimony.</v>

768
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.343
<v Speaker 1>Harvard University's Lgbtq a a plus a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus stars infinite to the Hashtag </v>

769
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.420
<v Speaker 1>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

770
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.600
<v Speaker 1>They came out with a pamphlet that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only can we change our heart,</v>

771
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:48.330
<v Speaker 1>our gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can fluctuate on a daily basis.</v>

772
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could be he she or Monday,</v>

773
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday.</v>

774
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.870
<v Speaker 1>And so I took this idea and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

775
00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I identify as an 80 year old under 120 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound Monday,</v>

776
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.670
<v Speaker 1>but then I'm going to fight in the judo </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

777
00:41:03.671 --> 00:41:04.504
<v Speaker 1>I use Judah because my brother was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympian in judo as I think we might </v>

778
00:41:06.921 --> 00:41:07.754
<v Speaker 1>have this discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fight and the under eight </v>

779
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:14.290
<v Speaker 1>category on Tuesday because I self </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify on Tuesday as being a child now</v>

780
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:19.291
<v Speaker 1>it sounds satirical and insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Dutch gentlemen who's 69 years old,</v>

781
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.123
<v Speaker 1>did you know the ages and he just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decided that he identifies with </v>

782
00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:30.350
<v Speaker 1>someone 20 years younger and he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it on dating apps and changes,</v>

783
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 1>and then that would change his pension </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

784
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

785
00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:34.960
<v Speaker 1>it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then.</v>

786
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.103
<v Speaker 1>Then I introduced a new term and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that proved to be prophetically </v>

787
00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:40.043
<v Speaker 1>satirical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I coined a new condition called </v>

788
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.900
<v Speaker 1>transgenderism by proxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

789
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:47.803
<v Speaker 1>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

790
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.790
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're watching now,</v>

791
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.330
<v Speaker 1>enjoy this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Joe and God have sex,</v>

792
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.660
<v Speaker 1>if I self identify you as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm engaging in heterosexual sex.</v>

793
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's not about me self identify me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

794
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I can change my identity exactly on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own interpretations of.</v>

795
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

796
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.173
<v Speaker 1>it's not that my self identity changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a woman that the guy that I'm </v>

797
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:14.510
<v Speaker 1>having sex with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I self identify as a female.</v>

798
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks,</v>

799
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe not even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks later,</v>

800
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 1>some trans activists on twitter came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

801
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 1>ew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>

802
00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:24.434
<v Speaker 1>Transphobes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you have a excuse the term </v>

803
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 1>a dick in your mouth doesn't mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a dick.</v>

804
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:33.940
<v Speaker 1>If it's a woman and I called this trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

805
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:39.440
<v Speaker 1>cunnilingus volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it's a dick.</v>

806
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.630
<v Speaker 1>If that person that identifies as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

807
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 1>so just because you have a dick in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>

808
00:42:44.121 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it's a deck because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a woman.</v>

809
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.530
<v Speaker 1>You are giving sex to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

810
00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a nine inch penis in your.</v>

811
00:42:50.221 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 1>In your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a vagina.</v>

812
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Yale put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put tampons in the men's room.</v>

813
00:42:55.371 --> 00:42:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

814
00:42:56.331 --> 00:42:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I said that not only women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I.</v>

815
00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:00.890
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my.</v>

816
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.170
<v Speaker 1>That's my daily life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called Tuesday for me,</v>

817
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.013
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time getting that out </v>

818
00:43:05.481 --> 00:43:08.620
<v Speaker 1>because of my women aren't the only ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>who menstruate.</v>

819
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:09.680
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes they are.</v>

820
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

821
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:12.120
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

822
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Boys can have periods to children to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught the latest victory for trend.</v>

823
00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how they say that.</v>

824
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 1>The latest victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

825
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Latest victory for who wrote that story?</v>

826
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Who wrote that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vox.</v>

827
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Halena.</v>

828
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Hey Halena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off.</v>

829
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.100
<v Speaker 1>That's not a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>

830
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 1>That is God damn nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can I tell you what's not victory?</v>

831
00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:36.320
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids.</v>

832
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.453
<v Speaker 1>Kids don't know if you want to tell kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes people are born in the </v>

833
00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 1>wrong bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be true.</v>

834
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be real evidence to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the way the brain works.</v>

835
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

836
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:53.890
<v Speaker 1>if you want to call it the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing it from normalcy in a way</v>

837
00:43:58.101 --> 00:43:59.770
<v Speaker 1>that makes it look inferior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

838
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the real problem?</v>

839
00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:02.294
<v Speaker 1>So if someone has this condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't feel inferior and you </v>

840
00:44:05.241 --> 00:44:06.074
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be bigoted towards them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't live in a being exposed </v>

841
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:10.064
<v Speaker 1>to any of discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we shouldn't change our </v>

842
00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 1>understanding of reality to celebrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your unique personhood.</v>

843
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incidentally,</v>

844
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I talk about in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

845
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.113
<v Speaker 1>all of these idea pathogens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I argue some of them come from really </v>

846
00:44:23.271 --> 00:44:24.870
<v Speaker 1>noble places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high strung,</v>

847
00:44:24.871 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 1>so as well.</v>

848
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's cover a few of these.</v>

849
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:27.891
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

850
00:44:27.891 --> 00:44:30.860
<v Speaker 1>the empty slate premise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tabula Rasa,</v>

851
00:44:30.861 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 1>we're with empty minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a profoundly idiotic position,</v>

852
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:35.993
<v Speaker 1>but it really stems from the noble </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeful position that if we're all born </v>

853
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:40.794
<v Speaker 1>with equal potentiality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could all reach the same end </v>

854
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:44.544
<v Speaker 1>trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If only the environment were conducive </v>

855
00:44:46.681 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 1>for us being top athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top scientists stopped mathematicians,</v>

856
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.293
<v Speaker 1>then we would have reached it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing inherently at the </v>

857
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:54.144
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at t equals zero that differentiates of </v>

858
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.100
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insanely stupid and wrong.</v>

859
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.230
<v Speaker 1>But it is a hopeful message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

860
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 1>extend this to other contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

861
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.273
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be that you're defined by </v>

862
00:45:06.301 --> 00:45:09.240
<v Speaker 1>your biological sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could change it in any way you want.</v>

863
00:45:09.241 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 1>That sounds very liberating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

864
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.160
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of these idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathogens,</v>

865
00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:17.610
<v Speaker 1>what I call these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these parasitic ideas really come from a</v>

866
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:18.444
<v Speaker 1>notion of trying to liberate people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they're the shackles of </v>

867
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:23.274
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

868
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of,</v>

869
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:30.720
<v Speaker 1>of delusional thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is rooted in its genesis,</v>

870
00:45:30.721 --> 00:45:32.420
<v Speaker 1>comes from a good place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

871
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree with that more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender dysphoria used to be considered a</v>

872
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.690
<v Speaker 1>used to be considered a mental disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

873
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.190
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

874
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is it?</v>

875
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest,</v>

876
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 1>if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

877
00:45:48.931 --> 00:45:50.970
<v Speaker 1>is it a physical disorder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

878
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it in a very charitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically correct way.</v>

879
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not part of the default </v>
<v Speaker 1>value of human expressions.</v>

880
00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Male and female is the default values.</v>

881
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:03.534
<v Speaker 1>We are a sexually dimorphic species now </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all sorts of reasons until genetic </v>

882
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:08.784
<v Speaker 1>developmental reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the brain is getting typed in </v>

883
00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:11.514
<v Speaker 1>Utero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things can happen that altered those </v>

884
00:46:14.701 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 1>default values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you come out with gender dysphoria.</v>

885
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be discriminated against.</v>

886
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 1>You should be treated with complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

887
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:22.223
<v Speaker 1>You should be free of bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that there is a </v>

888
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of possibilities of which that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one is one of the default values.</v>

889
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.570
<v Speaker 1>It's simply isn't it's wrong to argue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

890
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:34.703
<v Speaker 1>but in the same way that feminists like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to argue that there are no innate sex </v>

891
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:42.441
<v Speaker 1>differences because that they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>would help alter the sexist status quo.</v>

892
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.790
<v Speaker 1>This is what's happening with Trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>Activism.</v>

893
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 1>That's why they are consequentialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to truth,</v>

894
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:50.820
<v Speaker 1>screw truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw reality,</v>

895
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:55.821
<v Speaker 1>screw biological common sense in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of freeing the world of bigotry.</v>

896
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:58.703
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to free the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political bigotry without constantly </v>

897
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:03.540
<v Speaker 1>attacking truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

898
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and here's the other question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it is not,</v>

899
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:08.070
<v Speaker 1>this is what I was getting at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

900
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.380
<v Speaker 1>if it's not a mental disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is.</v>

901
00:47:12.381 --> 00:47:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Is it a physical disorder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a disorder at all,</v>

902
00:47:14.881 --> 00:47:17.790
<v Speaker 1>and if it's not a disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why must it be treated medically?</v>

903
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Why must it be gender reassignment </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery?</v>

904
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Why must there be exogenous hormones </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced into the body?</v>

905
00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Why is all that happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhetorical question or are you asking me</v>

906
00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.240
<v Speaker 1>to just</v>

907
00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.840
<v Speaker 3>walk up to them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

908
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:33.400
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of rhetorical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one here,</v>

909
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:34.234
<v Speaker 3>but if it's not a disorder than why are </v>
<v Speaker 3>these gender reassignment physicians </v>

910
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

911
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have to have a sex change </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a woman.</v>

912
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 3>If you're a woman with a big Dick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>broad shoulders and a big hairy chest,</v>

913
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.620
<v Speaker 3>but you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

914
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:50.913
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the need for the doctor then if </v>

915
00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:55.420
<v Speaker 3>you're already a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we decided that you're a woman,</v>

916
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.373
<v Speaker 3>so you just want to change your </v>
<v Speaker 3>appearance to outwardly match how you </v>

917
00:48:00.761 --> 00:48:01.450
<v Speaker 3>feel.</v>

918
00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 4>Well that seems a disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder.</v>

919
00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't want to misspeak,</v>

920
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 4>but I wonder if.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in the DSM five,</v>

921
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:12.160
<v Speaker 4>gender dysphoria is listed as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition.</v>

922
00:48:12.161 --> 00:48:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that correct?</v>

923
00:48:13.021 --> 00:48:13.650
<v Speaker 4>It is</v>

924
00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:14.483
<v Speaker 3>it as a condition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not accepted by that in terms </v>

925
00:48:17.031 --> 00:48:17.864
<v Speaker 3>of public perception and certainly in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of trans activists or lbgt </v>

926
00:48:22.791 --> 00:48:26.420
<v Speaker 3>activists or anybody who talks about </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things in a progressive way,</v>

927
00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.493
<v Speaker 3>that is a taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the actual medical nomenclature </v>

928
00:48:30.501 --> 00:48:33.440
<v Speaker 3>that's used to describe those conditions</v>
<v Speaker 3>is taboo.</v>

929
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

930
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you heard about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>

931
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:36.603
<v Speaker 4>There was a physician research </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists at Brown University who </v>

932
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 4>published a paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very serious data scientific data.</v>

933
00:48:44.561 --> 00:48:47.170
<v Speaker 4>I think her name is Lisa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Simple or liberal.</v>

934
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember her name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

935
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.290
<v Speaker 4>it was published I think in a plus one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

936
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 4>very serious scientific journal where </v>
<v Speaker 4>she looked at the social contagion.</v>

937
00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:01.270
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a sort of transgenderism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

938
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.120
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there definitely seems to beat well.</v>

939
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.313
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally that is social contagion </v>

940
00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 4>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that paper was published,</v>

941
00:49:08.681 --> 00:49:09.514
<v Speaker 4>Brown had advertised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was published in a Peer Review </v>

942
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:18.870
<v Speaker 4>Journal while the Trans activist game </v>
<v Speaker 4>after that paper and Brown decided to at</v>

943
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:23.050
<v Speaker 4>least pull it off of it's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>promotional plan.</v>

944
00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.910
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I reached out actually to,</v>

945
00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I think her name is Lisa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get her on the show,</v>

946
00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:30.600
<v Speaker 4>but as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was a bit tested.</v>

947
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:32.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's probably shell shocked.</v>

948
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:34.330
<v Speaker 4>She's shellshocked and so I'm not sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>if she'll come,</v>

949
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.373
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a serious person who probably </v>

950
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 4>isn't as liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a,</v>

951
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.780
<v Speaker 4>she's a physician who deals with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues,</v>

952
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:41.883
<v Speaker 4>who was simply talking about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's definitely a social </v>

953
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:48.390
<v Speaker 4>contagion effect that is taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's the Nazi.</v>

954
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:51.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people just</v>

955
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:54.790
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really crazy when it comes to gender.</v>

956
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.013
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be the battle ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the battle ground between logic and </v>

957
00:49:58.841 --> 00:49:59.674
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It rests in gender and I have this </v>

958
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:06.721
<v Speaker 3>conversation with a friend of mine about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gender pay gap and he was arguing it</v>

959
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.483
<v Speaker 3>as if it was a thing where there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man and a woman working right next to </v>

960
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 3>each other doing the same job and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman was making seventy eight cents.</v>

961
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:20.650
<v Speaker 3>The man is making a dollar and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart guy and I had to explain to him,</v>

962
00:50:20.651 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not the case.</v>

963
00:50:22.121 --> 00:50:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing different jobs.</v>

964
00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.140
<v Speaker 3>They're working different hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

965
00:50:26.141 --> 00:50:27.200
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're spitting out.</v>

966
00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Propaganda is</v>

967
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 2>if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was reluctant to believe me.</v>

968
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:32.420
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you serious?</v>

969
00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 2>He any leary said this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

970
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:36.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be very upset if I find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're,</v>

971
00:50:36.891 --> 00:50:37.970
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're lying to me.</v>

972
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I go that I'm lying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

973
00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 2>this is adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

974
00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:42.860
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what the fuck you're</v>

975
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:46.580
<v Speaker 2>talking about and you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset if you find out that online,</v>

976
00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be upset if you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking apologized to me when I show you</v>

977
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:50.820
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

978
00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 2>so I know he did not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent him the information,</v>

979
00:50:53.811 --> 00:50:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I sent him many articles on it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent him many critiques of the way.</v>

980
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Even the president of United States was </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing this because they're doing it</v>

981
00:51:01.161 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 2>in a very politically correct way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually disingenuous.</v>

982
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I showed him the actual raw data that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that men work an average of.</v>

983
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.053
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the percentage is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more hours that they are more likely to </v>

984
00:51:14.151 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 2>die on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pick more risky jobs.</v>

985
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:17.684
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not discounting actual sexual </v>

986
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:22.640
<v Speaker 2>discrimination at work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure exists,</v>

987
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.980
<v Speaker 2>but this is not when you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the raw data,</v>

988
00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:28.310
<v Speaker 2>which is what they're trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seventy eight cents to a dollar.</v>

989
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.550
<v Speaker 2>They're saying this is just systemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism across the board.</v>

990
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.473
<v Speaker 2>There's no other explanation for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I showed him know there is other </v>

991
00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:38.150
<v Speaker 2>explanations form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different jobs.</v>

992
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.790
<v Speaker 2>It's working different hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

993
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.760
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a bunch of factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone making you more aggressive,</v>

994
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:46.980
<v Speaker 2>making you more risk of or more a risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>taker.</v>

995
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Risk taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of different factors.</v>

996
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:51.613
<v Speaker 2>His response was sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception of something is as important </v>

997
00:51:54.741 --> 00:51:55.574
<v Speaker 2>as the fact I'm like you motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come to your house and </v>

998
00:51:57.651 --> 00:51:59.270
<v Speaker 2>smack you in the face in front of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

999
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.233
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting that you say this </v>

1000
00:52:01.491 --> 00:52:06.260
<v Speaker 2>because what you are trying to do there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is use information.</v>

1001
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.333
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it's tsunami of information to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to move away from is anchored </v>

1002
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:10.394
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that I discussed in </v>

1003
00:52:11.781 --> 00:52:12.614
<v Speaker 2>great detail in my book and I think I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to a similar realization to you </v>

1004
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:20.510
<v Speaker 2>regrettably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that is that oftentimes all the</v>

1005
00:52:20.511 --> 00:52:22.370
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is not going to help.</v>

1006
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to lose.</v>

1007
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:28.400
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to lose and it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're putting your hands in your lap.</v>

1008
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:29.563
<v Speaker 2>What he was trying to find a way to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>by him saying that perception is </v>

1009
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:35.690
<v Speaker 2>sometimes more important than the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>

1010
00:52:35.691 --> 00:52:36.524
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to say that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to say that women are </v>

1011
00:52:39.051 --> 00:52:39.884
<v Speaker 2>discriminated against because these </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts are paraded around in a way that </v>

1012
00:52:44.451 --> 00:52:45.284
<v Speaker 2>make women feel bad and because women </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel bad that they're making seventy </v>

1013
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 2>eight cents to the man's dollar.</v>

1014
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:53.990
<v Speaker 2>That is just as important as the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality of how much they make.</v>

1015
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

1016
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:57.290
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just spun a Web.</v>

1017
00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.200
<v Speaker 2>You spun a bullshit web and your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your legs are all trapped up in it.</v>

1018
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:01.250
<v Speaker 2>You can't go anywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1019
00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.800
<v Speaker 2>it speaks to another thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed in the book.</v>

1020
00:53:03.801 --> 00:53:06.080
<v Speaker 2>So are you familiar with poppers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falsification,</v>

1021
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:06.914
<v Speaker 2>principal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1022
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:09.320
<v Speaker 2>So Karl popper was a philosopher of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

1023
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 2>As a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to read most philosophers because</v>

1024
00:53:13.131 --> 00:53:13.964
<v Speaker 2>they engage in a lot of highfalutin </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit that really doesn't get us </v>

1025
00:53:16.221 --> 00:53:17.054
<v Speaker 2>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but philosophers of science actually </v>

1026
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:22.190
<v Speaker 2>quite helpful and that they really help </v>
<v Speaker 2>us understand the epistemology of how to</v>

1027
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.380
<v Speaker 2>learn about knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create knowledge,</v>

1028
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.393
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

1029
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>and so Karl</v>

1030
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.790
<v Speaker 4>popper argued that if you really want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>test a theory,</v>

1031
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.653
<v Speaker 4>you have to be able to falsify the </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory that which cannot be falsified </v>

1032
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:35.460
<v Speaker 4>cannot be considered a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>

1033
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:37.950
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the observation is this way,</v>

1034
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:38.963
<v Speaker 4>it supports the theory of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>observation is this way at falsifies a </v>

1035
00:53:41.491 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1036
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 4>fate is not a scientific theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1037
00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:49.200
<v Speaker 4>Because if I step out of my house today </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the truck hits me,</v>

1038
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.183
<v Speaker 4>it was my faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I step out of my house and the truck </v>

1039
00:53:52.111 --> 00:53:53.580
<v Speaker 4>doesn't hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was my faith.</v>

1040
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 4>So there are no conditions of the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>where whatever is instantiated is not my</v>

1041
00:53:57.961 --> 00:53:59.010
<v Speaker 4>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>

1042
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.030
<v Speaker 4>fatalism is not part of the epistemology</v>
<v Speaker 4>of science.</v>

1043
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:04.050
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1044
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:06.120
<v Speaker 4>so to speak to that point that we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about earlier,</v>

1045
00:54:06.121 --> 00:54:08.040
<v Speaker 4>how when someone is anchored in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>

1046
00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:09.180
<v Speaker 4>you can get them away from it.</v>

1047
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:10.283
<v Speaker 4>So I talk and I have a section of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>book that is currently titled All Roads </v>

1048
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Lead to bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1049
00:54:14.821 --> 00:54:16.830
<v Speaker 4>so let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A few examples of these.</v>

1050
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:22.820
<v Speaker 4>If you say that you don't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>sex with overweight women,</v>

1051
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.040
<v Speaker 4>grossly overweight women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>500 pound women,</v>

1052
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:28.380
<v Speaker 4>then the argument is you're a fattest </v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1053
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 4>You are judging us based on the folds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>our skin and you're demonizing us.</v>

1054
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.773
<v Speaker 4>If you are someone who is specifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking to have sex with someone who is </v>

1055
00:54:38.221 --> 00:54:41.490
<v Speaker 4>overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are fetishizing our skin folds.</v>

1056
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.730
<v Speaker 4>So if I love having sex with a fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

1057
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.653
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I don't want to have sex with a fat </v>

1058
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bad person.</v>

1059
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.553
<v Speaker 4>And I demonstrate through many of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>examples how all roads lead to </v>

1060
00:54:53.011 --> 00:54:53.844
<v Speaker 4>victimhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1061
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.773
<v Speaker 4>I give the example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the last time I was on the show </v>

1062
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:59.760
<v Speaker 4>have a woman who had done a study </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrating that,</v>

1063
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1064
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 4>soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Israeli soldiers,</v>

1065
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.180
<v Speaker 4>had never raped a Palestinian woman.</v>

1066
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that case?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did.</v>

1067
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:08.723
<v Speaker 4>Now she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had done the study hoping to show </v>

1068
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:12.450
<v Speaker 4>that there was rampant rape of senior </v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

1069
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:13.463
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't uncover a single documented</v>
<v Speaker 4>case of a Palestinian woman being raped </v>

1070
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:20.490
<v Speaker 4>by IDF soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Israeli Defense Forces,</v>

1071
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 4>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you conclude from that?</v>

1072
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:23.783
<v Speaker 4>While the IDF soldiers are so racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they demonize these women so much </v>

1073
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.510
<v Speaker 4>that they're not even worthy of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>raped.</v>

1074
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:33.660
<v Speaker 4>So if you rape the Palestinian women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're an evil Jew.</v>

1075
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 4>If you don't rape any of the Palestinian</v>
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>

1076
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:40.290
<v Speaker 4>you're an evil Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so through all of these examples,</v>

1077
00:55:40.291 --> 00:55:45.150
<v Speaker 4>I demonstrate that all states of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world lead to you being a bigot.</v>

1078
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.180
<v Speaker 4>And that if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fails poppers,</v>

1079
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:49.210
<v Speaker 4>falsification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>principle,</v>

1080
00:55:49.211 --> 00:55:50.230
<v Speaker 4>because I kept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1081
00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Except the state of not choosing it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meaning meaning if you like,</v>

1082
00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.183
<v Speaker 3>if you don't choose between a fat woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>or if you don't love a fat woman or you </v>

1083
00:56:03.081 --> 00:56:04.760
<v Speaker 3>don't not want to have sex with a fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1084
00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:06.980
<v Speaker 3>you just have sex with anyone who wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have sex with you.</v>

1085
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the equal outcome.</v>

1086
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:11.083
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially that's what they're looking </v>

1087
00:56:11.931 --> 00:56:12.764
<v Speaker 3>for it because if you don't choose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's really interesting about </v>

1088
00:56:17.181 --> 00:56:21.080
<v Speaker 3>people is if someone doesn't have your </v>
<v Speaker 3>principals ideologically,</v>

1089
00:56:21.081 --> 00:56:22.820
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to shit on them and body </v>
<v Speaker 3>shamed them.</v>

1090
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Like how many people called</v>

1091
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.963
<v Speaker 1>Trump's disgusting and made fun of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>little hands and how many liberals left </v>

1092
00:56:27.691 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 1>wing people's talking about how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

1093
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.230
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Ha must obviously have a little dick.</v>

1094
00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1095
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:34.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1096
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:35.730
<v Speaker 1>it's horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy is across both aisles,</v>

1098
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:39.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:40.413
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you want to get into </v>

1100
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:42.394
<v Speaker 1>this at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1101
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.130
<v Speaker 1>what did you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a bit old news now,</v>

1102
00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:45.790
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1103
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 1>what'd you think of some of our common </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends?</v>

1104
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:51.370
<v Speaker 1>His response to the threat cavenaugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

1105
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:56.410
<v Speaker 1>our common friends responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of some of our common friends,</v>

1106
00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I thought the not respond well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did not follow the into logical,</v>

1107
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 1>he fails as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for example.</v>

1108
00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:08.080
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presumption of innocence,</v>

1109
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:13.030
<v Speaker 1>it should be something that is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>profoundly a nonstarter in terms of ever</v>

1110
00:57:13.031 --> 00:57:13.864
<v Speaker 1>violating that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tenant that to the extent that we </v>

1111
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:18.154
<v Speaker 1>didn't come infinitely close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing that he was guilty of </v>

1112
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:25.210
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nonstarter that you don't.</v>

1113
00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:26.373
<v Speaker 1>There is no repercussions that should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed him and yet many folks that </v>

1114
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.570
<v Speaker 1>both of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1115
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:33.670
<v Speaker 1>we're not of that opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1116
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of our friends thought that,</v>

1117
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't a criminal case,</v>

1118
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.273
<v Speaker 1>this was a job interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we don't need to reach the same </v>

1119
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 1>exact thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of evidence,</v>

1120
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 1>evidence to determine for him to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially guilty.</v>

1121
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was grotesque who said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1122
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name rhymes with Sham Paris.</v>

1123
00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:58.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people were rightly concerned </v>

1124
00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:05.370
<v Speaker 1>about Cavanaugh's ideology in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his record on privacy.</v>

1125
00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his promotion of the Patriot Act.</v>

1126
00:58:08.951 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of issues that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>had real concern.</v>

1127
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Those seem to go away while this was all</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

1128
00:58:15.671 --> 00:58:16.504
<v Speaker 1>which is really confusing to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's real reasons to be </v>

1129
00:58:18.671 --> 00:58:21.340
<v Speaker 1>concerned about this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Jordan Jordan said,</v>

1130
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.233
<v Speaker 1>put out a tweet and I might've been the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first one to two a critique him for </v>

1131
00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:30.610
<v Speaker 1>where he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Kevin is confirmed,</v>

1132
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.180
<v Speaker 1>he should step down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that that was insane.</v>

1133
00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did he say?</v>

1134
00:58:36.391 --> 00:58:37.420
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1135
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequently he said,</v>

1136
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a thought experiment and no,</v>

1137
00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:44.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no thought experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1138
00:58:44.501 --> 00:58:45.334
<v Speaker 1>I mean there wasn't any sane person </v>
<v Speaker 1>would think that someone coming out 36 </v>

1139
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:53.794
<v Speaker 1>years after the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes before there's going to be </v>

1140
00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:59.020
<v Speaker 1>the volt saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1141
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.100
<v Speaker 1>somewhere somehow someplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not sure he may have been.</v>

1142
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:03.934
<v Speaker 1>The one is not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was saying he may have been the one </v>

1143
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 1>she was saying he was the one and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying that he covered her mouth and</v>

1144
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:14.450
<v Speaker 1>that he was trying to get her pants on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was wearing a one piece swimsuit</v>

1145
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.210
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read into it.</v>

1146
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem.</v>

1147
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what happened other than</v>

1148
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.910
<v Speaker 3>her and him and both of them are dealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with 36 year old memory,</v>

1149
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:29.010
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've already said this on my show.</v>

1150
00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.130
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was in 1983.</v>

1151
00:59:32.131 --> 00:59:37.131
<v Speaker 4>I was at summer camp and Hillary Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 4>took me to the side and had my way.</v>

1152
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.990
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure it was 1983 maybe in 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had her way with you.</v>

1153
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:43.170
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:45.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it was hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure.</v>

1155
00:59:45.551 --> 00:59:47.860
<v Speaker 4>Uproot kindness kind of confident was </v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

1156
00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1157
00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:50.843
<v Speaker 4>Elizabeth Loftus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is someone that I know well who's a </v>

1158
00:59:53.131 --> 00:59:53.964
<v Speaker 4>professor at Uc Irvine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is the preeminent researcher on </v>

1159
00:59:58.441 --> 01:00:01.540
<v Speaker 4>memory and eye witness testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1160
01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.440
<v Speaker 4>as someone who has demonstrated through </v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

1161
01:00:04.441 --> 01:00:09.441
<v Speaker 4>many decades of research that our memory</v>
<v Speaker 4>is unbelievably inaccurate.</v>

1162
01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.183
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our ability to remember sort of to </v>

1163
01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.080
<v Speaker 4>identify someone in I testimony four </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks ago is unbelievably suspect,</v>

1164
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.300
<v Speaker 4>let alone 36 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

1165
01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:25.530
<v Speaker 4>So where was the science?</v>

1166
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.653
<v Speaker 3>Let me pause right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there are traumatic events that </v>

1167
01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:32.990
<v Speaker 3>you can remember very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particularly if someone tries to assault</v>

1168
01:00:32.991 --> 01:00:36.440
<v Speaker 3>you or something happens to you that did</v>
<v Speaker 3>get seared into your brain.</v>

1169
01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.870
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1170
01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:39.890
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1171
01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:41.870
<v Speaker 3>I remember being beat up when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

1172
01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ever being humiliated.</v>

1173
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.460
<v Speaker 3>My step dad and mom wasn't even really </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat up.</v>

1174
01:00:46.461 --> 01:00:47.294
<v Speaker 3>My Kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll hit me like once or twice or </v>

1175
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:49.520
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't do anything about it.</v>

1176
01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I froze and I remember my stepdad came </v>
<v Speaker 3>and rescued me.</v>

1177
01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't remember all the details,</v>

1178
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 3>but I do remember that I felt humiliated</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that I lost.</v>

1179
01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:00.740
<v Speaker 3>And I do remember that my Stepdad had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rescue me.</v>

1180
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:01.783
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can remember stuff from 36 </v>

1181
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:05.750
<v Speaker 3>years ago is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is possible.</v>

1182
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.440
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with this story is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were drinking.</v>

1183
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 3>There were underage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were really young.</v>

1184
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.093
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're dealing with all these </v>

1185
01:01:17.781 --> 01:01:18.614
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some sort of interaction </v>

1186
01:01:21.471 --> 01:01:23.270
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1187
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:27.860
<v Speaker 3>was she somewhat willing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will she somewhat into him?</v>

1188
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Was she completely resistant to it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1189
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.840
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know,</v>

1190
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.800
<v Speaker 3>but there's no demonstrated pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him doing awful things.</v>

1191
01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:42.080
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a couple,</v>

1192
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:47.170
<v Speaker 3>at least two people that had completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>fraudulent claims that came out and they</v>

1193
01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:49.910
<v Speaker 3>were ideologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologically opposed to him.</v>

1194
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.230
<v Speaker 3>So they had concocted these stories that</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned out to fall apart.</v>

1195
01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Here's my feeling on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone does that intentionally,</v>

1196
01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:01.040
<v Speaker 3>they should receive the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>punishment.</v>

1197
01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:03.920
<v Speaker 3>I could not agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone would get,</v>

1198
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.143
<v Speaker 3>if they were convicted of those acts </v>
<v Speaker 3>written an article on this actually </v>

1199
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:08.640
<v Speaker 3>strips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

1200
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.120
<v Speaker 3>if you falsely accuse someone of rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally,</v>

1201
01:02:11.121 --> 01:02:14.600
<v Speaker 3>falsely accuse someone of rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are literally subjecting them to the</v>

1202
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:17.300
<v Speaker 3>punishment of rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if the prosecution goes through?</v>

1203
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 3>What if that person winds up getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>incarcerated,</v>

1204
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>locked in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated from their family,</v>

1205
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>kids taken away their ability to earn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>living?</v>

1206
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>You should be treated the same way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to get them to be treated.</v>

1207
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it is almost an equal act to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape itself.</v>

1208
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hope I almost,</v>

1209
01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I hope not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have physical violence.</v>

1210
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go further than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's going to get me into trouble.</v>

1211
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.473
<v Speaker 1>I almost would argue that it is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabolical because the rapist does a </v>

1212
01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:43.734
<v Speaker 1>horrific act on you once every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning that you wake up as a false </v>

1213
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.193
<v Speaker 1>accuser knowing that you have put this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person in prison and you go about your </v>

1214
01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:54.354
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaging in this form of rape if </v>

1215
01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:56.664
<v Speaker 1>you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would disagree with that because I </v>

1216
01:02:58.081 --> 01:02:58.914
<v Speaker 1>think if you rape someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person who got raped has to deal </v>

1217
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:02.304
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real pain of being physically </v>

1218
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:05.060
<v Speaker 1>violated.</v>

1219
01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.700
<v Speaker 1>The guy who was in prison for 25 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>in getting raped by seven guys,</v>

1220
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>guys got to learn how to fight and keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>your butt cheeks closed and keep moving.</v>

1221
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:15.780
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them are awful.</v>

1222
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I think the rapist is far more awful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's physically doing something.</v>

1223
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy on my show maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had maybe not as many people as you</v>

1224
01:03:23.671 --> 01:03:24.504
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've had quite a few amazing people </v>

1225
01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:26.484
<v Speaker 1>on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most poignant ones was a </v>

1226
01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 1>gentleman that I invited and I was lucky</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he accepted my invitation.</v>

1227
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is David Mccallum.</v>

1228
01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Mccallum a sort of maybe last January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had just.</v>

1229
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.373
<v Speaker 1>He had been released from I think almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>three decades in prison for a murder </v>

1230
01:03:45.061 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 1>that came up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't him who did it.</v>

1231
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why I invited him a more than</v>

1232
01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:51.534
<v Speaker 1>just because it's an incredible story is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had seen his response to the </v>

1233
01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable injustice that he had gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

1234
01:03:59.100 --> 01:03:59.933
<v Speaker 1>I think he went in when he was 17 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now he was in his late forties and he </v>

1235
01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:08.160
<v Speaker 1>had such grace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such lack of anger.</v>

1236
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:09.623
<v Speaker 1>I mean it literally was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was Buddha and so I thought how </v>

1237
01:04:12.691 --> 01:04:13.524
<v Speaker 1>powerful it would be to have this person</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on my show if only to tap into </v>

1238
01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:19.380
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

1239
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I told them,</v>

1240
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I think on the show that if it were me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be so eaten up by anger,</v>

1241
01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>by a sense of revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to burn the whole planet down a.</v>

1242
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great guy.</v>

1243
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:34.670
<v Speaker 1>You should definitely check him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's written a book about it.</v>

1244
01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>It's really an amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1245
01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:37.733
<v Speaker 1>False accusations are awful and and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are people who lie to try to </v>

1246
01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:43.734
<v Speaker 1>punish someone who didn't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an awful crime and I think it </v>

1247
01:04:47.011 --> 01:04:47.844
<v Speaker 1>should be equal in punishment to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime that you are falsely accusing </v>

1248
01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>someone of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1249
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:53.993
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the only way to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem was with false rape </v>

1250
01:04:57.091 --> 01:04:57.924
<v Speaker 1>accusations is that there's very little </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment at all that happens to the </v>

1251
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:03.390
<v Speaker 1>women for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the men,</v>

1252
01:05:03.391 --> 01:05:06.000
<v Speaker 1>men who are accused men of falsely </v>
<v Speaker 1>raping them.</v>

1253
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.820
<v Speaker 1>There's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very little happen.</v>

1254
01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that is?</v>

1255
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

1256
01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:12.054
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it as the horrific thing </v>

1257
01:05:14.131 --> 01:05:16.890
<v Speaker 1>that it actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's partly because people are</v>

1258
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.550
<v Speaker 3>of doubting someone who has been raped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

1259
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.660
<v Speaker 3>One of the more horrific things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do is like imagine if you had been</v>

1260
01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:26.494
<v Speaker 3>raped and then you told your story and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>came along and I have no knowledge of </v>

1261
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:34.360
<v Speaker 3>the actual event and I come along and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1262
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.970
<v Speaker 3>God's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is bullshit.</v>

1263
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:39.190
<v Speaker 3>It never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing happened to him,</v>

1264
01:05:39.191 --> 01:05:41.530
<v Speaker 3>he's just a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just wants attention.</v>

1265
01:05:41.531 --> 01:05:44.830
<v Speaker 3>So he's running around here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was wearing a short skirt and he went</v>

1266
01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:46.980
<v Speaker 3>out that night and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

1267
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:52.170
<v Speaker 3>that is something that does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that is so disgusting.</v>

1268
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Someone who doubts someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually been a victim,</v>

1269
01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.173
<v Speaker 3>that people are scared of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also there's the kid gloves </v>

1270
01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:01.594
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't treat women accusing men of </v>

1271
01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:09.511
<v Speaker 3>things the same way we accused women </v>
<v Speaker 3>accused men accusing women of things.</v>

1272
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.060
<v Speaker 3>Men accusing women to things where if a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man accuses a woman of violence,</v>

1273
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:15.850
<v Speaker 3>will you okay dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be fine.</v>

1274
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:18.730
<v Speaker 3>If a woman beats up her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which does happen.</v>

1275
01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:19.923
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know a guy whose girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to punch the shit out of him and I </v>

1276
01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:22.960
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

1277
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 3>you got to get out like you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're literally being abused.</v>

1278
01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:27.403
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being domestically abused and no </v>

1279
01:06:29.801 --> 01:06:31.900
<v Speaker 3>one's even going to care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand that?</v>

1280
01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:34.030
<v Speaker 3>You've got to get out of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship because look,</v>

1281
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:36.370
<v Speaker 3>if you are hitting her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a man is hitting a woman,</v>

1282
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:39.370
<v Speaker 3>then I'm locked that motherfucker up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel,</v>

1283
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:41.830
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure that's how you feel too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a piece of shit.</v>

1284
01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:43.590
<v Speaker 3>But if a woman hits a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1285
01:06:43.591 --> 01:06:44.800
<v Speaker 3>just keep your hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1286
01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:45.634
<v Speaker 3>Don't let her hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1287
01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is from me.</v>

1288
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.260
<v Speaker 3>A man whose friend was murdered by his </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>

1289
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.080
<v Speaker 3>One of my good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1290
01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Phil Hartman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More by his wife.</v>

1291
01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:02.350
<v Speaker 3>So this is a woman who was always </v>
<v Speaker 3>insulting him,</v>

1292
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:07.530
<v Speaker 3>always publicly humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saw this during her publicly humiliated,</v>

1293
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.310
<v Speaker 3>insult him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sought many times.</v>

1294
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.940
<v Speaker 3>She's a very angry person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a cocaine problem.</v>

1295
01:07:12.941 --> 01:07:16.450
<v Speaker 3>She was also on Zoloft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want some sort of a settlement with</v>

1296
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:17.284
<v Speaker 3>zoloft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The family did because she was doing </v>

1297
01:07:18.581 --> 01:07:22.750
<v Speaker 3>cocaine and Zoloft at the same time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's known to have a psychotic reaction,</v>

1298
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 3>but she shot him in his fucking sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1299
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:26.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women do commit violence.</v>

1300
01:07:26.591 --> 01:07:29.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not as common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still gross.</v>

1301
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:29.943
<v Speaker 3>It's still an egregious crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but good luck trying to go get someone </v>

1302
01:07:32.351 --> 01:07:33.184
<v Speaker 3>locked up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck getting anybody to be </v>

1303
01:07:34.991 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 3>sympathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even me.</v>

1304
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:37.083
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1305
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:37.880
<v Speaker 3>not that I have your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1306
01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.410
<v Speaker 3>I met your wife.</v>

1307
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:40.210
<v Speaker 3>She's a lovely woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she kicked your ass,</v>

1308
01:07:40.211 --> 01:07:42.210
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably be on her side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're probably wondering how.</v>

1309
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.140
<v Speaker 3>How is someone so gorgeous as her choose</v>
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>

1310
01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking that I know.</v>

1311
01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Have you out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you buddy.</v>

1312
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.420
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to actually share with you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

1313
01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:57.040
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping to only discuss this for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to only see it in the book,</v>

1314
01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 3>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You open me up,</v>

1315
01:07:59.291 --> 01:08:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't help but cheer.</v>

1316
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 3>I came close to probably being a victim </v>
<v Speaker 3>of some very serious.</v>

1317
01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:08.920
<v Speaker 3>I've never been sexually abused or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

1318
01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:12.270
<v Speaker 3>but I think I escaped one narrowly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1319
01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 3>when I was a child in Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1320
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 3>so this was during</v>

1321
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.340
<v Speaker 4>the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all discussed in the intro to my</v>

1322
01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:20.750
<v Speaker 4>forthcoming book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1323
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.393
<v Speaker 4>it was during the height of the Ami,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the start of the civil war where nobody </v>

1324
01:08:26.151 --> 01:08:27.110
<v Speaker 4>would leave the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1325
01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.340
<v Speaker 4>everybody's been butchered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

1326
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:28.881
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and center.</v>

1327
01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:31.790
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to leave Lebanon for </v>
<v Speaker 4>obvious reasons.</v>

1328
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:34.790
<v Speaker 4>My father had been stuck out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

1329
01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:38.210
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't get back into Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was myself,</v>

1330
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:39.710
<v Speaker 4>my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1331
01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:40.583
<v Speaker 4>I believe my sister was there and a male</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend of ours who was stuck at our </v>

1332
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the middle of the night there's a</v>

1333
01:08:47.121 --> 01:08:50.960
<v Speaker 4>knock on our door now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is in the middle of the most brutal</v>

1334
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:53.510
<v Speaker 4>civil war you could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if somebody knocks at your door,</v>

1335
01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:56.450
<v Speaker 4>it's usually not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

1336
01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.810
<v Speaker 4>I go to the door to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking about remembering,</v>

1337
01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.190
<v Speaker 4>you were saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1338
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm 11 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1339
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:06.080
<v Speaker 4>or at least at the cusp of turning 11,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1340
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:07.250
<v Speaker 4>I get to the door.</v>

1341
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Who is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1342
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.733
<v Speaker 4>the gentleman says it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember if his name was </v>

1343
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the two.</v>

1344
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:15.140
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so and so.</v>

1345
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.690
<v Speaker 4>Who's this now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the time in Lebanon,</v>

1346
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.553
<v Speaker 4>in our kitchen we had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember how in restaurants in </v>

1347
01:09:20.811 --> 01:09:23.930
<v Speaker 4>the old days you'd have these in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bathrooms,</v>

1348
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:28.190
<v Speaker 4>you'd have these sort of towels that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could use to wipe your hands?</v>

1349
01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1350
01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.510
<v Speaker 4>not disposable time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual cloth towels.</v>

1351
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.793
<v Speaker 4>So we had a service where this gentleman</v>
<v Speaker 4>with come and in our kitchen we had one </v>

1352
01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:41.540
<v Speaker 4>of these days he would pick them up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>launder them,</v>

1353
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.493
<v Speaker 4>and then bring them back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this gentleman who that's our only </v>

1354
01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:45.344
<v Speaker 4>relationship with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knocks at our door with some other guys </v>

1355
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.511
<v Speaker 4>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1356
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 4>open the door now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is in the middle of the civil war.</v>

1357
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:55.850
<v Speaker 4>Now if at that moment I opened that </v>
<v Speaker 4>door,</v>

1358
01:09:55.851 --> 01:09:58.100
<v Speaker 4>if I don't have the instinct to go call </v>
<v Speaker 4>my mother,</v>

1359
01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the trajectory would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

1360
01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:05.150
<v Speaker 4>so I go to get my mother and now the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy's growing more insistent.</v>

1361
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:06.643
<v Speaker 4>We call anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole interaction that takes </v>

1362
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we refuse to open the door for him.</v>

1363
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:14.870
<v Speaker 4>At the time there was still some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>police presence in Lebanon.</v>

1364
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:16.103
<v Speaker 4>The unit used to be called 16 in Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The number 16 maybe for the precinct or </v>

1365
01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:21.950
<v Speaker 4>whatever we call them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They come over,</v>

1366
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:25.580
<v Speaker 4>the guy comes in and the the policeman </v>
<v Speaker 4>says to him,</v>

1367
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:26.443
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knocking on people's door in the middle </v>

1368
01:10:28.621 --> 01:10:29.960
<v Speaker 4>of the civil war says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1369
01:10:29.961 --> 01:10:34.700
<v Speaker 4>we went up to the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We brought some Pama grades for them and</v>

1370
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:35.534
<v Speaker 4>so the police man looks at him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know these people other than </v>

1371
01:10:39.141 --> 01:10:43.160
<v Speaker 4>changing their towel in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this brutal civil war.</v>

1372
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.310
<v Speaker 4>You're coming here to give them these </v>
<v Speaker 4>fruits.</v>

1373
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.020
<v Speaker 4>If I ever catch you here again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1374
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.240
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the guy looks at us and says,</v>

1375
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:55.970
<v Speaker 4>I'll be back for you or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

1376
01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.013
<v Speaker 4>And within a week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the exact time period </v>

1377
01:10:58.581 --> 01:11:00.710
<v Speaker 4>we had left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm almost certain,</v>

1378
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm surmising,</v>

1379
01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:07.430
<v Speaker 4>but I'm almost certain that this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>with his buddies was coming over,</v>

1380
01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:12.670
<v Speaker 4>not because he wanted to share a coffee </v>
<v Speaker 4>and cookies and my feeling is some bad</v>

1381
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 1>stuff would have happened that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But through the grace of the cosmos,</v>

1382
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>we were protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because I've.</v>

1383
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:20.754
<v Speaker 1>I've often been asked what was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scariest moment you had in the civil </v>

1384
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were many,</v>

1385
01:11:24.991 --> 01:11:26.370
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things that I saw,</v>

1386
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:27.204
<v Speaker 1>but nothing scared me as much as that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction because I sort of pretty </v>

1387
01:11:31.981 --> 01:11:32.814
<v Speaker 1>much knew what was in store for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dehumanizing that happens during war </v>

1388
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>leads to all sorts of horrific acts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1389
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:41.480
<v Speaker 1>it's disgusting and scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1390
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:42.151
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1391
01:11:42.151 --> 01:11:43.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably dodged a bullet.</v>

1392
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I related the logical and we're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate to have left.</v>

1393
01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:47.523
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been asked to go back to </v>

1394
01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Lebanon many times and at this point by </v>
<v Speaker 1>some pretty prominent people,</v>

1395
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:56.700
<v Speaker 1>big politicians and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really have a mental block.</v>

1396
01:11:56.701 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I even get Lebanese folks saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1397
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know people who will protect you.</v>

1398
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1399
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:02.813
<v Speaker 1>Do you live in Canada?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Announced one of the greatest countries </v>

1400
01:12:04.171 --> 01:12:05.460
<v Speaker 1>in the world's ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1401
01:12:05.461 --> 01:12:06.241
<v Speaker 1>Go back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1402
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys come to me.</v>

1403
01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Come visit Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Fuck Outta here.</v>

1404
01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Toronto's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes it.</v>

1405
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite cities.</v>

1406
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I love about it,</v>

1407
01:12:17.191 --> 01:12:20.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like a big city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people are friendly,</v>

1408
01:12:20.611 --> 01:12:22.410
<v Speaker 1>like it's a small town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1409
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the hell you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled that off.</v>

1410
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.790
<v Speaker 1>We're just good people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel.</v>

1411
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal and Toronto?</v>

1412
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Because Toronto better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

1413
01:12:31.861 --> 01:12:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Montrio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard me pull?</v>

1414
01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like what?</v>

1415
01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.460
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you don't like about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelle?</v>

1416
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I do love Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal.</v>

1417
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:45.970
<v Speaker 1>It is the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the French English.</v>

1418
01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That conflict seems to me silly.</v>

1419
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're going to succeed.</v>

1420
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

1421
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get you're going to leave Canada.</v>

1422
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:55.043
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations going to be your own </v>

1423
01:12:56.101 --> 01:12:57.310
<v Speaker 1>country that nobody goes to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1424
01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.800
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make everybody speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

1425
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.520
<v Speaker 1>That's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the main.</v>

1426
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:01.463
<v Speaker 1>They put French signs everywhere I get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to like cling onto their </v>

1427
01:13:04.081 --> 01:13:06.000
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it and the culture is wonderful.</v>

1428
01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:08.610
<v Speaker 1>The food's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's great people in Montreal.</v>

1429
01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1430
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.280
<v Speaker 1>they're beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Love Montreal,</v>

1431
01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.710
<v Speaker 1>but I love to run a more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1432
01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1433
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned French before I did English,</v>

1434
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:17.934
<v Speaker 1>so I'm a more francophone through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through history and I fully agree with </v>

1435
01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:23.970
<v Speaker 1>you about the stupidity of the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>

1436
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1437
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I was invited once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was probably in the late nineties.</v>

1438
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I had been a professor a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was invited by,</v>

1439
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:33.303
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the big business schools in </v>

1440
01:13:33.961 --> 01:13:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AGC,</v>

1441
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:37.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a French acronym.</v>

1442
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:38.423
<v Speaker 1>I'd been invited to give a talk there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were interested in potentially </v>

1443
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.730
<v Speaker 1>making me an offer and so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

1444
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming that I'm getting my talking</v>

1445
01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:47.790
<v Speaker 1>in English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1446
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:48.624
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole scientific career has been in </v>

1447
01:13:49.681 --> 01:13:51.420
<v Speaker 1>English even though I'm fluent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

1448
01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:52.121
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1449
01:13:52.121 --> 01:13:52.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1450
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:54.210
<v Speaker 1>we'd really like you to give it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

1451
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that that was so paisanos </v>
<v Speaker 1>parochial.</v>

1452
01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:00.270
<v Speaker 1>It was so small minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1453
01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.153
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1454
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't see Israeli people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1455
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 1>how come we're not doing this in Hebrew?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the Japanese saying,</v>

1456
01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:08.220
<v Speaker 1>why isn't this happening in Japanese?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1457
01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:12.520
<v Speaker 1>The two groups that I see doing this are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans</v>

1458
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.390
<v Speaker 2>and the French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1459
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>but whether it be in Quebec or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

1460
01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:20.350
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's in part because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't accept that they no longer the big</v>

1461
01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:22.450
<v Speaker 2>bully of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1462
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:26.470
<v Speaker 2>The positive side would be that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just celebrating this language.</v>

1463
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:28.143
<v Speaker 2>They appreciate their heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't be protecting your </v>

1464
01:14:30.971 --> 01:14:33.190
<v Speaker 2>heritage through draconian means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1465
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:37.060
<v Speaker 2>So when you have language police going </v>
<v Speaker 2>around measuring whether the French sign</v>

1466
01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 2>is bigger than the English one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting stuck in the weeds,</v>

1467
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.081
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1468
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:41.914
<v Speaker 2>That is a weird one that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's such a beautiful city and the </v>

1469
01:14:45.251 --> 01:14:48.910
<v Speaker 2>people were really nice there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're hardy people in Montreal and</v>

1470
01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're hardy folk because the winter,</v>

1471
01:14:51.311 --> 01:14:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1472
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:53.343
<v Speaker 2>you got to deal with shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to deal with adversity over </v>

1473
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting in that there is so</v>

1474
01:14:57.521 --> 01:14:58.354
<v Speaker 2>much nicer than the people that deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the adversity in the cold climates </v>

1475
01:15:01.031 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

1476
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.903
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States when you deal with the cold </v>

1477
01:15:06.701 --> 01:15:07.750
<v Speaker 2>climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are mean.</v>

1478
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I've been asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think I had an answer,</v>

1479
01:15:11.351 --> 01:15:13.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was rubin who asked me,</v>

1480
01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:14.123
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that many of the sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people on the forefront of the </v>

1481
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.390
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1482
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:24.430
<v Speaker 2>the debate all stem from Canada and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think I had a good reason.</v>

1483
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:25.504
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any thoughts as to why is it just a </v>

1484
01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:29.930
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1485
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:33.490
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons so that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>does not have a first amendment.</v>

1486
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:34.383
<v Speaker 2>So Canada is not have the same with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have here in the United States is </v>

1487
01:15:38.771 --> 01:15:39.604
<v Speaker 2>fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the only places on earth </v>

1488
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:44.703
<v Speaker 2>where it is literally a part of our law </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should be able to express </v>

1489
01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:54.211
<v Speaker 2>yourself freely and that this ethic is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that permeates our culture.</v>

1490
01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It permeates our identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that we all cling to.</v>

1491
01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:58.893
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of speech is a very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the reasons why we </v>

1492
01:16:02.471 --> 01:16:03.304
<v Speaker 2>get so stunned when we see censorship </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when we see censorship that's just </v>

1493
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.980
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1494
01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:13.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not justified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1495
01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.810
<v Speaker 2>what you guys have over there is a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more slippery slope,</v>

1496
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:17.853
<v Speaker 2>human rights councils and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdness that we've seen time and time </v>

1497
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.780
<v Speaker 2>again with people getting fined for </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>

1498
01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.100
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1499
01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:27.963
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of like very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very weird stuff that you guys have to </v>

1500
01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:34.210
<v Speaker 2>deal with up there because you simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a first amendment.</v>

1501
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:35.650
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1502
01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:36.573
<v Speaker 2>that causes more people to come out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the defending freedom of speech </v>

1503
01:16:40.031 --> 01:16:42.880
<v Speaker 2>because because you realize how </v>
<v Speaker 2>important it is and you're right next to</v>

1504
01:16:42.881 --> 01:16:43.540
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1505
01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:44.373
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all spouting off at the mouth and </v>

1506
01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:47.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking shoot nuclear bombs into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere.</v>

1507
01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1508
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.120
<v Speaker 2>you're living next to a bunch of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild hillbillies is what it's like.</v>

1509
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:54.760
<v Speaker 2>This is what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're living in Canada,</v>

1510
01:16:54.761 --> 01:16:55.594
<v Speaker 2>you're living next to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are those fucking crazy </v>

1511
01:16:57.581 --> 01:17:00.310
<v Speaker 2>assholes doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at least those crazy ass schools can</v>

1512
01:17:00.311 --> 01:17:02.050
<v Speaker 2>say whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1513
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:03.183
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows if this podcast would be even </v>

1514
01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:08.770
<v Speaker 2>possible in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1515
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have gotten</v>

1516
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 4>in trouble for some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've said along the way.</v>

1517
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 4>It's entirely likely a speaking of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1518
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.060
<v Speaker 4>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned the human rights tribunal.</v>

1519
01:17:20.061 --> 01:17:25.061
<v Speaker 4>I think at one point a I discussed on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the show the indigenous woman who argued</v>

1520
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.080
<v Speaker 4>that she should get tenure despite not </v>
<v Speaker 4>having published anything.</v>

1521
01:17:30.081 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know that story?</v>

1522
01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.330
<v Speaker 4>Don't let me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me,</v>

1523
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:38.000
<v Speaker 4>let me restate that story or maybe state</v>
<v Speaker 4>it for the first time because it,</v>

1524
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 4>it relates to something bigger than I'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>like to discuss in the Canadian context.</v>

1525
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:42.973
<v Speaker 4>So there's this now push and Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 4>universities to have what's called to </v>

1526
01:17:46.551 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 4>indigenize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The university's okay.</v>

1527
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:53.360
<v Speaker 4>To indigenize means many things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in one case,</v>

1528
01:17:53.361 --> 01:17:55.400
<v Speaker 4>the case that I just mentioned briefly </v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

1529
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.503
<v Speaker 4>you had a professor in the law faculty </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the University of British Columbia </v>

1530
01:17:59.601 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 4>who was an indigenous woman who had not </v>
<v Speaker 4>published much,</v>

1531
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:04.660
<v Speaker 4>if anything and had got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>

1532
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 4>had been given every single opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1533
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.320
<v Speaker 4>extensions on her tenure clock and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1534
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:11.650
<v Speaker 4>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when she didn't get tenure,</v>

1535
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.493
<v Speaker 4>she filed a complaint with the British </v>
<v Speaker 4>Columbia human rights tribunal arguing </v>

1536
01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:18.374
<v Speaker 4>that her tradition is an oral one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and therefore by forcing her to write </v>

1537
01:18:22.671 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 4>things down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1538
01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:26.840
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an academic wise,</v>

1539
01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:28.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's unbelievable.</v>

1540
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:33.590
<v Speaker 4>So saying her tradition is being on land</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you shouldn't be forcing you to swim</v>

1541
01:18:33.681 --> 01:18:36.020
<v Speaker 4>in a swimming event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right.</v>

1542
01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:40.520
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judaism is based also on oral tradition.</v>

1543
01:18:40.521 --> 01:18:41.354
<v Speaker 4>So by that logic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those Jewish scientists who won </v>

1544
01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:44.114
<v Speaker 4>Nobel prizes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the more nefarious manifestation of </v>

1545
01:18:49.431 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 4>and the generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while there are two other instances,</v>

1546
01:18:51.771 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 4>one annoying but not so serious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one I think very serious,</v>

1547
01:18:55.610 --> 01:19:00.170
<v Speaker 4>the annoying but not so serious is where</v>
<v Speaker 4>now at every single event and can't.</v>

1548
01:19:00.171 --> 01:19:02.720
<v Speaker 4>And Canadian University,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say you're giving out diplomas,</v>

1549
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:08.050
<v Speaker 4>you have to first sell flagellate at an </v>
<v Speaker 4>apologize for sitting on stolen land,</v>

1550
01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:09.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1551
01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 4>So here are students who have spent </v>
<v Speaker 4>years getting their degrees.</v>

1552
01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.780
<v Speaker 4>This is their moment to shine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is about them.</v>

1553
01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:15.853
<v Speaker 4>But you have to first hear about why </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all evil because we've </v>

1554
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:22.310
<v Speaker 4>transgressing on native land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one example.</v>

1555
01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:23.563
<v Speaker 4>The more serious example is where it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>no longer appropriate to say that the </v>

1556
01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:33.731
<v Speaker 4>scientific method is the way of knowing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there are alternate ways of knowing</v>

1557
01:19:34.491 --> 01:19:36.590
<v Speaker 4>that are just as valid and what are </v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

1558
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:39.380
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the indigenous way of knowing,</v>

1559
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:40.663
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I've argued that when it comes to </v>

1560
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:45.740
<v Speaker 4>content specific knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1561
01:19:45.741 --> 01:19:46.574
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to study something in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the deep north where the inuits have </v>

1562
01:19:51.081 --> 01:19:51.914
<v Speaker 4>lived for thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have local knowledge </v>

1563
01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 4>about the flora,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the fauna.</v>

1564
01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:02.360
<v Speaker 4>That is truly a valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

1565
01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.270
<v Speaker 4>that is in fact scientific knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But exactly,</v>

1566
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:06.670
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1567
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:07.900
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying that,</v>

1568
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.780
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm saying it's a content </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>

1569
01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:11.023
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be appreciative of that </v>

1570
01:20:14.401 --> 01:20:15.234
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and listened to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that speaks to </v>

1571
01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 2>your point that it is outside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>purview of the scientific method.</v>

1572
01:20:21.451 --> 01:20:26.451
<v Speaker 2>There is no episode homology that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is no Lebanese Jewish way of knowing.</v>

1573
01:20:26.971 --> 01:20:27.804
<v Speaker 2>There is no Joe Rogan way of knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't any transgender way of </v>

1574
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:32.874
<v Speaker 2>knowing this information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the scientific method that's </v>

1575
01:20:35.311 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 2>the only game in town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While they're arguing that,</v>

1576
01:20:37.771 --> 01:20:38.604
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ways of not just like the </v>

1577
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag science must fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned this on the Ruben report,</v>

1578
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:46.260
<v Speaker 2>judge agreement with this Hashtag </v>
<v Speaker 2>seismic fault.</v>

1579
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's going to rise.</v>

1580
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:49.510
<v Speaker 2>They're called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're called [inaudible].</v>

1581
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.393
<v Speaker 2>Actually this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This came out of the University of Cape </v>

1582
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:54.623
<v Speaker 2>Town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the top universities in South </v>

1583
01:20:55.770 --> 01:21:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Africa where the students were arguing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is ridiculous that we only abide</v>

1584
01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:02.970
<v Speaker 2>by the scientific method.</v>

1585
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 2>There are all sorts of other Booga Booga</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways of knowing that are just.</v>

1586
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:07.613
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using google.</v>

1587
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:08.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean,</v>

1588
01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:09.363
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could dance and make the rain come </v>

1589
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:11.950
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1590
01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:15.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it like spiritual shamanism,</v>

1591
01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:16.254
<v Speaker 2>ways of knowing that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are outside the purview of the </v>

1592
01:21:18.661 --> 01:21:19.494
<v Speaker 2>scientific method and that is grotesque.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that I argue </v>

1593
01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:24.063
<v Speaker 2>probably doesn't make me a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends at the university is that there </v>

1594
01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:29.850
<v Speaker 2>is no indigenous way of knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

1595
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:32.850
<v Speaker 2>She's Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag science must fall.</v>

1596
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.713
<v Speaker 2>I need to remember those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He a website for know your meme and I </v>

1597
01:21:35.371 --> 01:21:37.530
<v Speaker 2>got the video of where it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1598
01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.520
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

1599
01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.290
<v Speaker 2>sad proves to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1600
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling this is a four Chan </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's real,</v>

1601
01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.433
<v Speaker 2>or three years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's made that largest in my shitty </v>

1602
01:21:47.581 --> 01:21:47.820
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>

1603
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Could read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Science must fall as a Hashtag mocking a</v>

1604
01:21:51.001 --> 01:21:52.740
<v Speaker 2>movement to abolish the science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1605
01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:53.730
<v Speaker 2>it's marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1606
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:58.170
<v Speaker 2>but the original idea is that you should</v>
<v Speaker 2>decolonize your mind.</v>

1607
01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's mocking that movement,</v>

1608
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:00.953
<v Speaker 2>mocking a movement to abolish the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific method and replace it with a </v>

1609
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:04.314
<v Speaker 2>new understanding of scientific inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This movement was started by a group of </v>

1610
01:22:07.141 --> 01:22:07.974
<v Speaker 2>students known as follows at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Cape Town who want to </v>

1611
01:22:10.571 --> 01:22:11.404
<v Speaker 2>decolonize science from Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>modernity as an offshoot of the ongoing </v>

1612
01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:20.160
<v Speaker 2>fees must fall movement protesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>increases in university tuition.</v>

1613
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:23.100
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask going forward to know that you</v>

1614
01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:28.101
<v Speaker 2>guys have tuition way lower healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 2>and student.</v>

1615
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.000
<v Speaker 2>We pay for it with taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1616
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's worth it.</v>

1617
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said time and time.</v>

1618
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1619
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the hybrid form of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of governing.</v>

1620
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:42.600
<v Speaker 2>In a hybrid form of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that,</v>

1621
01:22:42.601 --> 01:22:45.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've supported a lot of socialized ideas</v>

1622
01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:46.543
<v Speaker 2>and one of the reasons why is because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>see socialism work with the fire </v>

1623
01:22:48.871 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 2>department,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the police department,</v>

1624
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.863
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with things that we all agreed that </v>

1625
01:22:53.131 --> 01:22:53.964
<v Speaker 2>we're going to chip in and pay for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that we don't do this with </v>

1626
01:22:56.190 --> 01:22:57.870
<v Speaker 2>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1627
01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my neighbor gets sick,</v>

1628
01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.950
<v Speaker 2>the community has to chip in.</v>

1629
01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.813
<v Speaker 2>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's been paying taxes his whole </v>

1630
01:23:04.291 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a viable part of the community.</v>

1631
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:07.443
<v Speaker 2>We should be taking care of our own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This should be a primary thing like </v>

1632
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:12.250
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To strengthen our community,</v>

1633
01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:15.600
<v Speaker 2>to strengthen our civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the primary things you wish you'd</v>

1634
01:23:15.601 --> 01:23:20.601
<v Speaker 2>be taking care of each other physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be like above.</v>

1635
01:23:20.681 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Education.</v>

1636
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.310
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't have to fucking be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>

1637
01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>A quarter million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get a fucking education.</v>

1638
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:28.023
<v Speaker 2>Don't we want less losers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't we want more people to have </v>

1639
01:23:30.011 --> 01:23:33.100
<v Speaker 2>education?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we want more people to have some sort</v>

1640
01:23:33.101 --> 01:23:37.450
<v Speaker 2>of pathway to success?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that just logically lead to a,</v>

1641
01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:41.290
<v Speaker 2>a stronger economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stronger communities?</v>

1642
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Stronger civilization when it was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical.</v>

1643
01:23:43.961 --> 01:23:48.961
<v Speaker 2>Let me give a devil's advocate advocate </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to the extent that they are now,</v>

1644
01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:52.630
<v Speaker 2>no longer any barriers to entry to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into university.</v>

1645
01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Certainly in Canada at least not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial one.</v>

1646
01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:55.803
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a misallocation of talent and </v>

1647
01:23:59.051 --> 01:23:59.884
<v Speaker 2>resources where everybody feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>compelled to go to university where in </v>

1648
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:06.100
<v Speaker 2>reality many of the folks in question </v>
<v Speaker 2>and believe me,</v>

1649
01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm the last guy to argue against </v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

1650
01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:09.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about lifelong learning,</v>

1651
01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.950
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have to be through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>formal channels of getting a degree,</v>

1652
01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:15.813
<v Speaker 2>but that's not compulsory at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it is compulsory unofficially in </v>

1653
01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:20.764
<v Speaker 2>that it is now no longer acceptable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>not have at least some entry level </v>

1654
01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:25.923
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then we should concentrate on that </v>

1655
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:28.060
<v Speaker 2>as an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1656
01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be the issue.</v>

1657
01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:30.064
<v Speaker 2>Not this idea that somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>education should be expensive so it </v>

1658
01:24:34.151 --> 01:24:36.750
<v Speaker 2>should be difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it should be something that it's only</v>

1659
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.830
<v Speaker 2>sought out by people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

1660
01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:40.000
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I agree.</v>

1661
01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:41.740
<v Speaker 2>It should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The barrier to entry shouldn't be that,</v>

1662
01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:42.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the finances that don't allow you </v>

1663
01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:46.150
<v Speaker 2>to pursue your interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know,</v>

1664
01:24:46.151 --> 01:24:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean just as a professor for 25 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1665
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:50.103
<v Speaker 2>there are students that I see very early</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in a given semester that I know </v>

1666
01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:58.270
<v Speaker 2>they're not there or they're not there </v>
<v Speaker 2>for intrinsic reasons.</v>

1667
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.823
<v Speaker 2>They just don't have the sparkle in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their eyes and no amount of coaxing on </v>

1668
01:25:02.741 --> 01:25:05.200
<v Speaker 2>my part is ever going to bring them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I try,</v>

1669
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:06.063
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody's redeemable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can tell that they're there </v>

1670
01:25:08.321 --> 01:25:11.800
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe those people would have had a much</v>

1671
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:16.900
<v Speaker 2>more lucrative trajectory where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue trade school.</v>

1672
01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:18.503
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we have to also be careful </v>

1673
01:25:20.051 --> 01:25:22.480
<v Speaker 2>about how to allocate the talent that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1674
01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:23.883
<v Speaker 2>I know that that absolutely makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that is most likely played </v>

1675
01:25:28.091 --> 01:25:31.260
<v Speaker 2>out over the difficulty of pursuing an </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

1676
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like it is with everything else.</v>

1677
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever,</v>

1678
01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:36.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to be a standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian.</v>

1679
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:39.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not everybody gets to do Carnegie </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hall.</v>

1680
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1681
01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:41.973
<v Speaker 2>there's a weeding out process of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficulty of achieving success and </v>

1682
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.713
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that fall by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wayside and don't make it and this is </v>

1683
01:25:48.821 --> 01:25:50.590
<v Speaker 2>just natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a natural part of the process,</v>

1684
01:25:50.591 --> 01:25:52.600
<v Speaker 2>but if you say not everybody is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>

1685
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.673
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but open mike nights available to </v>

1686
01:25:55.571 --> 01:25:56.404
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True and that's why there's so many </v>

1687
01:25:57.701 --> 01:25:58.534
<v Speaker 2>comedians that actually are good because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do find it through because there's </v>

1688
01:26:01.211 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 2>no financial barrier to entry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it</v>

1689
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:04.833
<v Speaker 3>costs $35,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year to pursue an education in comedy </v>

1690
01:26:09.291 --> 01:26:10.124
<v Speaker 3>and you had to be $200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in debt before you could make a living </v>

1691
01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:12.914
<v Speaker 3>on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1692
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.083
<v Speaker 3>There wouldn't be a goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The laugh at there wouldn't be none of </v>

1693
01:26:17.601 --> 01:26:18.434
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'd be zero of us and that's not a </v>

1694
01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:21.554
<v Speaker 3>good x.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good example because </v>

1695
01:26:22.971 --> 01:26:27.170
<v Speaker 3>obviously comedy is one of the rare </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that is self-educated process.</v>

1696
01:26:27.171 --> 01:26:29.060
<v Speaker 3>You have to yourself taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way.</v>

1697
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:30.223
<v Speaker 3>You just have to pursue it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's the rigidness of </v>

1698
01:26:34.221 --> 01:26:35.640
<v Speaker 3>university studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1699
01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.493
<v Speaker 3>the rigidness of courses of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of determining what people should and </v>

1700
01:26:39.711 --> 01:26:40.544
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't learn what they should and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be educated in who also the </v>

1701
01:26:45.171 --> 01:26:47.360
<v Speaker 3>randomness of the professors that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

1702
01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Like you could get you and get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful education I'm sure.</v>

1703
01:26:51.210 --> 01:26:52.043
<v Speaker 3>Or you get some dipshit and get taught </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how gender is a social construct </v>

1704
01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:57.913
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting in class all baffled </v>

1705
01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:00.134
<v Speaker 3>looking at your penis going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you done to me fucking </v>

1706
01:27:02.331 --> 01:27:03.164
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

1707
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:04.363
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1708
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:05.783
<v Speaker 4>I'm at the point now in my career as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>professor where I'm facing a bit of a </v>

1709
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:15.671
<v Speaker 4>fork and that I remain as passionate </v>
<v Speaker 4>about teaching students,</v>

1710
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:18.110
<v Speaker 4>but the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this medium,</v>

1711
01:27:18.111 --> 01:27:18.944
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Appearing on Joe Rogan and then having </v>

1712
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.970
<v Speaker 4>10 million people watch and maybe maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>be excited about evolutionary psychology</v>

1713
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.433
<v Speaker 4>is so much of a bigger platform that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>causes me at times a bit of an angst </v>

1714
01:27:32.991 --> 01:27:33.824
<v Speaker 4>when I have to put in all the efforts </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I have to put in to teach a class </v>

1715
01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:38.084
<v Speaker 4>of 14 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that each of those mines is not </v>

1716
01:27:40.971 --> 01:27:44.210
<v Speaker 4>worthy of being educated and being </v>
<v Speaker 4>inspired and so on.</v>

1717
01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:45.373
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I am facing at this point in my </v>

1718
01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:47.931
<v Speaker 4>career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1719
01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:48.764
<v Speaker 4>I'm a mid career point in my life where </v>
<v Speaker 4>I could turn on my laptop and put up </v>

1720
01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:55.850
<v Speaker 4>anything and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25,000</v>

1721
01:27:55.851 --> 01:27:57.800
<v Speaker 4>people will watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is nothing compared to your farm,</v>

1722
01:27:57.801 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 4>but it's $25,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of his classroom size.</v>

1723
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.800
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arena full of people.</v>

1724
01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:05.960
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1725
01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:07.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I now struggle with.</v>

1726
01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:10.760
<v Speaker 4>I always remain as passionate once I </v>
<v Speaker 4>walk into class.</v>

1727
01:28:10.761 --> 01:28:12.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm just as passionate just as </v>
<v Speaker 4>committed.</v>

1728
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:16.100
<v Speaker 4>But to the extent that we have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>fixed pie of time,</v>

1729
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:21.430
<v Speaker 4>it becomes so difficult to ever have the</v>
<v Speaker 4>twelfth students went out against the 12</v>

1730
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.980
<v Speaker 4>million students.</v>

1731
01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:23.813
<v Speaker 3>Here would be my perspective and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>this can enhance this experience for </v>

1732
01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:29.594
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would treat it the same way that a </v>

1733
01:28:31.881 --> 01:28:32.714
<v Speaker 3>comedian treats performing live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I do this podcast and every time I </v>

1734
01:28:36.501 --> 01:28:38.720
<v Speaker 3>do this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm reaching millions of people.</v>

1735
01:28:38.721 --> 01:28:39.590
<v Speaker 3>What if I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1736
01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.720
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do the improv anymore.</v>

1737
01:28:41.721 --> 01:28:44.510
<v Speaker 3>It's only 190 people do the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

1738
01:28:44.511 --> 01:28:46.570
<v Speaker 3>It's only 400 people in the main room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>

1739
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:48.650
<v Speaker 3>that's too good analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too small,</v>

1740
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:51.680
<v Speaker 3>but doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

1741
01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the belly room,</v>

1742
01:28:52.731 --> 01:28:54.650
<v Speaker 3>70 people in the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>belly room,</v>

1743
01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.470
<v Speaker 3>doing those little small room hones your</v>
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>

1744
01:28:57.471 --> 01:28:59.990
<v Speaker 3>It actually keeps you tied into people </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1745
01:28:59.991 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 3>It keeps you engaged with individual</v>

1746
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.020
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps you real.</v>

1747
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you say that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

1748
01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:06.810
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1749
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:07.643
<v Speaker 1>I had an MBA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching mba course this semester </v>

1750
01:29:09.151 --> 01:29:13.140
<v Speaker 1>where we had to miss two classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one because it was Canadian thanksgiving</v>

1751
01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:13.974
<v Speaker 1>on a Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was the provincial </v>

1752
01:29:15.781 --> 01:29:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Canadian thanksgiving can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1753
01:29:18.121 --> 01:29:23.121
<v Speaker 1>The real Thanksgiving first or ours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ours is the second Monday in October.</v>

1754
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.800
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1755
01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Yours is also called a Greenbay plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas.</v>

1756
01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:31.493
<v Speaker 1>That's called American thanksgiving </v>
<v Speaker 1>called November 24th mother fucker or </v>

1757
01:29:36.091 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thursday,</v>

1758
01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:39.023
<v Speaker 1>November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this Mba class was being taught on </v>

1759
01:29:39.661 --> 01:29:40.494
<v Speaker 1>Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I missed one Monday because of </v>

1760
01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:42.533
<v Speaker 1>thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I missed the second Monday because </v>

1761
01:29:44.101 --> 01:29:44.934
<v Speaker 1>it was the official provincial election </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec and by university decree we </v>

1762
01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:49.854
<v Speaker 1>had to cancel classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that I made up those </v>

1763
01:29:51.781 --> 01:29:53.730
<v Speaker 1>classes and I asked the students as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1764
01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:54.803
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could come in on a Sunday as the </v>

1765
01:29:56.821 --> 01:29:59.040
<v Speaker 1>university has dictated or we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could post them,</v>

1766
01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:01.200
<v Speaker 1>post the lectures online.</v>

1767
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:02.423
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually I asked them would </v>
<v Speaker 1>you prefer if I posted all my lectures </v>

1768
01:30:06.271 --> 01:30:07.104
<v Speaker 1>online and then I came in and did other </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in class or would you prefer that </v>

1769
01:30:10.261 --> 01:30:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I actually deliver the material live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you?</v>

1770
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:16.410
<v Speaker 1>And actually a lot of them answered in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way similar to what you just said,</v>

1771
01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:21.411
<v Speaker 1>which is there is something intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about delivering the message right there</v>

1772
01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:22.830
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tangibly,</v>

1773
01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:27.480
<v Speaker 1>that you can't capture online 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent live performance in any way,</v>

1774
01:30:27.481 --> 01:30:30.570
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's music or comedy or,</v>

1775
01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:31.051
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1776
01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I think teaching is informed a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>live performance,</v>

1777
01:30:34.111 --> 01:30:34.944
<v Speaker 1>but is when you have someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disinterested and listless and just say </v>

1778
01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 1>they have no energy and they're teaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the information is fascinating.</v>

1779
01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:43.374
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to absorb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas if you have someone like </v>

1780
01:30:45.151 --> 01:30:45.984
<v Speaker 1>yourself who's passionate and engaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>and articulate and they have live to </v>

1781
01:30:49.381 --> 01:30:50.400
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's fun.</v>

1782
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.990
<v Speaker 1>It makes the educational experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that it.</v>

1783
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:54.630
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1784
01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:56.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a performance art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1785
01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.293
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what pisses me off when I </v>

1786
01:30:58.741 --> 01:31:01.110
<v Speaker 1>received the teaching evaluations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually,</v>

1787
01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're great.</v>

1788
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:03.703
<v Speaker 1>I scored very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once in a while you get someone who </v>

1789
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:09.540
<v Speaker 1>enters something that you know is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you an example.</v>

1790
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Someone says he wasn't accessible to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

1791
01:31:13.650 --> 01:31:14.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is there wasn't a single </v>

1792
01:31:16.591 --> 01:31:21.591
<v Speaker 1>time that a student ever asked to meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>me either during office hours or if they</v>

1793
01:31:22.111 --> 01:31:24.360
<v Speaker 1>can't make office hours outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>office hours,</v>

1794
01:31:24.361 --> 01:31:26.100
<v Speaker 1>we could do a skype chat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could do a phone chat.</v>

1795
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I've never said I'm not meeting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time with.</v>

1796
01:31:29.230 --> 01:31:30.063
<v Speaker 1>It's never happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone because they are protected by </v>

1797
01:31:32.881 --> 01:31:33.714
<v Speaker 1>the cloak of anonymity because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching evaluations are done </v>

1798
01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:36.773
<v Speaker 1>anonymously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can write whatever they want and there </v>

1799
01:31:38.761 --> 01:31:40.980
<v Speaker 1>is no opportunity for you to reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1800
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:41.873
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is this has no effect on my </v>

1801
01:31:43.681 --> 01:31:44.880
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I could easily say,</v>

1802
01:31:44.881 --> 01:31:47.910
<v Speaker 1>who cares what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do care because probably like you,</v>

1803
01:31:48.130 --> 01:31:48.963
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to think that every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>person in that audience is going to </v>

1804
01:31:50.971 --> 01:31:53.400
<v Speaker 1>hopefully find you funny and they walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

1805
01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:54.770
<v Speaker 1>entertained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1806
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:58.410
<v Speaker 1>because of your set and there's no way </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to rebut them.</v>

1807
01:31:58.830 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when someone's</v>

1808
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.350
<v Speaker 3>lying about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really annoying,</v>

1809
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:07.560
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like it's like yelp scores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever ever read yelp reviews?</v>

1810
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Like you read them and you'll see all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these wonderful reviews.</v>

1811
01:32:11.681 --> 01:32:15.250
<v Speaker 3>The restaurant was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The food was fantastic.</v>

1812
01:32:15.251 --> 01:32:17.500
<v Speaker 3>The decor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything about it.</v>

1813
01:32:17.501 --> 01:32:18.334
<v Speaker 3>The waitress was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The chef came over to our table and </v>

1814
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:22.443
<v Speaker 3>greeted us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so good and then you'll see one </v>

1815
01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:25.780
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone was rude.</v>

1816
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:30.070
<v Speaker 3>My food was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait when it was this the same place.</v>

1817
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:32.740
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I always love to do,</v>

1818
01:32:32.741 --> 01:32:33.574
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite things to do on yelp </v>
<v Speaker 3>is I will go to a restaurant and if I'm </v>

1819
01:32:38.111 --> 01:32:39.550
<v Speaker 3>interested in this restaurant and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1820
01:32:39.551 --> 01:32:41.530
<v Speaker 3>look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got four and a half stars,</v>

1821
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.980
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll find a one star and I go,</v>

1822
01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:45.883
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me click on their profile and you </v>

1823
01:32:47.501 --> 01:32:52.501
<v Speaker 3>will see a fucking tornado of one star </v>
<v Speaker 3>reviews of everybody with everything.</v>

1824
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Fucking laundromats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grocery stores.</v>

1825
01:32:56.111 --> 01:32:59.080
<v Speaker 3>They hate everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so universal.</v>

1826
01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:02.500
<v Speaker 3>It's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then occasionally like one four star</v>

1827
01:33:02.501 --> 01:33:05.310
<v Speaker 3>review of something like a movie theater</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

1828
01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 3>They're probably on adderall that day or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1829
01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking weird.</v>

1830
01:33:09.701 --> 01:33:10.534
<v Speaker 3>It's weird how many malcontents are out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there just bouncing off of things and </v>

1831
01:33:13.871 --> 01:33:14.704
<v Speaker 3>just angry at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honking their horn and traffic and </v>

1832
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:18.820
<v Speaker 3>writing one star reviews.</v>

1833
01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.793
<v Speaker 4>I've actually thought of starting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>project and I had a research assistant </v>

1834
01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:25.110
<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Preemptive,</v>

1835
01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:26.173
<v Speaker 4>not exploring it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tell me what you think of this </v>

1836
01:33:31.441 --> 01:33:34.680
<v Speaker 4>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have one star to five stars,</v>

1837
01:33:34.681 --> 01:33:37.080
<v Speaker 4>let's say on Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on travel,</v>

1838
01:33:37.081 --> 01:33:38.160
<v Speaker 4>expedia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it's called,</v>

1839
01:33:38.490 --> 01:33:39.570
<v Speaker 4>hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurants.</v>

1840
01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:40.973
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that the amount of words </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people use across the five stars </v>

1841
01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:48.240
<v Speaker 4>changes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

1842
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:49.223
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothesis might be the more negative </v>

1843
01:33:51.631 --> 01:33:54.140
<v Speaker 4>the review,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more words are used because.</v>

1844
01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:55.733
<v Speaker 4>And so probably I hope nobody steals </v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea because that's an idea that </v>

1845
01:33:58.141 --> 01:33:59.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping to test a soon.</v>

1846
01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientifically.</v>

1847
01:34:01.081 --> 01:34:01.914
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you look.</v>

1848
01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm saying.</v>

1849
01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:04.530
<v Speaker 3>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1850
01:34:04.531 --> 01:34:06.480
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your prediction would.</v>

1851
01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:10.450
<v Speaker 3>There's a thing on it already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

1852
01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Statistical difference between one star </v>
<v Speaker 3>and five star reviews on yelp.</v>

1853
01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.230
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make that large place.</v>

1854
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:18.900
<v Speaker 3>What year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty 14.</v>

1855
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:20.610
<v Speaker 3>You're way behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

1856
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Many businesses in the real world </v>
<v Speaker 3>encourage customers to rate on yelp.</v>

1857
01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:25.283
<v Speaker 3>Yelp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to find local businesses </v>

1858
01:34:26.341 --> 01:34:29.580
<v Speaker 3>relies on user reviews to help the </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewers find the best places.</v>

1859
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Both positive and negative reviews are </v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful in this mission.</v>

1860
01:34:32.101 --> 01:34:35.310
<v Speaker 3>Positive reviews on yelp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go back to what the thing was.</v>

1861
01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1862
01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.133
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm seeing or statistical </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences in the amount of text just </v>

1863
01:34:40.801 --> 01:34:41.431
<v Speaker 3>text,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1864
01:34:41.431 --> 01:34:45.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not a part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a part of the review?</v>

1865
01:34:46.770 --> 01:34:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Is that what they're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it up,</v>

1866
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:53.040
<v Speaker 3>getting into types of words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generalize the language,</v>

1867
01:34:53.041 --> 01:34:55.020
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1868
01:34:55.021 --> 01:34:55.411
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but blah,</v>

1869
01:34:55.411 --> 01:34:55.780
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1870
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:59.000
<v Speaker 3>Blah and one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>125,458</v>

1871
01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.013
<v Speaker 3>yelp reviews using the data sheet </v>
<v Speaker 3>containing reviews of businesses and </v>

1872
01:35:03.321 --> 01:35:04.154
<v Speaker 3>Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Asa,</v>

1873
01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:05.013
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>

1874
01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.133
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When comparing the most frequent two </v>

1875
01:35:07.611 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 3>word phrases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1876
01:35:08.991 --> 01:35:13.160
<v Speaker 3>but this is just the content,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's also probably safe Jamie,</v>

1877
01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:18.220
<v Speaker 3>but look at that one star is so there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain words that come up and run star.</v>

1878
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:21.230
<v Speaker 3>That's not what it is though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

1879
01:35:21.231 --> 01:35:23.780
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Happy and contrast at one star.</v>

1880
01:35:23.781 --> 01:35:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Yelp reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1881
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:29.690
<v Speaker 3>use very little positive language and </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead discuss the amount of minutes,</v>

1882
01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.890
<v Speaker 3>presumably much for this first section </v>
<v Speaker 3>is only two word reviews.</v>

1883
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:35.870
<v Speaker 3>The next section here is three word </v>
<v Speaker 3>reviews.</v>

1884
01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:37.170
<v Speaker 3>And so he goes on further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1885
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.760
<v Speaker 3>go back to where I was reading there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says very little.</v>

1886
01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:44.840
<v Speaker 3>So five star yelp reviews contain many </v>
<v Speaker 3>instances of good.</v>

1887
01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:45.673
<v Speaker 3>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1888
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Contrast the one star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yelp reviews,</v>

1889
01:35:47.841 --> 01:35:49.220
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's what's interesting.</v>

1890
01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:50.413
<v Speaker 3>Use very little positive language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but instead discussed the amount of </v>

1891
01:35:52.491 --> 01:35:56.420
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>presumably long and unfortunate waits at</v>

1892
01:35:56.421 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 3>the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1893
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.903
<v Speaker 3>Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the cities where the reviewers </v>

1894
01:35:59.811 --> 01:36:00.644
<v Speaker 3>were collected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why appears prominently so I </v>

1895
01:36:03.871 --> 01:36:05.660
<v Speaker 3>don't have more people have to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1896
01:36:05.661 --> 01:36:06.710
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>

1897
01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.730
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>words in the review itself.</v>

1898
01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:11.973
<v Speaker 3>Let me take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me throw that in there at all the </v>

1899
01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:15.100
<v Speaker 3>size of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1900
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:18.740
<v Speaker 3>just the size of their review because </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a statistical analysis of the,</v>

1901
01:36:18.741 --> 01:36:20.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the words content you.</v>

1902
01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:24.200
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1903
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:25.423
<v Speaker 4>let me tell you the background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I published a paper in 2014 in a </v>

1904
01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 4>journal called evolution human behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we looked at.</v>

1905
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.030
<v Speaker 4>Just give me a chance to give you a bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of background.</v>

1906
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:40.580
<v Speaker 4>So remember I talked earlier about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>framing effect.</v>

1907
01:36:40.581 --> 01:36:41.414
<v Speaker 4>If she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I tell you that a burger is 10 </v>

1908
01:36:42.351 --> 01:36:46.310
<v Speaker 4>percent fat versus 90 percent fat free,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same description.</v>

1909
01:36:46.311 --> 01:36:48.300
<v Speaker 4>It's just one way you frame it </v>
<v Speaker 4>positively,</v>

1910
01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:49.173
<v Speaker 4>negatively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I took this idea with one of my </v>

1911
01:36:50.781 --> 01:36:54.890
<v Speaker 4>former doctoral students and we applied </v>
<v Speaker 4>it to the context of mating.</v>

1912
01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:55.733
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I tell you you can go out on a date </v>

1913
01:36:57.921 --> 01:36:58.754
<v Speaker 4>with this woman and seven out of 10 of </v>
<v Speaker 4>her acquaintances thinks she's </v>

1914
01:37:01.671 --> 01:37:02.504
<v Speaker 4>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is exactly like telling you that </v>

1915
01:37:04.611 --> 01:37:07.520
<v Speaker 4>three out of 10 of her friends didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think she's intelligent.</v>

1916
01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:08.354
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I could either frame the information </v>

1917
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 4>positively or negatively.</v>

1918
01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.133
<v Speaker 4>It's the exact same information and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is called the framing effect because </v>

1919
01:37:15.321 --> 01:37:18.800
<v Speaker 4>just how you frame something causes </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to change their evaluation of the</v>

1920
01:37:18.801 --> 01:37:19.634
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1921
01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:21.013
<v Speaker 4>And so what we want to know is whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>men or women are more likely to succumb </v>

1922
01:37:25.911 --> 01:37:28.370
<v Speaker 4>to the framing effect within a meeting </v>
<v Speaker 4>context.</v>

1923
01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Do you follow what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1924
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:32.810
<v Speaker 4>Well before I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not to put you on the spot,</v>

1925
01:37:32.811 --> 01:37:33.644
<v Speaker 4>but I guess I will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you predict which of the two sexes </v>

1926
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:41.450
<v Speaker 4>is more likely to fall prey to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>framing manipulation specifically in the</v>

1927
01:37:41.451 --> 01:37:43.970
<v Speaker 4>main context?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Emails fairy good.</v>

1928
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.580
<v Speaker 4>You're an evolutionary psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>White women or men don't mind.</v>

1929
01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.420
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's not quite friends.</v>

1930
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Say she's a con.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1931
01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.700
<v Speaker 4>but that's because she's got no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of that's not.</v>

1932
01:37:51.970 --> 01:37:52.803
<v Speaker 4>That's not the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason is because negatively framed </v>

1933
01:37:55.891 --> 01:37:56.550
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

1934
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:58.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is how I'm going to tie it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the study.</v>

1935
01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Negative information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1936
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:00.383
<v Speaker 1>Negatively framed information looms </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger and the psyche of women </v>

1937
01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:05.393
<v Speaker 1>specifically in the mating domain </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely because making a poor choice </v>

1938
01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:14.040
<v Speaker 1>has greater consequences evolutionarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking for the woman,</v>

1939
01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:15.083
<v Speaker 1>the exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is called the parental </v>

1940
01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:16.794
<v Speaker 1>investment theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we took parental investment theory </v>

1941
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.433
<v Speaker 1>and applied it in this context to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framing the decision and showed that </v>

1942
01:38:22.981 --> 01:38:25.500
<v Speaker 1>when it comes specifically to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maitland context,</v>

1943
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:28.320
<v Speaker 1>women are more likely to succumb to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framing effect that makes sense.</v>

1944
01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>And and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason again stems from the fact</v>

1945
01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that there is what's called a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>negativity bias for this.</v>

1946
01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:39.930
<v Speaker 1>The same valence information looms </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger when it's negative.</v>

1947
01:38:39.931 --> 01:38:40.764
<v Speaker 1>Then it's once Fazio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely because we've evolved to pay </v>

1948
01:38:44.011 --> 01:38:47.550
<v Speaker 1>more attention to negative information </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than positive information.</v>

1949
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And so that got me thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis that I just told you,</v>

1950
01:38:52.710 --> 01:38:53.543
<v Speaker 1>which is in the consumer context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I spend more time as a consumer </v>

1951
01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:00.840
<v Speaker 1>trying to justify my very negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision?</v>

1952
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.630
<v Speaker 1>And therefore that's why I got the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

1953
01:39:03.631 --> 01:39:04.464
<v Speaker 1>If any bastard steals that hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to know the godfather always </v>

1954
01:39:08.461 --> 01:39:09.294
<v Speaker 1>knows there's more into this is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long article that it doesn't do what I </v>

1955
01:39:14.821 --> 01:39:15.654
<v Speaker 1>believe it does right here is the amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of words in the review has a lesser </v>

1956
01:39:19.081 --> 01:39:22.900
<v Speaker 1>negative affect review that is 333 words</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates a onestar decreased,</v>

1957
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.430
<v Speaker 1>but the average amount of words in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelp reviews 130 words.</v>

1958
01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:29.970
<v Speaker 1>So the more words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is to have a negative</v>

1959
01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:32.370
<v Speaker 1>one star review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's already there.</v>

1960
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:36.120
<v Speaker 1>So they aren't they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a multifaceted analysis.</v>

1961
01:39:36.121 --> 01:39:36.954
<v Speaker 1>The model experienced 25 point 98 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the variation in the number </v>

1962
01:39:40.021 --> 01:39:43.230
<v Speaker 1>of stars given in a review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sounds like a low percentage,</v>

1963
01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:44.064
<v Speaker 1>but it's impressive for such a simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>model using unstructured real world </v>

1964
01:39:47.311 --> 01:39:48.144
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1965
01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:49.471
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1966
01:39:49.471 --> 01:39:50.304
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from a another principle which </v>

1967
01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:53.184
<v Speaker 1>basically says that when companies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to pay attention to people how </v>

1968
01:39:56.851 --> 01:40:01.851
<v Speaker 1>satisfied they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one dissatisfied customer ends up having</v>

1969
01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:02.844
<v Speaker 1>much larger influence than one satisfied</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer because if you like the metric </v>

1970
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.520
<v Speaker 1>velocity of someone who's pissed as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater than the possible certainly,</v>

1971
01:40:11.521 --> 01:40:12.354
<v Speaker 1>and that's why people were terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad reviews and you know they don't </v>

1972
01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.080
<v Speaker 1>really take too much.</v>

1973
01:40:16.230 --> 01:40:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Here's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a real problem.</v>

1974
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:19.723
<v Speaker 1>I'm fake reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of companies and employ </v>

1975
01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:24.203
<v Speaker 1>these really unscrupulous humans who </v>
<v Speaker 1>will write fake reviews for your </v>

1976
01:40:29.311 --> 01:40:30.144
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were really positive reviews and </v>

1977
01:40:32.041 --> 01:40:32.874
<v Speaker 1>make it look like your business is </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing and I guarantee you they use </v>

1978
01:40:35.641 --> 01:40:38.370
<v Speaker 1>very few words because they just try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bang them out.</v>

1979
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:39.263
<v Speaker 1>They just have a bunch of fake bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts and you can pay someone and </v>

1980
01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:45.150
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's services that do that.</v>

1981
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:46.343
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way your restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any way to algorithmically </v>

1982
01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 1>identify who the fake review because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure</v>

1983
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:55.880
<v Speaker 2>of the words they use are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grammatical.</v>

1984
01:40:55.881 --> 01:40:56.714
<v Speaker 2>So where you know at somehow fake is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so because I don't think </v>

1985
01:40:59.711 --> 01:41:00.544
<v Speaker 2>the fake reviews are done with a Bot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's done with actual human </v>

1986
01:41:04.751 --> 01:41:05.584
<v Speaker 2>sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1987
01:41:05.670 --> 01:41:06.503
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe if you notice it's in </v>

1988
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.200
<v Speaker 2>English because they're all done in </v>
<v Speaker 2>India or something like that.</v>

1989
01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it is just people </v>
<v Speaker 2>finding a loophole in the system.</v>

1990
01:41:16.451 --> 01:41:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I actually heard someone discussing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a restaurant.</v>

1991
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.373
<v Speaker 2>We in a restaurant waiting to seat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was telling the owner of the </v>

1992
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:24.970
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1993
01:41:24.971 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I have a service that can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know of that can help you,</v>

1994
01:41:29.261 --> 01:41:31.890
<v Speaker 2>and they'll just leave you great reviews</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an a,</v>

1995
01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:33.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an amazing restaurant.</v>

1996
01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:34.714
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

1997
01:41:34.810 --> 01:41:35.643
<v Speaker 2>you should use this and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're lying to the </v>

1998
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:38.050
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1999
01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:38.883
<v Speaker 2>The food's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people have all these weird </v>

2000
01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:40.624
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that again speaks to </v>

2001
01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:46.300
<v Speaker 2>consequentialism versus the </v>
<v Speaker 2>anthological.</v>

2002
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2003
01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:47.733
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were to point to a fault that I </v>

2004
01:41:51.881 --> 01:41:55.000
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably other than perfectionism,</v>

2005
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:56.223
<v Speaker 2>is that my mother used to always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to realize that the world is </v>

2006
01:42:01.091 --> 01:42:03.790
<v Speaker 2>not as pure as the purity bubble that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in,</v>

2007
01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.253
<v Speaker 2>and so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to lose weight through a </v>

2008
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:13.830
<v Speaker 2>liposuction is a form of cheating </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if I don't go through the actual</v>

2009
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:20.050
<v Speaker 2>process of consciously altering my </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

2010
01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about the end result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you will say,</v>

2011
01:42:23.261 --> 01:42:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look really nice and thin.</v>

2012
01:42:24.551 --> 01:42:27.670
<v Speaker 2>Now the fact that I did it through quote</v>
<v Speaker 2>an artificial way,</v>

2013
01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:31.930
<v Speaker 2>to me it doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that's too brutal of a</v>

2014
01:42:31.931 --> 01:42:34.060
<v Speaker 2>standard or would you support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2015
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:35.970
<v Speaker 2>not only is it not too brutal of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard,</v>

2016
01:42:35.971 --> 01:42:36.804
<v Speaker 2>it's actually based in logic because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that don't alter their behavior </v>

2017
01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:40.713
<v Speaker 2>but instead get liposuction almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>always wind up putting that fat back on </v>

2018
01:42:44.471 --> 01:42:46.390
<v Speaker 2>because they have to change your </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

2019
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an issue with their patterns.</v>

2020
01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the number one pattern.</v>

2021
01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:51.610
<v Speaker 2>If someone is thinking about losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

2022
01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:52.473
<v Speaker 2>the number one pattern that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>always encourage people to do besides </v>

2023
01:42:54.431 --> 01:42:58.840
<v Speaker 2>changing their diet to a reduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>radically reduce the amount of sugar and</v>

2024
01:42:58.841 --> 01:43:03.310
<v Speaker 2>bread and pasta they which will in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>of itself eliminate a lot of weight,</v>

2025
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 2>is intermittent fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning have a timed feeding window,</v>

2026
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:11.920
<v Speaker 2>give yourself eight hours a day and eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want to eat for eight hours,</v>

2027
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:15.130
<v Speaker 2>but when that eight hours is done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't eat for 16 hours and that is.</v>

2028
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:19.840
<v Speaker 2>That is law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you just decide what that time window</v>

2029
01:43:19.841 --> 01:43:20.674
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You decide when you're going to start </v>

2030
01:43:21.371 --> 01:43:24.310
<v Speaker 2>eating during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on when you want to eat dinner and</v>

2031
01:43:24.311 --> 01:43:26.140
<v Speaker 2>when you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you put that fork down,</v>

2032
01:43:26.141 --> 01:43:29.650
<v Speaker 2>there is 16 hours between then and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time you ever stuff food in your face.</v>

2033
01:43:29.651 --> 01:43:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing that,</v>

2034
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:32.163
<v Speaker 2>you will lose a lot of weight and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy way to do it and and it's and </v>

2035
01:43:35.381 --> 01:43:40.160
<v Speaker 2>it's mimicking or closer mimic of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary reality.</v>

2036
01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our evolutionary reality.</v>

2037
01:43:41.891 --> 01:43:42.724
<v Speaker 2>You did not have shelves where food was </v>
<v Speaker 2>available everywhere in pantries and </v>

2038
01:43:46.001 --> 01:43:48.490
<v Speaker 2>refrigerators and superimpose a strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>proponent.</v>

2039
01:43:48.491 --> 01:43:51.190
<v Speaker 2>This is a plug for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a friend,</v>

2040
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's</v>

2041
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:56.900
<v Speaker 1>the antifragile guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nassim Taleb as a WHO's also Lebanese by</v>

2042
01:43:56.901 --> 01:43:57.734
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2043
01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 1>someone who's into this intermittent </v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting.</v>

2044
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:02.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think he swears by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken,</v>

2045
01:44:02.630 --> 01:44:04.520
<v Speaker 1>the yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do.</v>

2046
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:06.710
<v Speaker 1>I do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had many,</v>

2047
01:44:06.711 --> 01:44:07.544
<v Speaker 1>many nutritionists and people that study</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science of nutritional absorption </v>

2048
01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:12.374
<v Speaker 1>and science of fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real science to fast and Dom </v>

2049
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:20.390
<v Speaker 1>D'agostino has done some extensive work </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the positive benefits of fasting.</v>

2050
01:44:20.391 --> 01:44:22.640
<v Speaker 1>So it was Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick has discussed this in depth,</v>

2051
01:44:23.150 --> 01:44:27.260
<v Speaker 1>but I'm intermittent fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that timed feeding window is just,</v>

2052
01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:29.300
<v Speaker 1>it's so critical if you can just do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2053
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:30.373
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad just lost 100 pounds doing that </v>

2054
01:44:32.061 --> 01:44:33.590
<v Speaker 1>over the last year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.460
<v Speaker 1>He alters diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2056
01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:37.333
<v Speaker 1>just decided he needed to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the big one is he had a time to </v>

2057
01:44:40.191 --> 01:44:42.350
<v Speaker 1>window and that time to Windows eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours per day.</v>

2058
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:44.730
<v Speaker 1>I organized in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2059
01:44:45.150 --> 01:44:45.983
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in April,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mini summit on health promotion from </v>

2060
01:44:49.671 --> 01:44:50.504
<v Speaker 1>an evolutionary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I invited several physicians who </v>

2061
01:44:53.091 --> 01:44:55.160
<v Speaker 1>are very sympathetic to the evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach,</v>

2062
01:44:55.450 --> 01:44:58.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of identifying ways by which we</v>

2063
01:44:58.131 --> 01:45:02.060
<v Speaker 1>can promote health whilst recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these evolutionary imperatives.</v>

2064
01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could share one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2065
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:06.800
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2066
01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:08.240
<v Speaker 1>that Gino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the,</v>

2067
01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:12.320
<v Speaker 1>when you look at young men who suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>from erectile dysfunction,</v>

2068
01:45:12.710 --> 01:45:16.280
<v Speaker 1>do you know what's the one behavior that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these young men,</v>

2069
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:17.143
<v Speaker 1>because usually of course did I tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>this function is something that is more </v>

2070
01:45:19.251 --> 01:45:20.084
<v Speaker 1>prevalent as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to have to suffer from this </v>

2071
01:45:23.301 --> 01:45:24.134
<v Speaker 1>condition as a young man is an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is the one behavior </v>

2072
01:45:27.681 --> 01:45:28.514
<v Speaker 1>that they share?</v>

2073
01:45:31.130 --> 01:45:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite obvious what.</v>

2074
01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:37.490
<v Speaker 1>So a behavior that's really the true </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental to your health.</v>

2075
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Think of the worst one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol,</v>

2076
01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:42.110
<v Speaker 1>no worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack of sleep.</v>

2077
01:45:43.050 --> 01:45:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Worse drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

2078
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:46.340
<v Speaker 1>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2079
01:45:46.730 --> 01:45:51.730
<v Speaker 1>So heavy smokers are likely to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones who are a director.</v>

2080
01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.570
<v Speaker 1>As far as young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overall vitality has probably decreased.</v>

2081
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:59.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or their body is probably like,</v>

2082
01:45:59.211 --> 01:46:00.140
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so sick,</v>

2083
01:46:00.141 --> 01:46:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be breeding as a matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

2084
01:46:02.250 --> 01:46:03.740
<v Speaker 1>there's some interesting studies looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

2085
01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:04.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2086
01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.460
<v Speaker 1>how erect your penis has as a function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

2087
01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:10.280
<v Speaker 1>as a metric of your overall health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

2088
01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I had mentioned this in several </v>

2089
01:46:15.231 --> 01:46:19.760
<v Speaker 1>lectures and then it actually came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a promotional campaign.</v>

2090
01:46:19.761 --> 01:46:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they watch my lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2091
01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I think Health Canada where they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2092
01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:29.810
<v Speaker 1>advertisement with simply a cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's limp.</v>

2093
01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:30.733
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole now that is exactly </v>

2094
01:46:33.741 --> 01:46:37.340
<v Speaker 1>what an evolutionary health promotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach would be like.</v>

2095
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:40.910
<v Speaker 1>And let me explain why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The typical approach with these types of</v>

2096
01:46:40.911 --> 01:46:41.744
<v Speaker 1>social marketing campaigns is provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with more information and that </v>

2097
01:46:45.801 --> 01:46:50.670
<v Speaker 1>would cause them to alter their behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're behaving in a maladaptive</v>

2098
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:51.503
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you like.</v>

2099
01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 4>It's because they didn't know any </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

2100
01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:57.660
<v Speaker 4>So tell them the likelihood of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering heart disease when they're 73.</v>

2101
01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:00.480
<v Speaker 4>But the reality of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that when I'm 21,</v>

2102
01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:03.420
<v Speaker 4>73 is a long time away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a mortal.</v>

2103
01:47:03.421 --> 01:47:07.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to suffer from these </v>
<v Speaker 4>realities,</v>

2104
01:47:07.261 --> 01:47:08.094
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can easily discount that </v>

2105
01:47:09.001 --> 01:47:10.680
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But tell me,</v>

2106
01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:11.514
<v Speaker 4>show me vividly that I might not be able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to perform with my really hot </v>

2107
01:47:14.941 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2108
01:47:15.931 --> 01:47:16.764
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't take much of an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist to understand that people </v>

2109
01:47:18.871 --> 01:47:19.704
<v Speaker 4>will respond to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to draw another parallel from the </v>

2110
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.823
<v Speaker 4>women's part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women turn out to be the ones who are </v>

2111
01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:29.580
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmingly most likely to expose </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves to the sun,</v>

2112
01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:33.420
<v Speaker 4>whether either the actual natural sun or</v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial sunbeds,</v>

2113
01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:38.160
<v Speaker 4>even though they're much more </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledgeable than men about the effects</v>

2114
01:47:38.161 --> 01:47:40.350
<v Speaker 4>of sun exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not because they didn't know any</v>

2115
01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:41.184
<v Speaker 4>better than they were doing the behavior</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they know more than men and yet </v>

2116
01:47:43.021 --> 01:47:46.260
<v Speaker 4>they do it more so they do it more </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of an aesthetic reason,</v>

2117
01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:48.870
<v Speaker 4>because they think that they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that health glow.</v>

2118
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:49.703
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be at tonight's party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tony's going to be there and I need to </v>

2119
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:53.723
<v Speaker 4>look good for Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you simply tell them that when </v>

2120
01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:56.634
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be 74,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might suffer a greater incidence of </v>

2121
01:47:58.291 --> 01:47:59.550
<v Speaker 4>melanoma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Cares?</v>

2122
01:47:59.850 --> 01:48:00.683
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you show them aesthetic ravages to </v>

2123
01:48:04.291 --> 01:48:05.124
<v Speaker 4>your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that increases their attention to your </v>

2124
01:48:08.461 --> 01:48:11.730
<v Speaker 4>message.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the bottom line is learn what are the</v>

2125
01:48:11.731 --> 01:48:12.564
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary triggers that get people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention and use that rather than </v>

2126
01:48:15.481 --> 01:48:17.010
<v Speaker 4>simply provide them with more </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

2127
01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:21.300
<v Speaker 4>So that is one applied the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this approach.</v>

2128
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:22.163
<v Speaker 4>What are the evolutionary triggers that </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause people to smoke in the first </v>

2129
01:48:23.821 --> 01:48:25.220
<v Speaker 4>place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2130
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:27.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's necessarily an </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary trait.</v>

2131
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just because tobacco is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean is addictive,</v>

2132
01:48:32.161 --> 01:48:32.994
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2133
01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:36.440
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't explain the initial </v>
<v Speaker 4>first time,</v>

2134
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:38.430
<v Speaker 4>start smoking the first time you smoke.</v>

2135
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:40.800
<v Speaker 4>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet what I saw,</v>

2136
01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:42.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going off the cuff here.</v>

2137
01:48:42.631 --> 01:48:44.850
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know because I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought about that exact question.</v>

2138
01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:46.043
<v Speaker 4>It turns out as you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you don't start smoking by the </v>

2139
01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:51.630
<v Speaker 4>age of 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why the number 19,</v>

2140
01:48:51.631 --> 01:48:53.190
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's because it's the teenage </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2141
01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:56.430
<v Speaker 4>You're almost guaranteed to never smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2142
01:48:56.431 --> 01:48:57.264
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the tobacco companies really have to </v>

2143
01:48:58.861 --> 01:49:01.610
<v Speaker 4>get you when you're a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy who started when he was 14,</v>

2144
01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:02.340
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2145
01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:03.173
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a cousin who started at 33 so </v>

2146
01:49:04.531 --> 01:49:06.720
<v Speaker 4>that they are anomalies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy,</v>

2147
01:49:06.721 --> 01:49:09.020
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my feeling is it's probably a form.</v>

2148
01:49:09.021 --> 01:49:12.900
<v Speaker 4>So if I'm going to link it in some way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to an evolutionary mechanism,</v>

2149
01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:15.690
<v Speaker 4>it's probably just pure conformity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2150
01:49:16.050 --> 01:49:20.400
<v Speaker 4>To the extent that that young kids think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the school to smoke,</v>

2151
01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:23.580
<v Speaker 4>they were just going to imitate others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

2152
01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they want to look cool.</v>

2153
01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:26.913
<v Speaker 4>They see that character that's smoking </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just takes that big deep drag in </v>

2154
01:49:30.781 --> 01:49:33.090
<v Speaker 4>that exhale and they're slipping a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rebel.</v>

2155
01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 4>They don't even give a fuck about their </v>
<v Speaker 4>health.</v>

2156
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:36.750
<v Speaker 4>Looking at them out there just smoking </v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes.</v>

2157
01:49:36.751 --> 01:49:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably wearing leather,</v>

2158
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:42.030
<v Speaker 4>looking like a crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what?</v>

2159
01:49:42.031 --> 01:49:43.860
<v Speaker 4>I've never taken a single puff of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire life.</v>

2160
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.150
<v Speaker 4>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you?</v>

2161
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:47.680
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about drugs.</v>

2162
01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 4>Just</v>

2163
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:48.591
<v Speaker 3>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2164
01:49:48.591 --> 01:49:49.001
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2165
01:49:49.001 --> 01:49:49.511
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2166
01:49:49.511 --> 01:49:49.951
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2167
01:49:49.951 --> 01:49:52.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smoked a cigarette when I was 15.</v>

2168
01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:54.340
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quit my sister,</v>

2169
01:49:54.341 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 3>stuck with it for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did it together.</v>

2170
01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:58.090
<v Speaker 3>I was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was 14.</v>

2171
01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:01.210
<v Speaker 3>She smoked for a long time after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why did you see the first time?</v>

2172
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to go back to the time when</v>

2173
01:50:04.121 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 3>I was 15 and asked myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably just wanted to try it.</v>

2174
01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.660
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the adult thing.</v>

2175
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:12.720
<v Speaker 3>We did a lot of adult things that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>gross,</v>

2176
01:50:12.721 --> 01:50:14.800
<v Speaker 3>like we tried liquor and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2177
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.233
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things that we did that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were supposed to do because it was </v>

2178
01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:21.370
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be like a cool person thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's gross.</v>

2179
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.593
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it since then before shows </v>

2180
01:50:27.130 --> 01:50:29.710
<v Speaker 3>because I have friends that were smokers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2181
01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:30.553
<v Speaker 3>I had read that there's a nootropic </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit to nicotine and that one of the </v>

2182
01:50:33.971 --> 01:50:36.940
<v Speaker 3>things that Steven King said when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote his book on writing,</v>

2183
01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the more.</v>

2184
01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:39.243
<v Speaker 3>It's a great book by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on writing if anybody's interested in </v>

2185
01:50:40.751 --> 01:50:43.010
<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coming from a real master,</v>

2186
01:50:43.011 --> 01:50:43.844
<v Speaker 3>a guy who's been incredibly prolific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his attitude and his philosophy on </v>

2187
01:50:47.291 --> 01:50:48.940
<v Speaker 3>writing is pretty unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2188
01:50:48.970 --> 01:50:49.803
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that he said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he struggled after he quit smoking </v>

2189
01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:54.350
<v Speaker 3>because of the synaptic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2190
01:50:54.370 --> 01:50:56.260
<v Speaker 3>the synaptic benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2191
01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:00.130
<v Speaker 3>the cognitive benefits of smoking was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really beneficial for his writing.</v>

2192
01:51:00.150 --> 01:51:00.983
<v Speaker 3>It like really fired up his writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a couple of times back when my </v>

2193
01:51:05.531 --> 01:51:08.380
<v Speaker 3>friend Tony Hinchcliffe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he quit recently quit like a,</v>

2194
01:51:08.381 --> 01:51:10.760
<v Speaker 3>about a year or so ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2195
01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:11.673
<v Speaker 3>but he would smoke and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a couple of times he would be </v>

2196
01:51:13.721 --> 01:51:15.640
<v Speaker 3>smoking before a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a give me one of those things.</v>

2197
01:51:15.850 --> 01:51:16.683
<v Speaker 3>We try that I have no fear at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I would ever be addicted to </v>

2198
01:51:20.651 --> 01:51:22.030
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have zero fear.</v>

2199
01:51:22.031 --> 01:51:22.864
<v Speaker 3>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way in my mindset that I </v>

2200
01:51:24.581 --> 01:51:26.860
<v Speaker 3>would ever allow myself to be physically</v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted,</v>

2201
01:51:26.861 --> 01:51:30.340
<v Speaker 3>but using it as a tool right before I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went onstage,</v>

2202
01:51:30.370 --> 01:51:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I've found it to give me a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a charge.</v>

2203
01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of interesting,</v>

2204
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:34.743
<v Speaker 3>not valuable enough for me to pursue and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily even better than other </v>

2205
01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:45.010
<v Speaker 3>nootropics or other cognitive enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like coffee or,</v>

2206
01:51:45.011 --> 01:51:45.844
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me the real one is breathing and </v>

2207
01:51:47.471 --> 01:51:48.304
<v Speaker 3>moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like to get my blood pumping and </v>

2208
01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:54.130
<v Speaker 3>take some big deep breaths and fire my </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain up and get my,</v>

2209
01:51:54.131 --> 01:51:54.731
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here,</v>

2210
01:51:54.731 --> 01:51:56.680
<v Speaker 3>we already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a cup of coffee earlier.</v>

2211
01:51:56.681 --> 01:51:57.514
<v Speaker 3>But the stimulation of actual dialog of </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to somebody and talking to an </v>

2212
01:52:03.101 --> 01:52:04.780
<v Speaker 3>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful personally yourself,</v>

2213
01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:07.600
<v Speaker 3>aren't you lucky this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exciting.</v>

2214
01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:10.960
<v Speaker 3>It gets you fired up and it gets all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cylinders pumping.</v>

2215
01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:14.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is something to cigarettes.</v>

2216
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.570
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely something I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>founded,</v>

2217
01:52:16.571 --> 01:52:17.404
<v Speaker 3>a stimulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it that made you feel so </v>

2218
01:52:19.570 --> 01:52:23.020
<v Speaker 3>confident that you would not fall prey </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it's addictive properties?</v>

2219
01:52:23.021 --> 01:52:23.854
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am confident that I'm not a loser </v>

2220
01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:26.793
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing anything stupid with my </v>

2221
01:52:28.631 --> 01:52:29.464
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2222
01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that.</v>

2223
01:52:31.391 --> 01:52:36.100
<v Speaker 3>But you don't think that not trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>could over overwhelm your willpower.</v>

2224
01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Impossible doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no door.</v>

2225
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:42.100
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting in La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

2226
01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.170
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking way I'm going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted to cigarettes and people</v>

2227
01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:46.501
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

2228
01:52:46.501 --> 01:52:49.100
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the openness to shut up,</v>

2229
01:52:49.101 --> 01:52:51.230
<v Speaker 2>buzzy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not happening.</v>

2230
01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:52.610
<v Speaker 2>So you could call somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push you,</v>

2231
01:52:52.611 --> 01:52:54.010
<v Speaker 2>but I can't call them the r word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2232
01:52:54.011 --> 01:52:56.790
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it works.</v>

2233
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:58.940
<v Speaker 2>The double standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2234
01:52:58.980 --> 01:52:59.813
<v Speaker 2>pussies also good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with pussy is </v>

2235
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:03.043
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an insult because it's one of the </v>

2236
01:53:04.401 --> 01:53:08.120
<v Speaker 2>most wonderful things the world has ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen at speaking of policies.</v>

2237
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My.</v>

2238
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I put out a sad truth clip where I,</v>

2239
01:53:13.571 --> 01:53:14.404
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regrettably apologize to the Trans </v>

2240
01:53:16.401 --> 01:53:17.234
<v Speaker 2>community because it turns out that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know that my marriage was </v>

2241
01:53:19.941 --> 01:53:20.774
<v Speaker 2>transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know why your marriage is </v>

2242
01:53:22.221 --> 01:53:23.054
<v Speaker 2>transphobic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2243
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:24.733
<v Speaker 2>Because some trans activists have argued</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is ridiculous for heterosexual </v>

2244
01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:33.701
<v Speaker 2>men to strictly want to mate because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about pussies,</v>

2245
01:53:34.410 --> 01:53:35.243
<v Speaker 2>so strictly want to mate with women who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have pussies when there are some women </v>

2246
01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:42.780
<v Speaker 2>who have nine inch penises that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much of a women.</v>

2247
01:53:43.090 --> 01:53:43.923
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I argued that now that I've learned </v>

2248
01:53:46.371 --> 01:53:47.204
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous that I focused on </v>

2249
01:53:49.170 --> 01:53:50.003
<v Speaker 2>building a life as a heterosexual man </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a woman that has a vagina and not </v>

2250
01:53:54.111 --> 01:53:56.900
<v Speaker 2>with a woman that has a nine inch penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And therefore,</v>

2251
01:53:56.901 --> 01:53:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I apologize for my transphobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2252
01:53:58.671 --> 01:53:59.504
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense because </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't it be just like with the fat </v>

2253
01:54:01.581 --> 01:54:06.470
<v Speaker 2>thing that you just just choose whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then be happy with what you got that</v>

2254
01:54:06.471 --> 01:54:09.200
<v Speaker 2>there's no discrimination at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just managed to fall in love.</v>

2255
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:12.580
<v Speaker 2>You just got lucky and it's an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of vagina male,</v>

2256
01:54:12.581 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 2>a woman who has a vagina that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgically created.</v>

2257
01:54:16.130 --> 01:54:20.130
<v Speaker 2>But had I been more progressive and open</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the early now,</v>

2258
01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.180
<v Speaker 2>did you ever date a trans person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2259
01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:24.620
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to date a bunch of people</v>

2260
01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:25.700
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2261
01:54:25.701 --> 01:54:28.640
<v Speaker 2>like to say that you've never dated </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's over six foot five.</v>

2262
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tall phobic.</v>

2263
01:54:30.190 --> 01:54:32.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a ridiculous statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

2264
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:34.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that you've,</v>

2265
01:54:34.041 --> 01:54:34.874
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've never dated anybody that weighs </v>

2266
01:54:35.901 --> 01:54:37.180
<v Speaker 2>more than 300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2267
01:54:37.181 --> 01:54:38.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a,</v>

2268
01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:40.410
<v Speaker 2>you're a mass phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

2269
01:54:40.930 --> 01:54:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just all of it's stupid.</v>

2270
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.890
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid people telling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

2271
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.823
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is it's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are pushing this idea of </v>

2272
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:50.923
<v Speaker 2>being open entirely open to all things </v>
<v Speaker 2>trans that you as a heterosexual person </v>

2273
01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:57.553
<v Speaker 2>should not just recognize that this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman because they transferred from a </v>

2274
01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:02.653
<v Speaker 2>male to a female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but recognize even if they haven't </v>

2275
01:55:05.361 --> 01:55:09.350
<v Speaker 2>transferred and recognize them in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sexual selection in terms of a date.</v>

2276
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:10.363
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just fucking stupid because </v>

2277
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:13.870
<v Speaker 2>you can decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2278
01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:14.713
<v Speaker 2>You're not into certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not really into girls with </v>

2279
01:55:16.821 --> 01:55:19.100
<v Speaker 2>short hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could decide that it's not my thing.</v>

2280
01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't like girls with shaved heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find it attractive.</v>

2281
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.633
<v Speaker 2>Like a woman can say that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like guys have creepy mustaches </v>

2282
01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:29.540
<v Speaker 2>and nobody gets mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if a man says to certain people,</v>

2283
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:33.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into chicks with Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that guy's a piece of shit.</v>

2284
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:34.663
<v Speaker 2>Or what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing called sexual racism </v>

2285
01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:40.550
<v Speaker 2>where you specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2286
01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:42.330
<v Speaker 2>are not attracted to a particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2287
01:55:43.570 --> 01:55:44.403
<v Speaker 2>I don't like</v>

2288
01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Asian men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like black women.</v>

2289
01:55:47.401 --> 01:55:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to instantiate those</v>

2290
01:55:51.481 --> 01:55:52.314
<v Speaker 1>sexual preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the racial q is the one that's </v>

2291
01:55:55.651 --> 01:55:57.900
<v Speaker 1>causing you to either be attracted or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not attached to someone,</v>

2292
01:55:58.230 --> 01:55:59.670
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2293
01:56:00.570 --> 01:56:03.600
<v Speaker 1>well there's certainly beautiful people </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all race,</v>

2294
01:56:03.601 --> 01:56:04.434
<v Speaker 1>so that doesn't make a whole lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to me in terms of the person </v>

2295
01:56:06.611 --> 01:56:07.444
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you tell them you've never seen </v>

2296
01:56:08.911 --> 01:56:10.310
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful black woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2297
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Like you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have met enough black women.</v>

2298
01:56:12.871 --> 01:56:14.970
<v Speaker 1>If you tell me 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful Asian woman,</v>

2299
01:56:14.971 --> 01:56:17.040
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying?</v>

2300
01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Like there's beautiful people in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

2301
01:56:20.791 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 1>you should be allowed to be with whoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want in terms of.</v>

2302
01:56:25.630 --> 01:56:27.930
<v Speaker 1>But why is it it's always sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2303
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Because like obnoxious people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example.</v>

2304
01:56:30.961 --> 01:56:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't like friends that are loud and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get drunk in public.</v>

2305
01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you drunk phobic?</v>

2306
01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't enjoy that.</v>

2307
01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:40.800
<v Speaker 1>So like in terms of sexual selection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dates,</v>

2308
01:56:40.801 --> 01:56:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why that analogy might </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

2309
01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:43.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me the progressive's you could </v>

2310
01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.073
<v Speaker 1>alter your level of obnoxiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could grow out of your boxes as </v>

2311
01:56:49.261 --> 01:56:50.610
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some people,</v>

2312
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:53.340
<v Speaker 1>conceivably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically we're fucked.</v>

2313
01:56:53.370 --> 01:56:54.690
<v Speaker 1>That's just who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

2314
01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:56.120
<v Speaker 1>If you want to name any names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2315
01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:01.350
<v Speaker 1>but your race is a immutable part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2316
01:57:01.410 --> 01:57:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the perspective.</v>

2317
01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I see that I'm playing devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not agreeing with it.</v>

2318
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:06.511
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2319
01:57:06.511 --> 01:57:09.070
<v Speaker 1>what about a tall versus short?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2320
01:57:09.071 --> 01:57:09.904
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a woman volleyball player and </v>

2321
01:57:11.371 --> 01:57:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you're six foot three and you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to date a guy was five feet tall,</v>

2322
01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you.</v>

2323
01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:16.350
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you?</v>

2324
01:57:16.630 --> 01:57:18.510
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the biggest problems with</v>

2325
01:57:18.511 --> 01:57:20.070
<v Speaker 1>being a very tall woman because one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2326
01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:20.700
<v Speaker 1>one of the.</v>

2327
01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:21.533
<v Speaker 1>So there's something called assorted of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mating and evolutionary theory sort of </v>

2328
01:57:23.851 --> 01:57:24.684
<v Speaker 1>meeting is basically birds of a feather </v>
<v Speaker 1>flock together and that's very much the </v>

2329
01:57:28.171 --> 01:57:31.590
<v Speaker 1>mechanism that drives may choice much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than opposites attract.</v>

2330
01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So one of the sources of mating cues </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people most sword on his height,</v>

2331
01:57:36.210 --> 01:57:40.050
<v Speaker 1>so it's not so much that women want guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are only six foot or taller,</v>

2332
01:57:40.051 --> 01:57:42.720
<v Speaker 1>it's just that the woman wants a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's taller than her.</v>

2333
01:57:43.170 --> 01:57:44.003
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a study that I've discussed in </v>

2334
01:57:46.081 --> 01:57:51.081
<v Speaker 1>the past that looked at something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>720 actual couples and I think there was</v>

2335
01:57:51.661 --> 01:57:55.710
<v Speaker 1>only a single one out of the 720 where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman was taller than the man.</v>

2336
01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Now once a woman gets to be over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain height,</v>

2337
01:57:58.651 --> 01:58:00.210
<v Speaker 1>she's six foot two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six foot three.</v>

2338
01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Her potential pool of prospective </v>
<v Speaker 1>suitors really shrinks.</v>

2339
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:08.130
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have a daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really want to pray that she doesn't</v>

2340
01:58:08.131 --> 01:58:12.180
<v Speaker 1>get too tall because boy are her choices</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be limited because few women</v>

2341
01:58:12.181 --> 01:58:14.370
<v Speaker 1>want to date the shorter guy than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:58:14.371 --> 01:58:17.250
<v Speaker 1>When you're a six foot three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six foot four woman,</v>

2343
01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:18.333
<v Speaker 1>you're got to be a tough spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're basically relegated to big </v>

2344
01:58:21.601 --> 01:58:23.820
<v Speaker 1>athletes are big giant people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2345
01:58:23.821 --> 01:58:24.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2346
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:25.183
<v Speaker 1>the other place where you get this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of assorted of mating is where you get </v>

2347
01:58:27.781 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 1>women who are super educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2348
01:58:30.931 --> 01:58:32.640
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exact same thing happened.</v>

2349
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:37.910
<v Speaker 1>The more educated a woman gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worse her marriage prospects because</v>

2350
01:58:38.581 --> 01:58:39.414
<v Speaker 1>the more sophisticated women are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more they insist on a high status </v>

2351
01:58:42.971 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore,</v>

2352
01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:45.363
<v Speaker 1>as I get more educated as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are just fewer men who are as </v>

2353
01:58:48.161 --> 01:58:53.161
<v Speaker 1>educated or more than me and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doomed to a life of solitude.</v>

2354
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:56.200
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense.</v>

2355
01:58:56.201 --> 01:59:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Especially considering that men in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

2356
01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:01.953
<v Speaker 1>they get insecure around women who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more successful and more educated or </v>

2357
01:59:06.371 --> 01:59:07.204
<v Speaker 1>more intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like very rarely are men comfortable </v>

2358
01:59:09.791 --> 01:59:11.980
<v Speaker 1>with a woman who has to explain things </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

2359
01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:14.260
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2361
01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:16.780
<v Speaker 1>So I have another theory which I'd like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to at some point test.</v>

2362
01:59:16.930 --> 01:59:17.763
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone will steal it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have a couple that gets </v>

2363
01:59:20.890 --> 01:59:21.723
<v Speaker 1>married very young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are judging one another based on </v>

2364
01:59:25.421 --> 01:59:27.730
<v Speaker 1>their mate value at 18 or 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2365
01:59:27.731 --> 01:59:28.564
<v Speaker 1>So Tony is the high school quarterback </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he's the hot guy and I'm the </v>

2366
01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:37.450
<v Speaker 1>cheerleader and then later he stagnates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't go on with his career.</v>

2367
01:59:37.451 --> 01:59:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I go on and become a physician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a cheerleader,</v>

2368
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:44.950
<v Speaker 1>so I 29.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is not a huge inequity between our</v>

2369
01:59:44.951 --> 01:59:47.170
<v Speaker 1>two mating values on the meeting market.</v>

2370
01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we were both 19,</v>

2371
01:59:49.151 --> 01:59:51.300
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we had roughly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2372
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:54.790
<v Speaker 1>value made us a very attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable couple,</v>

2373
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:56.800
<v Speaker 1>but tony turned out to be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>loser.</v>

2374
01:59:56.890 --> 01:59:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a lame duck.</v>

2375
01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I.</v>

2376
02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So I have a theory that and I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point tested,</v>

2377
02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe some graduate student will write </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me saying,</v>

2378
02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll work with this on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

2379
02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:08.073
<v Speaker 1>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory whereby I think that in </v>

2380
02:00:10.361 --> 02:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>many cases where people end up divorcing</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they married young,</v>

2381
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:15.303
<v Speaker 1>it's precisely because that which </v>
<v Speaker 1>started as equitable mating values at </v>

2382
02:00:19.781 --> 02:00:20.614
<v Speaker 1>time t zero turned out to have huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>divergence in our trajectory on the </v>

2383
02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:24.643
<v Speaker 1>meeting market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that puts a huge strain on the </v>

2384
02:00:26.501 --> 02:00:29.740
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when the wife status is going</v>

2385
02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:30.633
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the best way to ensure that the </v>

2386
02:00:31.901 --> 02:00:32.734
<v Speaker 1>marriage ends is for the status of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman to keep going up and that the man </v>

2387
02:00:36.761 --> 02:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>to either stagnate or go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be doomed.</v>

2388
02:00:40.690 --> 02:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that also,</v>

2389
02:00:44.650 --> 02:00:45.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the young marriages are rough </v>

2390
02:00:47.021 --> 02:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>because people grow and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily grow together when you catch</v>

2391
02:00:50.501 --> 02:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>people 10 years later and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes radically different people.</v>

2392
02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:54.953
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also the thing that </v>

2393
02:00:56.860 --> 02:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>women don't seem to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

2394
02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>respect a man who's not doing as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2395
02:01:02.910 --> 02:01:03.743
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2396
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a giant issue.</v>

2397
02:01:05.530 --> 02:01:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Even if the is doing okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if your guys making $50,000</v>

2398
02:01:10.181 --> 02:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good living.</v>

2399
02:01:11.471 --> 02:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>He's out there doing well but you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>300,</v>

2400
02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe 300 grand a year and it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>losers over here.</v>

2401
02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>What is 50 grand like you're kicking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass,</v>

2402
02:01:20.771 --> 02:01:21.604
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some big wig at some big </v>

2403
02:01:22.631 --> 02:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>corporation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a real sticking point.</v>

2404
02:01:27.311 --> 02:01:28.144
<v Speaker 1>And with men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they have a household </v>

2405
02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:30.424
<v Speaker 1>where they contributed income together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pile all the income and the man </v>

2406
02:01:34.301 --> 02:01:37.120
<v Speaker 1>starts spending the woman's money on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2407
02:01:37.150 --> 02:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts buying stuff.</v>

2408
02:01:38.421 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>You got a new fishing rod and did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get</v>

2409
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.810
<v Speaker 4>that with your money or my money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2410
02:01:41.811 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 4>it gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2411
02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:45.870
<v Speaker 4>And incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking of say,</v>

2412
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:46.783
<v Speaker 4>consumer psychology stuff that I study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you take a very rich woman and you </v>

2413
02:01:50.721 --> 02:01:54.850
<v Speaker 4>go out on a date with her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though she obviously can afford the</v>

2414
02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:58.160
<v Speaker 4>dinner and she can afford anything that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to buy her,</v>

2415
02:01:58.490 --> 02:02:02.030
<v Speaker 4>if you exhibit cues of frugality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheapness,</v>

2416
02:02:02.630 --> 02:02:05.480
<v Speaker 4>that's the perfect way to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you won't have a second date.</v>

2417
02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:07.980
<v Speaker 4>So it's not so much a question of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2418
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:09.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an old sexist,</v>

2419
02:02:09.911 --> 02:02:12.560
<v Speaker 4>the ritual whereby men were wooing </v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

2420
02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:15.690
<v Speaker 4>It really is an honest signal of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>commitment to,</v>

2421
02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:17.510
<v Speaker 4>to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the best way,</v>

2422
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:19.430
<v Speaker 4>and I get many of these letters where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people asked me,</v>

2423
02:02:19.431 --> 02:02:20.330
<v Speaker 4>hey professor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are,</v>

2424
02:02:21.070 --> 02:02:22.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dating advice.</v>

2425
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:23.803
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do have to exhibit generosity when </v>

2426
02:02:25.431 --> 02:02:28.460
<v Speaker 4>you go out with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nuptial gift giving,</v>

2427
02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:29.150
<v Speaker 4>natural gift giving.</v>

2428
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:34.040
<v Speaker 4>Is it sort of a fancy term for courtship</v>
<v Speaker 4>rituals across animal species?</v>

2429
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:39.430
<v Speaker 4>So many species you have typically the </v>
<v Speaker 4>male engaging in some form of courtship,</v>

2430
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:41.233
<v Speaker 4>gift giving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and depending on the quality of the </v>

2431
02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:44.504
<v Speaker 4>gift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will determine whether the female will </v>

2432
02:02:45.951 --> 02:02:46.784
<v Speaker 4>mate with your not well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much of what we do in marketing </v>

2433
02:02:49.221 --> 02:02:50.930
<v Speaker 4>context is exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2434
02:02:50.931 --> 02:02:54.110
<v Speaker 4>It's the exact same phenomenon repeating</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself in the human context,</v>

2435
02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:55.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2436
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.980
<v Speaker 4>engagement rings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2437
02:02:58.340 --> 02:02:59.173
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you are supposed to spend </v>
<v Speaker 4>a quarter of your yearly salary on this </v>

2438
02:03:02.571 --> 02:03:04.040
<v Speaker 4>rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really what it is.</v>

2439
02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:06.800
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if everybody meets it,</v>

2440
02:03:06.801 --> 02:03:08.130
<v Speaker 4>but that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is that right?</v>

2441
02:03:08.131 --> 02:03:09.710
<v Speaker 4>It's three months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exact God.</v>

2442
02:03:09.711 --> 02:03:11.870
<v Speaker 4>When you say a quarter of the yearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>salary,</v>

2443
02:03:11.871 --> 02:03:15.560
<v Speaker 4>it makes you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is wrong with people,</v>

2444
02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:17.990
<v Speaker 4>but the reason so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the,</v>

2445
02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:19.190
<v Speaker 4>but here's the reason.</v>

2446
02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:23.360
<v Speaker 4>Here's the reason you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what's called a hobby and signal.</v>

2447
02:03:23.361 --> 02:03:24.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I've ever discussed this</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this,</v>

2448
02:03:24.821 --> 02:03:29.821
<v Speaker 4>in this podcast is a hobby and signal is</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically the idea that for a signal,</v>

2449
02:03:30.291 --> 02:03:32.780
<v Speaker 4>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be costly,</v>

2450
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:34.490
<v Speaker 4>otherwise everybody could imitate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2451
02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:35.440
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2452
02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:36.740
<v Speaker 4>so think about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2453
02:03:36.741 --> 02:03:39.050
<v Speaker 4>rites of passage in different cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2454
02:03:39.230 --> 02:03:41.570
<v Speaker 4>If you want to demonstrate that you're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>top warrior,</v>

2455
02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:45.740
<v Speaker 4>the rite of passage has to be brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise,</v>

2456
02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:48.560
<v Speaker 4>if it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all have to do five setups than every</v>

2457
02:03:48.561 --> 02:03:49.394
<v Speaker 4>male could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the females can determine the </v>

2458
02:03:51.590 --> 02:03:53.210
<v Speaker 4>pretenders from the real guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2459
02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:54.530
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have,</v>

2460
02:03:54.531 --> 02:03:56.240
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bullet ant,</v>

2461
02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:57.410
<v Speaker 4>you know this one too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2462
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:58.663
<v Speaker 4>You put your hands through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that takes a lot of courage and </v>

2463
02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:03.340
<v Speaker 4>capacity to people who don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about.</v>

2464
02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:07.310
<v Speaker 4>So this is a tribe in the Amazon whereby</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take the bullet,</v>

2465
02:04:07.311 --> 02:04:08.144
<v Speaker 4>ant is supposedly the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest purveyor of pain that is </v>

2466
02:04:12.051 --> 02:04:14.010
<v Speaker 4>humanly possible that you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

2467
02:04:14.011 --> 02:04:15.860
<v Speaker 4>My friend Steve gets done by one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it,</v>

2468
02:04:15.861 --> 02:04:19.190
<v Speaker 4>and what did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in Bolivia,</v>

2469
02:04:19.250 --> 02:04:20.680
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2470
02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:25.310
<v Speaker 4>he got stung and in his heel got them in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the heel and he said it was just,</v>

2471
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:27.240
<v Speaker 4>he was delirious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

2472
02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:28.790
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Said it lasts for a few hours,</v>

2473
02:04:28.791 --> 02:04:29.780
<v Speaker 4>then it goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2474
02:04:29.781 --> 02:04:30.614
<v Speaker 4>So what they do in this tribe is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>take a bunch of these ants in the order </v>

2475
02:04:34.551 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 4>of a couple of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is enough to cause agonizing,</v>

2476
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:39.720
<v Speaker 4>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>delirious pain,</v>

2477
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:45.470
<v Speaker 4>and they said date them through this </v>
<v Speaker 4>compound a and then they enter,</v>

2478
02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:52.620
<v Speaker 4>weave them in these gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these a leaf gloves so that when they're</v>

2479
02:04:52.921 --> 02:04:53.754
<v Speaker 4>coming to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come out of their stupor and you </v>

2480
02:04:56.191 --> 02:04:59.760
<v Speaker 4>have your hands in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start viciously biting you,</v>

2481
02:04:59.790 --> 02:05:00.623
<v Speaker 4>stinging you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're supposed to withstand that </v>

2482
02:05:03.721 --> 02:05:05.220
<v Speaker 4>pain without screaming.</v>

2483
02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.053
<v Speaker 4>You have to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you sort of almost go onto this </v>

2484
02:05:07.621 --> 02:05:11.370
<v Speaker 4>religious fervor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this kind of an incantation,</v>

2485
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:16.790
<v Speaker 4>and you have to do that ritual 20 </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate occasions at different times on</v>

2486
02:05:18.421 --> 02:05:22.200
<v Speaker 4>different days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 slash 20 before you are admitted into</v>

2487
02:05:22.201 --> 02:05:24.180
<v Speaker 4>the tribe of Warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2488
02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:26.700
<v Speaker 4>Well now let's think back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>engagement ring,</v>

2489
02:05:26.701 --> 02:05:27.534
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If all it takes for me to convince you </v>

2490
02:05:29.911 --> 02:05:34.500
<v Speaker 4>of my honest intentions is to buy you </v>
<v Speaker 4>flowers and now let's go back behind the</v>

2491
02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:36.420
<v Speaker 4>shed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have sex,</v>

2492
02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:40.320
<v Speaker 4>well then a lot of cheaters are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>convince you of doing this one.</v>

2493
02:05:40.321 --> 02:05:41.154
<v Speaker 4>They really didn't have good intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it takes for me to spend a </v>

2494
02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:47.160
<v Speaker 4>quarter of my salary to convince you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I have honestly,</v>

2495
02:05:47.250 --> 02:05:48.083
<v Speaker 4>so therefore this is a form of what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>called is a hobby and signaling because </v>

2496
02:05:50.331 --> 02:05:54.420
<v Speaker 4>it's a hobby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a Israeli ornithologist that studied</v>

2497
02:05:54.421 --> 02:05:55.254
<v Speaker 4>this type of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this costly signaling behavior using </v>

2498
02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Arabian babblers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a type of bird.</v>

2499
02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:02.040
<v Speaker 4>So here's another example of as a hobby </v>
<v Speaker 4>having signal,</v>

2500
02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:08.440
<v Speaker 4>you probably have seen this when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a Predator that's looking at who to</v>

2501
02:06:08.581 --> 02:06:12.240
<v Speaker 4>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you often will have gazelles starting to</v>

2502
02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:17.340
<v Speaker 4>actually make themselves conspicuously </v>
<v Speaker 4>visible to the Predator.</v>

2503
02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:19.350
<v Speaker 4>They come close to them and they start </v>
<v Speaker 4>jumping from,</v>

2504
02:06:19.351 --> 02:06:21.540
<v Speaker 4>have you ever seen this student?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called stroking,</v>

2505
02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:22.973
<v Speaker 4>not strutting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And can you think why that would be </v>

2506
02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:27.810
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are they not hiding?</v>

2507
02:06:27.811 --> 02:06:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Why are they not making themselves a </v>
<v Speaker 4>inconspicuously?</v>

2508
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:32.303
<v Speaker 4>Why are they drawing attention to </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves when they are 50 different </v>

2509
02:06:36.331 --> 02:06:38.310
<v Speaker 4>gazelles that the Predator could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>pointing to?</v>

2510
02:06:38.610 --> 02:06:39.510
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2511
02:06:39.511 --> 02:06:40.344
<v Speaker 4>because what what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that animal is saying is the fact </v>

2512
02:06:44.611 --> 02:06:45.444
<v Speaker 4>that I could stand here in front of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and jump up and down and make myself </v>

2513
02:06:49.890 --> 02:06:50.723
<v Speaker 4>this visible suggests that it's probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lost cause for you to try to go after </v>

2514
02:06:55.981 --> 02:06:56.190
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2515
02:06:56.190 --> 02:06:57.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm Super Fit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2516
02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:03.000
<v Speaker 4>It's a costly signal of my fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an honest signal,</v>

2517
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:03.893
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one who is not doing this behavior </v>

2518
02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:09.940
<v Speaker 4>is the one that you should be paying </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to interest.</v>

2519
02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:13.560
<v Speaker 4>So this is called and so I use this </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle of as a hobby and signaling to</v>

2520
02:07:13.561 --> 02:07:15.870
<v Speaker 4>explain things like conspicuous </v>
<v Speaker 4>consumption,</v>

2521
02:07:15.871 --> 02:07:16.704
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why you buy the fancy car </v>

2522
02:07:19.081 --> 02:07:21.900
<v Speaker 4>that the other males can't hope to </v>
<v Speaker 4>purchase,</v>

2523
02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:26.700
<v Speaker 4>it's precisely because they can't afford</v>
<v Speaker 4>to match your signal.</v>

2524
02:07:26.850 --> 02:07:27.683
<v Speaker 4>Therefore it's an honest signal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why I buy 100 million dollar </v>

2525
02:07:30.631 --> 02:07:35.631
<v Speaker 4>painting that a monkey could have drawn </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows how wealthy I am,</v>

2526
02:07:36.071 --> 02:07:38.590
<v Speaker 4>that I could waste $100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million dollars.</v>

2527
02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

2528
02:07:41.150 --> 02:07:43.250
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all just meeting stuff.</v>

2529
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:44.263
<v Speaker 2>It's mating and food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to become somebody </v>

2530
02:07:47.031 --> 02:07:47.864
<v Speaker 2>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to find dinner and you want to </v>

2531
02:07:48.831 --> 02:07:50.630
<v Speaker 2>have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goodnight everybody.</v>

2532
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those signals are so fascinating.</v>

2533
02:07:54.741 --> 02:07:57.680
<v Speaker 2>When we see them in our culture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get angry at them,</v>

2534
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:58.783
<v Speaker 2>like you see some guy pull up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferrari and you go look at this fucking </v>

2535
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:03.170
<v Speaker 2>loser with those little Duke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2536
02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:04.083
<v Speaker 2>You're like maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe a guy with a shitload of money </v>

2537
02:08:06.741 --> 02:08:10.370
<v Speaker 2>wants to let the world know because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>likes to fuck you.</v>

2538
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've shared actually on this show,</v>

2539
02:08:12.411 --> 02:08:13.244
<v Speaker 2>I think the stories about my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my brothers who was a big car </v>

2540
02:08:15.891 --> 02:08:17.840
<v Speaker 2>collector,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three Ferrari's,</v>

2541
02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:19.033
<v Speaker 2>Aston Martin Lagonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've even shared a story which I'm </v>

2542
02:08:22.281 --> 02:08:23.114
<v Speaker 2>happy to repeat of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would go to nightclubs where he's </v>

2543
02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:28.220
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the Olympian,</v>

2544
02:08:28.221 --> 02:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>this is the five foot three guy,</v>

2545
02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:31.853
<v Speaker 4>go to nightclubs and he would pick the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most beautiful woman and approach her </v>

2546
02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:36.780
<v Speaker 4>even though she's accompanied by six </v>
<v Speaker 4>foot four,</v>

2547
02:08:37.110 --> 02:08:38.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tough fucking guy.</v>

2548
02:08:39.330 --> 02:08:40.163
<v Speaker 4>And he had that confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think because he had that wealth </v>

2549
02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:45.940
<v Speaker 4>catapulting him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

2550
02:08:46.130 --> 02:08:47.990
<v Speaker 2>certainly helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly helps.</v>

2551
02:08:48.230 --> 02:08:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

2552
02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.273
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2553
02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.133
<v Speaker 2>it is a weird ever prevalent aspect in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the communication between men and </v>

2554
02:08:58.491 --> 02:09:01.460
<v Speaker 2>females is how much money does the man </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2555
02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:02.331
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2556
02:09:02.331 --> 02:09:03.164
<v Speaker 2>and this is one thing that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women hate because they don't want to </v>

2557
02:09:05.511 --> 02:09:07.460
<v Speaker 2>feel like they can be purchased and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

2558
02:09:07.490 --> 02:09:09.410
<v Speaker 2>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't,</v>

2559
02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.220
<v Speaker 2>some can write a lot can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a factor.</v>

2560
02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:18.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a big and a lot of women are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>just rabidly ruthlessly independent.</v>

2561
02:09:18.141 --> 02:09:20.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't want that ever in their life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and good for them.</v>

2562
02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:21.313
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is that's a very </v>

2563
02:09:23.901 --> 02:09:24.734
<v Speaker 2>effective strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pull up in that Ferrari or that </v>

2564
02:09:27.471 --> 02:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Rolls Royce or whatever the fuck you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving and it,</v>

2565
02:09:29.791 --> 02:09:30.624
<v Speaker 2>it has a big impact and you get to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nightclub and those studies have been </v>

2566
02:09:33.591 --> 02:09:36.850
<v Speaker 2>done endlessly and psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's one example,</v>

2567
02:09:36.930 --> 02:09:39.900
<v Speaker 4>and you don't need to have a signal as </v>
<v Speaker 4>big as a Ferrari,</v>

2568
02:09:40.110 --> 02:09:43.860
<v Speaker 4>just how you dress in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>status that is exhibited.</v>

2569
02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:47.130
<v Speaker 4>So there's a study that was done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in the early nineties where they</v>

2570
02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:50.010
<v Speaker 4>manipulated the status,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sartorial,</v>

2571
02:09:50.011 --> 02:09:50.844
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the attire of men and women into one of </v>

2572
02:09:53.581 --> 02:09:54.480
<v Speaker 4>three different types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2573
02:09:54.481 --> 02:09:55.314
<v Speaker 4>high status,</v>
<v Speaker 4>medium and know some tee shirt or a </v>

2574
02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.470
<v Speaker 4>McDonald's uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2575
02:09:58.950 --> 02:10:01.290
<v Speaker 4>And then they asked men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2576
02:10:02.130 --> 02:10:03.460
<v Speaker 4>one of six possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2577
02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:06.750
<v Speaker 4>would you go out for coffee with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy when you go out on dinner,</v>

2578
02:10:06.751 --> 02:10:08.340
<v Speaker 4>would you have sex with him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you marry him?</v>

2579
02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:11.760
<v Speaker 4>And across all six levels of </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships,</v>

2580
02:10:12.150 --> 02:10:17.150
<v Speaker 4>the status of the attire of a man had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>profound effect on the likelihood of the</v>

2581
02:10:17.431 --> 02:10:19.980
<v Speaker 4>woman saying yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher status,</v>

2582
02:10:19.981 --> 02:10:24.981
<v Speaker 4>the more likely she said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That same manipulation on women had zero</v>

2583
02:10:25.891 --> 02:10:28.170
<v Speaker 4>effect on men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

2584
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:31.560
<v Speaker 4>no man has ever uttered the following </v>
<v Speaker 4>words,</v>

2585
02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:33.710
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a but,</v>

2586
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:34.723
<v Speaker 4>and I'd love to have sex with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not exhibiting cues of </v>

2587
02:10:37.281 --> 02:10:39.590
<v Speaker 4>ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>therefore no sex for you,</v>

2588
02:10:39.591 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Linda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2589
02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:42.353
<v Speaker 3>So that's a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a reality that people are very </v>

2590
02:10:44.341 --> 02:10:45.174
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think women necessarily are </v>

2591
02:10:48.931 --> 02:10:52.560
<v Speaker 3>craving the same reaction from men </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of their ambition.</v>

2592
02:10:52.561 --> 02:10:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think women are ever saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>through my ambition,</v>

2593
02:10:56.311 --> 02:10:58.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get a good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2594
02:10:58.230 --> 02:10:59.063
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2595
02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:03.930
<v Speaker 3>just not a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they do say through my ambition,</v>

2596
02:11:03.931 --> 02:11:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to need a map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

2597
02:11:06.090 --> 02:11:08.150
<v Speaker 3>That's because that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2598
02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.433
<v Speaker 3>the reality is there's a lot of shitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings out there and some of them </v>

2599
02:11:12.151 --> 02:11:12.984
<v Speaker 3>have penises and if you're a woman and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you run into too many of those or for </v>

2600
02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:19.470
<v Speaker 3>buy for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of your environment,</v>

2601
02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:21.870
<v Speaker 3>because of your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the circles,</v>

2602
02:11:21.871 --> 02:11:24.960
<v Speaker 3>you travel in your around too many of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2603
02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:27.870
<v Speaker 3>a large dating pool of shitheads out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2604
02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:29.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just say,</v>

2605
02:11:29.281 --> 02:11:31.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't want this in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want.</v>

2606
02:11:31.001 --> 02:11:33.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be like my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be like my sister.</v>

2607
02:11:33.931 --> 02:11:37.950
<v Speaker 3>I want to be independent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you're not saying is I am going</v>

2608
02:11:37.951 --> 02:11:42.030
<v Speaker 3>to get a bar house and a baller car and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get me a man.</v>

2609
02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:45.990
<v Speaker 3>And the only woman that I know of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever heard say that is disgusting.</v>

2610
02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:47.910
<v Speaker 3>And the only woman that I ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

2611
02:11:48.070 --> 02:11:48.903
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about her success and our </v>

2612
02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:53.130
<v Speaker 3>success allows her to get men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a foul beast.</v>

2613
02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:54.051
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2614
02:11:54.051 --> 02:11:55.470
<v Speaker 3>She's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not healthy.</v>

2615
02:11:56.350 --> 02:11:57.183
<v Speaker 4>A lot of women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not so much that they're </v>

2616
02:11:58.321 --> 02:11:59.154
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean resources are good only to the </v>

2617
02:12:01.051 --> 02:12:03.870
<v Speaker 4>extent that they allow you to ascend the</v>
<v Speaker 4>social hierarchy,</v>

2618
02:12:03.871 --> 02:12:04.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2619
02:12:04.610 --> 02:12:08.130
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't explain why some women are </v>
<v Speaker 4>attracted to the starving artists,</v>

2620
02:12:08.131 --> 02:12:08.964
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because why are so many women </v>

2621
02:12:10.201 --> 02:12:12.000
<v Speaker 4>romanticizing over the guy with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guitar.</v>

2622
02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:16.950
<v Speaker 4>But that's because they are choosing him</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on his future trajectory.</v>

2623
02:12:16.951 --> 02:12:18.260
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am back.</v>

2624
02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:20.093
<v Speaker 4>I am banking on the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>exhibit enough talent that I suspect </v>

2625
02:12:24.451 --> 02:12:27.000
<v Speaker 4>that by investing in you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by choosing you,</v>

2626
02:12:27.210 --> 02:12:28.950
<v Speaker 4>it's going to take me to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>trajectory.</v>

2627
02:12:29.070 --> 02:12:31.440
<v Speaker 4>No woman has ever uttered the following </v>
<v Speaker 4>words.</v>

2628
02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:35.310
<v Speaker 4>You have no talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You exhibit no ambition.</v>

2629
02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:37.740
<v Speaker 4>You're never going to step out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>basement.</v>

2630
02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:39.100
<v Speaker 4>Let's have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2631
02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:40.133
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not that women are only </v>

2632
02:12:41.521 --> 02:12:45.210
<v Speaker 4>interested in money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're interested in a panoply of cues,</v>

2633
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:50.070
<v Speaker 4>all of which relate to the potential of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ascending the social hierarchy.</v>

2634
02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense,</v>

2635
02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:57.220
<v Speaker 3>but it makes sense that these things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>biologically interwoven into our psyche.</v>

2636
02:12:57.570 --> 02:12:58.680
<v Speaker 3>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>

2637
02:12:58.710 --> 02:12:59.211
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just.</v>

2638
02:12:59.211 --> 02:13:00.450
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unavoidable.</v>

2639
02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:00.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

2640
02:13:00.850 --> 02:13:01.683
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm always on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the first time that I came on </v>

2641
02:13:03.131 --> 02:13:04.090
<v Speaker 4>this show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we discussed this.</v>

2642
02:13:04.100 --> 02:13:08.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm always amazed that so many people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have such antipathy towards evolutionary</v>

2643
02:13:08.381 --> 02:13:11.500
<v Speaker 4>psychology because there is really no </v>
<v Speaker 4>other game in town.</v>

2644
02:13:11.501 --> 02:13:15.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What else could explain the evolution of</v>

2645
02:13:15.581 --> 02:13:19.630
<v Speaker 4>the most important organ that defines </v>
<v Speaker 4>our person had called the human mind,</v>

2646
02:13:19.631 --> 02:13:20.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2647
02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:21.273
<v Speaker 4>you're comfortable accepting that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>liver and the kidneys and the heart has </v>

2648
02:13:24.341 --> 02:13:25.174
<v Speaker 4>evolved through evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't accept that your mind and </v>

2649
02:13:27.851 --> 02:13:29.420
<v Speaker 4>your brain has evolved through </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolution,</v>

2650
02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:31.860
<v Speaker 4>so it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an form</v>

2651
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:37.250
<v Speaker 1>insane form of science denialism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent 25 years fighting and I'm not</v>

2652
02:13:38.281 --> 02:13:40.650
<v Speaker 1>sure if I'm any closer to winning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>

2653
02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.680
<v Speaker 1>It's the only form of science denialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's culturally acceptable.</v>

2654
02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:44.543
<v Speaker 1>It's culturally acceptable because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>defines people in a way that makes them </v>

2655
02:13:47.521 --> 02:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>feel like animals or makes them feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap or it makes them feel like they're</v>

2656
02:13:50.551 --> 02:13:52.120
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2657
02:13:52.130 --> 02:13:52.963
<v Speaker 1>It makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes people feel like they're </v>

2658
02:13:53.521 --> 02:13:55.050
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and interestingly,</v>

2659
02:13:55.051 --> 02:13:55.884
<v Speaker 1>it comes a lot more for this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of science than eyes and from the </v>

2660
02:13:58.681 --> 02:13:59.514
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why a lot of a lot of people </v>

2661
02:14:01.081 --> 02:14:02.460
<v Speaker 1>will write me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2662
02:14:02.461 --> 02:14:05.670
<v Speaker 1>why do you seem to be critiquing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more people on the left and the right?</v>

2663
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:08.670
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not showing my political colors.</v>

2664
02:14:08.671 --> 02:14:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It's simply because the ecosystem that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate in,</v>

2665
02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:12.893
<v Speaker 1>which is called academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just so happens that most of the bs </v>

2666
02:14:15.391 --> 02:14:19.080
<v Speaker 1>comes from the left because the academia</v>
<v Speaker 1>is laden with leftists,</v>

2667
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:22.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's not so much that I give a free </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass to the right.</v>

2668
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:25.770
<v Speaker 1>When you have a right wing senator who </v>
<v Speaker 1>denies evolution,</v>

2669
02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:26.633
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first to also critique him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is when it comes to </v>

2670
02:14:29.371 --> 02:14:32.250
<v Speaker 1>human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really the leftists who are denying</v>

2671
02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.200
<v Speaker 1>the biological basis of our human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

2672
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that this science </v>
<v Speaker 1>denialism is so prevalent on the last,</v>

2673
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.863
<v Speaker 1>on the left when it comes to gender?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because gender seems to be the </v>

2674
02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:46.260
<v Speaker 1>battleground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be the battle ground even in</v>

2675
02:14:46.261 --> 02:14:47.910
<v Speaker 1>terms of transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2676
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2677
02:14:49.201 --> 02:14:50.034
<v Speaker 1>the battleground of gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the gender pay gap or </v>

2678
02:14:53.551 --> 02:14:58.551
<v Speaker 1>whether it's traditional gender roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be where science denialism</v>

2679
02:15:00.090 --> 02:15:04.130
<v Speaker 1>lives on the left in the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2680
02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:09.160
<v Speaker 1>like what I always grew up thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the left,</v>

2681
02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:10.433
<v Speaker 1>the left was always more open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were supposed to be the more </v>

2682
02:15:13.681 --> 02:15:17.010
<v Speaker 1>educated and they were supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more compassionate people.</v>

2683
02:15:17.490 --> 02:15:20.820
<v Speaker 1>So something happened and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it happened,</v>

2684
02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this science denialism and this,</v>

2685
02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:26.813
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that if it shows any </v>

2686
02:15:29.881 --> 02:15:30.714
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's any statistics or any data </v>

2687
02:15:32.701 --> 02:15:34.620
<v Speaker 1>that shows differences between the men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the women,</v>

2688
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:36.090
<v Speaker 1>that this is somehow.</v>

2689
02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:39.013
<v Speaker 1>This is somehow an example of sexism or </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal tyranny or there's a reason </v>

2690
02:15:46.281 --> 02:15:49.580
<v Speaker 1>for this that's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the reason is actually quite,</v>

2691
02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:50.533
<v Speaker 1>quite simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the right wing folks who deny </v>

2692
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:57.200
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's typically for religious ideological</v>

2693
02:15:57.201 --> 02:15:58.760
<v Speaker 1>reasons for industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2694
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.863
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is some pet ideology that is </v>

2695
02:16:02.361 --> 02:16:03.194
<v Speaker 1>threatening me and therefore I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deny science this exact same thing </v>

2696
02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:08.323
<v Speaker 1>happening with the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also have been parametize a quasi </v>

2697
02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:13.040
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called progressivism.</v>

2698
02:16:13.130 --> 02:16:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say progressivism in quotes,</v>

2699
02:16:15.501 --> 02:16:16.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2700
02:16:16.381 --> 02:16:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcomes and all the rest of</v>

2701
02:16:18.501 --> 02:16:19.310
<v Speaker 1>the garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2702
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:23.660
<v Speaker 1>And therefore to the extent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary theory in general,</v>

2703
02:16:23.690 --> 02:16:24.523
<v Speaker 1>but evolutionary psychology in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular is a threat to my quasi </v>

2704
02:16:28.251 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 1>religion than I will reject</v>

2705
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.280
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why evolution deniers tend to be</v>

2706
02:16:33.281 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 2>on the right and evolution psychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that iris than to be on the left.</v>

2707
02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:39.820
<v Speaker 2>They've both been parasitized by </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions.</v>

2708
02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:41.720
<v Speaker 2>They're just different religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so,</v>

2709
02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:42.753
<v Speaker 2>that's a fast anyway to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that progressivism is in fact some sort </v>

2710
02:16:46.421 --> 02:16:47.254
<v Speaker 2>of religion and it makes sense if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the science denialism aspect </v>

2711
02:16:49.871 --> 02:16:54.010
<v Speaker 2>of it because you're not looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of an objective analysis of all</v>

2712
02:16:54.011 --> 02:16:55.660
<v Speaker 2>the facts and the data that's in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you.</v>

2713
02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:56.733
<v Speaker 2>You're saying what fits this construct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what fits this pattern of behavior that </v>

2714
02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:02.434
<v Speaker 2>I've chosen to adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I have to show all the people </v>

2715
02:17:04.451 --> 02:17:08.110
<v Speaker 2>that are around me like you accused Sean</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carroll of doing,</v>

2716
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:12.760
<v Speaker 2>adopting this instead of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual facts of this case.</v>

2717
02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2718
02:17:14.921 --> 02:17:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Did you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had the grievance studies focused on</v>

2719
02:17:17.271 --> 02:17:17.830
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>

2720
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Peter,</v>

2721
02:17:19.241 --> 02:17:22.120
<v Speaker 2>but goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Kim's Lindsey,</v>

2722
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:23.950
<v Speaker 2>could you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you believe that?</v>

2723
02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:27.370
<v Speaker 2>This is stuff that is repeatedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful,</v>

2724

<v Speaker 2>James Lindsey and Peter Boghossian.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2730

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2731
02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:45.333
<v Speaker 2>And they came on the podcast and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about all these different false </v>

2732
02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:50.673
<v Speaker 2>studies and false papers that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>published that were peer reviewed and </v>

2733
02:17:54.221 --> 02:17:55.054
<v Speaker 2>published in academic journals that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like what was the one </v>

2734
02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:04.010
<v Speaker 2>heteronormativity in dog parks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2735
02:18:04.090 --> 02:18:05.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

2736
02:18:05.230 --> 02:18:06.063
<v Speaker 2>the humping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tell you a quick funny story </v>

2737
02:18:07.961 --> 02:18:10.720
<v Speaker 2>phobia and dog parks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll,</v>

2738
02:18:10.721 --> 02:18:12.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this,</v>

2739
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:16.870
<v Speaker 2>a few folks knew about this project </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it came out.</v>

2740
02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:20.670
<v Speaker 2>One of them has a name that sounds like </v>
<v Speaker 2>glaad slide.</v>

2741
02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that guy.</v>

2742
02:18:23.290 --> 02:18:24.280
<v Speaker 2>He's just glad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Father,</v>

2743
02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:25.173
<v Speaker 2>he's the godfather now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that I didn't know the </v>

2744
02:18:27.791 --> 02:18:28.624
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which particular studies they were </v>

2745
02:18:29.321 --> 02:18:30.910
<v Speaker 2>sending out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew about the general project,</v>

2746
02:18:30.911 --> 02:18:34.180
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know the details and so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted this project go on for,</v>

2747
02:18:34.181 --> 02:18:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it was maybe 18 months if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not mistaken,</v>

2748
02:18:36.551 --> 02:18:38.110
<v Speaker 2>something that order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2749
02:18:38.190 --> 02:18:40.870
<v Speaker 2>at one point I was flipping through </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2750
02:18:40.871 --> 02:18:41.704
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw the dog rape culture stuff </v>

2751
02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.510
<v Speaker 2>new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I contact feet.</v>

2752
02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:47.913
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2753
02:18:48.250 --> 02:18:50.140
<v Speaker 2>there was no even sanitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't.</v>

2754
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

2755
02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I go dog park rape you.</v>

2756
02:18:56.510 --> 02:19:01.120
<v Speaker 2>So he calls me up like within a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds he's just cracking up laughing.</v>

2757
02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:04.180
<v Speaker 2>That's the background to some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>

2758
02:19:04.210 --> 02:19:05.043
<v Speaker 2>He was up for some sort of disciplinary </v>
<v Speaker 2>review right after he left the podcast </v>

2759
02:19:09.281 --> 02:19:12.220
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that went or what went.</v>

2760
02:19:12.250 --> 02:19:14.040
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are gunning for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2761
02:19:14.290 --> 02:19:15.910
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was explaining that,</v>

2762
02:19:15.911 --> 02:19:20.290
<v Speaker 2>but I think what he's doing is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable and I think that it needs to be</v>

2763
02:19:20.291 --> 02:19:23.950
<v Speaker 2>known and especially in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>people listening to this,</v>

2764
02:19:23.951 --> 02:19:27.530
<v Speaker 2>they're going to send their kids to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking schools and spend $50,000</v>

2765
02:19:27.531 --> 02:19:28.364
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

2766
02:19:28.620 --> 02:19:29.750
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2767
02:19:29.751 --> 02:19:31.250
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often times people write to me.</v>

2768
02:19:31.251 --> 02:19:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Even even my wife was telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2769
02:19:33.231 --> 02:19:34.064
<v Speaker 1>why do you care so much about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because imagine all of these </v>

2770
02:19:37.341 --> 02:19:38.174
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spending their parents hard </v>

2771
02:19:39.021 --> 02:19:39.854
<v Speaker 1>earned money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have been studying tons of </v>

2772
02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:43.820
<v Speaker 1>really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true things and I don't mean true.</v>

2773
02:19:43.821 --> 02:19:44.654
<v Speaker 1>It has to be scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could study art and you could study </v>

2774
02:19:47.001 --> 02:19:48.740
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could study philosophy,</v>

2775
02:19:48.890 --> 02:19:49.723
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not creating a hierarchy of </v>

2776
02:19:50.901 --> 02:19:52.220
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good,</v>

2777
02:19:52.221 --> 02:19:55.820
<v Speaker 1>but as long as you are committed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to logic and so on,</v>

2778
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:59.540
<v Speaker 1>these fields are what I call </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual terrorism.</v>

2779
02:19:59.630 --> 02:20:04.630
<v Speaker 1>They're nihilists and it pisses me off </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a professor that they've been allowed</v>

2780
02:20:04.671 --> 02:20:06.680
<v Speaker 1>to promulgate for 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years,</v>

2781
02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:07.813
<v Speaker 1>untouched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those who argue that these guys </v>

2782
02:20:10.581 --> 02:20:12.050
<v Speaker 1>were frauds because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2783
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2784
02:20:12.501 --> 02:20:14.450
<v Speaker 1>they submitted these papers under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pseudonym.</v>

2785
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you expect them to do?</v>

2786
02:20:15.951 --> 02:20:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2787
02:20:16.290 --> 02:20:17.123
<v Speaker 1>if you're a whistleblower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you not submit your complaint or </v>

2788
02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:21.793
<v Speaker 1>using the name Jane Doe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that they use a pseudonym </v>

2789
02:20:24.561 --> 02:20:25.394
<v Speaker 1>that's hardly fraudulent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to demonstrate how </v>

2790
02:20:28.071 --> 02:20:28.904
<v Speaker 1>fraudulent that whole enterprise is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what if you use the false name and </v>

2791
02:20:31.671 --> 02:20:32.780
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you agree?</v>

2792
02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

2793
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:34.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2794
02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:35.593
<v Speaker 1>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important to expose this idiocy </v>

2795
02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:39.853
<v Speaker 1>because it's so prevalent and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and there's a bunch of fake </v>

2796
02:20:42.981 --> 02:20:43.814
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals out there that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeating all this nonsense and so when </v>

2797
02:20:47.661 --> 02:20:52.661
<v Speaker 1>they see this and what's should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like onion level satire,</v>

2798
02:20:53.211 --> 02:20:57.180
<v Speaker 1>obvious and they don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they rewarded and they,</v>

2799
02:20:57.181 --> 02:20:58.014
<v Speaker 1>they talk about it's one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers they've read this year because </v>

2800
02:21:00.930 --> 02:21:01.763
<v Speaker 1>these people are preposterous and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just one of those things where you </v>

2801
02:21:04.791 --> 02:21:07.970
<v Speaker 1>let people get away with things and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep pushing it,</v>

2802
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:09.950
<v Speaker 1>keep pushing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes further.</v>

2803
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:13.490
<v Speaker 1>They keep getting further with it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually they just get away.</v>

2804
02:21:13.770 --> 02:21:16.010
<v Speaker 1>They're too far gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't bring them back.</v>

2805
02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I actually told Pete and I hope I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think he'll mind that I'm sharing this,</v>

2806
02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:21.653
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was telling me about the </v>

2807
02:21:22.281 --> 02:21:23.114
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I try to temper </v>

2808
02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:29.980
<v Speaker 1>or his expectations of how much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatal blow the project would be,</v>

2809
02:21:31.491 --> 02:21:35.990
<v Speaker 1>he I had the feeling that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that if we are successful,</v>

2810
02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:40.670
<v Speaker 1>it's the end of the bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit edifices and I kept saying,</v>

2811
02:21:40.671 --> 02:21:41.504
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really important what </v>

2812
02:21:42.261 --> 02:21:43.094
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course I supported in any way </v>

2813
02:21:44.331 --> 02:21:45.920
<v Speaker 1>that I can help and advise you and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2814
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm there for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you should think that </v>

2815
02:21:49.851 --> 02:21:50.684
<v Speaker 1>it's going to end and I think I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>proven to be right because you're 100 </v>

2816
02:21:53.031 --> 02:21:53.864
<v Speaker 1>percent right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think postmodernism by its </v>

2817
02:21:55.641 --> 02:21:58.670
<v Speaker 1>very definition is almost like a snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can't be killed.</v>

2818
02:21:58.671 --> 02:22:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you to judge what is bullshit or</v>

2819
02:22:01.370 --> 02:22:03.740
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2820
02:22:03.741 --> 02:22:05.780
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of an impact do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it had?</v>

2821
02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it killed one percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit?</v>

2822
02:22:08.390 --> 02:22:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

2823
02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I can't put a number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I certainly five.</v>

2824
02:22:12.831 --> 02:22:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's be generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with five.</v>

2825
02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:16.820
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken to,</v>

2826
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:19.130
<v Speaker 1>you know Alan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the original Ho,</v>

2827
02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:21.800
<v Speaker 1>do you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of this type of hoaxing?</v>

2828
02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:22.693
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the original hoax was done by Allen </v>

2829
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Soko,</v>

2830
02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:31.280
<v Speaker 4>s o k a l who is a physicist who in 1996</v>
<v Speaker 4>submitted a paper.</v>

2831
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:33.810
<v Speaker 4>He's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a physicist,</v>

2832
02:22:33.811 --> 02:22:34.500
<v Speaker 4>so he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2833
02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:36.510
<v Speaker 4>hardcore scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was,</v>

2834
02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:37.373
<v Speaker 4>he was so pissed off and all these post </v>
<v Speaker 4>modernists that he submitted a paper on </v>

2835
02:22:41.791 --> 02:22:42.624
<v Speaker 4>the Hermeneutics of gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this kind of bs and they of course </v>

2836
02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:47.633
<v Speaker 4>lapped it up because here's a physicist </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's now joining the Pantheon of our </v>

2837
02:22:51.271 --> 02:22:53.430
<v Speaker 4>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>therefore let's accept it.</v>

2838
02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:54.990
<v Speaker 4>And then of course at that point he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2839
02:22:55.350 --> 02:22:56.183
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have something to admit to you guys </v>

2840
02:22:58.170 --> 02:22:59.003
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Him and I had communicated at one point </v>

2841
02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I had written an article about his hoax </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he corrected me.</v>

2842
02:23:04.361 --> 02:23:05.970
<v Speaker 4>It was very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very cute because I said,</v>

2843
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:06.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy created some pseudo random </v>

2844
02:23:08.821 --> 02:23:10.110
<v Speaker 4>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>

2845
02:23:10.111 --> 02:23:10.681
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2846
02:23:10.681 --> 02:23:11.514
<v Speaker 4>professor side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually spent quite a bit of effort </v>

2847
02:23:14.101 --> 02:23:16.950
<v Speaker 4>coming up with all these words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it wasn't random bs.</v>

2848
02:23:16.951 --> 02:23:17.784
<v Speaker 4>It was very well thought out vs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this is a guy that you might want to </v>

2849
02:23:21.931 --> 02:23:22.764
<v Speaker 4>have on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he doesn't any these </v>

2850
02:23:23.611 --> 02:23:24.510
<v Speaker 4>pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's the,</v>

2851
02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:28.920
<v Speaker 4>he's the godfather of hoaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This stuff.</v>

2852
02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:30.353
<v Speaker 3>It's just got to be so frustrating to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>in academia and to see all this around </v>

2853
02:23:34.261 --> 02:23:35.094
<v Speaker 3>you and see all these false thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these fake people putting this con game </v>

2854
02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:41.813
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of a real learning </v>
<v Speaker 3>institution and not only that but this </v>

2855
02:23:45.151 --> 02:23:45.984
<v Speaker 3>being celebrated by other true academics</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't want to get called </v>

2856
02:23:49.861 --> 02:23:53.670
<v Speaker 3>out as being racist or homophobic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>transphobic or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2857
02:23:53.671 --> 02:23:58.590
<v Speaker 3>These morons are celebrating this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a weird trickery to me.</v>

2858
02:23:58.591 --> 02:24:02.820
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like being a comedian and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being around joke thieves,</v>

2859
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:04.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like almost the same thing.</v>

2860
02:24:04.830 --> 02:24:08.190
<v Speaker 3>I know you're not the same thing as me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a faker.</v>

2861
02:24:08.370 --> 02:24:10.950
<v Speaker 3>You're faking this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in this artist's colony.</v>

2862
02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:11.873
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else is struggling to come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with material and you're just stealing </v>

2863
02:24:15.061 --> 02:24:15.894
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what is going on with these </v>

2864
02:24:17.581 --> 02:24:18.414
<v Speaker 3>gender studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like you're pretending you're an </v>

2865
02:24:19.841 --> 02:24:22.290
<v Speaker 3>intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is craziness.</v>

2866
02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:23.270
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2867
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:25.620
<v Speaker 3>you're ignoring the science.</v>

2868
02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:26.593
<v Speaker 4>So I have a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the original postmodernists were all </v>

2869
02:24:29.141 --> 02:24:31.360
<v Speaker 4>French postmodernist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know their name,</v>

2870
02:24:31.361 --> 02:24:35.680
<v Speaker 4>but for your viewers to Michelle Fuco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida,</v>

2871
02:24:35.770 --> 02:24:37.180
<v Speaker 4>the three grand bullshitters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2872
02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:39.550
<v Speaker 4>And so I have here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was this the seventies?</v>

2873
02:24:39.551 --> 02:24:40.384
<v Speaker 4>This is started about the sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies really went into full </v>

2874
02:24:43.181 --> 02:24:45.340
<v Speaker 4>throttle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2875
02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:48.280
<v Speaker 4>Now I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to link this back to mating.</v>

2876
02:24:48.281 --> 02:24:49.510
<v Speaker 4>Remember we said everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2877
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:50.703
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I genuinely think that in the deep </v>

2878
02:24:52.031 --> 02:24:52.864
<v Speaker 4>recesses of their minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these three fraudsters that not believe </v>

2879
02:24:56.321 --> 02:24:57.154
<v Speaker 4>a single thing and what they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they quickly learned that if they </v>

2880
02:24:59.741 --> 02:25:00.574
<v Speaker 4>stood in front of a crowd uttered some </v>
<v Speaker 4>full profundity jibberish and you had </v>

2881
02:25:04.121 --> 02:25:04.954
<v Speaker 4>all the hot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful young ladies sitting and </v>

2882
02:25:06.731 --> 02:25:07.564
<v Speaker 4>looking at you as if you a deep poet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they quickly learned that there's </v>

2883
02:25:12.250 --> 02:25:13.083
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary rewards that come with </v>
<v Speaker 4>their full profundity and so the train </v>

2884
02:25:16.661 --> 02:25:21.661
<v Speaker 4>was off and they weren't going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>off the station and then that's it.</v>

2885
02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:24.580
<v Speaker 4>The trajectory set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe</v>

2886
02:25:24.910 --> 02:25:29.730
<v Speaker 2>that if we could ever find some diary or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something of these rounds there,</v>

2887
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:33.610
<v Speaker 2>they probably have written my God that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of women.</v>

2888
02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:34.593
<v Speaker 2>I guess Michelle for core was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a lot of young men through my </v>

2889
02:25:38.201 --> 02:25:39.250
<v Speaker 2>trickery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

2890
02:25:39.310 --> 02:25:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I think they admitted it that openly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2891
02:25:41.850 --> 02:25:42.683
<v Speaker 2>I don't even in a diary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt they admitted it to themselves </v>

2892
02:25:45.491 --> 02:25:46.510
<v Speaker 2>that openly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so.</v>

2893
02:25:46.511 --> 02:25:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that in the deep recesses </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their mind when they went to bed,</v>

2894
02:25:50.050 --> 02:25:50.883
<v Speaker 2>do you think that they've convinced </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves that they are saying </v>

2895
02:25:52.031 --> 02:25:54.460
<v Speaker 2>something profound or they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they're locked into.</v>

2896
02:25:54.461 --> 02:25:55.294
<v Speaker 2>I think this is what I think when most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are engaging in that sort of </v>

2897
02:25:58.901 --> 02:25:59.734
<v Speaker 2>deceptive behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're locked into a pattern that they </v>

2898
02:26:01.721 --> 02:26:02.554
<v Speaker 2>know is effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That pattern has some sort of an effect </v>

2899
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:08.550
<v Speaker 2>of a beneficial effect on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's sexually,</v>

2900
02:26:08.770 --> 02:26:11.410
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in terms of the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics that they exist in.</v>

2901
02:26:11.770 --> 02:26:14.680
<v Speaker 2>There's this pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've found this pattern that they can</v>

2902
02:26:14.681 --> 02:26:16.300
<v Speaker 2>pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I believe,</v>

2903
02:26:16.390 --> 02:26:17.223
<v Speaker 2>so therefore they are being self </v>
<v Speaker 2>deceptive to the point where they </v>

2904
02:26:20.441 --> 02:26:21.274
<v Speaker 2>believe their bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe maybe not even being self </v>

2905
02:26:23.411 --> 02:26:25.720
<v Speaker 2>deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly not being self analytical.</v>

2906
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:26.290
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

2907
02:26:26.290 --> 02:26:28.480
<v Speaker 2>they've hit this hot spot where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2908
02:26:28.481 --> 02:26:33.481
<v Speaker 2>they lock in and then they just follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's effective and what's working.</v>

2909
02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:34.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps you.</v>

2910
02:26:34.881 --> 02:26:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do think though,</v>

2911
02:26:36.761 --> 02:26:39.160
<v Speaker 2>that eventually all of these guys will </v>
<v Speaker 2>die out.</v>

2912
02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:42.280
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think the BS,</v>

2913
02:26:42.281 --> 02:26:43.114
<v Speaker 2>we'll just find a new way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will metamorphosize into some new </v>

2914
02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:48.220
<v Speaker 2>instantiation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's always,</v>

2915
02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:51.610
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be a critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass of bs in the university.</v>

2916
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:52.743
<v Speaker 2>I think there's always going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people that want to believe in </v>

2917
02:26:55.211 --> 02:26:56.044
<v Speaker 2>things that are not true because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them seem better than what they </v>

2918
02:26:58.841 --> 02:26:59.674
<v Speaker 2>really are.</v>

2919
02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:00.693
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be a bunch of </v>

2920
02:27:01.451 --> 02:27:06.451
<v Speaker 2>people that want to avoid the reality of</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially lives unfair,</v>

2921
02:27:08.180 --> 02:27:11.240
<v Speaker 2>a ladder system of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just.</v>

2922
02:27:11.650 --> 02:27:13.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>

2923
02:27:13.121 --> 02:27:16.900
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is just like the natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the natural world.</v>

2924
02:27:16.901 --> 02:27:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Nature itself is unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just in general,</v>

2925
02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:22.750
<v Speaker 2>you know that the salmon never gets to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat the eagle.</v>

2926
02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:26.320
<v Speaker 2>It's just not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a lot of people that</v>

2927
02:27:26.321 --> 02:27:31.321
<v Speaker 2>find these inequalities and find this </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfairness very disconcerting.</v>

2928
02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:33.993
<v Speaker 2>It disturbs them to no end and they set </v>
<v Speaker 2>out on a quest to try to more the world </v>

2929
02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:43.630
<v Speaker 2>and to some weird utopian fantasy land </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everything has an equal outcome.</v>

2930
02:27:43.631 --> 02:27:46.360
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in people that are fucked,</v>

2931
02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:47.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get people that look like Lena </v>

2932
02:27:48.730 --> 02:27:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Dunham and they want to like sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like balance out the playing field.</v>

2933
02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:52.420
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair,</v>

2934
02:27:52.690 --> 02:27:55.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how come Scarlett Johansson is</v>

2935
02:27:55.301 --> 02:27:57.160
<v Speaker 2>a woman and how come Lena Dunham is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman?</v>

2936
02:27:57.161 --> 02:27:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not fair,</v>

2937
02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:00.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2938
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:01.663
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things that aren't </v>

2939
02:28:02.141 --> 02:28:03.280
<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things that aren't fair</v>

2940
02:28:03.430 --> 02:28:06.550
<v Speaker 2>intellectually the way people's minds </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

2941
02:28:06.551 --> 02:28:07.384
<v Speaker 2>They're not this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are Ilan mosque and </v>

2942
02:28:09.821 --> 02:28:11.780
<v Speaker 2>then there's a other folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2943
02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:15.610
<v Speaker 2>We just not that bright and this is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the world.</v>

2944
02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:19.090
<v Speaker 2>So do you think as as fighters for </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

2945
02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:20.373
<v Speaker 2>our objective is to simply make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the number of bullshitters stays </v>

2946
02:28:24.801 --> 02:28:25.634
<v Speaker 2>below certain thresholds since we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>eradicate them fully according to your </v>

2947
02:28:28.370 --> 02:28:29.203
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least what we could do is sort of </v>

2948
02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:34.400
<v Speaker 2>steady the tides so that they're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>below a certain number.</v>

2949
02:28:34.401 --> 02:28:35.234
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 percent of people are going to be </v>

2950
02:28:36.801 --> 02:28:37.634
<v Speaker 2>bullshitters in the university and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as they don't get past that </v>

2951
02:28:39.201 --> 02:28:40.400
<v Speaker 2>threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing a good job.</v>

2952
02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:41.473
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I'd like to be more optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to eradicate all of the </v>

2953
02:28:43.431 --> 02:28:45.680
<v Speaker 2>bullshitters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's possible,</v>

2954
02:28:45.681 --> 02:28:46.514
<v Speaker 2>but I think that bullshit as a whole is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very attractive to people and it's very </v>

2955
02:28:51.171 --> 02:28:56.060
<v Speaker 2>attractive to people to pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very attractive to people to engage</v>

2956
02:28:56.061 --> 02:28:59.190
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like reality and they want to</v>

2957
02:28:59.210 --> 02:29:00.043
<v Speaker 2>change things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of bullshit that does </v>

2958
02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:02.623
<v Speaker 2>exist in our culture and it has forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the Fucker chiropractor still </v>

2959
02:29:05.061 --> 02:29:07.530
<v Speaker 2>around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are psychic still around right?</v>

2960
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of nonsense out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2961
02:29:09.591 --> 02:29:11.710
<v Speaker 2>And then when you look into what those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2962
02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:14.600
<v Speaker 2>what real evidence there is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychics are real,</v>

2963
02:29:14.601 --> 02:29:15.700
<v Speaker 2>it's almost zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2964
02:29:15.701 --> 02:29:17.390
<v Speaker 2>and I could link it by the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketing.</v>

2965
02:29:17.391 --> 02:29:18.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2966
02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:20.150
<v Speaker 2>the dove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dove Company,</v>

2967
02:29:20.730 --> 02:29:21.563
<v Speaker 2>they're probably their most successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign of all time has been one where </v>

2968
02:29:24.081 --> 02:29:27.380
<v Speaker 2>they argued that beauty is a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct.</v>

2969
02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:31.340
<v Speaker 2>You're all beautiful in your own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that again is a beautiful message,</v>

2970
02:29:31.341 --> 02:29:32.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if am someone,</v>

2971
02:29:32.901 --> 02:29:36.980
<v Speaker 2>if I'm a woman who doesn't score well on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the typical evolutionary cues,</v>

2972
02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:38.113
<v Speaker 2>then what do I want to hear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear that there is no such </v>

2973
02:29:39.711 --> 02:29:42.380
<v Speaker 2>thing as evolutionary accused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all socially constructed,</v>

2974
02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:43.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I have sagging breast,</v>

2975
02:29:43.911 --> 02:29:47.780
<v Speaker 2>if I have poor skin and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have wrinkly skin,</v>

2976
02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:48.853
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to believe that there is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>such thing as an universal beauty </v>

2977
02:29:51.741 --> 02:29:52.574
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in that sense dove has been </v>

2978
02:29:54.831 --> 02:29:58.190
<v Speaker 2>incredibly successful because by </v>
<v Speaker 2>peddling false hope,</v>

2979
02:29:58.610 --> 02:30:02.510
<v Speaker 2>they've actually been able to tap into </v>
<v Speaker 2>women's insecurities and incense.</v>

2980
02:30:02.540 --> 02:30:03.430
<v Speaker 2>That's good marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2981
02:30:03.490 --> 02:30:04.323
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the cover of Cosmopolitan </v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine that was widely criticized </v>

2982
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:14.830
<v Speaker 2>because they had a morbidly obese woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>on who was a bikini plus size model?</v>

2983
02:30:15.801 --> 02:30:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2984
02:30:16.430 --> 02:30:17.263
<v Speaker 2>and they were challenging beauty norms </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is a person that's eating </v>

2985
02:30:20.931 --> 02:30:21.860
<v Speaker 2>themselves to death.</v>

2986
02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:22.693
<v Speaker 2>You've got fucking assholes and so your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of discipline and your desire to </v>

2987
02:30:28.671 --> 02:30:29.504
<v Speaker 2>shame people who exercise and is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing to make them feel bad </v>

2988
02:30:33.711 --> 02:30:34.544
<v Speaker 2>because you feel bad that you can't put </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking cook cookies and cupcakes </v>

2989
02:30:37.671 --> 02:30:38.504
<v Speaker 2>down as a lead you to try to push this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous standard and one of the </v>

2990
02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:44.834
<v Speaker 2>things my point of view was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you imagine if the cover of men's </v>

2991
02:30:47.541 --> 02:30:51.410
<v Speaker 2>health had an enormous fat guy with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>gut hangover,</v>

2992
02:30:51.530 --> 02:30:52.363
<v Speaker 2>his belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and people were saying the new </v>

2993
02:30:53.781 --> 02:30:54.614
<v Speaker 2>standards of attractiveness for men have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been changed by Mike who just drinks </v>

2994
02:30:58.611 --> 02:31:00.500
<v Speaker 2>beer and eats cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

2995
02:31:00.501 --> 02:31:02.570
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's never going to fly.</v>

2996
02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:03.433
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to fly with men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does fly with women and by the </v>

2997
02:31:05.451 --> 02:31:08.480
<v Speaker 2>way they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Fat Acceptance Movement doesn't just</v>

2998
02:31:08.481 --> 02:31:09.314
<v Speaker 2>argue that you know not being 500 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>is unattractive because of the </v>

2999
02:31:13.521 --> 02:31:14.354
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually argue that the medical </v>

3000
02:31:16.251 --> 02:31:20.640
<v Speaker 2>evidence suggesting that there is a link</v>
<v Speaker 2>between obesity and downstream</v>

3001
02:31:20.730 --> 02:31:22.590
<v Speaker 4>bad effects is all bullshit.</v>

3002
02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:24.590
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just that they.</v>

3003
02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:25.713
<v Speaker 3>They also point to one incredibly flawed</v>
<v Speaker 3>study that has been wildly disproven </v>

3004
02:31:30.690 --> 02:31:31.523
<v Speaker 3>that says that there's some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>vigor or vitality involved in being </v>

3005
02:31:34.231 --> 02:31:37.560
<v Speaker 3>overweight because they they get sick </v>
<v Speaker 3>less.</v>

3006
02:31:37.980 --> 02:31:40.170
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no truth to that whatsoever.</v>

3007
02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:41.033
<v Speaker 3>They only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they only analyze people who were </v>

3008
02:31:42.601 --> 02:31:45.030
<v Speaker 3>healthy at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's there's.</v>

3009
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:49.740
<v Speaker 3>You can go and Google the study and find</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the criticism of that study,</v>

3010
02:31:49.741 --> 02:31:52.920
<v Speaker 3>but it's 100 percent horseshit folks </v>
<v Speaker 3>being fat's not good for you.</v>

3011
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:53.783
<v Speaker 3>It's really bad for you when you're as </v>
<v Speaker 3>big as that woman on the cover of </v>

3012
02:31:55.621 --> 02:31:59.280
<v Speaker 3>Cosmopolitan magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's literally morbidly obese.</v>

3013
02:31:59.370 --> 02:32:03.330
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's addicted to food in a horrible way</v>

3014
02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:04.373
<v Speaker 3>and to promote that and pretend that </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another this is okay and </v>

3015
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:08.743
<v Speaker 3>we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to show new standards of </v>

3016
02:32:10.471 --> 02:32:11.520
<v Speaker 3>beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

3017
02:32:11.521 --> 02:32:15.600
<v Speaker 3>you giant gelatinous bag of meat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tissue.</v>

3018
02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:16.793
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a dying person who's addicted to </v>

3019
02:32:18.031 --> 02:32:19.560
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't want to look like that.</v>

3020
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:22.580
<v Speaker 4>I feel as though given that on one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these shows,</v>

3021
02:32:22.581 --> 02:32:24.650
<v Speaker 4>you spend about 45 minutes fat shaming </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

3022
02:32:25.490 --> 02:32:26.323
<v Speaker 4>that they talked to you about your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There hasn't been a recognition of your </v>

3023
02:32:29.541 --> 02:32:31.700
<v Speaker 4>slimness much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much slimmer.</v>

3024
02:32:31.701 --> 02:32:32.370
<v Speaker 4>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slender,</v>

3025
02:32:32.370 --> 02:32:34.580
<v Speaker 4>felt a bit of drool coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I first came in,</v>

3026
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:37.040
<v Speaker 4>there was a bit of drool on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your thing when you saw me.</v>

3027
02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:38.800
<v Speaker 4>You ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No drawer.</v>

3028
02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:40.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

3029
02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:41.810
<v Speaker 4>There's no drill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much weight have you lost?</v>

3030
02:32:42.470 --> 02:32:44.000
<v Speaker 4>About 30.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nice.</v>

3031
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:45.063
<v Speaker 4>That's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have to register as a dangerous </v>

3032
02:32:46.851 --> 02:32:47.601
<v Speaker 4>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3033
02:32:47.601 --> 02:32:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Thirty more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3034
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:50.720
<v Speaker 4>You're on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing different?</v>

3035
02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:55.820
<v Speaker 4>Great question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At being accountable to the scale.</v>

3036
02:32:56.270 --> 02:33:00.020
<v Speaker 4>Being accountable to how many things go </v>
<v Speaker 4>in my mouth.</v>

3037
02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:05.240
<v Speaker 4>So meaning every Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what I get on the scale,</v>

3038
02:33:06.350 --> 02:33:07.130
<v Speaker 4>you see what I'm saying?</v>

3039
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:12.130
<v Speaker 4>So I've put on three pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>therefore I intercept that trajectory at</v>

3040
02:33:12.141 --> 02:33:12.974
<v Speaker 4>three pounds rather than in four years </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I get on the scale and I'm all 32 </v>

3041
02:33:16.551 --> 02:33:19.820
<v Speaker 4>pounds overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So number one being a,</v>

3042
02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:22.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>privy to that information.</v>

3043
02:33:22.611 --> 02:33:24.140
<v Speaker 4>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife,</v>

3044
02:33:24.141 --> 02:33:24.974
<v Speaker 4>whom you've met many times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enters all my stuff and my fitness </v>

3045
02:33:28.011 --> 02:33:29.990
<v Speaker 4>pal.com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at the end of the day,</v>

3046
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:34.430
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she tells me you've eaten 1,792</v>

3047
02:33:34.431 --> 02:33:37.340
<v Speaker 4>calories and you've exercised 400 </v>
<v Speaker 4>calories.</v>

3048
02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:38.960
<v Speaker 4>You had 1300 calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

3049
02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Now you might say that's not sustainable</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be so sort of Nazi,</v>

3050
02:33:43.401 --> 02:33:45.320
<v Speaker 4>like in terms of your accountability for</v>
<v Speaker 4>your whole life.</v>

3051
02:33:45.321 --> 02:33:50.321
<v Speaker 4>But for me that really works because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>very objective oriented.</v>

3052
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:51.583
<v Speaker 4>If I let it slide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I can wake up one day and I'm 30 </v>

3053
02:33:54.441 --> 02:33:54.960
<v Speaker 4>pounds overweight.</v>

3054
02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've seen you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that I think about.</v>

3055
02:33:57.150 --> 02:33:57.983
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to show you anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>about your back and you couldn't get on </v>

3056
02:34:00.541 --> 02:34:02.430
<v Speaker 3>my machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

3057
02:34:02.431 --> 02:34:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we even talked about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

3058
02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:06.240
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were spending about 40 minutes,</v>

3059
02:34:06.450 --> 02:34:07.283
<v Speaker 4>40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

3060
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:09.480
<v Speaker 4>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

3061
02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:11.250
<v Speaker 4>I know that you don't read your </v>
<v Speaker 4>comments.</v>

3062
02:34:11.251 --> 02:34:12.084
<v Speaker 4>I had gone to check some of the comments</v>
<v Speaker 4>that some people were quite upset at </v>

3063
02:34:14.281 --> 02:34:15.114
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fat People for no for you that I'll </v>

3064
02:34:17.651 --> 02:34:18.400
<v Speaker 4>maybe</v>

3065
02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:20.230
<v Speaker 3>get off your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fat fucks.</v>

3066
02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Lazy Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was coming from.</v>

3067
02:34:23.250 --> 02:34:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Was coming from concern and love Cyprus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't take it badly.</v>

3068
02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Have you looked at what Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 3>is doing?</v>

3069
02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:30.400
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the meat stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3070
02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The carnivore diet,</v>

3071
02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:35.140
<v Speaker 3>so very fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's lost 50 pounds.</v>

3072
02:34:35.530 --> 02:34:38.290
<v Speaker 3>He looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he's at his intellectual peak.</v>

3073
02:34:38.291 --> 02:34:41.470
<v Speaker 3>He sees overrunning with energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take any supplements,</v>

3074
02:34:41.471 --> 02:34:43.420
<v Speaker 3>doesn't take anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just eats meat.</v>

3075
02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's astounding.</v>

3076
02:34:45.230 --> 02:34:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Do there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

3077
02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Is that sorta the Quito thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3078
02:34:48.540 --> 02:34:49.840
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

3079
02:34:49.841 --> 02:34:50.674
<v Speaker 3>It's different because of glucogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have a Quito is more fat than </v>

3080
02:34:55.031 --> 02:34:57.250
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more fat even than proteins.</v>

3081
02:34:57.430 --> 02:35:01.990
<v Speaker 3>He's eating mostly protein and fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but much more protein that you would get</v>

3082
02:35:01.991 --> 02:35:03.310
<v Speaker 3>an acute agentic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>

3083
02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:05.530
<v Speaker 3>so he's not necessarily in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketosis.</v>

3084
02:35:05.531 --> 02:35:06.364
<v Speaker 3>I mean we probably have some of the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>when your body has a large quantity of </v>

3085
02:35:09.551 --> 02:35:10.384
<v Speaker 3>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body converts that protein into </v>

3086
02:35:12.041 --> 02:35:13.960
<v Speaker 3>glucose into glucogenesis.</v>

3087
02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:14.793
<v Speaker 3>It's a very interesting process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of the reasons why if you </v>

3088
02:35:18.281 --> 02:35:19.114
<v Speaker 3>eat too much protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it knocks you out of ketosis because </v>

3089
02:35:20.741 --> 02:35:22.600
<v Speaker 3>your body changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns it into glucose.</v>

3090
02:35:23.230 --> 02:35:25.930
<v Speaker 3>What he's doing is essentially an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elimination diet.</v>

3091
02:35:25.931 --> 02:35:26.764
<v Speaker 3>He's only eating meat and when I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to like actual real nutrition </v>

3092
02:35:31.450 --> 02:35:33.850
<v Speaker 3>experts who really understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

3093
02:35:34.060 --> 02:35:36.040
<v Speaker 3>they do not recommend what he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

3094
02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:36.933
<v Speaker 3>but I think maybe that's because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>hasn't been done and studied on a wide </v>

3095
02:35:41.111 --> 02:35:41.944
<v Speaker 3>scale before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There have been a few anecdotal reports </v>

3096
02:35:44.681 --> 02:35:49.300
<v Speaker 3>about people have eating just meat for </v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years and they're real healthy.</v>

3097
02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:53.590
<v Speaker 3>It seems to really be effective with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have autoimmune issues.</v>

3098
02:35:53.860 --> 02:35:54.693
<v Speaker 3>People that have psoriasis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have various autoimmune </v>

3099
02:35:56.921 --> 02:35:57.754
<v Speaker 3>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems that cutting out all </v>

3100
02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 3>inflammation causing foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning dairy,</v>

3101
02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:06.760
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the pasta and bread,</v>

3102
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:11.290
<v Speaker 3>all those things seem to have a profound</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on certain people.</v>

3103
02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:13.060
<v Speaker 3>His daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them,</v>

3104
02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:15.880
<v Speaker 3>he's one of them and I know some other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people as well.</v>

3105
02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:16.833
<v Speaker 3>I know some really smart people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have gotten into that and they've </v>

3106
02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:23.080
<v Speaker 3>experienced profound changes in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>body composition.</v>

3107
02:36:23.081 --> 02:36:24.700
<v Speaker 3>They have lost a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

3108
02:36:25.390 --> 02:36:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Even people that are eating a large </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of meat.</v>

3109
02:36:28.450 --> 02:36:30.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that's attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3110
02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:32.110
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think fiber's important.</v>

3111
02:36:32.111 --> 02:36:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Phytonutrients that report and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of stuff you get from vegetables and</v>

3112
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:36.343
<v Speaker 3>also I don't have a negative reaction to</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables doesn't seem to be affecting </v>

3113
02:36:40.121 --> 02:36:40.954
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people I think it's entirely </v>

3114
02:36:42.731 --> 02:36:43.564
<v Speaker 3>possible do right and I think if you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>have some really profound autoimmune </v>

3115
02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:49.893
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly it seems to be effective </v>

3116
02:36:50.801 --> 02:36:54.250
<v Speaker 3>with certain types of arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the worst thing to give a shot.</v>

3117
02:36:54.430 --> 02:36:58.420
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely recommend that if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>did do something like that,</v>

3118
02:36:58.570 --> 02:37:02.050
<v Speaker 3>that you would supplement and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think Jordan's doing that at all.</v>

3119
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:02.943
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any harm </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever in supplementing with </v>

3120
02:37:05.171 --> 02:37:07.690
<v Speaker 3>multivitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting your essential new nutrients,</v>

3121
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:12.850
<v Speaker 3>essential fatty acids from fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vitamin B Complex d complex,</v>

3122
02:37:12.851 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 3>make sure you've got all your bases </v>
<v Speaker 3>covered nutritionally and then if your</v>

3123
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.370
<v Speaker 2>body just responds really well to only </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating meat,</v>

3124
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks fantastic.</v>

3125
02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:23.713
<v Speaker 2>Every time I talk to me it looks better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be curious to know though what </v>

3126
02:37:26.151 --> 02:37:28.460
<v Speaker 2>some of his metrics are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The LDL hdl.</v>

3127
02:37:29.330 --> 02:37:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about that,</v>

3128
02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:36.520
<v Speaker 2>you know that is very poorly understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>and almost always misinterpreted the ldl</v>

3129
02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:37.933
<v Speaker 2>hdl correspondence and what it means in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like whether or not you're </v>

3130
02:37:40.941 --> 02:37:44.870
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arterial plaque is important,</v>

3131
02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:45.733
<v Speaker 2>and then there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of markers that can </v>

3132
02:37:47.931 --> 02:37:50.510
<v Speaker 2>show inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation in your body,</v>

3133
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:52.123
<v Speaker 2>what your blood pressure is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how some people react much differently </v>

3134
02:37:56.391 --> 02:37:58.190
<v Speaker 2>to the various foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3135
02:37:58.191 --> 02:38:01.960
<v Speaker 2>We obviously know that some people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>to certain nuts this.</v>

3136
02:38:01.970 --> 02:38:02.803
<v Speaker 2>There's the people very biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much that one of the things that </v>

3137
02:38:07.111 --> 02:38:11.270
<v Speaker 2>needs to do nutrition experts are saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you just have your body consumed</v>

3138
02:38:11.271 --> 02:38:13.430
<v Speaker 2>just one thing and this elimination </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

3139
02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:14.653
<v Speaker 2>it eliminates so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>processes that your body has to engage </v>

3140
02:38:18.261 --> 02:38:19.094
<v Speaker 2>in in order to break down all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things and then it eliminates </v>

3141
02:38:23.091 --> 02:38:26.270
<v Speaker 2>all the different reactions that you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>from all these various foods.</v>

3142
02:38:26.450 --> 02:38:27.283
<v Speaker 2>Your body's only concentrating on one </v>
<v Speaker 2>food all the time and it seems to </v>

3143
02:38:31.461 --> 02:38:32.294
<v Speaker 2>alleviate a lot of these conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also the fact that when you're </v>

3144
02:38:35.961 --> 02:38:39.650
<v Speaker 2>eating just meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be as hungry.</v>

3145
02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:43.520
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to overeat as much.</v>

3146
02:38:43.521 --> 02:38:48.260
<v Speaker 2>It's it's much less likely that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>overeat with protein than it is that you</v>

3147
02:38:48.261 --> 02:38:49.094
<v Speaker 2>overeat with pasta breads and sugars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines in terms of </v>

3148
02:38:52.101 --> 02:38:53.300
<v Speaker 2>caloric intake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just you,</v>

3149
02:38:53.301 --> 02:38:54.134
<v Speaker 2>you hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you reach your satiety point very </v>

3150
02:38:55.581 --> 02:38:56.480
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3151
02:38:56.540 --> 02:38:57.373
<v Speaker 2>and that is probably a factor as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Jordan has lost a tremendous </v>

3152
02:39:00.981 --> 02:39:03.830
<v Speaker 2>amount of weight and I think in losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that weight,</v>

3153
02:39:03.831 --> 02:39:08.750
<v Speaker 2>his body is less inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has less fat that's in inhibiting his</v>

3154
02:39:08.751 --> 02:39:11.760
<v Speaker 2>motion and you know his arteries and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>body is.</v>

3155
02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:15.320
<v Speaker 2>His limbs aren't as fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's faces on fat.</v>

3156
02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:17.900
<v Speaker 2>He's not snoring anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which indicates that he was.</v>

3157
02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:18.913
<v Speaker 2>He probably had some fat in his face and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of blocking and and </v>

3158
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:25.160
<v Speaker 2>constricting his breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all really interesting.</v>

3159
02:39:25.310 --> 02:39:28.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a gentleman I not sure if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get his name right.</v>

3160
02:39:28.281 --> 02:39:32.720
<v Speaker 2>He's a nutritional psychiatrist at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia University.</v>

3161
02:39:32.721 --> 02:39:33.554
<v Speaker 2>I just discovered it recently while </v>
<v Speaker 2>working out on the elliptical through </v>

3162
02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:37.633
<v Speaker 2>the a big thing series and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of short clips where he talks </v>

3163
02:39:42.681 --> 02:39:47.030
<v Speaker 2>about how he incorporates nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 2>within his psychiatric practice.</v>

3164
02:39:47.031 --> 02:39:47.864
<v Speaker 2>I think his name is drew Ramsay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems like a guy that would be </v>

3165
02:39:50.541 --> 02:39:51.374
<v Speaker 2>unplugging so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably a few too many buddies </v>

3166
02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:54.793
<v Speaker 2>seemed like a a booking agent right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he seems like a really </v>

3167
02:39:59.751 --> 02:40:02.550
<v Speaker 2>interesting guy because he shows you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a psychiatrist who,</v>

3168
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:03.403
<v Speaker 2>who thinks ultimately that a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>mood related issues relate to what we </v>

3169
02:40:08.331 --> 02:40:09.080
<v Speaker 2>put in our bodies.</v>

3170
02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:09.913
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no question that inflammation </v>

3171
02:40:10.911 --> 02:40:15.911
<v Speaker 2>has a direct result or a direct action </v>
<v Speaker 2>on how you think and feel.</v>

3172
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Inflammation makes people irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes people with magic does a lot of</v>

3173
02:40:20.671 --> 02:40:24.060
<v Speaker 2>terrible things to just your body in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

3174
02:40:24.061 --> 02:40:25.920
<v Speaker 2>which affects your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a part of your body.</v>

3175
02:40:26.430 --> 02:40:27.263
<v Speaker 2>You know the idea that somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another non interchangeable is pretty </v>

3176
02:40:29.221 --> 02:40:30.054
<v Speaker 2>preposterous and people that don't take </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of their body but want their brain </v>

3177
02:40:32.701 --> 02:40:34.420
<v Speaker 2>to be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is like,</v>

3178
02:40:34.470 --> 02:40:35.760
<v Speaker 2>you want your cake and you want to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3179
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you don't.</v>

3180
02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:40.440
<v Speaker 2>You don't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not looking at it holistically.</v>

3181
02:40:40.450 --> 02:40:44.430
<v Speaker 2>So someone who is as passionate as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are about these issues.</v>

3182
02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:45.593
<v Speaker 2>If someone in your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be your wife or your </v>

3183
02:40:47.881 --> 02:40:49.890
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing the right choices,</v>

3184
02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:53.430
<v Speaker 2>does that cause you to be that much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>irate because they're sort of within the</v>

3185
02:40:53.431 --> 02:40:57.000
<v Speaker 2>purview of your influence or how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>steer rebelling?</v>

3186
02:40:57.240 --> 02:40:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I would think that maybe I'm being an </v>
<v Speaker 2>overbearing asshole.</v>

3187
02:40:59.611 --> 02:41:00.444
<v Speaker 2>I would look at it internally first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I would look at them and try to </v>

3188
02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:06.420
<v Speaker 2>figure out like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

3189
02:41:06.421 --> 02:41:07.650
<v Speaker 2>what is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong here?</v>

3190
02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Is this simply a dietary thing or is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychological thing?</v>

3191
02:41:11.130 --> 02:41:11.963
<v Speaker 2>It will become a big project for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when there's a loved one that's </v>

3192
02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:16.680
<v Speaker 2>essentially eating themselves into poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

3193
02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:19.800
<v Speaker 2>which is really common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more common than.</v>

3194
02:41:19.801 --> 02:41:20.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3195
02:41:21.450 --> 02:41:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I think the most recent estimate google </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3196
02:41:24.451 --> 02:41:26.070
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young Jamie,</v>

3197
02:41:26.130 --> 02:41:26.963
<v Speaker 2>I think the most recent estimate is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States is above 50 percent </v>

3198
02:41:30.541 --> 02:41:32.340
<v Speaker 2>obesity rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

3199
02:41:32.370 --> 02:41:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Which is stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

3200
02:41:34.021 --> 02:41:36.900
<v Speaker 2>when I was at the Canadian Senate </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearings,</v>

3201
02:41:37.290 --> 02:41:40.800
<v Speaker 2>actually argued that if we wished to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of bigotry,</v>

3202
02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:42.053
<v Speaker 2>then when we'd get a lot more bank for </v>
<v Speaker 2>our buck if we went after fat bigotry </v>

3203
02:41:47.610 --> 02:41:48.443
<v Speaker 2>rather than transgender bigotry because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are so few people who are </v>

3204
02:41:51.511 --> 02:41:55.830
<v Speaker 2>transgendered and even though we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>condemn any bigotry they face,</v>

3205
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:59.220
<v Speaker 2>they make up a very small portion that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was being facetious,</v>

3206
02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:01.410
<v Speaker 2>but I was basically arguing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3207
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:06.480
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to have these bills </v>
<v Speaker 2>that try to stamp out bigotry,</v>

3208
02:42:06.481 --> 02:42:07.314
<v Speaker 2>you should be going after fatphobia </v>
<v Speaker 2>because most Canadians are also obese </v>

3209
02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:11.220
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3210
02:42:11.220 --> 02:42:13.500
<v Speaker 2>They didn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said it's a sizable problem.</v>

3211
02:42:13.501 --> 02:42:18.501
<v Speaker 2>Many obesity United States here goes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 course behavioral risk factors.</v>

3212
02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Adult obesity raised now exceed 35 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent in seven states.</v>

3213
02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about children as well?</v>

3214
02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:27.233
<v Speaker 2>I think they're talking about overall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think overall I think children are </v>

3215
02:42:30.931 --> 02:42:33.210
<v Speaker 2>more fat now than they've ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

3216
02:42:33.270 --> 02:42:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a moment.</v>

3217
02:42:34.351 --> 02:42:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned earlier that I had read all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kids get the actual numbers again.</v>

3218
02:42:39.090 --> 02:42:42.960
<v Speaker 2>So the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult obesity exceeds 35 percent,</v>

3219
02:42:42.961 --> 02:42:44.160
<v Speaker 2>30 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>29 states,</v>

3220
02:42:44.161 --> 02:42:44.994
<v Speaker 2>25 percent in 48 states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>West Virginia has the highest adult </v>

3221
02:42:47.161 --> 02:42:49.290
<v Speaker 2>obesity rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>38 percent,</v>

3222
02:42:49.650 --> 02:42:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Colorado lowest at 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shout out to Colorado adult obesity rate</v>

3223
02:42:54.330 --> 02:42:56.220
<v Speaker 2>increased in Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>

3224
02:42:56.221 --> 02:42:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Oklahoma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island,</v>

3225
02:42:57.421 --> 02:42:59.310
<v Speaker 2>South Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it by,</v>

3226
02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:02.820
<v Speaker 2>for not just adult obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but overall obesity.</v>

3227
02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:04.153
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

3228
02:43:07.430 --> 02:43:10.940
<v Speaker 2>What is the obesity rate in America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 60 million people.</v>

3229
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:12.910
<v Speaker 2>It is 160 million</v>

3230
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:15.610
<v Speaker 3>people in America are either obese or </v>
<v Speaker 3>overweight.</v>

3231
02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Nearly three quarters of American men </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more than 60 percent of women,</v>

3232
02:43:19.810 --> 02:43:23.410
<v Speaker 3>more than 60 percent of women are </v>
<v Speaker 3>overweight.</v>

3233
02:43:23.411 --> 02:43:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Thirty percent of boys</v>

3234
02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:30.010
<v Speaker 4>and girls under the age of 20 are obese </v>
<v Speaker 4>or overweight.</v>

3235
02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:30.933
<v Speaker 4>So remember I was mentioning earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was mentioning the a health summit </v>

3236
02:43:34.091 --> 02:43:37.390
<v Speaker 4>that I held at my university at one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys.</v>

3237
02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:41.620
<v Speaker 4>His name is Robert Lustig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a pediatric endocrinologist.</v>

3238
02:43:41.890 --> 02:43:42.723
<v Speaker 4>He was red.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was saying that many instances of </v>

3239
02:43:45.821 --> 02:43:46.654
<v Speaker 4>diabetes and other really high blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure that you would never ever see </v>

3240
02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:53.530
<v Speaker 4>in young children is now very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very common.</v>

3241
02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:55.420
<v Speaker 4>So 25,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 years ago,</v>

3242
02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:56.433
<v Speaker 4>he would never have a single patient who</v>
<v Speaker 4>is under a certain age and now it's </v>

3243
02:43:59.860 --> 02:44:00.910
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

3244
02:44:00.911 --> 02:44:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>

3245
02:44:01.490 --> 02:44:04.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a stunning statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's disgusting.</v>

3246
02:44:04.401 --> 02:44:06.110
<v Speaker 3>It's sad to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

3247
02:44:06.170 --> 02:44:07.003
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3248
02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:08.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are prisoner of their diet and </v>

3249
02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:12.710
<v Speaker 3>that's most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3250
02:44:12.711 --> 02:44:16.880
<v Speaker 3>exercise plays a factor for sure it </v>
<v Speaker 3>speeds up your metabolism,</v>

3251
02:44:16.881 --> 02:44:17.714
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop eating shit and you got to stop </v>

3252
02:44:19.731 --> 02:44:22.400
<v Speaker 3>eating so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's so satisfying to people,</v>

3253
02:44:22.610 --> 02:44:23.443
<v Speaker 3>especially people that feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just feel unsatisfied and </v>

3254
02:44:27.861 --> 02:44:28.694
<v Speaker 3>unfulfilled and unhappy and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicating themselves with food because </v>

3255
02:44:32.421 --> 02:44:33.254
<v Speaker 3>they get this little charge every time </v>
<v Speaker 3>they stuffed a cake down their mouth or </v>

3256
02:44:36.111 --> 02:44:40.490
<v Speaker 3>they eat a sandwich or they eat a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>bowl of unhealthy stuff.</v>

3257
02:44:40.610 --> 02:44:41.443
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you're going to break out </v>
<v Speaker 4>into being Kevin Spacey in the movie </v>

3258
02:44:43.881 --> 02:44:44.714
<v Speaker 4>seven where he goes out killing people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who wrote the law governing the way </v>

3259
02:44:50.571 --> 02:44:54.980
<v Speaker 4>you're speaking with such a disdain </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's not.</v>

3260
02:44:55.010 --> 02:44:56.300
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessary,</v>

3261
02:44:56.370 --> 02:44:57.203
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a disease that you're giving </v>

3262
02:44:58.141 --> 02:45:01.160
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's sad is like,</v>

3263
02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:05.580
<v Speaker 3>and I understand if you don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>education on this and some people don't,</v>

3264
02:45:05.730 --> 02:45:07.950
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the case with most </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3265
02:45:07.951 --> 02:45:10.290
<v Speaker 3>Most people understand that what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating is bad for them.</v>

3266
02:45:10.530 --> 02:45:11.363
<v Speaker 3>They do it anyway.</v>

3267
02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:14.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which shows you that it's not only about</v>

3268
02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:15.953
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't do bad things simply because </v>

3269
02:45:17.221 --> 02:45:18.420
<v Speaker 4>you didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3270
02:45:18.510 --> 02:45:19.321
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

3271
02:45:19.321 --> 02:45:19.891
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3272
02:45:19.891 --> 02:45:21.840
<v Speaker 4>psychology is very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human.</v>

3273
02:45:21.841 --> 02:45:22.674
<v Speaker 4>Psychology is so unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated and that's why I love my </v>

3274
02:45:26.821 --> 02:45:28.200
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I love my profession.</v>

3275
02:45:28.201 --> 02:45:30.690
<v Speaker 4>Every day I wake up and I'm in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>playground,</v>

3276
02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:33.900
<v Speaker 4>what's the next problem that I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to tackle and have fun studying?</v>

3277
02:45:34.410 --> 02:45:36.360
<v Speaker 4>That's why I love my life and I hope </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

3278
02:45:36.510 --> 02:45:38.370
<v Speaker 4>I often get people who write to me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

3279
02:45:38.610 --> 02:45:40.410
<v Speaker 4>what's the secret?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are you always smiling?</v>

3280
02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:41.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm always smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3281
02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:42.390
<v Speaker 4>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm healthy.</v>

3282
02:45:42.391 --> 02:45:43.224
<v Speaker 4>I have a great family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wake up every day excited about </v>

3283
02:45:45.301 --> 02:45:46.200
<v Speaker 4>the prospects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they.</v>

3284
02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:48.660
<v Speaker 4>If you could find that half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the battle's won.</v>

3285
02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:49.390
