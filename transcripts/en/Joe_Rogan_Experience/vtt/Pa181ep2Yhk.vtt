00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.870
<v Speaker 1>the reason why that upsets me is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grants people a false sense of</v>

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>security and hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know Islam is wonderful,</v>

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>but we need to attack this separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing called Islam Islam.</v>

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Well from day one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1400 years ago,</v>

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Islam was Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual element.</v>

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that most Muslims just</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to practice the spiritual part,</v>

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>but there is no set of doctrines and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate book called radicalized Islam,</v>

11
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all comes from the same texts.</v>

12
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>It comes from the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes from the Heidi's,</v>

13
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and it comes from the Sierra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biography of Mohammed,</v>

14
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this kind of false narrative that</v>

15
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>people are prominently gating so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem as though they're not</v>

16
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>frontally attacking a religion while</v>
<v Speaker 1>laudable.</v>

17
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>While Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that reflex,</v>

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>it's false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

19
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>to go back to our point of talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

20
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>we need to talk.</v>

21
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only Islam.</v>

22
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Some people choose to practice it fully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people choose to ignore the ugly</v>

23
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is no such thing as Islamism.</v>

24
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam is part of Islam.</v>

25
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Now you're a person that goes out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your way to say,</v>

26
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about the kind sweet</v>

27
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Islamic people that just want to raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>their children now.</v>

28
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.781
<v Speaker 1>So how do you sort of manage those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that they're the same?</v>

29
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Like when the term radical Islam gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown around,</v>

30
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So radical Islam simply means I really</v>

31
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>take my Islam seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.913
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

33
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's draw us a silly analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't eat pork,</v>

34
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my radical Jew,</v>

35
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>or am I a Jew right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happen to be Jewish.</v>

36
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I simply ignore the kosher edict that</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

37
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>don't eat pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why do you do that though?</v>

38
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Because in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I simply identify as Jewish in the sense</v>

39
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>that at Judaism is a multi attribute</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

40
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>It includes a shared history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shared lineage,</v>

41
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 1>sh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sh kind of erase.</v>

42
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It's what some could argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's array,</v>

43
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>so it's considered in a lot of people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

44
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>So I could still in the same way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might identify as coming from Boston</v>

45
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>and there's a shared history from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who grew up around the time that</v>

46
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>you grew up in Boston and there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of affiliation and tribalism,</v>

47
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>would that reality being Jewish as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned and for most Jews is</v>

48
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't necessarily take the religious</v>

49
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>elements very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

50
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:34.641
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that we are practicing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a light Judaism or non radical Judaism.</v>

51
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>We're simply ignoring those parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judaism that we choose to ignore.</v>

52
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>So there is no such thing as radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

53
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:46.701
<v Speaker 1>There are no books called radical Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a set of doctrines called Islam</v>

54
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>and then I could do what's called</v>
<v Speaker 1>cafeteria Islam,</v>

55
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>which is I pick and choose the parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wish to adhere to.</v>

56
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discourse is a false narrative.</v>

57
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I understand the reason for it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people find it rather Gauche to attack</v>

58
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>frontally it religion at least to attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

59
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.720
<v Speaker 1>So they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call this the,</v>

60
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ISM magic eucharistic rite.</v>

61
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>You add ism to something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it bad.</v>

62
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Islam as good Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam is bad.</v>

63
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

64
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a characteristic that I see in</v>

65
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody that I respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all think that everything they do</v>

66
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>socks or at least they have very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high standards and an often</v>

67
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>disappointed by their own work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have some of that,</v>

69
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but I also have that idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I've,</v>

70
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I talked about my dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

71
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was my wrestling coach in high</v>

72
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.294
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

73
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.000
<v Speaker 1>he was also my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>earth science biology and environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies teacher.</v>

75
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>She was my teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>what a drag you went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad being the fucking.</v>

77
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot because he was no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't pull any punches from me.</v>

78
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.470
<v Speaker 1>he drove me as hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not harder than his other students.</v>

80
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>He didn't show any favoritism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that was always</v>

81
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>his thing on the mat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm kind of paraphrasing,</v>

82
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>but basically you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you either win or you learn,</v>

83
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>especially in that high school college</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting,</v>

84
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.293
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

85
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>you're learning about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

86
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>if you went out there and you got your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass handed to you and you just got beat</v>

87
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>and didn't learn anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

88
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the moment,</v>

89
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>reflect on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build on what you did wrong and you now</v>

90
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:29.910
<v Speaker 1>you're actually gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wave one.</v>

91
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Now you know more about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about where your your</v>

92
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>limitations are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you need to improve and expand your</v>

93
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>talents are your limitations.</v>

94
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.380
<v Speaker 1>So I guess whenever I'm doing a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking at it from a learning</v>

95
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>perspective so there aren't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes unless they're fatal and then</v>

96
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever that really is the right way</v>

97
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>to look at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You win or you learn.</v>

98
00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>You know you have great experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were successful or you have</v>

99
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>very beneficial experiences because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized what went wrong.</v>

100
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>What is just one more wrinkle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more piece of information or one</v>

101
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>more experience that you can add to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>database of knowledge and it'll make you</v>

102
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>better at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

103
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my biggest frustration in life is</v>

104
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:22.321
<v Speaker 1>when there is something that Kinda goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and I can't figure out what it was</v>

105
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that's frustrating for me because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

106
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't build on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't learn from it,</v>

107
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:31.321
<v Speaker 1>but I don't understand what went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whether it's a relationship or</v>

108
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>whether it's something I tried to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something I did or how often does</v>

109
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:38.480
<v Speaker 1>that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot,</v>

110
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of times I've actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>had an opportunity to do,</v>

112
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>have a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocal with somebody else as a guest</v>

113
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:48.871
<v Speaker 1>singer and I know rehearsal was great</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you blew it for the,</v>

114
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>for the main event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

115
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>what did I do wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did everything the same.</v>

116
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>And until you can actually pinpoint that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and figure out what it was,</v>

117
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm slipping.</v>

118
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm waking up in the middle of the night</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what the fuck went</v>

119
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're done with that,</v>

120
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:09.590
<v Speaker 2>you've got to figure out a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing from dead deer to meet.</v>

121
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 2>And all the other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just so complex.</v>

122
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:14.800
<v Speaker 2>How would you ever expect somebody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to be,</v>

123
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>have like a desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were like that at some point.</v>

124
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rinella opened the door for me to have</v>

125
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.220
<v Speaker 1>that super lucky forever grateful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when he took me into a wild back</v>

126
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

127
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get to the nuts.</v>

128
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>The first year it was a three breaks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Missouri breaks in October,</v>

129
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>nine degrees out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freezing your dick off every night and</v>

130
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.050
<v Speaker 1>attend like lifeless Steven Ella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of.</v>

131
00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves suffering.</v>

132
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I love that he loves it.</v>

133
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>He's legit as they come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really is.</v>

134
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

135
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.100
<v Speaker 2>There is just this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this big gap.</v>

136
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.780
<v Speaker 2>And my father got me into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

137
00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>my brother doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't hunt and.</v>

138
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.390
<v Speaker 2>But I think he has a respect for it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>understands what's going on.</v>

139
00:06:57.391 --> 00:06:59.310
<v Speaker 2>But he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at the time that I was</v>

140
00:06:59.311 --> 00:07:02.400
<v Speaker 2>introduced to hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother was more interested in going</v>

141
00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:05.070
<v Speaker 2>out with his friends and Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 2>mornings were not for getting up early.</v>

142
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.860
<v Speaker 2>And so we're essentially the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

143
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.980
<v Speaker 2>but I just went this way and he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>go that way.</v>

144
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a weird.</v>

145
00:07:12.661 --> 00:07:16.260
<v Speaker 2>So you could be in the same house with</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody in a different way.</v>

146
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rinella has a real good way of looking</v>

147
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:18.870
<v Speaker 1>at it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

148
00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:20.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't expect people to go out and get</v>

149
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:24.610
<v Speaker 1>rid of their own sewage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should I expect them to go out and</v>

150
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.320
<v Speaker 1>hunt their own food like you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>

151
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.971
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

152
00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I think he probably said this at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

153
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or somebody smart did.</v>

154
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.930
<v Speaker 2>It was like I choose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

155
00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 2>I choose to for meat to be the one thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I grabbed ahold of to bring into</v>

156
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.450
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my skill set.</v>

157
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't knit my own clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

158
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't make my own shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't build my own houses.</v>

159
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just looking at some</v>

160
00:07:47.311 --> 00:07:48.720
<v Speaker 2>construction stuff a little bit earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

161
00:07:48.721 --> 00:07:50.010
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>

162
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing?</v>

163
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.080
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just picked this one thing because</v>

165
00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:58.830
<v Speaker 2>it's also part of my passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you couldn't just ask someone who's a</v>

166
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.250
<v Speaker 2>construction worker to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go hunt,</v>

167
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 2>get some meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you have a desire for that,</v>

168
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:09.981
<v Speaker 2>so that's just another hard part about</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting and and non hunters by proxy are</v>

169
00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:15.021
<v Speaker 2>essential to hunting always in industry</v>
<v Speaker 2>and opinion and because we could</v>

170
00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:17.190
<v Speaker 2>legislate ourselves out of being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt.</v>

171
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.600
<v Speaker 2>That can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is a privileged man.</v>

172
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:24.540
<v Speaker 2>That's not a right and a lot of ways and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's another whole nother can of</v>

173
00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:25.800
<v Speaker 2>worms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could.</v>

174
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.210
<v Speaker 2>It could go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.910
<v Speaker 1>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is that so many people are</v>

176
00:08:29.911 --> 00:08:34.911
<v Speaker 1>opposed to it because they're so removed</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the realities of the wild and they</v>

177
00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:40.260
<v Speaker 1>just feel some sort of moral superiority</v>
<v Speaker 1>by either not eating meat entirely or by</v>

178
00:08:40.261 --> 00:08:43.110
<v Speaker 1>not killing their own meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The not killing their own meat is really</v>

179
00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:45.420
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my wife was having a conversation</v>

180
00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:47.880
<v Speaker 1>with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were out to dinner with a bunch of</v>

181
00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:52.881
<v Speaker 1>people while I was on El con and the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was eating a steak guy from England in</v>

182
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:54.930
<v Speaker 1>England and will hunt or they've do</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

183
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>these like foxes and</v>

184
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 2>horses and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

185
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 2>tweed pussies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kesari England.</v>

186
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 2>We love you guys carving a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my wife goes,</v>

187
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually out elk hunting.</v>

188
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 2>And the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hunts.</v>

189
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.460
<v Speaker 2>That's deplorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy said,</v>

190
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 2>does deplorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's carving a steak,</v>

191
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.960
<v Speaker 2>was saying something the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got.</v>

192
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.873
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

193
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 2>people were looking at me like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird at work.</v>

194
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my buddies at work was eating a</v>

195
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 2>chicken sandwich from chick filet and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>look on the bag and there's a cartoon</v>

196
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 2>chicken on the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in my mind I'm like,</v>

197
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like building a swimming pool by</v>

198
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking weird and irony that,</v>

199
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 2>that were like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

200
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating the chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's a cartoon version of it so we</v>

201
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>can celebrate the fact that we just</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered this chicken and we fried it</v>

202
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that doesn't make sense like a</v>

203
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:42.160
<v Speaker 2>swimming pool with a lake as smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's Paris.</v>
