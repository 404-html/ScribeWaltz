<v Speaker 1>to fight and then he got lost me Phi and</v>

4
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:10.414
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you find out what they did </v>

5
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>until the runup or what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I got drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

7
00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:16.534
<v Speaker 1>weeks before hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking surprise if you will not </v>

8
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>live in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not,</v>

9
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

10
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.433
<v Speaker 1>really immersing yourself and in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in the language that you speak to </v>

12
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>yourself and in the way that you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

13
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Once you expect your mind's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>support you if you don't support it.</v>

14
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things that I felt </v>

15
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:35.604
<v Speaker 2>when Jon Jones tested positive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine three weeks out of his fight </v>

16
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 2>with Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

17
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not even other.</v>

18
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only was anything wrong with doing,</v>

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with doing cocaine.</v>

20
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a positive drug,</v>

21
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 2>but some people enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

22
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 2>some people enjoy drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy drinking.</v>

23
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's positive drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily either.</v>

24
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.213
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know cause I don't have </v>

25
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 2>experience with cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not something you're supposed</v>

26
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:00.294
<v Speaker 2>to be doing three weeks outside of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>world title fight with one of the best </v>

27
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.354
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most difficult challenges </v>

28
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 2>you've ever faced in your professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>career and you're out doing blow just 21</v>

29
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 2>days before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

30
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the most talented take the </v>

31
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>gifts that they've been given and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>abused them in a way.</v>

32
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I met Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's um,</v>

33
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it's different to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

34
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>where he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he was,</v>

35
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.350
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only met him briefly.</v>

36
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Why was it I made him in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legend that is a show there and a,</v>

37
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:37.604
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just,</v>

38
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>he was very sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all over the place,</v>

39
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:40.664
<v Speaker 1>bouncing around and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't expect him to be like </v>

40
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expect.</v>

41
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And what do you mean by all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place bounds?</v>

42
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just said to me,</v>

43
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Hi blue eyes and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>

44
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>he's my from dangerous and I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

45
00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found it a bit strange.</v>

46
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I read into with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found him different.</v>

47
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say that I just found him </v>
<v Speaker 1>different and I,</v>

48
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to read into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

49
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to avoid it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

50
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met,</v>

51
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was different.</v>

52
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

53
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

54
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone,</v>

55
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.533
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going on in his </v>

56
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:22.124
<v Speaker 1>life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going on in his </v>

57
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>life and you could say that about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

58
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>He could say that about a serial killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't ya?</v>

59
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>But we do know what's going in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as full,</v>

60
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

61
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:31.424
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some things that you shouldn't </v>

62
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>do and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shouldn't be doing it.</v>

63
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>But these reasons,</v>

64
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.833
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to John's coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will tell you that John Surrounds </v>

65
00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:43.841
<v Speaker 2>himself with the wrong people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And John is an extremely talented guy.</v>

66
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe one of the most talented</v>

67
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 2>guys to ever compete in the sport and </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly strong mentally too.</v>

68
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.863
<v Speaker 2>Because despite all of his issues with </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not preparing as well as he could </v>

69
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 2>when the chips are down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy gets through things.</v>

70
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>He overcomes adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a front runner.</v>

71
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 2>He's the one that broke his toe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a,</v>

72
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 2>that was terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's gone,</v>

73
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't even realize that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening that that happened actually in</v>

74
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 2>the final flurry where he stopped chill </v>
<v Speaker 2>son and a more impressive performance is</v>

75
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:16.354
<v Speaker 2>when he fought vitor Belfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vito or completely hyper extended his </v>

76
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>arm and he would not tap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>it was for his title Vi tour came that </v>
<v Speaker 2>close.</v>

78
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Was it for the title?</v>

79
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've been non title fight,</v>

80
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>but [inaudible] came find out if that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a title fight or non title fight.</v>

81
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Either way [inaudible] came that close </v>
<v Speaker 2>to legitimately beating John Jones.</v>

82
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.073
<v Speaker 2>That clothes got a lot fully locked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Armbar that would have made 90% of the </v>

83
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 2>professional fighters in the world tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what makes him who he is.</v>

84
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.593
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't say notice it was a </v>

85
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:47.974
<v Speaker 2>title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Jamie just looked at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't say no to some blow.</v>

87
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Well he could say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he want it.</v>

88
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Didn't want us to get some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know of any,</v>

89
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:58.380
<v Speaker 2>his weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know these people,</v>

90
00:03:58.381 --> 00:03:59.214
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness or don't know if it is </v>

91
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 2>deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

92
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't be something you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

93
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 2>It's also indulgence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he likes to party,</v>

94
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's isn't there also the </v>

95
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:13.714
<v Speaker 2>issue that fighters in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially guys that are about a lot of </v>

96
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>hard gym sessions and a lot of hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>

97
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 2>they have impulse control problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those impulse control problems.</v>

98
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously not a scientist or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

99
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 2>but when you talk to neurologists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists,</v>

100
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.373
<v Speaker 2>they will tell you that there are direct</v>
<v Speaker 2>correlations between head impacts and </v>

101
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 2>poor impulse control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

102
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely a direct impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

103
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not looking for a scapegoat in my own </v>

104
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've looked back at some of the poor</v>

105
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 2>decision making that I've done in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

106
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 2>particularly in my fighting times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like back then and I was like,</v>

107
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if a lot of that was getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit in the head a lot.</v>

108
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.253
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it can't be good to get kicked in </v>

109
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 2>the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just never good.</v>

110
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Not In the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not good.</v>

111
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 2>And so if you've been kicked in the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>or punched in the face or whatever,</v>

112
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of impact.</v>

113
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing about football </v>
<v Speaker 2>players,</v>

114
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:10.324
<v Speaker 2>they're saying now is it even a shot to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chest even getting tackled like </v>

115
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 2>someone rams at you and slams their </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders into your chest.</v>

116
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 2>The brain gets jostled around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 2>You might not have a bruise on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>

118
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>but your brain is receiving essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same impact as a punch.</v>

119
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just kinda crazy.</v>

120
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people might not like,</v>

121
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>they split it as a shade that Jon Jones </v>
<v Speaker 2>has gone.</v>

122
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

123
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Cause he's got a lot back on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

124
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>He's got to look back on him and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

125
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's also got to figure out what it is </v>

126
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 2>that he took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

127
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:45.874
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even exactly to have an </v>

128
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>isolated what he took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the whole lifestyle,</v>

129
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cert most certainly an issue.</v>

130
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:55.294
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost like one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you say you don't know what you </v>

131
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 2>got until it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

132
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of gone for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not really.</v>

133
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 2>He was always still in the mix and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was always multimillion dollar fights,</v>

134
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:08.770
<v Speaker 2>a waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he fought over in saint proves.</v>

135
00:06:08.771 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 2>So he's back in the mix and everything's</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking good.</v>

136
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.374
<v Speaker 2>He's slated to fight at UFC 200 against </v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel cormier is gonna make like 10 </v>

137
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 2>million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be giant.</v>

138
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.234
<v Speaker 2>And then whoosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone for something that if you </v>

139
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:28.841
<v Speaker 2>talked to people that are experts in </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing drugs,</v>

140
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>they will tell you that this clomiphene </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what he got popped for,</v>

141
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 2>which is an anti estrogen supplement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not even beneficial.</v>

142
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 2>The only time that stuff's beneficial as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of,</v>

143
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 2>essentially when you're coming off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>

144
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 2>but yet he didn't test positive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids before or after.</v>

145
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So it could have been a tainted </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>

146
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 2>It could have been a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have been,</v>

147
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 2>who knows what wacky shit he was taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

148
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

149
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.990
<v Speaker 1>people forget that they locked sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've still got off guidance,</v>

151
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still go,</v>

152
00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a guide and you know,</v>

153
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:03.130
<v Speaker 1>to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

154
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.650
<v Speaker 1>is that the best thing you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing or someone to talk.</v>

155
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:06.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

156
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be high five and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're going to,</v>

157
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick a lot of bugle your nose.</v>

158
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.793
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it harder though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for champions because once they </v>

159
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 2>like dominate someone to kick someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass,</v>

160
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 2>like say if you fight the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most difficult fight of your career,</v>

161
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 2>you fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's Daniel Cormier,</v>

163
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd dominate them,</v>

164
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>you win and a beautiful fashion and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it,</v>

166
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I am the fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 2>And then you just want to do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to do after that,</v>

168
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.760
<v Speaker 2>and it's indulgence and chaos.</v>

169
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it.</v>

170
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Or is both the eight comes to bite you </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ass all the time.</v>

171
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.890
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] yeah.</v>
