00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Ventura,</v>

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a bigger fan now that I know</v>

4
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 2>that you're pro fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is huge for me.</v>

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to bring back the fanny</v>
<v Speaker 2>pack for years.</v>

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I've been nothing but ridicule James.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent my way.</v>

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I find that strange because I'm a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one locked in my hotel right now</v>

9
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 2>in the safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you gave because they give you</v>

10
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 2>them little safes in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I carry my passport in it.</v>

11
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 2>I carry the things that I need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>travel.</v>

12
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 2>If I'm doing airline travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my schedules,</v>

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I carry two sets of reading glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry my sunglasses.</v>

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 2>What could be better than a fanny pack</v>
<v Speaker 2>to carry all that sucker.</v>

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

16
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I tend to wear my pants a little tight</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can't put things in the pocket.</v>

17
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Things break when they get in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>

18
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fanny pack advocate.</v>

19
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've warned them now for 20 years I've</v>

20
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 2>had them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

21
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 2>And now you have one of ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

22
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Happy to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

23
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm honored.</v>

24
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a superior carriers stuff and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it to use.</v>

25
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.191
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

26
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 2>and I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've stated this in Minnesota,</v>

27
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I have legit conceal and carry where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can carry a weapon.</v>

28
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think I carry it in your</v>

29
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 2>fanny pack?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

30
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 2>they make fanny pack specifically that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Velcro open instantaneously.</v>

31
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pop right open.</v>

32
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well if I'm,</v>

33
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not wearing my shoulder holster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in my fanny pack.</v>

34
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you.</v>

35
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 2>You're only allowed to conceal carry in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota and if he goes state?</v>

36
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

37
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Many of the states now are honoring the</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

38
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I say you got to check though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking,</v>

39
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 2>if you can shoot pretty much across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country now for most part,</v>

40
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 2>if you have a legitimate conceal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry in your home state,</v>

41
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 2>the other states will likewise honor it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't go to the airport with it.</v>

42
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you can't do anything like</v>

43
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 2>that with a judith to be driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those subjects were much</v>

44
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 2>like the subject of your book marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifesto.</v>

45
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those subjects where as soon</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you bring up that subject,</v>

46
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 2>concealed carry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just go,</v>

47
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

48
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

49
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I help shepherd the law through when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was governor in Minnesota because,</v>

50
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was mayor of Brooklyn Park first and I</v>

51
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 2>went to my police chief to get conceal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and carry and he denied me.</v>

52
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 2>I was the mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could he deny it?</v>

53
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Because it was up to police chiefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why says he don't like it?</v>

54
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just didn't like it and you didn't</v>

55
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I sat back and thought,</v>

56
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is ridiculous.</v>

57
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 2>A police chief shouldn't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

58
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 2>It should be uniformally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Shall issue if you're qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be left up to him because</v>

60
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 2>like in Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lived in northern Minnesota,</v>

61
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>the rural north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get a concealed carry,</v>

62
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 2>like nothing because the police chiefs</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there didn't care.</v>

63
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.390
<v Speaker 2>But if you live down in the cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha,</v>

64
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't get conceal and carry if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bribed them.</v>

65
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.370
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>state law that's Washington wasn't.</v>

66
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was left up to the police chiefs,</v>

67
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>so if you went up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and changed that and made it</v>

68
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:27.061
<v Speaker 2>universal across the state shall issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we required you had to go through an</v>

69
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 2>accredited gun training course.</v>

70
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 2>You had to go to the range and shoot a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum of 70.</v>

71
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 2>You had to have a complete background</v>
<v Speaker 2>check done on you criminal background,</v>

72
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the case of a five point,</v>

73
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight with alcohol,</v>

74
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>with driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made conceal and carry point zero,</v>

75
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well those are good and if you're</v>

76
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 2>carrying your weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are not under the influence of any</v>

77
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

78
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are all excellent ideas and that's</v>

79
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 2>where we passed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you qualify for all that,</v>

80
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:05.850
<v Speaker 2>it shall issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

81
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 2>So what do you stand with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The NRA has been.</v>

82
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 2>They pushed back and I understand why</v>
<v Speaker 2>they push back against Gun.</v>

83
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Any gun regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that comes up.</v>

84
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Regulation in regards to background</v>
<v Speaker 2>checks,</v>

85
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 2>regards to anything because they feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ground lost is lost forever and</v>

86
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is and it.</v>

87
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 2>And it is a.</v>

88
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.570
<v Speaker 2>where I feel is is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me put it to you this way,</v>

89
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 2>life experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was physically in the Philippines,</v>

90
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Philippine islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was physically in the Philippines.</v>

91
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:44.611
<v Speaker 2>The Day Ferdinand Marcos became a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictator who I was there now.</v>

92
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I was in the US military on a US</v>
<v Speaker 2>military base,</v>

93
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 2>so it didn't really affect us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

94
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 2>we'd go into town and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a.</v>

95
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Then you had a soldier on every corner</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a machine gun.</v>

96
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 2>When he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

97
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'm getting to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He became a dictator and gave himself</v>

98
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>the power of the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Congress and the supreme court,</v>

99
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 2>complete dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing he did as a dictator,</v>

100
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.420
<v Speaker 2>he gave the people of the Philippines a</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 to 12 day grace period to turn in all</v>

101
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 2>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it was the death penalty.</v>

102
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my question to the people who oppose gun</v>

103
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 2>rights are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are are anti guns.</v>

104
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Why would a dictator make his first</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing of business to disarm the public?</v>

105
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Why would he make that as number one</v>
<v Speaker 2>priority?</v>

106
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's pretty obvious he doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

107
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Alicia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

108
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people fail to realize our second</v>

109
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:48.781
<v Speaker 2>amendment is there for us to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>defend ourself against our own</v>

110
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there it's not there for hunting</v>

111
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 2>and fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they wrote the bill of rights,</v>

112
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't hunt and fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't eat.</v>

113
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 3>That was irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was there because the British used to</v>

114
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 3>come and occupy our homes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steal our stuff.</v>

115
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 3>So the British cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Second Amendment to happen to where</v>

116
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 3>our forefathers says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

117
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.200
<v Speaker 3>we're going to allow the people to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to defend themselves against</v>

118
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 3>oppressive government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that the opposition to</v>

119
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 3>it is just a lack of foresight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

120
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you're living in this time</v>
<v Speaker 3>where for the most part things are very</v>

121
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 3>peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably the most safe time ever to</v>

122
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 3>be alive and that people have forgotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's entirely possible that tyranny</v>

123
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 3>could erupt at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe so.</v>

124
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 3>And they don't realize that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we,</v>

125
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to movements that happened this</v>

126
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had the Bernie Sanders Movement and</v>

127
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 3>the Donald Trump movement originally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted the same thing.</v>

128
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 3>They could never get together though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because once the firefighter left the</v>

129
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:54.040
<v Speaker 3>others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the firefighter,</v>

130
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that what they wanted was a turnover</v>

131
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 3>in Washington.</v>

132
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 3>They were sick of business as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's run these bums out,</v>

133
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 3>let's start fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're two movements were</v>

134
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 3>about and the more we're seeing day to</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

135
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Hillary Clinton is obviously a</v>

136
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 3>more rational choice than Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's obviously a person who speaks</v>

137
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a better representative of the people.</v>

138
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 3>She's intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's measured unless she flip flops</v>

139
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 3>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

140
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 3>But she's obviously deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply embed with the banks and special</v>

141
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:32.921
<v Speaker 3>interest groups in this most recent</v>
<v Speaker 3>wikileaks release of emails.</v>

142
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 3>It shows that she's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's been with talking with bankers,</v>

143
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 3>making sure that marijuana stays</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

144
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that she has vowed to</v>

145
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 3>push back against with all of our might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a disturbing thing to see in</v>

146
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:48.760
<v Speaker 3>2016 because my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

147
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more people locked up.</v>

148
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:53.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if people know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's more people locked up for</v>

149
00:07:53.281 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 3>marijuana in this country then for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent crimes combined.</v>

150
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 3>And that is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>

151
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible too.</v>

152
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 3>When you get to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I did this book and went into</v>

153
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:11.531
<v Speaker 3>the history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's terrifies you there is that our</v>

154
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 3>history books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our government written with the</v>

155
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:20.141
<v Speaker 3>government's view of history of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want you to know because what</v>

156
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:25.331
<v Speaker 3>astounded me in doing this book was to</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn that marijuana was the economic</v>

157
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:31.481
<v Speaker 3>backbone of this country for its first</v>
<v Speaker 3>160 years of existence.</v>

158
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 3>That if George Washington and Thomas</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jefferson were alive today,</v>

159
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 3>they'd be raided by the dea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be doing 10 to 12 years in the</v>

160
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:46.661
<v Speaker 3>federal penitentiary for being major</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug dealers because they both raised</v>

161
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 3>massive amounts of marijuana and sold</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

162
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 3>And and there was a time that England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were the colonies forced us to</v>

163
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v Speaker 2>grow it because they needed it for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>sales on their ships and the rope and so</v>

164
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 2>that they could colonize the world with</v>
<v Speaker 2>their navy and they forced us to grow</v>

165
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here you have a product and now all</v>

166
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason that I personally have gotten</v>

167
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 2>on the bandwagon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've made this a personal focus is</v>

168
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:22.521
<v Speaker 2>because I had completely lost my quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life and marijuana has given it back.</v>

169
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

170
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I won't say because of privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone extremely close to me,</v>

171
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 2>developed epileptic seizure disorder and</v>
<v Speaker 2>was seizing three to four times a week</v>

172
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 2>and I was taking care of these seizures</v>
<v Speaker 2>three to four times a week.</v>

173
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever dealt with someone with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>seizure disorder,</v>

174
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a feeling of helplessness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a feeling of pain.</v>

175
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Speaker 2>You can't even imagine what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person's going through.</v>

176
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 2>This is the person taking care of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it's someone you love,</v>

177
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.740
<v Speaker 2>the pain is unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the person was put on four</v>

178
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one after the other pharmaceutical</v>

179
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 2>medicines for seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

180
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 2>None of them worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all had horrible side effects.</v>

181
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.530
<v Speaker 2>The seizures continued for two over two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

182
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in desperation,</v>

183
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 2>we went to Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person got quote,</v>

184
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three drops under the tongue three times</v>

185
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 2>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazingly,</v>

186
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:31.580
<v Speaker 2>the seizures stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a good friend whose son has an</v>

187
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 2>amazingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the person's completely weaned off</v>

188
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 2>all pharmaceutical and that's now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>pill form.</v>

189
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 2>The person takes a pill in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>appeal at night and has been seizure</v>

190
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:47.300
<v Speaker 2>free for two and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they've taken a pharmaceutical based</v>

191
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Pilliga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marinol,</v>

192
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 2>or they know they're taking real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the other stuff.</v>

193
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:53.060
<v Speaker 2>The O,</v>
<v Speaker 2>m,</v>

194
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 2>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not The thc,</v>

195
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cbd.</v>

196
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That person needs the seat and fact this</v>

197
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 2>person takes zero thc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All CBD,</v>

198
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 2>so they're not psych.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not psychoactive.</v>

199
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:07.240
<v Speaker 2>What's at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really a non [inaudible] non</v>

200
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 2>now not even if it were.</v>

201
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

202
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my friend Tommy Chong told me,</v>

203
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Chong said there should be no</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between medical marijuana and</v>

204
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 2>recreational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said the entire plants medical,</v>

205
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 2>those that are smoking it for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>euphoric feeling are doing it for mental</v>

206
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:27.110
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

207
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

208
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.790
<v Speaker 2>So how do you get through this life if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can smoke a joint in the evening and</v>

209
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 2>it makes you relax and what's the matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that?</v>

210
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between that or</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a glass of wine or having</v>

211
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:44.570
<v Speaker 2>anything else while we're just victims</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the propaganda of the 19 thirties and</v>

212
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.230
<v Speaker 2>whether people know it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all organized by Randolph hearst</v>

213
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:50.760
<v Speaker 2>and race spacing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race based,</v>

214
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 2>and William Randolph hearst who owned</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearst also earned,</v>

215
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.490
<v Speaker 2>owned a bunch of paper mills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He owned these factors of Timberland and</v>

216
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 2>they came out with a machine called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>decorticator,</v>

217
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>whether people know this or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the decorticator made it</v>

218
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 2>economically easy to process hemp fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they came out with this in the 19</v>

219
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 2>thirties and the popular science</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine at the time.</v>

220
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.210
<v Speaker 2>It had a cover that said Hampton new</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion dollar crop based entirely on</v>

221
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>this new invention that decorticator</v>
<v Speaker 2>because before that they used to use</v>

222
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 2>slavery than when the cotton gin came</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

223
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 2>They use cotton instead of hemp because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was easier to get your enjoyable</v>

224
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:33.090
<v Speaker 2>because I don't have to say all this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those things that I've always</v>

225
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.760
<v Speaker 2>forever tries to be fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After you've done your homework,</v>

226
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 2>it's wonderful because usually I go on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

227
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to do the explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>

228
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 2>but with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to.</v>

229
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 2>You know it already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

230
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 2>William Randolph hearst was a real piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit.</v>

231
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 2>He really was.</v>

232
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 2>not just have these paper mills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was in charge of disseminating</v>

233
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:55.890
<v Speaker 2>the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy ran hearst publication</v>

234
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.900
<v Speaker 2>26 newspapers in all white rug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>country and marijuana,</v>

235

<v Speaker 2>that black smoked and then they'll rape</v>

236

<v Speaker 2>your daughters and your children and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wives and all that,</v>

237
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 2>and Lazy Mexicans.</v>

238
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why they lay around and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>brown skinned people,</v>

239
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 2>these Mexicans are all smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live in Mexico after about four</v>

240
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 2>months out of the fuck is less lazy than</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans,</v>

241
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal workers I've ever met.</v>

242
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is one of the dumbest stereotypes.</v>

243
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 2>All time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll Mexican gardeners go,</v>

244
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you this.</v>

245
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I live off the grid I live where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no electricity and our from pavement and</v>

246
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 2>an hour from electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A neighbor built a home down there and I</v>

247
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 2>had nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd go watch it everyday.</v>

248
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.720
<v Speaker 2>That's how I lived down there and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched these Mexican workers build a</v>

249
00:13:55.211 --> 00:14:00.211
<v Speaker 2>whole lot of cement from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have electronic cement</v>

250
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 2>mixers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mixed every bit of that cement by</v>

251
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 2>hand and one day I'm watching me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

252
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:12.061
<v Speaker 2>the rebar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two guys had to bend rebar by hand,</v>

253
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 2>jerking on it with a pipe to put it at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 or 90 degree angle,</v>

254
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to code to inspect that building.</v>

255
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point was,</v>

256
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 2>I started laughing and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 2>if you brought the American construction</v>
<v Speaker 2>worker down here,</v>

258
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:33.091
<v Speaker 2>he'd quit the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will quit in a day where because all</v>

259
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:38.311
<v Speaker 2>they do is deliver raw materials and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these Mexican builders would build</v>

260
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:44.220
<v Speaker 2>cement houses out of nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of raw material without a bit of</v>

261
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:46.470
<v Speaker 2>electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

262
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of Mexico and I love it</v>
<v Speaker 2>down there.</v>

263
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I love the food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the.</v>

264
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I love the life I lead down there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's the exact opposite of here.</v>

265
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live off the grid and I only pay</v>

266
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.610
<v Speaker 2>attention to what I can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

267
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Called flushing your brain out.</v>

268
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 2>My family lives down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents do.</v>

269
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They decided to chill out down to Mexico</v>

270
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 2>to only do the retirement thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what else is great to</v>

271
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 2>taxes and we always laugh at the Mexican</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

272
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're corrupt.</v>

273
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 2>They're this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On property taxes,</v>

274
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:24.730
<v Speaker 2>they are way superior to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That works down there.</v>

275
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>

276
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 2>at least in Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty much universal.</v>

277
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 2>If you buy a home and you're a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen and you fix the home up and</v>

278
00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 2>improve it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they reward you?</v>

279
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 2>You pay more for your taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go up for being a good citizen.</v>

280
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 2>So using their analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should buy the house,</v>

281
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 2>let it become the shit hole on the block</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll reward.</v>

282
00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll pay less.</v>

283
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Here's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Mexico,</v>

284
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taxes are due in March.</v>

285
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Property taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I pay them in January early,</v>

286
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:04.160
<v Speaker 2>they knock off 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I pay them in February,</v>

287
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 2>they knock off 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go down January 28th,</v>

288
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.930
<v Speaker 2>February's a short month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in 30 days I get 20 percent on my</v>

289
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 2>money legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me where I can do that.</v>

290
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty percent in 30 days.</v>

291
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Now granted it's only a couple hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks because property taxes are cheap</v>

292
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:31.220
<v Speaker 2>there anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a couple tanks of gas for my</v>

293
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.800
<v Speaker 2>pickup truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel weird living down there?</v>

294
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Not a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

295
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

296
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know Spanish now.</v>

297
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've never taken time to bother.</v>

298
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I get it down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just basically talk to me.</v>

299
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between what they know of English and</v>

300
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:52.100
<v Speaker 2>whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know of Spanish and to mining,</v>

301
00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 2>we figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

302
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

303
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 2>all you got to know to survive in Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one word,</v>

304
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.650
<v Speaker 2>which is just look at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

305
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.451
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all.</v>

306
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's high.</v>

307
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a little bit now.</v>

308
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

309
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:11.050
<v Speaker 2>You look at it and Mexican smile at them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say Cerveza and you'll get a smile</v>

310
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:12.500
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

311
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Surveys to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

312
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>so you just getting hammered all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

313
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>just say beer to a May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love to drink beer so that will smooth</v>

314
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 2>out any situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just smile and say Cerveza.</v>

315
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't know also that almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>all drugs are decriminalized in Mexico</v>

316
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.870
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in response to the drug laws and the</v>

317
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.430
<v Speaker 2>drug war starting to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Supreme Court ruled on for people,</v>

318
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 2>but only those four people can grow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>half pot.</v>

319
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.710
<v Speaker 2>It takes three more cases before it</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes the law.</v>

320
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's legal,</v>

321
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:44.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's decriminalized like mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>at decriminalized getting their</v>

322
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.640
<v Speaker 2>President Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was my friend,</v>

323
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:49.160
<v Speaker 2>he came out and said he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>decriminalize.</v>

324
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Said I'm a rancher</v>

325
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 3>farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to grow at your friends with the</v>

326
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:52.690
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

327
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew both of them saw a fox and a who</v>

328
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 3>was before him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a well member.</v>

329
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:00.960
<v Speaker 3>I was a governor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went there on a trade mission.</v>

330
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's Fox and Fox and I actually</v>

331
00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:09.081
<v Speaker 3>Fox and I actually established a trade</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in Minnesota via Mexico because</v>

332
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:11.850
<v Speaker 3>when I was down in Mexico they took me</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

333
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the corona brewery and when they took</v>

334
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:18.710
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were pallets of corn all from</v>

335
00:18:18.711 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

336
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:23.880
<v Speaker 3>He actually send their corn from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota to make corona beer.</v>

337
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:26.670
<v Speaker 3>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that like corona is such</v>

338
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 3>a weak beer and as soon as it's probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>grown in America.</v>

339
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.731
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's corn,</v>

340
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:31.980
<v Speaker 3>but it's United States courts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota corn.</v>

341
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:34.890
<v Speaker 3>That's free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes corona.</v>

342
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gluten free.</v>

343
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're one of those gluten free</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucks,</v>

344
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 3>you can have a corona.</v>

345
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 3>So the one of the few beers I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heineken to some rice based beers.</v>

346
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I think budweiser actually leave it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>corona though.</v>

347
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:48.540
<v Speaker 3>They get all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get all their corn from Minnesota.</v>

348
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 3>So you just surveys ended up back there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

349
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:52.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

350
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.553
<v Speaker 3>Drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

351
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.980
<v Speaker 3>So why do you say Cervesa for your</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends?</v>

352
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that means beer and Mexican and</v>

353
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 3>all the Mexicans love beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

354
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why if you just smile and say</v>

355
00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:04.460
<v Speaker 3>surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam,</v>

356
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.770
<v Speaker 3>you'll get a smile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surveys.</v>

357
00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:06.940
<v Speaker 3>So see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

358
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're not asking for.</v>

359
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not asking for one.</v>

360
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were just doing gay</v>

361
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.350
<v Speaker 3>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

362
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do down there?</v>

363
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I wake up in the morning with nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do and when I go to bed at night,</v>

364
00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm half done.</v>

365
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you tell?</v>

366
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I've been asked that answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell.</v>

367
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stole that from a friend down there.</v>

368
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 3>He said at one day and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I use that when I do an interview?</v>

369
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 3>He said feel free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wake up in the morning with nothing</v>

370
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:37.230
<v Speaker 3>to do and by the time I go to bed at</v>
<v Speaker 3>night I'm half done.</v>

371
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Well you obviously wrote this book so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing something.</v>

372
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why,</v>

373
00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:43.980
<v Speaker 3>why do you write books?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just get bored and you know,</v>

374
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I write them if I'm motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got motivated because of this</v>

375
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:50.070
<v Speaker 3>epileptic seizure issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever paid</v>

376
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:50.821
<v Speaker 3>attention to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

377
00:19:50.821 --> 00:19:52.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the navy seals had an issue with</v>

378
00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:55.740
<v Speaker 3>epileptic seizures as well from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebreathers.</v>

379
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently there's something to do with</v>

380
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:01.620
<v Speaker 3>getting the bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out about it because I started,</v>

381
00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:02.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

382
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.120
<v Speaker 3>eating a ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting my body to process fat instead</v>

383
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 3>of carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the reasons that the seals</v>

384
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:14.460
<v Speaker 3>are looking into this is because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>prevents seizures in people that use</v>

385
00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 3>those rebreathers as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

386
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that don't make bubbles.</v>

387
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used them all the time.</v>

388
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:21.120
<v Speaker 3>The Emerson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dove them.</v>

389
00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:24.150
<v Speaker 3>That was the majority of the thing I</v>
<v Speaker 3>dove when I was getting there and I</v>

390
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 3>never had a seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not,</v>

391
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I never heard of anyone having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>seizure.</v>

392
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.870
<v Speaker 3>Some people have them apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

393
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I never heard of it the entire six years</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in.</v>

394
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also a epilepsy in children.</v>

395
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.620
<v Speaker 3>They've used ketogenic diets to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

396
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.810
<v Speaker 3>to control epilepsy in children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

397
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:41.650
<v Speaker 3>like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was another big.</v>

398
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I would think this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think if anyone had any type of</v>

399
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>seizure disorder that would him</v>

400
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.590
<v Speaker 2>from the seals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

401
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a direct result of using</v>

402
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 2>the rebreathers yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would think anyone that had that</v>

403
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Speaker 2>result from a rebreather would be washed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

404
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think right?</v>

405
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you couldn't take the risk that</v>

406
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:06.970
<v Speaker 2>the person would have to do that job and</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have a seizure while attempting to</v>

407
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:07.721
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

408
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:12.721
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when the seizures occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is the first I've</v>

409
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 2>ever heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Dom D'agostino,</v>

410
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:16.220
<v Speaker 2>who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

411
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:21.330
<v Speaker 2>one of the premier experts on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diets and nutritional ketones.</v>

412
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.810
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

413
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 2>he's spoken about this and I've read</v>
<v Speaker 2>some other articles about it as well</v>

414
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 2>about where you've got to be with kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>with epilepsy.</v>

415
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.730
<v Speaker 2>You gotta remember when I was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>teams it was a whole different mindset.</v>

416
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even called the seals back</v>

417
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

418
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 2>You recall the ball fields to were</v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater demolition teams and the</v>

419
00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:43.450
<v Speaker 2>shields both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called Udt seal bugs,</v>

420
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.780
<v Speaker 2>bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bud stands for basic underwater</v>

421
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:51.580
<v Speaker 2>demolition slash seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was we were the frog man</v>

422
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:56.581
<v Speaker 2>in in 1962,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John F Kennedy had enough foresight to</v>

423
00:21:57.401 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 2>realize that wars would be fought by</v>
<v Speaker 2>small units from now on,</v>

424
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.130
<v Speaker 2>so he took the frog men out of the water</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he put them on the land with an</v>

425
00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 2>executive order because up until that</v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time,</v>

426
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 2>the navy could go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not go past the high watermark.</v>

427
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.430
<v Speaker 2>From that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the marines.</v>

428
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.590
<v Speaker 2>He required President Kennedy to sign an</v>
<v Speaker 2>executive order that allowed the navy to</v>

429
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 2>go past the high watermark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he then created.</v>

430
00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:28.870
<v Speaker 2>The Kennedy came out of the Navy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he took the navy frogman and put us</v>

431
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:32.770
<v Speaker 2>on land and they re re named distend</v>
<v Speaker 2>seals,</v>

432
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.990
<v Speaker 2>which the acronym seal stands for sea</v>
<v Speaker 2>air land teams,</v>

433
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 2>which means we come from the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we come from the air,</v>

434
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 2>and we come from the land.</v>

435
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Any of the three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

436
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.240
<v Speaker 2>That's where the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it all came from.</v>

437
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy Forum to seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took the frog man out of the water</v>

438
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 2>and put him on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The marines were angry because they felt</v>

439
00:22:57.011 --> 00:23:00.730
<v Speaker 2>that the land was theirs in the navy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be there.</v>

440
00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:05.800
<v Speaker 2>That's always been weird to me that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rivalry between military units,</v>

441
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you would think that the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>military is one big team?</v>

442
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're not in a common war</v>

443
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:12.790
<v Speaker 2>then you got to fight each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that bizarre?</v>

444
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking crazy.</v>

445
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're in the military,</v>

446
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 2>it's just your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mindset.</v>

447
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:20.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

448
00:23:20.451 --> 00:23:24.520
<v Speaker 2>it's your mindset and you get bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you haven't got an enemy to fight,</v>

449
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:26.500
<v Speaker 2>then you fight the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the bars,</v>

450
00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 2>you fight the other surfaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we used to do it all the time.</v>

451
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 2>We did trouble all the time.</v>

452
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't that seem stupid?</v>

453
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One big team wore stupid and if so,</v>

454
00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:41.404
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why?</v>

455
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't there be stupidity along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with wore that?</v>

456
00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.990
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with people with major</v>
<v Speaker 2>egos,</v>

457
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:51.710
<v Speaker 2>high testosterone rate and their and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their warriors.</v>

458
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 2>You know when you play that game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a game for real.</v>

459
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times you don't come back and play</v>

460
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like football and he didn't</v>

461
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:03.410
<v Speaker 2>like any of these sporting events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>

462
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a game of functionality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it feel like a game when you were in</v>

463
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 2>the military?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

464
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.140
<v Speaker 2>it was my job</v>
<v Speaker 2>most.</v>

465
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

466
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.580
<v Speaker 2>as a pro athlete that your job too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like a job.</v>

467
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.040
<v Speaker 2>It's your job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your job,</v>

468
00:24:21.041 --> 00:24:25.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's also your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not a volunteer job,</v>

469
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 2>but you volunteer of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go into the budge,</v>

470
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>you have to volunteer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteer unit.</v>

471
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.400
<v Speaker 2>You can volunteer in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can volunteer out.</v>

472
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.780
<v Speaker 2>It's whether you want to do the job or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

473
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 2>When all that shit went down with Chris</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyle and the.</v>

474
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:46.170
<v Speaker 2>When he said that he punched you in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bar and get you sued the family like,</v>

475
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.033
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

476
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Well I didn't choose glute ham rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

477
00:24:49.561 --> 00:24:54.561
<v Speaker 2>I shooed him and he died and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot automatically goes to his estate.</v>

478
00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 2>That's the way the legal works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was never in any jeopardy because in</v>

479
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:03.690
<v Speaker 2>any writers contract you have insurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the publisher,</v>

480
00:25:03.691 --> 00:25:07.320
<v Speaker 2>so it's me again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They portrayed and I became the villain</v>

481
00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.230
<v Speaker 2>going after the widow and the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

482
00:25:10.231 --> 00:25:13.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big insurance company that's</v>

483
00:25:13.501 --> 00:25:17.400
<v Speaker 2>covering the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not out a penny and they won't</v>

484
00:25:17.401 --> 00:25:19.140
<v Speaker 2>be out of pain that you had to explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

485
00:25:19.141 --> 00:25:20.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

486
00:25:20.341 --> 00:25:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the tie,</v>

487
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.500
<v Speaker 2>the trial got overturned because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance came out,</v>

488
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.640
<v Speaker 2>so it's okay to lie in court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the truth comes out,</v>

489
00:25:29.641 --> 00:25:30.720
<v Speaker 2>you can get a new trial.</v>

490
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.640
<v Speaker 2>The insurance came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean in court?</v>

491
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.970
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to say that insurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>is paying for everything,</v>

492
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.990
<v Speaker 2>even though it's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to say that in court.</v>

493
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.680
<v Speaker 2>So what happens when you say it in court</v>
<v Speaker 2>while it came out and the judge allowed</v>

494
00:25:43.681 --> 00:25:47.130
<v Speaker 2>it to a limited degree and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>appeals court ruled that the judge</v>

495
00:25:47.131 --> 00:25:52.020
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have did that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because having the judge say that it</v>

496
00:25:52.021 --> 00:25:55.830
<v Speaker 2>sways people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that if it all against</v>

497
00:25:55.831 --> 00:25:58.190
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because insurance companies a big.</v>

498
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Even though the other side is doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called poor morale thing,</v>

499
00:26:02.041 --> 00:26:05.950
<v Speaker 2>they're getting up and saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxing them financially and lying</v>

500
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.400
<v Speaker 2>insurance is paying for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get up and lie about it.</v>

501
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.600
<v Speaker 2>So the other side was saying this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to devastate our reality.</v>

502
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Trying to influence the end and in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

503
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:24.770
<v Speaker 2>let me state this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How overwhelming must be evidence of Ben</v>

504
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 2>for the jury to go against the grieving</v>
<v Speaker 2>widow of the dead war veteran?</v>

505
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be pretty overwhelming.</v>

506
00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 2>The evidence was overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the,</v>

507
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.330
<v Speaker 2>the jury went from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came for me.</v>

508
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:43.140
<v Speaker 2>They said he was lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This didn't happen and we're awarding.</v>

509
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think</v>

510
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.930
<v Speaker 3>he did that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know him?</v>

511
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't know him,</v>

512
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.420
<v Speaker 3>know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know even thing happened.</v>

513
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:55.560
<v Speaker 3>We were there on the same nights we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>at [inaudible] because I was there for a</v>

514
00:26:55.561 --> 00:27:00.150
<v Speaker 3>graduation of class 2:58 AM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>class 58.</v>

515
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 3>It's traditionally every hundred classes</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can,</v>

516
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:08.871
<v Speaker 3>you come back to the graduation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So class 2:58 was graduating the next</v>

517
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:13.110
<v Speaker 3>day on Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came out along with my team mates from</v>

518
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 3>58 to attend that graduation the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

519
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 3>So why would I say bad things about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>seals if I'm there?</v>

520
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:24.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said he punched me for</v>
<v Speaker 3>will tell,</v>

521
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.660
<v Speaker 3>because people don't know what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about because probably a lot of</v>

522
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:29.700
<v Speaker 3>people listening to this have no idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about.</v>

523
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:31.740
<v Speaker 3>So let me just fill my real clear right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

524
00:27:31.741 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 3>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American sniper.</v>

525
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:38.430
<v Speaker 3>The movie with Bradley Cooper was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant hit movie,</v>

526
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 3>very patriotic movie about a guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most successful snipers in US</v>

527
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:43.164
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

528
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.100
<v Speaker 3>A very successful warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>navy seal,</v>

529
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:49.080
<v Speaker 3>war hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody loved him.</v>

530
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Then he goes on the opiod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Show and he says that he punched</v>

531
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 3>you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know there's a chapter in his book where</v>

532
00:27:57.661 --> 00:28:00.620
<v Speaker 3>he writes that he called me scruff face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

533
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.170
<v Speaker 3>And you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said seals deserved to die.</v>

534
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.140
<v Speaker 3>That in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she accused me of treason.</v>

535
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.950
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was out there for a seal</v>

536
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.400
<v Speaker 3>graduation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I felt that way about my old unit,</v>

537
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.060
<v Speaker 3>why would I be attending?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he wrote in the book,</v>

538
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Speaker 3>He gave you a nickname in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scruff,</v>

539
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:20.491
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever.</v>

540
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean he might not have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when he wrote it in the book,</v>

541
00:28:22.561 --> 00:28:24.840
<v Speaker 3>he might not have even thought that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to give that to you.</v>

542
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what was going on.</v>

543
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.060
<v Speaker 3>My thought was at the time I was trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to wrap my head around why anybody would</v>

544
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 3>do this and I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe he's just trying to generate</v>

545
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 3>as much controversy as possible to</v>
<v Speaker 3>generate as much income as possible from</v>

546
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:39.330
<v Speaker 3>his book.</v>

547
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 3>And it just got out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

548
00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I was trying to put it together</v>

549
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:44.670
<v Speaker 3>because there was a couple of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>fabrications,</v>

550
00:28:44.671 --> 00:28:45.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

551
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shooting at a gas station that never</v>

552
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:50.560
<v Speaker 3>took place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that he,</v>

553
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.600
<v Speaker 3>during Katrina he was on the home and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot people who were looting.</v>

554
00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:56.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was disturbing because that's</v>

555
00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.470
<v Speaker 3>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

556
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 3>And he also lied about his medals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The navy had to come out and.</v>

557
00:29:01.381 --> 00:29:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he had two silver stars and five</v>

558
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:07.080
<v Speaker 3>bronze stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had won silver star.</v>

559
00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:10.230
<v Speaker 3>And three bronze star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we lied about three medals.</v>

560
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Well that's one in three is impressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

561
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

562
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they try to give them an excuse</v>

563
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:18.451
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

564
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:19.740
<v Speaker 3>he was confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

565
00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:22.410
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get a medal like that,</v>

566
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 3>it's like graduating from college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give you a certificate that puts on</v>

567
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:29.350
<v Speaker 3>your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you win the bronze star,</v>

568
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 3>the Silver Star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as a,</v>

569
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 3>as a seal yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he threw me under the bus.</v>

570
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 3>What does that feel like to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because reason.</v>

571
00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.500
<v Speaker 3>But this is obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that's very near and</v>

572
00:29:40.501 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 3>dear to your who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hugely.</v>

573
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:46.090
<v Speaker 2>He has made it to where I can't go to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>reunion anymore.</v>

574
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:51.470
<v Speaker 2>There were 170 seals that wanted me</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked out of the Udt Seal Association</v>

575
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.780
<v Speaker 2>over his lie</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lives of his buddies who came up</v>

576
00:29:57.791 --> 00:29:59.840
<v Speaker 2>and tried to testify for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it.</v>

577
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 2>It got embarrassing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His trial said that it actually</v>

578
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.031
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

579
00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they tried to say everything else to</v>

580
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 2>make it seem like it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

581
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 2>How the hell they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

582
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:13.440
<v Speaker 2>because they dance around the questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lawyering and well,</v>

583
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:17.470
<v Speaker 2>you have to piece together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't one witness that saw me get</v>

584
00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 2>hit and there wasn't one witness that</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard me say anything.</v>

585
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 2>See attributed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And weren't you visible the next day?</v>

586
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:31.230
<v Speaker 2>No photographs that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Them posing for pictures with me.</v>

587
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 2>If I had said all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would they have take pictures with</v>

588
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

589
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:41.220
<v Speaker 2>What is that feeling like when someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking lies horrible and when it</v>

590
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 2>makes a lot of terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

591
00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:47.680
<v Speaker 2>And what's worse about it is the media</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumps on it and convicts me of it</v>

592
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:51.370
<v Speaker 2>because why they broke the story when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went off the grid,</v>

593
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Mexico where I couldn't even come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they broke the story.</v>

594
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they knew?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to believe that,</v>

595
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.290
<v Speaker 2>but weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't it happen on the opiod Anthony</v>

596
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.123
<v Speaker 2>Show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

597
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.640
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that was planned</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know those guys,</v>

598
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.060
<v Speaker 2>but there was the whole ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all show did it.</v>

599
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 2>He did it that day on O'reilly later</v>
<v Speaker 2>that afternoon.</v>

600
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 2>So he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He named you.</v>

601
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:15.880
<v Speaker 2>He just started naming you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

602
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Then it went viral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went viral,</v>

603
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.970
<v Speaker 2>and everyone convicted me because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

604
00:31:21.971 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Iraq war veteran wouldn't lie.</v>

605
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

606
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I watched a.</v>

607
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you all that.</v>

608
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:34.620
<v Speaker 2>It's destroyed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get hired for a job during my</v>

609
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 2>trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After it was over,</v>

610
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:40.960
<v Speaker 2>guess what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty four major media conglomerates</v>

611
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.090
<v Speaker 2>entered the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

612
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.943
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

613
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.230
<v Speaker 2>the trial with that Amis Ama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cc,</v>

614
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 2>they call it or whatever have of</v>
<v Speaker 2>influencing the court of appeals to</v>

615
00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:52.450
<v Speaker 2>overturn my verdict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did it.</v>

616
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Thirty four media conglomerates that New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York Times the Washington Post.</v>

617
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:03.090
<v Speaker 2>All of these media conglomerates appeal</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Court of Appeals to overturn my</v>

618
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 2>verdict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why?</v>

619
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Because I won on something called unjust</v>
<v Speaker 2>enrichment.</v>

620
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 2>They want the ability to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>defame you and profit from it.</v>

621
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.700
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it what they had,</v>

622
00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:18.070
<v Speaker 2>what these judges accommodated them</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

623
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.070
<v Speaker 2>There's gonna be another trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've ordered a new trial.</v>

624
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 2>So I got to go through it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm glad because when it comes out</v>

625
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:31.111
<v Speaker 2>to juries and two judges find kyle</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty who's not going to believe it</v>

626
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:33.120
<v Speaker 2>then and.</v>

627
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.790
<v Speaker 2>But the point is they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've ordered a new trial,</v>

628
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.893
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

629
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.940
<v Speaker 2>they throughout the whole verdict of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jury,</v>

630
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.560
<v Speaker 2>the federal judge who wrote substantial</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence supporting the jury's verdict.</v>

631
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.340
<v Speaker 2>They did all that and they violated</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own rules.</v>

632
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.950
<v Speaker 2>A 76 year rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what it states if,</v>

633
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 2>because it happened during summation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the judge allowed it in the my</v>

634
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:02.750
<v Speaker 2>attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ended up for questions in an 11 day</v>

635
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:06.830
<v Speaker 2>trial and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a page of a 20 page summary and it was</v>

636
00:33:06.831 --> 00:33:11.831
<v Speaker 2>overturned on that and they overturned</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because they felt that it was undue</v>

637
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:16.160
<v Speaker 2>influence on the jury that they found</v>
<v Speaker 2>out that insurance was paying for</v>

638
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:18.550
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as one factor,</v>

639
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's the deal.</v>

640
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.780
<v Speaker 2>If the rules state that if in final</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument they say something,</v>

641
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 2>you must object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must object.</v>

642
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:35.141
<v Speaker 2>So the trial lawyer as a chance to rule</v>
<v Speaker 2>during final argument and the jury has a</v>

643
00:33:35.301 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 2>chance to hear the ruling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never objected</v>

644
00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.200
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they must object to undue influence</v>

645
00:33:40.201 --> 00:33:41.530
<v Speaker 4>because of the fact that it was</v>

646
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.150
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never objected.</v>

647
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:50.020
<v Speaker 2>The jury was dismissed at 1158 at 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh two.</v>

648
00:33:50.021 --> 00:33:53.880
<v Speaker 2>They then objected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The judge overruled him and we were done</v>

649
00:33:53.881 --> 00:33:55.200
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

650
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.340
<v Speaker 2>these two judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Riley and shepherd have now overturned</v>

651
00:33:59.341 --> 00:34:03.390
<v Speaker 2>the case on something that was never</v>
<v Speaker 2>objected to in trial.</v>

652
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:07.620
<v Speaker 2>They objected to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they overturned the jury and the</v>

653
00:34:07.621 --> 00:34:11.460
<v Speaker 2>federal judge Van.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also overturned my unjust</v>

654
00:34:11.461 --> 00:34:14.700
<v Speaker 2>enrichment claim because the media</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want it.</v>

655
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:20.060
<v Speaker 2>What they've allowed now is the media</v>
<v Speaker 2>can defame you and profit from it and</v>

656
00:34:21.061 --> 00:34:25.620
<v Speaker 2>you can't get any of their profits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how they harm you,</v>

657
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.840
<v Speaker 2>while that's the equivalent of if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>went out and robbed the bank and they</v>

658
00:34:30.841 --> 00:34:35.280
<v Speaker 2>caught you and they sentenced you to two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years in prison for the bank robbery.</v>

659
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.160
<v Speaker 2>But when you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to keep all the money you took.</v>

660
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.900
<v Speaker 2>So that's in this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular,</v>

661
00:34:42.901 --> 00:34:46.380
<v Speaker 2>which will now be the standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's they've ruled that way,</v>

662
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.560
<v Speaker 2>they now make it to where you can profit</v>
<v Speaker 2>from wrongdoing because of this case.</v>

663
00:34:51.961 --> 00:34:52.794
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

664
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.680
<v Speaker 4>This is such a touchy case because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>so indicative of the complications of</v>

665
00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:03.090
<v Speaker 4>people because people are not simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really very touchy.</v>

666
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.040
<v Speaker 4>He lied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did lie,</v>

667
00:35:05.041 --> 00:35:09.180
<v Speaker 4>but to me with his lie that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's not what I'm saying.</v>

668
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 4>What's complicated is he's also the</v>
<v Speaker 4>subject of this gigantic movie and this</v>

669
00:35:14.501 --> 00:35:18.690
<v Speaker 4>symbol of patriotism where so many</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will say,</v>

670
00:35:18.691 --> 00:35:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Chris Kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rest and peace.</v>

671
00:35:20.011 --> 00:35:24.400
<v Speaker 4>So many people would have a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>

672
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.910
<v Speaker 4>Someone took a photo in the cloud and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's on a cloud.</v>

673
00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:28.890
<v Speaker 4>That's Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Kyle.</v>

674
00:35:28.891 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 4>It'll look like a sniper in the car in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

675
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:34.440
<v Speaker 4>It's Chris Kyle guiding a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guarding the skies.</v>

676
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 4>Like it became a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he became this where it wasn't.</v>

677
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 4>He was a representative of the brave</v>
<v Speaker 4>military,</v>

678
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 4>like the portrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but honestly the betrayal that Bradley</v>

679
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:50.750
<v Speaker 4>Cooper played in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that movie was so simplistic and so it</v>

680
00:35:50.951 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a brand of a Joseph</v>

681
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Campbell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

682
00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.940
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hero's journey.</v>

683
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Had I not gone to court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have been in the movie.</v>

684
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to stop it.</v>

685
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.580
<v Speaker 2>They were going to have him punch you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie.</v>

686
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book,</v>

687
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had to stop it because I know when</v>

688
00:36:09.921 --> 00:36:11.630
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were in trial,</v>

689
00:36:11.631 --> 00:36:14.870
<v Speaker 2>you know what they tried to do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>diminish my role because when they knew</v>

690
00:36:14.871 --> 00:36:18.770
<v Speaker 2>they were going to lose their lawyer got</v>
<v Speaker 2>me on the stand and he said,</v>

691
00:36:18.771 --> 00:36:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Mr Ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

692
00:36:20.871 --> 00:36:25.871
<v Speaker 2>would it surprise you to know that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first draft of the movie doesn't have</v>

693
00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Speaker 2>you in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to prove how insignificant my</v>

694
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.350
<v Speaker 2>first draft of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean shit.</v>

695
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first draft of this.</v>

696
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so what if the second draft?</v>

697
00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:38.770
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

698
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you ended though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

699
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.340
<v Speaker 2>here's where my response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

700
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't surprise me at all because</v>

701
00:36:45.101 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I said we've sent two letters to warner</v>
<v Speaker 2>brothers warning them that if I am</v>

702
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:53.080
<v Speaker 2>indeed in in this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will be next to be sued.</v>

703
00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So we put Warner Brothers on notice that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this chapters included your movie,</v>

704
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.950
<v Speaker 2>you will get sued next and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people out here,</v>

705
00:37:02.951 --> 00:37:07.510
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to step into a lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that kept me from</v>

706
00:37:07.511 --> 00:37:12.130
<v Speaker 2>being punched out in that movie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayed me as a villain in that</v>

707
00:37:12.131 --> 00:37:13.060
<v Speaker 2>frickin movie,</v>

708
00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.250
<v Speaker 4>just to fill in way more than a villain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

709
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is insane.</v>

710
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.330
<v Speaker 4>It is insane because what's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy to me and what's</v>

711
00:37:20.331 --> 00:37:25.331
<v Speaker 4>complicated about this is that there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands and thousands of brave men and</v>

712
00:37:25.971 --> 00:37:28.790
<v Speaker 4>women who have risked their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice their lives,</v>

713
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.360
<v Speaker 4>and this guy becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is for your head and where is he</v>

714
00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:38.300
<v Speaker 4>rises above including me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including you.</v>

715
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.650
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very important,</v>

716
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.310
<v Speaker 4>but he rises above all of this and</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes this iconic figure.</v>

717
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.460
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This iconic figure that you can't</v>

718
00:37:46.461 --> 00:37:50.840
<v Speaker 4>tarnish and then the truth is irrelevant</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're willing to sacrifice people</v>

719
00:37:50.841 --> 00:37:55.520
<v Speaker 4>like you and the truth just for this</v>
<v Speaker 4>overall image of patriotism.</v>

720
00:37:55.521 --> 00:37:57.680
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

721
00:37:57.681 --> 00:38:00.020
<v Speaker 4>What a crazy place that must've been for</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

722
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.470
<v Speaker 2>still is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

723
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.770
<v Speaker 2>do you know that this person that I told</v>
<v Speaker 2>you about,</v>

724
00:38:05.771 --> 00:38:10.000
<v Speaker 2>what the seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seizure disorders started right</v>

725
00:38:10.001 --> 00:38:14.860
<v Speaker 2>after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she didn't die from doctors</v>

726
00:38:14.861 --> 00:38:17.710
<v Speaker 2>have said seizures can be caused by</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>

727
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 2>So I hold Chris Kyle directly</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the seizure disorder</v>

728
00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:26.650
<v Speaker 2>also that I had to face that marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 2>cured.</v>

729
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever communicate with him face</v>
<v Speaker 2>to face?</v>

730
00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Only one set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>

731
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we first in June,</v>

732
00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at,</v>

733
00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 2>in June of 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the book came out in January,</v>

734
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.030
<v Speaker 2>we had a settlement conference where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept saying that if he met me in person,</v>

735
00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:47.290
<v Speaker 2>we could work it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at this conference we agreed I would</v>

736
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:50.320
<v Speaker 2>meet him in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judge in the corner and just ski and</v>

737
00:38:50.321 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you and I are here.</v>

738
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.020
<v Speaker 2>We sat down in the room and I looked him</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the face and I said,</v>

739
00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 2>why did you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never punched me.</v>

740
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 2>He looked me back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes I did.</v>

741
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I turned to the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

742
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.950
<v Speaker 2>there's no need to go any farther.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

743
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:10.690
<v Speaker 2>if he's not going to admit it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen face to face one on one and I</v>

744
00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:15.691
<v Speaker 2>challenge his courage because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had the courage to go to Iraq.</v>

745
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.220
<v Speaker 2>He had the courage to shoot all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

746
00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't have the courage to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>

747
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a bizarre moment that must have</v>

748
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:25.560
<v Speaker 2>been sitting across from that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

749
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.070
<v Speaker 2>and he looked at me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

750
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the look in his face?</v>

751
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a doctor,</v>

752
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 2>but I've done some studying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was a sociopath.</v>

753
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Sociopath can lie and hold a straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and they lie to the point where</v>

754
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:45.601
<v Speaker 2>they believe their own lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How bizarre is it that this iconic</v>

755
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:46.961
<v Speaker 2>figure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

756
00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:49.190
<v Speaker 2>and then look how he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

757
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had no training and posttraumatic</v>

758
00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.690
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not medical and yet he's taking</v>

759
00:39:55.691 --> 00:40:00.691
<v Speaker 2>this marine to a gun range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who suffering from posttraumatic stress</v>

760
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:06.330
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't common sense tell you not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a weapon in the hands of someone</v>

761
00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:09.580
<v Speaker 2>suffering from posttraumatic stress.</v>

762
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Stress is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they tell him to man up?</v>

763
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Why would you put a weapon in somebody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands?</v>

764
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Who's suffering from posttraumatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress when you have no medical</v>

765
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:28.110
<v Speaker 2>training?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is quite qualified to treat this</v>

766
00:40:28.111 --> 00:40:28.640
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

767
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I would assume it would be based on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>own posttraumatic stress,</v>

768
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have it at all.</v>

769
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:37.150
<v Speaker 2>He was never treated for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He may have had it.</v>

770
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why he did what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know God,</v>

771
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:44.470
<v Speaker 2>what a crazy place today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

772
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:45.850
<v Speaker 2>But the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

773
00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 2>it's like I've been accused of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do.</v>

774
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

775
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I may have met him that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Briefly.</v>

776
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Let me some it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I obviously didn't get a one 1000000th</v>

777
00:40:57.941 --> 00:41:00.190
<v Speaker 2>of a percent of the amount of hate that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did,</v>

778
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:05.820
<v Speaker 2>but just read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got read off September 11th of this</v>

779
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.640
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in New York doing this book tour</v>

780
00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:12.640
<v Speaker 2>and I got read off in a hotel lobby over</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

781
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.930
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read off?</v>

782
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.500
<v Speaker 2>A guy yelled and screamed at me in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the entire hotel lobby,</v>

783
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I live with now and I</v>

784
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:26.200
<v Speaker 2>haven't been damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My reputation isn't damaged over</v>

785
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 2>something I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was gonna say is I obviously</v>

786
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 2>haven't experienced one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1000000th of the hate that you have,</v>

787
00:41:33.321 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 2>but I read.</v>

788
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.850
<v Speaker 4>We read this article on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were trying to figure out what</v>

789
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:42.110
<v Speaker 4>happened when your case was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we read this article that was,</v>

790
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was in the New York Times,</v>

791
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 4>see if he could find the article</v>
<v Speaker 4>detailing all the various lies.</v>

792
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an Yorker magazine.</v>

793
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.060
<v Speaker 4>New Yorker in married.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did an investigation of him,</v>

794
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 4>but it's stunning and just reading that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the the fucking amount of hate tweets</v>

795
00:41:58.131 --> 00:42:02.300
<v Speaker 4>and facebook tweets and you fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>coward and you this and knew that.</v>

796
00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

797
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 4>I didn't write it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

798
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:06.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck is going on.</v>

799
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:10.880
<v Speaker 4>If someone puts something like that in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the New Yorker with verified claims.</v>

800
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's verified.</v>

801
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.380
<v Speaker 4>What they were saying that he said and</v>
<v Speaker 4>what actually had happened was all</v>

802
00:42:15.381 --> 00:42:16.640
<v Speaker 4>verified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>

803
00:42:16.641 --> 00:42:19.490
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very confusing that somehow or another</v>

804
00:42:19.491 --> 00:42:22.490
<v Speaker 4>this slipped through the cracks and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>this became their iconic figure.</v>

805
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not discounting along with you.</v>

806
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.350
<v Speaker 4>The thousands and thousands of patriotic</v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans that risked their lives</v>

807
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's denying.</v>

808
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a great sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's denying he didn't do his job.</v>

809
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 2>I've never denied that from him or said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that about him.</v>

810
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he may be the best.</v>

811
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll still put my money on Carlos half</v>

812
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 2>cock though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The marine as being the best sniper.</v>

813
00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now,</v>

814
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:51.870
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

815
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:54.140
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did his job and he did it well,</v>

816
00:42:54.141 --> 00:42:58.280
<v Speaker 2>but why did he have to take an old</v>
<v Speaker 2>veteran that would be like me taking a</v>

817
00:42:58.281 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 2>world war guy and throwing him under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bus.</v>

818
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck would he choose you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I had fame.</v>

819
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got jealous that night.</v>

820
00:43:06.531 --> 00:43:09.860
<v Speaker 2>We were at the bar because everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowded around and wanted their picture</v>

821
00:43:09.861 --> 00:43:12.410
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

822
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll never be around.</v>

823
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to know why he picked out me.</v>

824
00:43:19.221 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 2>I think because I'm probably the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous maybe,</v>

825
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 2>or I develop to be the most famous seal</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than Dick Marcinko,</v>

826
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:29.160
<v Speaker 2>the rogue warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great books.</v>

827
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Read his books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a friend of mine.</v>

828
00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Richard Marcinko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

829
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:37.060
<v Speaker 4>Sat down and you're talking to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much time were you actually in the</v>

830
00:43:37.061 --> 00:43:37.760
<v Speaker 4>room with them?</v>

831
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of minutes.</v>

832
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Was all the minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minute he looked me in the eye and</v>

833
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sure did he hit you.</v>

834
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I turned to the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

835
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:47.880
<v Speaker 2>we got nothing more to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't want it.</v>

836
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I offered him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

837
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:56.290
<v Speaker 2>if you will walk out to be with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>press and admit you fabricated this</v>

838
00:43:56.331 --> 00:44:00.110
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will forgive you in front of the press</v>

839
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:04.160
<v Speaker 2>and we will go on with our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would not do it.</v>

840
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:08.390
<v Speaker 2>He did not have the courage to stand up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tell the truth.</v>

841
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.800
<v Speaker 4>It takes a lot of courage to admit you</v>
<v Speaker 4>lied about something that massive.</v>

842
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't line about speeding,</v>

843
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:14.543
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

844
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 4>This is a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive.</v>

845
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.800
<v Speaker 2>What about ruining my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ruining my reputation,</v>

846
00:44:19.801 --> 00:44:24.801
<v Speaker 2>ruining my wife's life route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost my conspiracy theory show because</v>

847
00:44:25.201 --> 00:44:28.620
<v Speaker 2>of it real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get hired right now.</v>

848
00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:33.150
<v Speaker 2>I can't get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My last job on the Internet at Aura tv</v>

849
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 2>because the owners Carlos slim from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

850
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 2>From that you know who I'm hired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know who I work for now?</v>

851
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.270
<v Speaker 2>The Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian TV.</v>

852
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only people that will hire me</v>

853
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:49.610
<v Speaker 2>because 34 media conglomerate centered</v>
<v Speaker 2>this case to overturn me.</v>

854
00:44:50.161 --> 00:44:52.620
<v Speaker 2>You think they're going to hire me now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain that.</v>

855
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think they did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they did that?</v>

856
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Because if they overturn your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can somehow or another because</v>

857
00:44:59.581 --> 00:45:04.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that it or is that discrediting</v>

858
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:06.960
<v Speaker 2>you in like that was a gigantic hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

859
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 2>But if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can discredit you,</v>

860
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.300
<v Speaker 2>it makes that movie still valuable.</v>

861
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it stops me from running for president.</v>

862
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they can discredit me,</v>

863
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.410
<v Speaker 2>do you want to run for president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it.</v>

864
00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Even living in Mexico from Mexico would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had to forsaken that.</v>

865
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:26.900
<v Speaker 2>That's why I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know the,</v>

866
00:45:26.901 --> 00:45:28.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why you didn't run for</v>

867
00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:31.290
<v Speaker 2>president because you had to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>forsaken live in New Mexico.</v>

868
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Now I might fucking when I know I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I could have one.</v>

869
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:38.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Libertarians contacted me twice to</v>

870
00:45:38.311 --> 00:45:40.760
<v Speaker 2>come to their convention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to nominate tessie,</v>

871
00:45:40.761 --> 00:45:42.400
<v Speaker 2>come back to America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Com.</v>

872
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Ken and I chose not to do it because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was up for the campaigning.</v>

873
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I was up to taking on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking on the damage and repubs,</v>

874
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at age 65,</v>

875
00:45:52.981 --> 00:45:57.981
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't up to do the job for four years</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'd have to it and my lifestyle</v>

876
00:45:58.111 --> 00:46:00.940
<v Speaker 2>and Mexico because people don't realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you take,</v>

877
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 2>when you get one of them jobs like</v>
<v Speaker 2>president or governor,</v>

878
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 2>your freedom leaves that day.</v>

879
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.930
<v Speaker 2>You don't have freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're 24 slash seven,</v>

880
00:46:09.931 --> 00:46:14.931
<v Speaker 2>your body at 24 slash seven every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no freedom whatsoever.</v>

881
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't go in 100 percent on that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt that if I,</v>

882
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.820
<v Speaker 2>if I to go for president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be 100 percent committed to</v>

883
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:25.770
<v Speaker 2>do the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not,</v>

884
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 2>you're cheating yourself and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating all the people that voted for</v>

885
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:31.560
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not 100 percent committed,</v>

886
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I could not reach 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I chose not to.</v>

887
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.370
<v Speaker 2>So is this because of your own personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings about living in Mexico and</v>

888
00:46:38.371 --> 00:46:43.371
<v Speaker 2>having freedom and relaxation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoying the quality of life and also I</v>

889
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Speaker 2>knew what would happen to me if I looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was going to win,</v>

890
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:53.220
<v Speaker 2>I would be politically assassinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would pull up everything they could</v>

891
00:46:53.221 --> 00:46:54.410
<v Speaker 2>on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

892
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.750
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they missed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I laugh about today when I ran for</v>

893
00:46:57.751 --> 00:47:00.150
<v Speaker 2>governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never found it out and I've</v>

894
00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 2>admitted it so it'll show up now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they never found out because I'm</v>

895
00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:07.320
<v Speaker 2>sure they would have tried to use it</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's irrelevant.</v>

896
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:09.300
<v Speaker 2>If I'd had gone for president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have,</v>

897
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:14.900
<v Speaker 2>you know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I used to be sergeant at arms of the</v>

898

<v Speaker 3>occasionally.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like what did you guys do at that time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 1973.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I rode harleys and I was still in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>navy.</v>

938
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:57.190

<v Speaker 3>happen in the navy and the army,</v>

939
00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:02.140
<v Speaker 3>like the elks and the Moose Club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in my day a lot of the outlaw bikers</v>

940
00:49:02.141 --> 00:49:03.670
<v Speaker 3>were former military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Brotherhood if you wanted.</v>

943
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Felt disenfranchised.</v>

944
00:49:12.641 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it more for the adventure I was</v>

945
00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:18.430
<v Speaker 3>getting out of the seals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd done two tours,</v>

946
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.640
<v Speaker 3>a 17 months in southeast Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to transition into private</v>

947
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:25.390
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was riding a Harley,</v>

948
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.360
<v Speaker 3>my two buddies that I'd written with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year earlier.</v>

949
00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:31.870
<v Speaker 3>We're now full patch Mongols when I came</v>
<v Speaker 3>back from my second deployment.</v>

950
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me pretend to be a douchebag</v>

951
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.120
<v Speaker 3>politician running against you here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

952
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I would say are you really prepared to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a former sergeant of arms from the</v>

953
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.620
<v Speaker 3>Mongols Motorcycle club running the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States of America?</v>

954
00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:49.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

955
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.430
<v Speaker 3>And I would counter that and say nobody</v>
<v Speaker 3>messes with the Mongols.</v>

956
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 3>Nobody will mess with the US.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why did they call you superman?</v>

1004
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:46.850

<v Speaker 2>out of the shields into civilian life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact if there's a good transition</v>

00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:06.371
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you about that shows how a</v>
<v Speaker 2>book should do due diligence before they</v>

1011
00:52:07.311 --> 00:52:10.880
<v Speaker 2>write something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a book written by William</v>

1012
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Queen and atf agent who infiltrated the</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's called under in the loan and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>infiltrated them and put like 25 of them</v>

1014
00:52:19.671 --> 00:52:21.080
<v Speaker 2>in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1015
00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:25.280
<v Speaker 2>in the book they wrote that I was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>former Mongol governor,</v>

1016
00:52:25.281 --> 00:52:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Jesse Ventura,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blahblahblahblahblah Blah.</v>

1017
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1018
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.120
<v Speaker 2>You know what they did before the book</v>
<v Speaker 2>was published,</v>

1019
00:52:31.121 --> 00:52:34.100
<v Speaker 2>a sent me an entire copy of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should.</v>

1020
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please read this and if you have any</v>

1021
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:37.700
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call us.</v>

1022
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read the book.</v>

1023
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:42.080
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hide from the fact that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Mongols.</v>

1024
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I never do a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I did want them to change something</v>

1025
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 2>and they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I called them,</v>

1026
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stated the history of the Mongols</v>

1027
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:56.441
<v Speaker 2>that we started off like all white</v>
<v Speaker 2>supremist outlaw motorcycle clubs.</v>

1028
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never join anything that was</v>

1029
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:02.720
<v Speaker 2>white supremist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to me,</v>

1030
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:07.010
<v Speaker 2>a biker is a lifestyle and the color of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your skin has nothing to do with it.</v>

1031
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Mongols were not white</v>

1032
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 2>supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said to me,</v>

1033
00:53:12.351 --> 00:53:13.184
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governor,</v>

1034
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 2>how can you prove that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started laughing.</v>

1035
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.350
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I can prove it easily.</v>

1036
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:20.900
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me their stay editor at random</v>

1037
00:53:20.901 --> 00:53:22.430
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1038
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 2>at what time did Mexicans become white</v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacy?</v>

1039
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Because I said the Mongols are 75</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent Latino,</v>

1040
00:53:28.951 --> 00:53:29.784
<v Speaker 2>Mexican.</v>

1041
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the few white guys who</v>
<v Speaker 2>could ride into east la and never be</v>

1042
00:53:34.531 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 2>bothered because of my patch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1043
00:53:38.581 --> 00:53:41.250
<v Speaker 2>so how can you call us what the Mongols</v>
<v Speaker 2>started?</v>

1044
00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Because they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans weren't allowed in the hell's</v>

1045
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 2>angels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1046
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:49.890
<v Speaker 2>I sold like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Mongols were the Mexican bikers</v>

1047
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 2>started their own bike club because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't allowed to be angels.</v>

1048
00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Will they allow white guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how did they miss that in writing</v>

1049
00:53:58.441 --> 00:54:02.340
<v Speaker 2>the book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems stupid that it's any better,</v>

1050
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.160
<v Speaker 2>but that seems like a giant error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1051
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:09.430
<v Speaker 2>That's why I had them pull out white</v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacy.</v>

1052
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she started laughing when I said,</v>

1053
00:54:11.731 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met a Mexican white</v>

1054
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:15.120
<v Speaker 2>supremacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you?</v>

1055
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.381
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1056
00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I haven't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1057
00:54:17.971 --> 00:54:20.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're 75 percent Latino Mexican.</v>

1058
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.171
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1059
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I gave her the history.</v>

1060
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 2>The Mongols started because the hell's</v>
<v Speaker 2>angels wouldn't allow Mexicans.</v>

1061
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.420
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how the Mongols got started</v>

1062
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.480
<v Speaker 2>in 1970 because they're 75 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latino Mexican,</v>

1063
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:41.040
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be white,</v>

1064
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a minority in the Mongols to know.</v>

1065
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Was there crime involved in the Mongols?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1066
00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:51.360
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I told them I was still in the navy</v>

1067
00:54:51.361 --> 00:54:54.450
<v Speaker 2>and they used to protect me whenever</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd have church,</v>

1068
00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.130
<v Speaker 2>trash churches meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it church and whenever we'd</v>

1069
00:54:59.131 --> 00:55:00.470
<v Speaker 2>have church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1070
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.540
<v Speaker 2>if it got to anything that was at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal,</v>

1071
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.510
<v Speaker 2>my pres would send me out to watch the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bikes.</v>

1072
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.000
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1073
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:09.720
<v Speaker 2>they knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1074
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.300
<v Speaker 2>they knew I was in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:55:11.301 --> 00:55:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doubles are too,</v>

1076
00:55:12.571 --> 00:55:14.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd faced double.</v>

1077
00:55:14.641 --> 00:55:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I'd face military justice as well as</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilian.</v>

1078
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:20.790
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these guys are old military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did it to protect me.</v>

1079
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But didn't feel bizarre to you to be a</v>

1080
00:55:24.181 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 2>part of a group that was probably doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>some illegal shit.</v>

1081
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I thought at least I won't go to</v>

1082
00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:30.024
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

1083
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Not Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know nothing about it</v>

1084
00:55:34.111 --> 00:55:36.630
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love them no matter what I loved</v>

1085
00:55:36.631 --> 00:55:38.700
<v Speaker 2>riding are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should see what I'd get pulled over.</v>

1086
00:55:38.701 --> 00:55:43.200
<v Speaker 2>We get pulled over by the CHP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California highway patrol back then and</v>

1087
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd pull out my active duty military id</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'd look at me.</v>

1088
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 2>And what are you doing with these guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said they liked to ride bikes.</v>

1089
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 2>So do I can't just ride a bike by</v>
<v Speaker 2>herself?</v>

1090
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:55.740
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1091
00:55:55.741 --> 00:56:00.370
<v Speaker 2>because cars have no respect for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're right by your writing.</v>

1092
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:04.170
<v Speaker 2>If you're riding and looking like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed what they're up on the screen a</v>

1093
00:56:04.171 --> 00:56:07.110
<v Speaker 2>little while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think the cars are going to bother</v>

1094
00:56:07.111 --> 00:56:08.340
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get the fuck out of</v>

1095
00:56:08.341 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 2>your way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>

1096
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

1097
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1101
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:23.100

<v Speaker 2>and it turned out there's not one harley</v>

<v Speaker 2>curiosity and gears.</v>

1112
00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.140
<v Speaker 2>It turned out when I built the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>chopper in the end,</v>

1113
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't one thing Harley on it.</v>

1115
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I put the old sissy bar that goes way</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That seems logical.</v>

1123
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.970
<v Speaker 2>These guys know I don't go that high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't extended front end.</v>

1124
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.310

<v Speaker 2>With the up up high handlebars be cool,</v>

1125
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 2>but you can't steer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>outline,</v>

1128
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.540
<v Speaker 2>not to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And through us,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1131
00:57:42.431 --> 00:57:44.680
<v Speaker 2>But you're a bunch of things like sissy</v>
<v Speaker 2>bars,</v>

1132
00:57:44.681 --> 00:57:46.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't have them today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys who built the bike didn't even</v>

1133
00:57:46.781 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 2>know what they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the sissy bar?</v>

1134
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the bar that sticks up high in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back.</v>

1135
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1136
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1137
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.200
<v Speaker 2>They call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't slide off the seats.</v>

1138
00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:00.090
<v Speaker 2>But she to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like saddlebags shore Sushi</v>

1139
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 2>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The replacement.</v>

1140
00:58:01.241 --> 00:58:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bungee anything I need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take with me on the Sissy Bar,</v>

1141
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:09.481
<v Speaker 2>like the sleeping bag and anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're taking a bungee it to the sissy</v>

1142
00:58:09.581 --> 00:58:12.470
<v Speaker 2>bar for when you drive down the road</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't dig saddlebags.</v>

1143
00:58:12.471 --> 00:58:14.500
<v Speaker 2>So you'll drive down the road to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>camping somewhere?</v>

1144
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:15.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote,</v>

1145
00:58:15.791 --> 00:58:17.830
<v Speaker 2>actually I rode when I got out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

1146
00:58:17.831 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I wrote all over Minnesota fly in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>colors and no one even recognize me.</v>

1147
00:58:21.701 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why I went to a place I had a full beard</v>

1148
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:30.481
<v Speaker 2>after I taught at Harvard and so Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depp had come out and in Captain Jack</v>

1149
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Sparrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to a place with a pitcher and</v>

1150
00:58:33.881 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you make my beard look like that?</v>

1151
00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:36.641
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1152
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:39.010
<v Speaker 2>So they braided my preamble when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing that.</v>

1153
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:39.970
<v Speaker 2>All the braids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1154
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 2>But then they talked me into letting me</v>
<v Speaker 2>put dreadlocks.</v>

1155
00:58:43.181 --> 00:58:47.650
<v Speaker 2>They sold them into my hair and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>dyed my hair jet black.</v>

1156
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I had dreadlocks to hear the thing like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1157
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I rode one year after I was out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

1158
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I drove all over Minnesota with</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreadlocks to my shoulders.</v>

1159
00:58:58.631 --> 00:59:00.910
<v Speaker 2>The beard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no helmet because we don't have a</v>

1160
00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:04.480
<v Speaker 2>helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Law and people were locking their doors.</v>

1161
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:07.120
<v Speaker 2>I had my Mongo colors on and here I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>the governor.</v>

1162
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never recognized as so never recovered</v>

1163
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.370
<v Speaker 2>because I had dreadlocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave me all the way to the</v>

1164
00:59:15.371 --> 00:59:17.500
<v Speaker 2>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now why are you riding around with no</v>

1165
00:59:17.501 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 2>helmet on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1166
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't have to in Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1167
00:59:20.901 --> 00:59:22.640
<v Speaker 2>but why wouldn't you want to protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head?</v>

1168
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like helmets.</v>

1169
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should be mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think something far more.</v>

1170
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:28.970
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laugh at what?</v>

1171
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 2>When you see someone wearing a helmet</v>
<v Speaker 2>and riding a bike with tennis shoes,</v>

1172
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:39.130
<v Speaker 2>it's far more important to have over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ankle boots as a biker than a helmet</v>

1173
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.950
<v Speaker 2>wise that you feet touched the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the.</v>

1174
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:46.250
<v Speaker 2>What's going to stable you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start sliding out your foot,</v>

1175
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want tennis shoes.</v>

1176
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:50.660
<v Speaker 2>You want an over the ankle laced up</v>
<v Speaker 2>boots,</v>

1177
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 2>so your boot or something dump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be able to protect your head.</v>

1178
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

1179
00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a choice of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what about when a little skullcap</v>

1180
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.560
<v Speaker 2>jammies that go like a hat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if?</v>

1181
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.400
<v Speaker 2>What if my head starts itching?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tasers.</v>

1182
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.263
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scratch it.</v>

1183
01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to rub the helmet.</v>

1184
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 2>That's why when you see a biker rubbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>his helmet,</v>

1185
01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:13.470
<v Speaker 2>it's because his head's itch and what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just look at me,</v>

1186
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 2>put it to worry about an itch.</v>

1187
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll accept helmets on motorcycles when</v>

1188
01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:22.880
<v Speaker 2>they make people in convertibles that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have roll bars.</v>

1189
01:00:22.881 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Have to wear them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a convertible.</v>

1190
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:27.470
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you should have to wear a helmet.</v>

1191
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:30.350
<v Speaker 2>It's good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you roll that car and you don't</v>

1192
01:00:30.351 --> 01:00:32.450
<v Speaker 2>have a helmet on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good point.</v>

1193
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:33.970
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about skills.</v>

1194
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:38.200
<v Speaker 2>So the day that you got to have a roll</v>
<v Speaker 2>bar is the day I'll put the helmet.</v>

1195
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.310
<v Speaker 2>All right buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relax.</v>

1196
01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:44.150
<v Speaker 2>And I can't wait to see these women in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beverly Hills with their convertible</v>

1197
01:00:44.151 --> 01:00:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes having to put helmets on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well those actually have roll bars built</v>

1198
01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:50.170
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pop up on one wheel,</v>

1199
01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 2>goes off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you know about that.</v>

1200
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.660
<v Speaker 2>German engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1201
01:00:53.661 --> 01:00:54.650
<v Speaker 2>they're very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're on the ball.</v>

1202
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Well I owned Porsche portion on Abbott.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean portia doesn't have it?</v>

1203
01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 2>What year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a 2000 and a 2003.</v>

1204
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:03.780
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a nine,</v>

1205
01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six?</v>

1206
01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:05.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1207
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:08.360
<v Speaker 2>well I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a boxster s and I have the twin</v>

1208

<v Speaker 2>turbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1209
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Well that should have that built in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should have it.</v>

1210
01:01:12.321 --> 01:01:14.660
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm a hard worker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hard top though.</v>

1211
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm a boxster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know the twin turbos a hard top.</v>

1212
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:18.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1213
01:01:18.861 --> 01:01:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't have a roll bar.</v>

1214
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The boxer,</v>

1216
01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:24.770

1217
01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because anything.</v>

1218
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I think anything past the nineties</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a convertible has some sort of a</v>

1219
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:33.660
<v Speaker 2>built in Rollbar or some sort of report</v>
<v Speaker 2>or seen it?</v>

1220
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you haven't flipped it,</v>

1221
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.520
<v Speaker 2>but the new ones that I'm getting rid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1222
01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm buying a tesla.</v>

1223
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting crazy.</v>

1224
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Go into Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Test drove a tesla.</v>

1225
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1226
01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:46.110
<v Speaker 2>they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1227
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I and I want to feel young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a computer driven car.</v>

1228
01:01:49.611 --> 01:01:51.530
<v Speaker 2>No gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes you feel young.</v>

1229
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I grew up in the sixties with</v>

1230
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:59.090
<v Speaker 2>all the muscle cars and I never dreamed</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be electric cars that can beat</v>

1231
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:03.770
<v Speaker 2>any combustible engine out there off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>line because the Tesla can beat</v>

1232
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:05.180
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>

1233
01:02:05.181 --> 01:02:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1234
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:10.700
<v Speaker 2>my twin turbo professionally driven will</v>
<v Speaker 2>do zero to 60 in two nine.</v>

1235
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 2>The Tesla does it into six</v>
<v Speaker 2>unprofessionally driven.</v>

1236
01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1237
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 2>they're ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculously fast.</v>

1238
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called,</v>

1239
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.730
<v Speaker 2>you know what they call?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the ludicrous option.</v>

1240
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Took it right out of spaceballs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1241
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's got a sense of humor.</v>

1242
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 2>He definitely does the ludicrous option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1243
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I and see I'm going to do my house in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota,</v>

1244
01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:35.841
<v Speaker 2>totally solar and I'm going to do it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's 105 percent so that way I can</v>

1245
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:41.721
<v Speaker 2>also feel my car's up off the sun so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be completely off any type in my</v>

1246
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:47.970
<v Speaker 2>home or my cars will all be powered in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico and Minnesota by the sun.</v>

1247
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 2>That's excluding my cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

1248
01:02:49.981 --> 01:02:51.480
<v Speaker 2>As long as you don't have to go on a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>road trip,</v>

1249
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:55.260
<v Speaker 2>they now have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all computerized to where you can</v>

1250
01:02:55.261 --> 01:02:59.250
<v Speaker 2>show where you can charge up again and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting 300 miles now to</v>

1251
01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:01.860
<v Speaker 2>recharge and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else is great about the Tesla?</v>

1252
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends how you drive.</v>

1253
01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else is great.</v>

1254
01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Is there a warranty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight years,</v>

1255
01:03:07.321 --> 01:03:10.470
<v Speaker 2>unlimited mileage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in that eight year period,</v>

1256
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:15.240
<v Speaker 2>any improvements made to the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get free upgrades like digital</v>

1257
01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:17.880
<v Speaker 2>upgrades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that's amazing for eight years,</v>

1258
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.370
<v Speaker 2>so eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could own the Tesla for eight years</v>

1259
01:03:20.371 --> 01:03:24.150
<v Speaker 2>and some doing an ad for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could own a Tesla for eight years</v>

1260
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.810
<v Speaker 2>and the car you own eight years from now</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be identical to whatever they're</v>

1261
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:29.010
<v Speaker 2>selling new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1262
01:03:29.011 --> 01:03:31.740
<v Speaker 2>I drove one for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a a.</v>

1263
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.360
<v Speaker 2>What does that fucking company called?</v>

1264
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:34.141
<v Speaker 2>Skirt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1265
01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:37.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called skirt and they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a uber for rentals.</v>

1266
01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:40.170
<v Speaker 2>They deliver a rental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You drive for a day or what?</v>

1267
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.960
<v Speaker 2>As long as you need it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my issue was at the battery.</v>

1268
01:03:42.961 --> 01:03:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Just ran out way too quick for me for</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do.</v>

1269
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.500
<v Speaker 2>I just do too many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me.</v>

1270
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:50.550
<v Speaker 2>It ain't because I live in Minnesota and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never drive over 100 miles in a day.</v>

1271
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golf course and that far right.</v>

1272
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for me in my lab,</v>

1273
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:58.860
<v Speaker 2>65 now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to be trapped.</v>

1274
01:03:58.861 --> 01:04:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know something that'll shock you?</v>

1275
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I've never owned a cell phone and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>never will.</v>

1276
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I was going to text you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1277
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.210
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a cell phone.</v>

1278
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I've never given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a cell phone for what?</v>

1279
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:14.220
<v Speaker 2>I like talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding?</v>

1280
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I was out in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out in New York doing this book</v>

1281
01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:22.350
<v Speaker 2>tour and I forget I was at serious and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in the green room and there were</v>

1282
01:04:22.351 --> 01:04:27.210
<v Speaker 2>10 people in that green room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine of the 10 sat there the whole time</v>

1283
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>doing things with a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1284
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I was the only one who sat and looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the room and watched nine other</v>

1285
01:04:34.951 --> 01:04:39.951
<v Speaker 2>people zeroed in on a screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if you count TV and that what we</v>

1286
01:04:41.581 --> 01:04:44.820
<v Speaker 2>spending 16 hours a day now looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>screens,</v>

1287
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I believe in evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that going to lead to?</v>

1288
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.020
<v Speaker 2>It's going to lead to some strange times</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1289
01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>But a strange people to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wouldn't you rather just have it and</v>

1290
01:04:54.421 --> 01:04:56.250
<v Speaker 2>have the discipline and not use it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1291
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fiber one.</v>

1292
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I never took typing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm going to send anything it'll</v>

1293
01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:03.270
<v Speaker 2>take me too long.</v>

1294
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 2>The thumbs when I taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I taught at Harvard,</v>

1295
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually sent my only email there to a</v>

1296
01:05:10.861 --> 01:05:13.330
<v Speaker 2>student because on email he will always</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie.</v>

1297
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I send a couple,</v>

1298
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:19.630
<v Speaker 2>but they actually taught me how to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer while I was teaching at Harvard</v>

1299
01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:23.920
<v Speaker 2>in my office and I actually students</v>
<v Speaker 2>would want to talk to me so I'd have to</v>

1300
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:28.921
<v Speaker 2>line up a schedule and I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent an email to a student or I told</v>

1301
01:05:29.081 --> 01:05:32.740
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the first email Jesse Ventura's</v>

1302
01:05:32.741 --> 01:05:36.670
<v Speaker 2>ever sent in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do with it as you see fit?</v>

1303
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll Betcha the students still got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing that I have the first email.</v>

1304
01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Jesse Ventura ever sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I left Harvard.</v>

1305
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.270
<v Speaker 2>There went the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it since.</v>

1306
01:05:48.271 --> 01:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife does.</v>

1307
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She does all that.</v>

1308
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably one of the main</v>

1309
01:05:55.511 --> 01:05:57.520
<v Speaker 2>reasons why this whole Chris Kyle thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>blew up.</v>

1310
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.770
<v Speaker 2>And you had no idea about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Mexico.</v>

1311
01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.420
<v Speaker 2>In Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any internet?</v>

1312
01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:02.890
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have Internet there.</v>

1313
01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I learned.</v>

1314
01:06:04.181 --> 01:06:07.180
<v Speaker 2>My son sent me an email telling me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>

1315
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.650
<v Speaker 2>So you had an email?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1316
01:06:08.651 --> 01:06:12.640
<v Speaker 2>and I have skype so I had to end up</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting through that satellite.</v>

1317
01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I had to get my attorney to file the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit immediately to stop him from</v>

1318
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:19.490
<v Speaker 2>from this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he.</v>

1319
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.150
<v Speaker 2>They continued promoting it for another</v>
<v Speaker 2>six months.</v>

1320
01:06:22.151 --> 01:06:24.670
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how bad the book company did.</v>

1321
01:06:24.671 --> 01:06:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Harper Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the same company that owns Fox</v>

1322
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:30.040
<v Speaker 2>News,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all under the same umbrella.</v>

1323
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Harper Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you would have typed my name and on</v>

1324
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:36.550
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have immediately sent you to the</v>

1325
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Chris Kyle Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did that to sell more books.</v>

1326
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the conspiracy that I went against</v>

1327
01:06:44.981 --> 01:06:46.900
<v Speaker 2>in this deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I got to go through it again.</v>

1328
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so long ago.</v>

1329
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy that it's still going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1330
01:06:50.411 --> 01:06:51.730
<v Speaker 2>this is 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1331
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened in 2012 and it's now 2016.</v>

1332
01:06:56.081 --> 01:06:58.850
<v Speaker 2>It's over four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be.</v>

1333
01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:03.370
<v Speaker 2>It'll be five years in January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you stay calm and all this does.</v>

1334
01:07:03.371 --> 01:07:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Is it this stress lessened at all or no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the consequences for you?</v>

1335
01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:12.691
<v Speaker 2>If you lose a financially it's cost me</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a million dollars.</v>

1336
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's while I'm the plaintiff.</v>

1337
01:07:16.841 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 2>No one pays for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cost me over a million dollars for</v>

1338
01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:25.480
<v Speaker 2>years of attorney fees and the courts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything that's gone with it.</v>

1339
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:27.730
<v Speaker 2>It's cost me a million dollars to clear</v>
<v Speaker 2>my name.</v>

1340
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had done this,</v>

1341
01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:33.460
<v Speaker 2>why would I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never happened.</v>

1342
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Why would I spend a million dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 2>court clearing my name has over time</v>

1343
01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:43.900
<v Speaker 2>when more information has come out about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other things that he said that</v>

1344
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:44.920
<v Speaker 2>turned out to not be true.</v>

1345
01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Has Public opinion started to shift</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards your way?</v>

1346
01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:50.350
<v Speaker 2>It has now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone has to somewhat,</v>

1347
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:54.820
<v Speaker 2>but you still have these people who will</v>
<v Speaker 2>accost me in hotels had happened in</v>

1348
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Mexico to what happened when a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>came up to me in a hotel lobby and read</v>

1349
01:07:59.411 --> 01:08:01.540
<v Speaker 2>me off and what do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

1350
01:08:01.541 --> 01:08:05.620
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't do it and all I'm doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeking the truth.</v>

1351
01:08:05.621 --> 01:08:08.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't keep it going after the</v>

1352
01:08:08.111 --> 01:08:09.690
<v Speaker 2>family says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1353
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:13.360
<v Speaker 2>they think I'm going after the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the family isn't going to lose a</v>

1354
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:16.910
<v Speaker 2>nickel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big insurance that I'm fighting</v>

1355
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:19.200
<v Speaker 2>hired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody knows this,</v>

1356
01:08:19.201 --> 01:08:23.900
<v Speaker 2>this read a Britain a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in your contract it states if</v>

1357
01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>any lawsuits come of this nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the publisher will handle it.</v>

1358
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The publisher handles it,</v>

1359
01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>but there is there any consequences to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the family where they don't profit as</v>

1360
01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:34.250
<v Speaker 2>much because of the fact there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit.</v>

1361
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.590
<v Speaker 2>The lawsuit cuts back in the profits for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book and the movie?</v>

1362
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:39.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the insurance company will pay</v>

1363
01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:42.950
<v Speaker 2>the whole lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me where they hire and they</v>

1364
01:08:42.951 --> 01:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>hire them before the books ever even</v>
<v Speaker 2>written errors and omissions,</v>

1365
01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:47.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1366
01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.393
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1367
01:08:48.610 --> 01:08:52.340
<v Speaker 2>and show no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't affect an anything in the</v>

1368
01:08:52.341 --> 01:08:56.580
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit itself won't effect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>popularity of the book unless unless</v>

1369
01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.980
<v Speaker 2>they find out he was a liar and don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose to read his book because I've</v>

1370
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 2>never read his book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would I?</v>

1371
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:07.280
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a lie about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could I believe anything else in it?</v>

1372
01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:11.310
<v Speaker 2>What a terrible position to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1373
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just innocent,</v>

1374
01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:19.421
<v Speaker 2>but you are either respected celebrity</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his sixties in this happens.</v>

1375
01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:23.240
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a crazy feeling.</v>

1376
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you didn't do nothing.</v>

1377
01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:27.110
<v Speaker 2>What else could you have done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1378
01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.870
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you have to go to court</v>
<v Speaker 2>over this.</v>

1379
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was such an iconic movie and such an</v>

1380
01:09:33.951 --> 01:09:36.050
<v Speaker 2>iconic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever talked to Bradley Cooper?</v>

1381
01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hold nothing against him.</v>

1382
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Of course he shouldn't have hector doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a job.</v>

1383
01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Now you know my friend directed at Clint</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eastwood.</v>

1384
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 2>He's a friend of mine in Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did you talk to clint?</v>

1385
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:50.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1386
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:53.510
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is so fucked up.</v>

1387
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:58.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just so crazy that you sat across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the table from this guy and he tells you</v>

1388
01:09:58.071 --> 01:09:58.850
<v Speaker 2>he did it.</v>

1389
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:00.190
<v Speaker 2>He tells you I did punch you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1390
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.220
<v Speaker 2>And I know he didn't and I know he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the courage to face up to</v>

1391
01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:06.680
<v Speaker 2>the truth or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or mental capability of him.</v>

1392
01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't let him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>

1393
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something wrong.</v>

1394
01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Some fuse blown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

1395
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why would you take one of your own</v>

1396
01:10:15.831 --> 01:10:19.100
<v Speaker 2>and throw them under the bus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would be like me doing it to a World War</v>

1397
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.510
<v Speaker 2>II guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking crazy,</v>

1398
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially I like to tell people,</v>

1399
01:10:23.361 --> 01:10:25.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember us Vietnam veterans,</v>

1400
01:10:25.941 --> 01:10:29.420
<v Speaker 2>we weren't cheered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got blamed for the war in which is a</v>

1401
01:10:29.421 --> 01:10:31.340
<v Speaker 2>big part of what the hell's angels was</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about.</v>

1402
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Trying to find comradery in another</v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

1403
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.910
<v Speaker 2>but we got blamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The politicians blamed us for the war</v>

1404
01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.670
<v Speaker 2>and the public sentiment here in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1405
01:10:40.671 --> 01:10:45.671
<v Speaker 2>At that time we were baby killers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were all these horrible vial you guys</v>

1406
01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 2>got spit on when they came home and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the first time in history in the</v>

1407
01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>United States history that veterans came</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and were treated that way.</v>

1408
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Whereas every guy will tell you this for</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years I didn't even acknowledge I was</v>

1409
01:10:59.991 --> 01:11:00.980
<v Speaker 2>a Vietnam vet.</v>

1410
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.293
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1411
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Because you didn't even acknowledge it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wanted to know you were.</v>

1412
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Nobody said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome home to you.</v>

1413
01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1414
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.980
<v Speaker 2>These IRAC guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get parades for them.</v>

1415
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:20.810
<v Speaker 4>So interesting because it seems like in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sense they got that right.</v>

1416
01:11:20.811 --> 01:11:23.900
<v Speaker 4>At least at least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like the way the Vietnam</v>

1417
01:11:23.901 --> 01:11:26.430
<v Speaker 4>veterans were treated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this,</v>

1418
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.630
<v Speaker 4>this fucking story just doesn't sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>right with me.</v>

1419
01:11:29.631 --> 01:11:32.570
<v Speaker 4>It's just horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so uncomfortable.</v>

1420
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:37.130
<v Speaker 4>It's so uncomfortable because how would</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like to have lived it for five years</v>

1421
01:11:37.131 --> 01:11:38.780
<v Speaker 4>like I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't imagine,</v>

1422
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:44.110
<v Speaker 4>but what's so uncomfortable about it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I feel like the sentiment behind</v>

1423
01:11:44.961 --> 01:11:49.310
<v Speaker 4>the movie and the public's perception of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie and the public's,</v>

1424
01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:54.380
<v Speaker 4>the public's love and gratitude towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and the rest of the military was to</v>

1425
01:11:54.381 --> 01:11:57.920
<v Speaker 4>me like a a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an amazing moment in a lot of ways.</v>

1426
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:01.260
<v Speaker 4>It's like people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People wanted to let me get.</v>

1427
01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you a different perspective</v>

1428
01:12:04.481 --> 01:12:05.470
<v Speaker 2>for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1429
01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I talked about this on my internet show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's more powerful?</v>

1430
01:12:09.881 --> 01:12:13.940
<v Speaker 2>God or government?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A government.</v>

1431
01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:15.670
<v Speaker 2>You want to know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1432
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:18.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God says something very simple.</v>

1433
01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Thous shalt not kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no asterisks by it.</v>

1434
01:12:23.601 --> 01:12:26.120
<v Speaker 2>There's no except for this reason or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that reason.</v>

1435
01:12:26.121 --> 01:12:28.370
<v Speaker 2>It's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thou shalt not kill,</v>

1436
01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:33.320
<v Speaker 2>but yet you can kill at the behest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and it's okay.</v>

1437
01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super complicated.</v>

1438
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1439
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.030
<v Speaker 2>and if and if you kill a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the behest of government,</v>

1440
01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.640
<v Speaker 2>they make you a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet God says,</v>

1441
01:12:46.641 --> 01:12:48.950
<v Speaker 2>thou shalt not kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had a fight,</v>

1442
01:12:48.951 --> 01:12:52.340
<v Speaker 2>kill a lot of people for the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hero.</v>

1443
01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.690
<v Speaker 2>How can that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could there be a double standard</v>

1444
01:12:56.691 --> 01:13:01.280
<v Speaker 2>like that that swallowed shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely that governments more</v>

1445
01:13:01.281 --> 01:13:06.110
<v Speaker 2>powerful than God because government</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows you to kill when God says you</v>

1446
01:13:06.111 --> 01:13:10.940
<v Speaker 2>can't and government rewards you for it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make gives you hero status for it</v>

1447
01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.610
<v Speaker 2>and God doesn't do anything about it.</v>

1448
01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:18.760
<v Speaker 4>It is pretty complicated thinking when</v>
<v Speaker 4>God is a big part of the military.</v>

1449
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:24.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean when the nine slash 11 happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the nine slash 11 attacks happened</v>

1450
01:13:24.131 --> 01:13:28.750
<v Speaker 4>and George Bush on television said that</v>
<v Speaker 4>God is with the troops.</v>

1451
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean the worst thing I ever heard him</v>
<v Speaker 2>say when he was trumping up the Iraq</v>

1452
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.140
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget it because I opposed</v>

1453
01:13:37.141 --> 01:13:38.940
<v Speaker 2>the Iraq war before it even app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1454
01:13:38.941 --> 01:13:41.970
<v Speaker 2>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and have nothing to do with nine</v>

1455
01:13:41.971 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 2>slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we invading Iraq?</v>

1456
01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget bushes.</v>

1457
01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Press conference where he walked out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>announced that he was sending in our</v>

1458
01:13:51.871 --> 01:13:55.440
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to attack Iraq and he was</v>

1459
01:13:55.441 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to leave the stage and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>final reporter asked him,</v>

1460
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Mr President,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you consult your father?</v>

1461
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Meaning Bush senior because you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush Sr had that Kuwait Iraq thing</v>

1462
01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:10.860
<v Speaker 2>happened during his watch and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

1463
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:16.230
<v Speaker 2>George Bush turning around to the press</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the American people smiling and</v>

1464
01:14:17.201 --> 01:14:18.460
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1465
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:23.700
<v Speaker 2>I consulted a higher father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting in my chair at home and</v>

1466
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:26.440
<v Speaker 2>almost fell out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1467
01:14:26.441 --> 01:14:31.441
<v Speaker 2>this guy wants me to believe that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to God and God told him to invade</v>

1468
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:34.234
<v Speaker 2>Iraq.</v>

1469
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.540
<v Speaker 2>You're saying you consulted a higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher father.</v>

1470
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:42.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like going up to a rock and in Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you should do with your life,</v>

1471
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:44.260
<v Speaker 2>like you're not getting any answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but excuse me,</v>

1472
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 2>and then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on the earth as long as this</v>

1473
01:14:47.111 --> 01:14:49.960
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm twice the man George Bushes and God</v>

1474
01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 2>ain't never said a word to me in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire existence.</v>

1475
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Yet this guy wants me to believe God</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks to him.</v>

1476
01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just let that go and just say,</v>

1477
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:02.290
<v Speaker 2>just talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let that slide.</v>

1478
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:06.240
<v Speaker 2>He consulted God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He consulted a higher father there,</v>

1479
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:07.720
<v Speaker 2>be right back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in other words,</v>

1480
01:15:07.721 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants us to believe that his invasion</v>

1481
01:15:11.111 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 2>of Iraq had God's blessing and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people of this country,</v>

1482
01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:20.020
<v Speaker 2>except that it's one of those convenient</v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledgements and Jesse Ventura can</v>

1483
01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:22.060
<v Speaker 2>say it because I've come out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>closet.</v>

1484
01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.370
<v Speaker 2>You've come out of the closet for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an atheist.</v>

1485
01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:31.430
<v Speaker 2>You're an atheist in that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe I don't believe in higher.</v>

1486
01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:35.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ain't selling me on that.</v>

1487
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you tell the possibility of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening when you die?</v>

1488
01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if he die.</v>

1489
01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:43.980
<v Speaker 2>You just go dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's a wrap.</v>

1490
01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.530
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1491
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.070
<v Speaker 2>There's no proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1492
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Then anything else happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just definitely need proof just to</v>

1493
01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:57.240
<v Speaker 2>belief to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it because like I said,</v>

1494
01:15:57.241 --> 01:16:01.170
<v Speaker 2>I've been on the planet 65 years now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's never spoke to me.</v>

1495
01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Now if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people said,</v>

1496
01:16:03.771 --> 01:16:04.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you're wrong?</v>

1497
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.353
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1498
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.690
<v Speaker 2>God made me with a brain to think did</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1499
01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:12.480
<v Speaker 2>He's going to condemn me because I used</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1500
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion in a sense,</v>

1501
01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:19.330
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that God came to people a long</v>

1502
01:16:19.331 --> 01:16:23.230
<v Speaker 2>fucking time ago when the books and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>told everybody about the world.</v>

1503
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard about water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just pass it down.</v>

1504
01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.060
<v Speaker 2>You know about horror?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1505
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horace was an Egyptian God who has the</v>

1506
01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:34.711
<v Speaker 2>identical same bio is Jesus only</v>
<v Speaker 2>predates and buy a couple hundred years.</v>

1507
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>So who's the real one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did this.</v>

1508
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:41.440
<v Speaker 2>They were both born of a virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both walked on water.</v>

1509
01:16:41.441 --> 01:16:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they both healed the sick.</v>

1510
01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.140
<v Speaker 2>They both were crucified and buried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rose again from the dead.</v>

1511
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Jesus did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so did horace.</v>

1512
01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:55.360
<v Speaker 2>What is a ton of parallels throughout</v>
<v Speaker 2>history and that's my point.</v>

1513
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:57.520
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm not a believer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1514
01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not opposed either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting that ancient people said</v>

1515
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:05.320
<v Speaker 2>about be communicating with higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>powers and passing down laws that must</v>

1516
01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:08.870
<v Speaker 2>be without a doubt followed and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them are ridiculous.</v>

1517
01:17:08.871 --> 01:17:10.090
<v Speaker 2>You can't wear the same tie back.</v>

1518
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.120
<v Speaker 3>Two different types of cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1519
01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 3>you can be put to death for wearing two</v>
<v Speaker 3>different types of cloth.</v>

1520
01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if people know that.</v>

1521
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.200
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of really fucking goofy</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>

1522
01:17:18.201 --> 01:17:21.950
<v Speaker 3>What about the story of who is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentleman in the Bible where he was bald</v>

1523
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 3>and two children mocked him for his</v>
<v Speaker 3>baldness,</v>

1524
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:29.630
<v Speaker 3>so a God sent to bears to attack the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids and more of them and killed them.</v>

1525
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.310
<v Speaker 3>That's in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Old Testament stuff.</v>

1526
01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:34.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make Fun of a bald guy like you and me</v>

1527
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 3>and a fucking bear comes and kills kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are your rights?</v>

1528
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:43.370
<v Speaker 3>What do you find these barriers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to recommend is that I've been</v>

1529
01:17:43.371 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 3>made fun of enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could I have a couple of attack bears?</v>

1530
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Then the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest fund,</v>

1531
01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:52.100
<v Speaker 3>the most ridiculous thing to say and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>put that in the Bible,</v>

1532
01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:57.101
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that two kids can make fun</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you being bald and so God punishes</v>

1533
01:17:57.581 --> 01:17:59.800
<v Speaker 3>those kids by having a fucking bear</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack them.</v>

1534
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:03.100
<v Speaker 3>How about it doesn't bother you if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>bald like,</v>

1535
01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of a pussy.</v>

1536
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Are you taunting you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about the fact that they tell you</v>

1537
01:18:07.701 --> 01:18:11.270
<v Speaker 3>that the world's only 5,000 years old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 10 or 10,</v>

1538
01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:12.110
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

1539
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:13.490
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell it is.</v>

1540
01:18:13.491 --> 01:18:16.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't keep track of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean how ridiculous is that?</v>

1541
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:18.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've done it very scientifically than</v>

1542
01:18:18.821 --> 01:18:21.530
<v Speaker 3>counted up all the ages of all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the Bible.</v>

1543
01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:23.360
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know how you are arguing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1544
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:30.350
<v Speaker 3>They're very accurate book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious to that.</v>

1545
01:18:30.351 --> 01:18:30.921
<v Speaker 3>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1546
01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:33.350
<v Speaker 3>that's old testament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't follow the Old Testament.</v>

1547
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you want to follow the book that was</v>

1548
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:37.880
<v Speaker 3>written by Constantine and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bishops.</v>

1549
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Not only that constant team wasn't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Christian until he was on his</v>

1550
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.090
<v Speaker 3>deathbed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Constantine converted when he was at</v>

1551
01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:48.170
<v Speaker 3>dying old man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a Christian through his entire</v>

1552
01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.930
<v Speaker 3>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hope for Jesse.</v>

1553
01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Hope for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just follow Constantine when I get</v>

1554
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:56.270
<v Speaker 3>to the dying bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I find out there's God,</v>

1555
01:18:56.271 --> 01:18:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I'll just see the light is hedge your</v>
<v Speaker 3>bets.</v>

1556
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:00.303
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's no,</v>

1557
01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.220
<v Speaker 3>it's like a liquid Danville's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arian would say you can't lose in this</v>

1558
01:19:04.221 --> 01:19:08.330
<v Speaker 3>bet because if you're wrong and there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>no god,</v>

1559
01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:10.970
<v Speaker 3>like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get to the deathbed and you</v>

1560
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.830
<v Speaker 3>convert to Christianity and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

1561
01:19:13.831 --> 01:19:15.670
<v Speaker 3>and there is no god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter anyway.</v>

1562
01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.360
<v Speaker 3>It's all just darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1563
01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:19.100
<v Speaker 3>You just go blank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it kind of.</v>

1564
01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1565
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.760
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like the Republicans and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Democrats.</v>

1566
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:26.780
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda like you filing your taxes</v>
<v Speaker 3>January 28th.</v>

1567
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:29.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his slip in a couple of days.</v>

1568
01:19:29.361 --> 01:19:32.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Republicans and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats was that.</v>

1569
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they vape.</v>

1570
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:39.430
<v Speaker 3>When you go to their conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lobbyists 10 both and they pay off</v>

1571
01:19:39.861 --> 01:19:44.330
<v Speaker 3>both sides show it doesn't matter who</v>
<v Speaker 3>wins the presidency.</v>

1572
01:19:44.331 --> 01:19:47.180
<v Speaker 3>They've already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be the equivalent of betting on the</v>

1573
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.940
<v Speaker 3>superbowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you bet on both teams,</v>

1574
01:19:49.941 --> 01:19:51.110
<v Speaker 3>you don't lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you?</v>

1575
01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1576
01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:55.550
<v Speaker 3>that's what the lobbyists do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bet on both teams.</v>

1577
01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.900
<v Speaker 3>So whether Hillary or trump wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got their base covered.</v>

1578
01:19:59.901 --> 01:20:02.480
<v Speaker 3>It don't matter to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've already paid them off.</v>

1579
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.750
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that really changes</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's right to left,</v>

1580
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 3>is the the aspects</v>

1581
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.580
<v Speaker 2>of society that are affected by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>social changes.</v>

1582
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Like Obama was much more lenient towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage,</v>

1583
01:20:15.271 --> 01:20:19.260
<v Speaker 2>towards a lot of social issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was much more strict on putting</v>

1584
01:20:19.261 --> 01:20:23.430
<v Speaker 2>us under more surveillance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a social issue.</v>

1585
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1586
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:26.730
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it plays out the same way.</v>

1587
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.590
<v Speaker 2>He may have been lenient on certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>social things and then more people are</v>

1588
01:20:31.591 --> 01:20:35.400
<v Speaker 2>now in jail and look what he does to</v>
<v Speaker 2>whistle blow as far as.</v>

1589
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bring destroys them and</v>

1590
01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:43.230
<v Speaker 2>show everybody that syncs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama is kinder to the people on social.</v>

1591
01:20:43.231 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it on,</v>

1592
01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 2>on the surface when you look at his</v>
<v Speaker 2>demeanor and the way he carries himself,</v>

1593
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.360
<v Speaker 2>but then when you look at the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>actions ventral.</v>

1594
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he's the most presidential</v>

1595
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:56.100
<v Speaker 2>president we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll say this,</v>

1596
01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:59.010
<v Speaker 2>he's the most dynamic speaker since Jack</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy.</v>

1597
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:03.130
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's that dynamic more.</v>

1598
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I think Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's kind of beaten down by</v>

1599
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:08.040
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's eight years in now and you've</v>

1600
01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:11.510
<v Speaker 2>heard of long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he is the most dynamic speaker since</v>

1601
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.510
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not.</v>

1602
01:21:12.511 --> 01:21:17.370
<v Speaker 2>The actions don't back the words the</v>
<v Speaker 2>words before he ran,</v>

1603
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.170
<v Speaker 2>when he was running for office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1604
01:21:19.171 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the guy.</v>

1605
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:24.480
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same thing's gonna happen with</v>

1606
01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the women out there that think,</v>

1607
01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:29.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get our first female</v>

1608
01:21:29.071 --> 01:21:29.851
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1609
01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:32.690
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it ain't gonna be nothing different</v>

1610
01:21:33.230 --> 01:21:37.070
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to get the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>government completely because Hillary's</v>

1611
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:41.340
<v Speaker 2>a globalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She supports all the global initiatives.</v>

1612
01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:45.840
<v Speaker 2>She's also for war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The finger troubles me when they attack</v>

1613
01:21:45.841 --> 01:21:47.400
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a trump supporter,</v>

1614
01:21:47.401 --> 01:21:51.180
<v Speaker 2>but hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they claim Hillary as the experience.</v>

1615
01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at it.</v>

1616
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.440
<v Speaker 2>When she was a senator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important vote she took was to</v>

1617
01:21:57.451 --> 01:22:02.451
<v Speaker 2>vote in the affirmative to invade Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She now admits that was her biggest</v>

1618
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:05.310
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>

1619
01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Madam Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the most important vote and you</v>

1620
01:22:09.361 --> 01:22:12.270
<v Speaker 2>blew it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're going to have your finger on</v>

1621
01:22:12.271 --> 01:22:15.090
<v Speaker 2>the button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens if you make the same</v>

1622
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:18.600
<v Speaker 2>mistake that you made with the war on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq,</v>

1623
01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:22.410
<v Speaker 2>which you now admit was the worst vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>you took as a senator?</v>

1624
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Approving the Iraq war and yet she took</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1625
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:28.770
<v Speaker 2>didn't she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She voted to the affirmative.</v>

1626
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to war with Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:34.920
<v Speaker 2>It's very troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The momentum of influence of all these</v>

1628
01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:37.800
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists and special interest groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the money that's behind her.</v>

1629
01:22:37.801 --> 01:22:41.160
<v Speaker 2>All the bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different people that are paying</v>

1630
01:22:41.161 --> 01:22:46.161
<v Speaker 2>her for these $250,000 an hour speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At what point in time do you gather up</v>

1631
01:22:47.311 --> 01:22:50.340
<v Speaker 2>enough money where this doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense anymore when we start thinking</v>

1632
01:22:50.341 --> 01:22:53.490
<v Speaker 2>about your children and your children's</v>
<v Speaker 2>children in the future of the world,</v>

1633
01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.860
<v Speaker 2>or do you think that she thinks she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the right thing?</v>

1634
01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.130
<v Speaker 2>She thinks she's doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the system that that's the system</v>

1635
01:22:59.131 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you have to play within the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system they've created,</v>

1636
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:06.430
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats and Republicans is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>system based upon the concept of</v>

1637
01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 2>bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1638
01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:11.320
<v Speaker 2>if you do bribery in the private sector,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to prison,</v>

1639
01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.440
<v Speaker 2>but in the public sector,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely alive and well.</v>

1640
01:23:14.441 --> 01:23:19.210
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't trust any career</v>
<v Speaker 2>politician because that means they are</v>

1641
01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:23.620
<v Speaker 2>comfortable in a system of bribery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a corrupt system,</v>

1642
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>and if they're comfortable to work in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that corrupt system for all those years,</v>

1643
01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 2>that means they're corrupt too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could when you know you could be the</v>

1644
01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:34.750
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you were one of the few</v>

1645
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:36.880
<v Speaker 2>independents that I know they really</v>
<v Speaker 2>could win.</v>

1646
01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially now.</v>

1647
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:42.580
<v Speaker 2>You see what's going on now with trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the what I call grab the pussy gate.</v>

1648
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 2>If grab the pussy date gate doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking moved up in the polls.</v>

1649
01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.740
<v Speaker 2>He's moved up since the first debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1650
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.030
<v Speaker 2>This is madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're.</v>

1651
01:23:51.031 --> 01:23:53.110
<v Speaker 2>We're dealing with a mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad world right now.</v>

1652
01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're dealing with what I see in the</v>

1653
01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:58.510
<v Speaker 2>United States today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least a faction of it.</v>

1654
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 2>We are going down the identical road of</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 thirties,</v>

1655
01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:04.414
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

1656
01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Look at what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're marginalizing one group of people,</v>

1657
01:24:11.771 --> 01:24:14.890
<v Speaker 2>the Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're responsible for everything bad</v>

1658
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.000
<v Speaker 2>in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1659
01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.660
<v Speaker 2>What did the Germans do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did that with the Jews.</v>

1660
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 2>They got all the other people angry at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jews,</v>

1661
01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:26.920
<v Speaker 2>all the Germans so that they could ride</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything we're doing right now.</v>

1662
01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Parallels 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany to a t.</v>

1663
01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:36.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what's really crazy waging wars</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the world were invading</v>

1664
01:24:36.691 --> 01:24:39.200
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1665
01:24:39.690 --> 01:24:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a poll taken three years</v>

1666
01:24:43.471 --> 01:24:46.710
<v Speaker 2>ago by Gallup and it never got any</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicity here.</v>

1667
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:50.430
<v Speaker 2>International poll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3000 people I think.</v>

1668
01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:53.760
<v Speaker 2>And they pose no Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody from the US.</v>

1669
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And they posed the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your country where to go to war</v>

1670
01:24:57.931 --> 01:25:00.780
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you think it would likely be</v>

1671
01:25:00.781 --> 01:25:05.781
<v Speaker 2>against?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty three percent answered the United</v>

1672
01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:08.790
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight percent answered China.</v>

1673
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Six percent said Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one out of four international people</v>

1674
01:25:14.731 --> 01:25:19.731
<v Speaker 2>believe that if they go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States will be the adversary</v>

1675
01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:21.570
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A veteran.</v>

1676
01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I hang my head in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame over that.</v>

1677
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Brian Jessee run too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

1678
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it too late?</v>

1679
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:32.020
<v Speaker 2>You'll have to wait until 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

1680
01:25:32.021 --> 01:25:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Now it's too late to get this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to go to the libertarian thing.</v>

1681
01:25:35.561 --> 01:25:36.980
<v Speaker 2>You've got to a ballot access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1682
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:38.200
<v Speaker 2>but 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 is a good time.</v>

1683
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Well it will be 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get you on the general.</v>

1684
01:25:42.491 --> 01:25:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I'll be almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you some,</v>

1685
01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.100
<v Speaker 2>my healthy diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost 70 and I never say never.</v>

1686
01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:51.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe when if Hillary wins and the women</v>

1687
01:25:51.811 --> 01:25:55.000
<v Speaker 2>see there's no difference having a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we learned,</v>

1688
01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:57.430
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference having a black man</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

1689
01:25:57.670 --> 01:26:00.450
<v Speaker 2>It's still business as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1690
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:04.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe when they learn all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the revolution continues to happen</v>

1691
01:26:04.521 --> 01:26:06.770
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something interesting.</v>

1692
01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.870
<v Speaker 2>The Bernie people and the original trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wanted the same thing.</v>

1693
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted but they couldn't come</v>

1694
01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>together because one's left ultra left</v>
<v Speaker 2>the others ultra,</v>

1695
01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:18.880
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1696
01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the status quo is now using that to</v>

1697
01:26:21.981 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're keeping the revolutionary</v>

1698
01:26:25.851 --> 01:26:30.020
<v Speaker 2>separated so that they can survive with</v>
<v Speaker 2>business as usual.</v>

1699
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two completely different</v>

1700
01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 2>factions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One that wants to dissolve the system</v>

1701
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:36.500
<v Speaker 2>because he thinks it's corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he uses certain aspects of the</v>

1702
01:26:36.501 --> 01:26:40.850
<v Speaker 2>system to make vast amounts of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one doesn't really care about</v>

1703
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:45.010
<v Speaker 2>money and really thinks that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>should make more money for them.</v>

1704
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things that I agree</v>

1705
01:26:46.311 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 2>with both agree to clean house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we got now is a mess.</v>

1706
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And clear the house out and start over.</v>

1707
01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both agreed to that.</v>

1708
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the things that</v>

1709
01:26:55.671 --> 01:26:59.930
<v Speaker 2>people support and trump and they wish</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he wasn't the guy he is and so they</v>

1710
01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:02.090
<v Speaker 2>try to pretend that he's someone other</v>
<v Speaker 2>than who he is.</v>

1711
01:27:02.230 --> 01:27:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe,</v>

1712
01:27:03.381 --> 01:27:07.340
<v Speaker 2>and I believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I would've gotten in the race and,</v>

1713
01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:11.540
<v Speaker 2>and gotten into the debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've won.</v>

1714
01:27:11.630 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you definitely could won.</v>

1715
01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:14.660
<v Speaker 2>You're a way better speaker than either</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them.</v>

1716
01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Even the speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1717
01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:20.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the baggage.</v>

1718
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1719
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:24.470
<v Speaker 2>and did you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some interest.</v>

1720
01:27:24.471 --> 01:27:26.870
<v Speaker 2>His finger aspect is a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1721
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.070
<v Speaker 2>when I ran for governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only raised $300,000.</v>

1722
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:32.623
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1723
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I made more money doing the job than</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I spent to get it.</v>

1724
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:38.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unprecedented.</v>

1725
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

1726
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:41.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why they don't want to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1727
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 2>That's why they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want me gone.</v>

1728
01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I've beaten them twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you're also an actual military</v>

1729
01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:51.680
<v Speaker 2>veteran and you're also a man is</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually held office before and you're</v>

1730
01:27:51.681 --> 01:27:55.190
<v Speaker 2>actually not a career politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've done the job and you have a</v>

1731
01:27:55.191 --> 01:27:56.960
<v Speaker 2>very good insight on what it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1732
01:27:57.170 --> 01:28:00.110
<v Speaker 2>You're also a conspiracy theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which scares the shit out of him.</v>

1733
01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's remember,</v>

1734
01:28:01.941 --> 01:28:05.840
<v Speaker 2>they did a huge study in England and</v>
<v Speaker 2>found the conspiracy theorists are</v>

1735
01:28:05.841 --> 01:28:07.250
<v Speaker 2>generally more intelligent.</v>

1736
01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Are you got to meet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of my friends know they're more</v>

1737
01:28:09.861 --> 01:28:14.861
<v Speaker 2>intelligent monkey because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't accept things.</v>

1738
01:28:14.961 --> 01:28:19.850
<v Speaker 2>They do their own personal studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they bring up an opinion.</v>

1739
01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's some flat earth people</v>

1740
01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:25.550
<v Speaker 2>and chem trails and there's some wacky</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that gets thrown into the mix there</v>

1741
01:28:25.551 --> 01:28:27.170
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dinosaurs aren't real,</v>

1742
01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you something as crazy as</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them sound.</v>

1743
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes after a few years go by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start thinking,</v>

1744
01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:38.150
<v Speaker 2>you know they might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about people in on the</v>

1745
01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 2>moon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we were there.</v>

1746
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1747
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:44.360
<v Speaker 2>absolutely I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think any of the footage is fake?</v>

1748
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I like to not believe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1749
01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I've never studied it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never sat down and really stammered</v>

1750
01:28:52.311 --> 01:28:54.230
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 18 years old.</v>

1751
01:28:54.231 --> 01:28:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I just graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revise school would allegedly walked on</v>

1752
01:28:57.021 --> 01:28:59.750
<v Speaker 2>the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only.</v>

1753
01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I was fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I far more concerned</v>

1754
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:05.770
<v Speaker 3>at that time of Woodstock and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1755
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 3>that also happened that year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real issue with conspiracy theories</v>

1756
01:29:09.421 --> 01:29:12.450
<v Speaker 3>is the absolute proven ones like Gulf of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tonkin,</v>

1757
01:29:12.451 --> 01:29:16.320
<v Speaker 3>which got us into the Vietnam War that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were part of like a operation</v>

1758
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:18.390
<v Speaker 3>northwoods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was signed by the Joint Chiefs of</v>

1759
01:29:18.391 --> 01:29:23.391
<v Speaker 3>staff and vetoed by Kennedy where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had planned attacks on Guantanamo Bay.</v>

1760
01:29:24.301 --> 01:29:28.410
<v Speaker 3>They were going to arm Cuban friendlies</v>
<v Speaker 3>to attack one ton of obey blaming on the</v>

1761
01:29:28.411 --> 01:29:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Cubans and let us go to war with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were going to blow up a drone.</v>

1762
01:29:32.071 --> 01:29:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Jetliner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were fire jetliner,</v>

1763
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.580
<v Speaker 3>blow it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blame it on Cuba.</v>

1764
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:36.930
<v Speaker 3>They were going to do all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1765
01:29:36.931 --> 01:29:38.820
<v Speaker 3>After knowing all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1766
01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.270
<v Speaker 3>are you all show out to include the</v>
<v Speaker 3>murder of John Kennedy?</v>

1767
01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy.</v>

1768
01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't either at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

1769
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.320
<v Speaker 3>What they've told us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let's bring in nine slash 11.</v>

1770
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the murder of John Kennedy to me is</v>

1771
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.720
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many aspects of it that</v>

1772
01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:57.090
<v Speaker 3>people like to conveniently ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the magic bullet,</v>

1773
01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:58.500
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the path,</v>

1774
01:29:58.501 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 3>because bullets take crazy paths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you know that bullets.</v>

1775
01:30:01.891 --> 01:30:03.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could shoot someone in the front and</v>

1776
01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:04.950
<v Speaker 3>the boat will come out of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyeballs.</v>

1777
01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things ricochet off bone.</v>

1778
01:30:08.041 --> 01:30:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Weird Shit happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a bullet does not go through bone</v>

1779
01:30:11.761 --> 01:30:14.220
<v Speaker 3>and come out looking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1780
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.860
<v Speaker 3>it can't be bigger than it originally</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1781
01:30:16.890 --> 01:30:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more particles inside the body</v>

1782
01:30:19.531 --> 01:30:21.530
<v Speaker 3>that are missing from the bullet itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1783
01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:26.010
<v Speaker 3>So it does show the bullet camp get</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger than what it originally was.</v>

1784
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:29.460
<v Speaker 3>That bullet went through Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shattered bones and connolly's body and</v>

1785
01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:32.280
<v Speaker 3>came out looking for Stina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've shot a lot of bullets.</v>

1786
01:30:32.281 --> 01:30:34.530
<v Speaker 3>I know what happens when you hit animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>with bullets.</v>

1787
01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:37.260
<v Speaker 3>When you hit bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have these two copper bullets from an</v>

1788
01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:39.900
<v Speaker 3>elk I shot and there are fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1789
01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:42.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We recreated it.</v>

1790
01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Unconcerned she theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't make the shots and I'm an</v>

1791
01:30:44.911 --> 01:30:46.140
<v Speaker 3>expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1792
01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the finger was hard.</v>

1793
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:53.400
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't work that bolt [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 3>quick enough like they claim he got the</v>

1794
01:30:53.401 --> 01:30:56.320
<v Speaker 3>shots off and like six seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>

1795
01:30:56.321 --> 01:31:01.321
<v Speaker 3>See the fastest I could do it without</v>
<v Speaker 3>even aiming was seven point eight and</v>

1796
01:31:01.981 --> 01:31:03.810
<v Speaker 3>that was not even taking a name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1797
01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I think if the gun was lubed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you practice really well,</v>

1798
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem with someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to do something</v>

1799
01:31:10.291 --> 01:31:12.330
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlos couldn't.</v>

1800
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.080
<v Speaker 3>The sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlos Health,</v>

1801
01:31:15.630 --> 01:31:19.440
<v Speaker 3>they created the whole thing for him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't make the shots and he's the</v>

1802
01:31:19.441 --> 01:31:22.200
<v Speaker 3>greatest sniper and history and even</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughed about it and said,</v>

1803
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.050
<v Speaker 3>you're going to tell me Oswald could</v>
<v Speaker 3>outshoot me.</v>

1804
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it possible that he got lucky?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>

1805
01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it possible that he got lucky</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot?</v>

1806
01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:32.880
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1807
01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:35.640
<v Speaker 3>In.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you like an Oliver's movie?</v>

1808
01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want it,</v>

1809
01:31:36.841 --> 01:31:38.640
<v Speaker 3>why didn't you take it when he's coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>at ya?</v>

1810
01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:40.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't get into that position if it</v>

1811
01:31:40.801 --> 01:31:44.070
<v Speaker 3>really was acting alone right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1812
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:48.240
<v Speaker 3>I cars coming right at you before it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes the turn that way if you miss the</v>

1813
01:31:48.241 --> 01:31:52.170
<v Speaker 3>next one is going to be closer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weird thing is that they had to come</v>

1814
01:31:52.171 --> 01:31:55.440
<v Speaker 3>up with the magic bullet theory to</v>
<v Speaker 3>account for a bullet that hit the</v>

1815
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:59.620
<v Speaker 3>underpass and ricocheted off of the curb</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hit a guy and because of that,</v>

1816
01:31:59.650 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 3>that's</v>

1817
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 4>why they had to account for one bullet.</v>

1818
01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the damaged bodies.</v>

1819
01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed Mr Newman and Mr Newman's</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the physical person closest to the</v>

1820
01:32:10.151 --> 01:32:13.870
<v Speaker 2>fatal headshot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy you see who covers his kids</v>

1821
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 2>in all the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Mr Newman and I asked him this a</v>

1822
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 2>few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing the show.</v>

1823
01:32:20.231 --> 01:32:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I met him there and interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1824
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.310
<v Speaker 2>where did you think the bullet came</v>
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>

1825
01:32:24.311 --> 01:32:24.761
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1826
01:32:24.761 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 2>it came from over my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which puts it right at the picket fence</v>

1827
01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:30.370
<v Speaker 2>because he was right down there and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said it came from over his right</v>

1828
01:32:30.371 --> 01:32:34.540
<v Speaker 2>shoulder and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had his FBI report there,</v>

1829
01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:37.750
<v Speaker 2>write one page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said to Mr Newman.</v>

1830
01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:38.171
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1831
01:32:38.171 --> 01:32:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Mr Newman when you stated at came over</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shoulder,</v>

1832
01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:44.920
<v Speaker 2>which put it at the grassy knoll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1833
01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.890
<v Speaker 2>how did the Warren Commission respond to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

1834
01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:51.100
<v Speaker 2>You know what he said to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked at me,</v>

1835
01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:53.590
<v Speaker 2>said I was never called in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warren Commission,</v>

1836
01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.600
<v Speaker 2>and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were the co,</v>

1837
01:32:56.740 --> 01:33:01.740
<v Speaker 2>the closest living witness to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>headshot and they never even brought you</v>

1838
01:33:02.261 --> 01:33:04.720
<v Speaker 2>in to ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1839
01:33:05.770 --> 01:33:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they saw his initial report</v>

1840
01:33:08.170 --> 01:33:10.570
<v Speaker 2>didn't fit with what they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put out,</v>

1841
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.200
<v Speaker 2>so they conveniently didn't call him in.</v>

1842
01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.580
<v Speaker 4>There's also two different accounts from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the autopsy,</v>

1843
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:23.010
<v Speaker 4>the Bethesda Maryland version versus the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dallas version of the entrance wound on</v>

1844
01:33:23.011 --> 01:33:23.970
<v Speaker 4>the neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1845
01:33:23.971 --> 01:33:28.530
<v Speaker 4>they call it an entrance wound and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Tesla Maryland said it was a</v>

1846
01:33:28.531 --> 01:33:29.550
<v Speaker 4>tracheotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ruined.</v>

1847
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:32.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they changed it from a bullet hitting</v>

1848
01:33:32.251 --> 01:33:34.100
<v Speaker 4>him in the front to a trake wound.</v>

1849
01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name also changed at Joe</v>

1850
01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Ford?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The back bullet.</v>

1851
01:33:37.961 --> 01:33:39.330
<v Speaker 2>He moved it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Now how do you do those things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1853
01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:46.900
<v Speaker 2>And then the other interesting thing was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harold Weisberg wrote about it,</v>

1854
01:33:46.901 --> 01:33:49.480
<v Speaker 2>news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great books Whitewash Harold.</v>

1855
01:33:49.481 --> 01:33:52.930
<v Speaker 2>It took him 10 years to get the minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Warren Commission.</v>

1856
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:58.200
<v Speaker 2>It came out that a Houston newspaper</v>
<v Speaker 2>stated Oswaldo was a paid FBI informant,</v>

1857
01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:03.040
<v Speaker 2>had his number and the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Warren Commission had to hold an</v>

1858
01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:06.970
<v Speaker 2>emergency meeting and it took harold 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years to get the minutes because they</v>

1859
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000
<v Speaker 2>withheld them now you'd think they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting to discover and find out about</v>

1860
01:34:13.121 --> 01:34:16.000
<v Speaker 2>this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole minutes to the meeting had</v>

1861
01:34:16.001 --> 01:34:18.730
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minutes to the meeting dealt with</v>

1862
01:34:18.731 --> 01:34:20.590
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we cover this up?</v>

1863
01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who is going to cover this up</v>

1864
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:26.910
<v Speaker 4>pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the guy who was the closest to</v>

1865
01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:30.000
<v Speaker 4>play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when when any sort of a chaotic event</v>

1866
01:34:30.001 --> 01:34:31.980
<v Speaker 4>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're memory is usually fucked up</v>

1867
01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:35.010
<v Speaker 4>because you're dealing with adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially someone who's not used to</v>

1868
01:34:35.011 --> 01:34:40.011
<v Speaker 4>being in sort of combat type situations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human memory is one of the most faulty</v>

1869
01:34:41.041 --> 01:34:43.920
<v Speaker 4>pieces of evidence you could ever get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People remember all kinds of shit that</v>

1870
01:34:43.921 --> 01:34:47.190
<v Speaker 4>isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if the story started getting out</v>

1871
01:34:47.191 --> 01:34:49.440
<v Speaker 4>that there was people shooting from</v>
<v Speaker 4>behind the grassy knoll,</v>

1872
01:34:49.710 --> 01:34:53.460
<v Speaker 4>it's entirely possible that someone can</v>
<v Speaker 4>fabricate something in their own mind</v>

1873
01:34:53.461 --> 01:34:54.630
<v Speaker 4>and not even be deceptive.</v>

1874
01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

1875
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I would think</v>

1876
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:02.780
<v Speaker 3>that if you were there and you heard the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot and you felt it go over your</v>

1877
01:35:02.781 --> 01:35:04.310
<v Speaker 3>shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think you,</v>

1878
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.050
<v Speaker 3>if you told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been around.</v>

1879
01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Mr Newman.</v>

1880
01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:09.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1881
01:35:09.201 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 3>I never quizzed him on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I thought he was.</v>

1882
01:35:11.631 --> 01:35:13.730
<v Speaker 3>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were other others too.</v>

1883
01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Not just him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1884
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:17.930
<v Speaker 3>But you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of witnesses said that</v>

1885
01:35:17.931 --> 01:35:18.890
<v Speaker 3>they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1886
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:23.390
<v Speaker 3>there's a photo where you see smoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>going across the plaza right from the</v>

1887
01:35:23.391 --> 01:35:26.180
<v Speaker 3>grassy knoll in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen.</v>

1888
01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever read a David Lifton's book?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Best evidence to amazing book.</v>

1889
01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:34.910
<v Speaker 3>That was the book that got me on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory theory trail,</v>

1890
01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.840
<v Speaker 3>but there was an analysis done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one you need to read is whitewashed</v>

1891
01:35:38.841 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 3>by Harold Weisberg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll read it this weekend.</v>

1892
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:42.583
<v Speaker 3>Whitewash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1893
01:35:42.810 --> 01:35:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got me fired up again.</v>

1894
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:46.430
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1895
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:49.550
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crazy analysis of all the witnesses of</v>

1896
01:35:49.551 --> 01:35:51.890
<v Speaker 3>the Kennedy assassination and how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them died.</v>

1897
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Untimely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Death is fucking terrifying if you</v>

1898
01:35:56.151 --> 01:35:56.990
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Folks.</v>

1899
01:35:56.991 --> 01:35:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if he could find that witnesses to</v>

1900
01:35:59.461 --> 01:36:01.730
<v Speaker 3>the Kennedy assassination that died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Untimely deaths,</v>

1901
01:36:01.731 --> 01:36:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they did a statistical analysis of</v>

1902
01:36:04.401 --> 01:36:09.401
<v Speaker 3>the odds of all these people getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>murdered and just random random murders</v>

1903
01:36:09.801 --> 01:36:12.920
<v Speaker 3>and fucking bizarre suicides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

1904
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:14.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about Dorothy Kilgallen,</v>

1905
01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:21.020
<v Speaker 3>the greater Washington reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She went out and got an interview with</v>

1906
01:36:21.111 --> 01:36:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Jack Ruby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She came out of the interview stating</v>

1907
01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to break the Kennedy case wide</v>
<v Speaker 3>open,</v>

1908
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.840
<v Speaker 3>got back to New York and they found her</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead the next day.</v>

1909
01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dorothy Kilgallen,</v>

1910
01:36:33.981 --> 01:36:36.860
<v Speaker 3>she's one of the most famous reporters</v>
<v Speaker 3>in New York,</v>

1911
01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:41.390
<v Speaker 3>and she got an interview with Jack Ruby</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she came out of the interview and</v>

1912
01:36:41.391 --> 01:36:44.720
<v Speaker 3>all she'd quote was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to break the Kennedy Case Wide</v>

1913
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.251
<v Speaker 3>Open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1914
01:36:45.251 --> 01:36:46.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

1915
01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:48.440
<v Speaker 3>And then she was found dead within a</v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

1916
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:54.070
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting too is this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee Harvey Oswald either acted alone or</v>

1917
01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 3>the government assassinated Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Juno of Judith,</v>

1918
01:36:58.191 --> 01:36:59.780
<v Speaker 3>very baker of.</v>

1919
01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Why do I know that name or she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oswald's girlfriend.</v>

1920
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In New Orleans and she's written a book</v>

1921
01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:10.541
<v Speaker 3>called Lee and me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Book where she talks She Lee was</v>

1922
01:37:10.581 --> 01:37:14.000
<v Speaker 3>going to divorce his wife and her and</v>
<v Speaker 3>judith.</v>

1923
01:37:14.001 --> 01:37:16.100
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what she says.</v>

1924
01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what she said on record,</v>

1925
01:37:19.730 --> 01:37:21.530
<v Speaker 3>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it adds all these speakers.</v>

1926
01:37:21.531 --> 01:37:24.020
<v Speaker 3>They weren't living together at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1927
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:24.980
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1928
01:37:24.981 --> 01:37:27.620
<v Speaker 3>all the different people that died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Untimely deaths.</v>

1929
01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fucking crazy.</v>

1930
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:33.920
<v Speaker 3>It's all heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A unknown.</v>

1931
01:37:34.530 --> 01:37:35.690
<v Speaker 3>What w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we got here?</v>

1932
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:39.650
<v Speaker 3>Drug overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that's really the bad one is the</v>

1933
01:37:39.651 --> 01:37:42.500
<v Speaker 3>guy who was in the tower there at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>train thing.</v>

1934
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:43.850
<v Speaker 3>Suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide,</v>

1935
01:37:43.851 --> 01:37:44.810
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They found,</v>

1936
01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:47.000
<v Speaker 3>they found him dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minor accident,</v>

1938
01:37:50.601 --> 01:37:53.540

<v Speaker 3>And these [inaudible] died quick.</v>

1939
01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:54.530
<v Speaker 3>This is what's interesting.</v>

1940
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 3>They died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all died within a very short amount</v>

1941
01:37:56.311 --> 01:37:58.170
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gunshot wound to the head.</v>

1942
01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:58.861
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1943
01:37:58.861 --> 01:38:02.520
<v Speaker 3>judith was involved in an Oswald.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>

1944
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:07.550
<v Speaker 3>They were at New Orleans attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create a fast moving cancer that Lee was</v>

1945
01:38:07.771 --> 01:38:12.771
<v Speaker 3>supposed to deliver to Mexico City to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to kill Castro a fast moving cancer</v>

1946
01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:16.920
<v Speaker 3>and what killed ruby a fast moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer.</v>

1947
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:18.143
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

1948
01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:21.540
<v Speaker 3>And you know who's in charge of it all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy that's on all the New York or</v>

1949
01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:25.290
<v Speaker 3>the New Orleans Saints football are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's the famous doctor?</v>

1950
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:28.410
<v Speaker 3>The clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's who judy worked for.</v>

1951
01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:30.770
<v Speaker 3>The cancer expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1952
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Give you cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1953
01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.680
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were attempting to create a fast</v>

1954
01:38:34.681 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 3>moving cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think they give that to Jack</v>

1955
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Ruby?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1956
01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were attempting to kill</v>

1957
01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Castro with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1958
01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:46.410
<v Speaker 3>do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald was</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved?</v>

1959
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I think Lee Harvey Oswald was an</v>
<v Speaker 3>undercover operative of our US</v>

1960
01:38:51.961 --> 01:38:53.220
<v Speaker 3>intelligence agency.</v>

1961
01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think he was involved in the</v>

1962
01:38:54.511 --> 01:38:59.511
<v Speaker 3>assassination attempt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I or he was involved or thought he</v>

1963
01:38:59.731 --> 01:39:03.750
<v Speaker 3>was stopping it because oswold loved</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy.</v>

1964
01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:08.100
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is just such a crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Liked Kennedy.</v>

1965
01:39:08.101 --> 01:39:10.980
<v Speaker 3>He didn't dislike him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy story.</v>

1966
01:39:10.981 --> 01:39:15.981
<v Speaker 3>So why would he kill him and why would</v>
<v Speaker 3>he use a weapon when you can get any</v>

1967
01:39:16.141 --> 01:39:18.780
<v Speaker 3>weapon in Texas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would he use one that had a,</v>

1968
01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:22.010
<v Speaker 3>a paper trail on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting to me about this</v>

1969
01:39:22.011 --> 01:39:23.250
<v Speaker 3>story too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway though,</v>

1970
01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:27.990
<v Speaker 3>enough of Kennedy and I just want one</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is that it shows how uncomfortable</v>

1971
01:39:27.991 --> 01:39:32.850
<v Speaker 3>people are with embracing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of corruption to the extent</v>

1972
01:39:32.851 --> 01:39:34.560
<v Speaker 3>where they would kill the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1973
01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:39.570
<v Speaker 3>it shows me why Jesse Ventura at times</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not popular.</v>

1974
01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Why do you talk about yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>third person like Roy Jones?</v>

1975
01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he is a third person because he</v>

1976
01:39:47.911 --> 01:39:48.840
<v Speaker 3>is a third person.</v>

1977
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Jesse Ventura is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1978
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:52.740
<v Speaker 3>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my business.</v>

1979
01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1980
01:39:53.370 --> 01:39:54.300
<v Speaker 3>You're superman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1981
01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:55.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

1982
01:39:55.861 --> 01:39:56.694
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1983
01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:59.610
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was her manner,</v>

1984
01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Jessie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She calls me honey.</v>

1985
01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:02.340
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:06.480

<v Speaker 3>After 41 years least she's not swearing</v>

1987
01:40:06.481 --> 01:40:07.320
<v Speaker 3>at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1988
01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.500
<v Speaker 3>I've done something right.</v>

1991
01:40:16.081 --> 01:40:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know how I could get it.</v>

2011
01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.780
<v Speaker 2>You know how I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How I'm a veteran.</v>

2012
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:08.660
<v Speaker 2>I get dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't sleep at night and we'll also do.</v>

2013
01:41:08.690 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 2>You have had hip replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2014
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:10.601
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2015
01:41:10.601 --> 01:41:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Well there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2016
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:14.080
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had the new technique.</v>

2017
01:41:14.081 --> 01:41:16.540
<v Speaker 2>They'll called hip resurfacing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do they do there?</v>

2018
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:18.910
<v Speaker 2>It was new at the time in [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

2019
01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I learned it from a neighbor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico's a triathlete and you should all</v>

2020
01:41:22.931 --> 01:41:25.180
<v Speaker 2>the triathletes get hip trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get this.</v>

2021
01:41:25.181 --> 01:41:27.430
<v Speaker 2>The differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still cut you and they still</v>

2022
01:41:27.431 --> 01:41:30.190
<v Speaker 2>dislocate your hip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't cut the femur.</v>

2023
01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2024
01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Clean up the ball and socket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cover them with carbon titanium,</v>

2025
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:37.210
<v Speaker 2>steel and puts you back together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like resurfacing the road.</v>

2026
01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:39.040
<v Speaker 2>A new layer of asphalt.</v>

2027
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:40.440
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2028
01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.850
<v Speaker 2>my femur bones completely intact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2029
01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:45.830
<v Speaker 2>that's so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way Better Way,</v>

2030
01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:46.840
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way better.</v>

2031
01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.770
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually now I do over a marathon a</v>

2032
01:41:50.770 --> 01:41:52.810
<v Speaker 2>week on the elliptical machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

2033
01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:54.490
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any pain at all?</v>

2034
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:55.480
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2035
01:41:56.050 --> 01:42:00.250
<v Speaker 2>a week ago I did 41 miles that week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2036
01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no restricting of your movement.</v>

2037
01:42:02.381 --> 01:42:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2038
01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm 65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I sit down in a chair,</v>

2039
01:42:07.091 --> 01:42:09.810
<v Speaker 2>I tightened up and when I get up it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a.</v>

2040
01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:12.100
<v Speaker 2>You get and that feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>

2041
01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:15.670
<v Speaker 2>these are a really good tutorial for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anomic chair.</v>

2042
01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:17.080
<v Speaker 2>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also was,</v>

2043
01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't learn until I got to Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the physical therapist during my</v>

2044
01:42:20.981 --> 01:42:24.010
<v Speaker 2>wrestling career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had actually knocked my pelvis out of</v>

2045
01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.630
<v Speaker 2>alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

2046
01:42:25.631 --> 01:42:27.520
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's giving you your back</v>

2047
01:42:27.521 --> 01:42:30.070
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he gave me a bunch of stretches to do</v>

2048
01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:33.520
<v Speaker 2>where I got my pelvis back in alignment</v>
<v Speaker 2>and between that,</v>

2049
01:42:33.521 --> 01:42:34.720
<v Speaker 2>and I'll make a plug here.</v>

2050
01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever watch on TV?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those teeter hangers?</v>

2051
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're phenomenal.</v>

2052
01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2053
01:42:40.991 --> 01:42:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a godsend.</v>

2054
01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it every day for 10 to 12 minutes.</v>

2055
01:42:46.841 --> 01:42:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I hang upside down and I and I played</v>
<v Speaker 2>golf.</v>

2056
01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been back to the chiropractor</v>
<v Speaker 2>in two years because of that.</v>

2057
01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They every day,</v>

2058
01:42:56.070 --> 01:43:00.580
<v Speaker 2>every day at the end of my workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hang up and down like dracula or like</v>

2059
01:43:00.581 --> 01:43:04.240
<v Speaker 2>a band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you actually get so comfortable.</v>

2060
01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:08.450
<v Speaker 2>You go into kind of a limbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where you.</v>

2061
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:11.650
<v Speaker 2>You're almost a conscious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're conscious,</v>

2062
01:43:11.651 --> 01:43:14.730
<v Speaker 2>but you're not hanging upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2063
01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:16.090
<v Speaker 2>You're blacking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2064
01:43:16.091 --> 01:43:18.820
<v Speaker 2>not blacking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just so relaxed.</v>

2065
01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2066
01:43:19.421 --> 01:43:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I get it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2067
01:43:20.590 --> 01:43:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

2068
01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I and I tell people this thing is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>godsend.</v>

2069
01:43:24.190 --> 01:43:26.230
<v Speaker 2>If he called me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do ads for him.</v>

2070
01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a legitimate way to decompress</v>

2071
01:43:29.831 --> 01:43:31.330
<v Speaker 2>your spa without machines.</v>

2072
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:32.350
<v Speaker 2>It's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

2073
01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:33.340
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2074
01:43:33.341 --> 01:43:34.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a doctor wants to sit.</v>

2075
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Your muscles are holding you in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

2076
01:43:37.001 --> 01:43:37.451
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2077
01:43:37.451 --> 01:43:39.040
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I relaxed my muscles.</v>

2078
01:43:39.041 --> 01:43:40.810
<v Speaker 2>I know how to relax my muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an athlete.</v>

2079
01:43:40.811 --> 01:43:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know when my muscles are tense and</v>

2080
01:43:43.061 --> 01:43:46.240
<v Speaker 2>when they're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can absolutely get some relief and</v>

2081
01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:49.390
<v Speaker 2>decompression in your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I get full upside down,</v>

2082
01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:51.320
<v Speaker 2>then I mentally go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2083
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:54.380
<v Speaker 2>relax your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relax your ankles.</v>

2084
01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:58.880
<v Speaker 2>I go through my whole body till I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way to the shoulders and the</v>

2085
01:43:58.881 --> 01:44:01.250
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you a have back there</v>

2086
01:44:01.251 --> 01:44:02.900
<v Speaker 2>now though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when I hang,</v>

2087
01:44:02.901 --> 01:44:07.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally relaxed and sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually feel yourself slip right back</v>

2088
01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:11.050
<v Speaker 2>in and then you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2089
01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:12.890
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2090
01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:13.753
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one.</v>

2091
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:17.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like a harness it straps to adore</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I pull on it,</v>

2092
01:44:17.181 --> 01:44:17.541
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

2093
01:44:17.541 --> 01:44:17.931
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

2094
01:44:17.931 --> 01:44:18.170
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>

2095
01:44:18.170 --> 01:44:20.150
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like literally hanging by my</v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

2096
01:44:20.151 --> 01:44:24.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a spinal decompression device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not one of them sexual things,</v>

2097
01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:27.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2098
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:30.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a bulging disc in my neck and uh,</v>

2099
01:44:30.261 --> 01:44:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I relieved it that way and so it made a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>

2100
01:44:32.271 --> 01:44:33.440
<v Speaker 2>huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2101
01:44:33.441 --> 01:44:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2102
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the aches and pains of a 65 year</v>

2103
01:44:36.651 --> 01:44:38.350
<v Speaker 2>old I'd have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had my hip done.</v>

2104
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:43.040
<v Speaker 2>I stopped running because my orthopedic</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeon says no one over 40 should</v>

2105
01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:46.160
<v Speaker 2>because really the pounding my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>49,</v>

2106
01:44:46.161 --> 01:44:49.250
<v Speaker 2>he just ran 200 miles still ultra</v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon.</v>

2107
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 2>The pounding that he can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's going to pay the price,</v>

2108
01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:56.310
<v Speaker 2>the pounding of his body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2109
01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:00.770
<v Speaker 2>like this Dr Truesdale told me today</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the technology they got,</v>

2110
01:45:00.771 --> 01:45:03.860
<v Speaker 2>you can run without pounding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right with elliptical machines,</v>

2111
01:45:04.930 --> 01:45:06.890
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it's the pounding.</v>

2112
01:45:06.891 --> 01:45:08.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you can't do it.</v>

2113
01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can do it and train for what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said the where,</v>

2114
01:45:11.631 --> 01:45:15.080
<v Speaker 2>that that's going to cause on your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>after age 40.</v>

2115
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:18.380
<v Speaker 2>And I have to agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the predominant orthopedic surgeon</v>

2116
01:45:18.381 --> 01:45:20.030
<v Speaker 2>of the Mayo Clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2117
01:45:20.031 --> 01:45:21.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also another issue and it's the</v>

2118
01:45:21.951 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 2>creation of the running shoe because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>running shoe,</v>

2119
01:45:23.931 --> 01:45:26.660
<v Speaker 2>having that big wedge and the heel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a normal gait.</v>

2120
01:45:26.690 --> 01:45:29.180
<v Speaker 2>The normal gait as you supposed to land</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ball of your feet.</v>

2121
01:45:29.181 --> 01:45:31.100
<v Speaker 2>If you watch the little kids run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they run,</v>

2122
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:35.330
<v Speaker 2>but when they created the running shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they allowed people to run and have all</v>

2123
01:45:35.331 --> 01:45:38.420
<v Speaker 2>their weight come down on their heel and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it acts as sort of like a little spring,</v>

2124
01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:42.170
<v Speaker 2>but that's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your body has a natural spring</v>

2125
01:45:42.171 --> 01:45:45.560
<v Speaker 2>built into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The design of the foot bar or you can do</v>

2126
01:45:45.561 --> 01:45:47.450
<v Speaker 2>the natural way the seals do.</v>

2127
01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.940
<v Speaker 2>How do they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're running the sand.</v>

2128
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:51.180
<v Speaker 2>That's great too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2129
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:55.040
<v Speaker 2>that is the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paula had gotten even worse when they</v>

2130
01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:59.720
<v Speaker 2>take you in the soft sand dunes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dune running is fucking amazing.</v>

2131
01:45:59.721 --> 01:46:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2132
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2133
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:04.730
<v Speaker 2>There was an old chief there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to call him superman.</v>

2134
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.390
<v Speaker 2>He was 41 years old when I was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>teams.</v>

2135
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Forty one and the softer the Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the faster he got.</v>

2136
01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to call him the Campbell.</v>

2137
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:19.310
<v Speaker 2>That was his nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I one thing about chief,</v>

2138
01:46:19.311 --> 01:46:23.240
<v Speaker 2>but we called them the camel because</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we'd hit the soft sand running</v>

2139
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:26.900
<v Speaker 2>normally in our team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was probably in the top six and</v>

2140
01:46:26.901 --> 01:46:29.250
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we'd hit the soft sand,</v>

2141
01:46:29.251 --> 01:46:31.490
<v Speaker 2>he was up first or second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

2142
01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could just run in the soft sand and</v>

2143
01:46:34.491 --> 01:46:35.910
<v Speaker 2>it didn't slow him down to.</v>

2144
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:37.700
<v Speaker 2>They have like big wide flipper feet or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2145
01:46:37.701 --> 01:46:39.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was actually a little whiter,</v>

2146
01:46:39.231 --> 01:46:41.330
<v Speaker 2>rebuilt guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also,</v>

2147
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:43.550
<v Speaker 2>he was able,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had this big rope.</v>

2148
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:48.770
<v Speaker 2>He could wear a pair of twin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>96 tanks for diving and he'd pull</v>

2149
01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:51.720
<v Speaker 2>himself up to the top of this rope just</v>
<v Speaker 2>using his hands.</v>

2150
01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Ninety pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2151
01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:55.560
<v Speaker 2>twin nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what is called there.</v>

2152
01:46:55.561 --> 01:46:57.000
<v Speaker 2>How much do those weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2153
01:46:57.001 --> 01:46:59.730
<v Speaker 2>but they're heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're heavy as hell.</v>

2154
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:04.080
<v Speaker 2>They're the old twin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 Scuba tanks there.</v>

2155
01:47:04.081 --> 01:47:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Big Old metal tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were and he used to go up that rope</v>

2156
01:47:08.731 --> 01:47:12.030
<v Speaker 2>using just his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a strength or why rebuild?</v>

2157
01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Not a big muscle guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just why rebuilt?</v>

2158
01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.190
<v Speaker 2>We call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we called him superman.</v>

2159
01:47:17.191 --> 01:47:22.140
<v Speaker 2>That was his nickname and the teams you</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead pt every day you do pt.</v>

2160
01:47:22.141 --> 01:47:25.890
<v Speaker 2>With him it was like in training unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every set of pushups 50.</v>

2161
01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Every time you do pushups with him is 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 a pop and you probably do at least 10</v>

2162
01:47:34.631 --> 01:47:39.040
<v Speaker 2>to 12 sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great for tearing apart 600</v>

2163
01:47:39.041 --> 01:47:42.520
<v Speaker 2>pushups a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you'll do a thousand flutter kicks.</v>

2164
01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:44.230
<v Speaker 2>What's a flutter kick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wham.</v>

2165
01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:48.010
<v Speaker 2>You're back at your kyc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a good time.</v>

2166
01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:54.150
<v Speaker 2>That along with running up sand dunes at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a party who's running sand dunes and the</v>

2167
01:47:55.331 --> 01:47:57.520
<v Speaker 2>other thing in training they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>account for,</v>

2168
01:47:57.730 --> 01:48:02.710
<v Speaker 2>but you have to Rodan to run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time you're moving and budge</v>

2169
01:48:02.711 --> 01:48:04.210
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be running.</v>

2170
01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:09.050
<v Speaker 2>You have to run to run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're when you'd run out on the</v>

2171
01:48:09.051 --> 01:48:10.910
<v Speaker 2>beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to run to get there and</v>

2172
01:48:10.911 --> 01:48:15.710
<v Speaker 2>then you have to run to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those don't count when you do a four</v>

2173
01:48:15.711 --> 01:48:17.960
<v Speaker 2>mile beach run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only counts on the beach.</v>

2174
01:48:17.961 --> 01:48:21.800
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't count the run to get there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the run to get back to run to the</v>

2175
01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Chow Hall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Rhonda and everywhere you.</v>

2176
01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:27.470
<v Speaker 2>When you're in budge training from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time you start in the morning till they</v>

2177
01:48:27.471 --> 01:48:30.470
<v Speaker 2>secure you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be running anytime you're</v>

2178
01:48:30.471 --> 01:48:31.820
<v Speaker 2>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

2179
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:34.790
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do it as the airborne shuffle.</v>

2180
01:48:34.791 --> 01:48:37.090
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of that shuffle run where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2181
01:48:37.091 --> 01:48:37.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2182
01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you're running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not really running kind of</v>

2183
01:48:40.131 --> 01:48:40.990
<v Speaker 2>jargon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2184
01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:42.240
<v Speaker 2>He just hustling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:48:42.710 --> 01:48:45.590
<v Speaker 2>They call it the airborne shuffle</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's should do a jump school.</v>

2186
01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:51.460
<v Speaker 2>What led you to want to write this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this marijuana want the experience I had</v>

2187
01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:57.280
<v Speaker 2>with the seizures and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated me because I knew there's</v>

2188
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:59.030
<v Speaker 2>other people out there suffering.</v>

2189
01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Our government should not be standing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way and stopping people from using a</v>

2190
01:49:04.101 --> 01:49:09.101
<v Speaker 2>plant that could help them and it's time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to end this ridiculous prohibition.</v>

2191
01:49:10.161 --> 01:49:14.060
<v Speaker 2>My mother who lived through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prohibition of alcohol told me before</v>

2192
01:49:14.061 --> 01:49:16.130
<v Speaker 2>she died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

2193
01:49:16.131 --> 01:49:19.430
<v Speaker 2>the war on drugs is identical to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prohibition of alcohol.</v>

2194
01:49:19.431 --> 01:49:23.540
<v Speaker 2>All you're doing is making criminals</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich and powerful and it's also,</v>

2195
01:49:23.541 --> 01:49:26.580
<v Speaker 2>there's an industry and keeping people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in jail and as an industry,</v>

2196
01:49:26.581 --> 01:49:28.320
<v Speaker 2>you catching people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locking them up,</v>

2197
01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:31.070
<v Speaker 2>check your rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing your rights,</v>

2198
01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:33.430
<v Speaker 2>imprisoning people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you find out that there's</v>

2199
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:37.250
<v Speaker 2>prison guard unions that are lobbying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep marijuana illegal so they have more</v>

2200
01:49:37.251 --> 01:49:38.840
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible,</v>

2201
01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:40.190
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>

2202
01:49:40.191 --> 01:49:43.030
<v Speaker 2>And they don't think of it as horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the perception.</v>

2203
01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Got The dea who's out there making money</v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

2204
01:49:45.891 --> 01:49:48.790
<v Speaker 2>keeping it illegal and you know what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2205
01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it to fight for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>

2206
01:49:50.531 --> 01:49:52.630
<v Speaker 2>but I've already got another position</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>

2207
01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:57.660
<v Speaker 2>But let's end the war on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take the dea and let's make the</v>

2208
01:49:58.721 --> 01:50:03.280
<v Speaker 2>dea do put as much effort into sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>crimes.</v>

2209
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of sexual crimes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Molesting children.</v>

2210
01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just went through one in Minnesota,</v>

2211
01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Jacob wetterling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they finally caught his murderer,</v>

2212
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 2>but he's not going to go to prison for</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdering because he plea bargained what</v>

2213
01:50:20.801 --> 01:50:22.150
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2214
01:50:22.151 --> 01:50:26.200
<v Speaker 2>the famous Jacob wetterling case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where that could happen</v>

2215
01:50:26.201 --> 01:50:30.340
<v Speaker 2>way back 20 some years ago where he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and his friends were going to the</v>

2216
01:50:30.341 --> 01:50:33.790
<v Speaker 2>video store and a guy took him at</v>
<v Speaker 2>gunpoint and you disappeared.</v>

2217
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:38.980
<v Speaker 2>The Minnesota Vikings wore his thing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>their uniform and it was a whole</v>

2218
01:50:38.981 --> 01:50:43.981
<v Speaker 2>national thing when Jacob wetterling was</v>
<v Speaker 2>abducted while they just discovered his</v>

2219
01:50:44.201 --> 01:50:46.460
<v Speaker 2>dead body a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2220
01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:50.800
<v Speaker 2>because they caught the guy who did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wouldn't confess unless he got</v>

2221
01:50:50.801 --> 01:50:54.310
<v Speaker 2>immunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had to give him immunity and</v>

2222
01:50:54.311 --> 01:50:58.240
<v Speaker 2>then he led them to the body so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could get closure over 20 some years</v>

2223
01:50:58.241 --> 01:50:59.074
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

2224
01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:01.630
<v Speaker 2>So he got immunity to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is he getting prosecuted for</v>

2225
01:51:01.631 --> 01:51:04.090
<v Speaker 2>something as getting prosecuted for</v>
<v Speaker 2>child porn?</v>

2226
01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:05.350
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2227
01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Now I say you take the dea and you put</v>
<v Speaker 2>them out catching child molesters and</v>

2228
01:51:14.231 --> 01:51:18.610
<v Speaker 2>sexual predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a good job for them to do.</v>

2229
01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:22.580
<v Speaker 2>It would be a good job for them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would rather take people that are</v>

2230
01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:25.440
<v Speaker 2>molesting children as our smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2231
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:28.600
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem might be they might have to</v>

2232
01:51:28.601 --> 01:51:31.840
<v Speaker 2>investigate the Catholic church and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be off limits,</v>

2233
01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:32.511
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2234
01:51:32.511 --> 01:51:34.030
<v Speaker 2>how about that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good one.</v>

2235
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Here's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love good ones.</v>

2236
01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:38.050
<v Speaker 2>My Club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mongols.</v>

2237
01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:41.380
<v Speaker 2>We got busted for the Federal Rico laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2238
01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:46.150
<v Speaker 2>How come they don't apply the Federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rico laws to the Catholic Church?</v>

2239
01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a good call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2240
01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't child molestations of felony.</v>

2241
01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:55.600
<v Speaker 2>They covered it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lied about it.</v>

2242
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 2>They continue to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come the church hasn't been</v>

2243
01:51:59.921 --> 01:52:04.720
<v Speaker 2>investigated under the Federal Rico Laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>and charged their questionnaire?</v>

2244
01:52:04.721 --> 01:52:06.130
<v Speaker 2>The church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

2245
01:52:06.670 --> 01:52:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And you're not allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2246
01:52:08.461 --> 01:52:11.410
<v Speaker 2>that's also why they hide them up in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vatican because the Vatican is its own</v>

2247
01:52:11.411 --> 01:52:13.360
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2248
01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that.</v>

2249
01:52:16.090 --> 01:52:21.090
<v Speaker 2>How come the Rico laws don't apply to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the child molestation that's gone on.</v>

2250
01:52:21.670 --> 01:52:23.690
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good point.</v>

2251
01:52:23.691 --> 01:52:25.600
<v Speaker 2>And when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Pope Benedict resigned,</v>

2252
01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:26.290
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2253
01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:27.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that they were going</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

2254
01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:31.210
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to prosecute him for crimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>against humanity because this guy was</v>

2255
01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:33.880
<v Speaker 2>shielding child molesters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He killed a child molester that went on</v>

2256
01:52:33.881 --> 01:52:36.760
<v Speaker 2>to rape 100 deaf kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2257
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:40.420
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy targeted deaf children</v>

2258
01:52:40.421 --> 01:52:42.990
<v Speaker 2>because they couldn't talk about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they,</v>

2259
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:45.380
<v Speaker 2>they stick them in the Vatican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you're in the Vatican,</v>

2260
01:52:45.381 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>the Vatican is</v>

2261
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:49.520
<v Speaker 4>protected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's literally got its own situation</v>

2262
01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:50.950
<v Speaker 4>where it's like a country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2263
01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:52.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2264
01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:56.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean I still don't think there's as</v>
<v Speaker 4>many people doing that as there are</v>

2265
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:58.430
<v Speaker 4>selling and buying drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the dea</v>

2266
01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:01.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what has come some other is the</v>

2267
01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:02.860
<v Speaker 2>worst effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

2268
01:53:02.861 --> 01:53:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you because I know people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were molested and never recovered</v>

2269
01:53:07.001 --> 01:53:11.200
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their entire lives have been altered.</v>

2270
01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes for generations because</v>

2271
01:53:14.231 --> 01:53:17.140
<v Speaker 2>generally you find the molester was</v>
<v Speaker 2>molested?</v>

2272
01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

2273
01:53:18.521 --> 01:53:19.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2274
01:53:19.241 --> 01:53:22.000
<v Speaker 2>usually that usually that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2275
01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:27.310
<v Speaker 2>So I would rather take our focus away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from people doing consensual crime</v>

2276
01:53:27.311 --> 01:53:32.311
<v Speaker 2>against themselves because addiction</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be treated a criminally.</v>

2277
01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:35.430
<v Speaker 2>It should be treated medically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2278
01:53:35.530 --> 01:53:38.770
<v Speaker 2>you can be addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always like to use this for an</v>

2279
01:53:38.771 --> 01:53:42.310
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine tomorrow if they took away</v>

2280
01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:45.730
<v Speaker 2>coffee and caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2281
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:47.500
<v Speaker 2>we have riots on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2282
01:53:47.501 --> 01:53:50.770
<v Speaker 2>And those are all addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People addicted to it.</v>

2283
01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Hoodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you trying to say,</v>

2284
01:53:51.791 --> 01:53:52.800
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2285
01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:55.120
<v Speaker 2>they're coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're addicted to it.</v>

2286
01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to understand that.</v>

2287
01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Then how dare them say you should take</v>
<v Speaker 2>away a drug from someone else.</v>

2288
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:03.183
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I.</v>

2289
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:06.010
<v Speaker 2>They have their fix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:54:06.011 --> 01:54:07.480
<v Speaker 2>How come theirs is legal?</v>

2291
01:54:08.290 --> 01:54:11.980
<v Speaker 4>I also don't think that we have to find</v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs for people that are doing something</v>

2292
01:54:11.981 --> 01:54:15.850
<v Speaker 4>that should be against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be against the law to arrest</v>

2293
01:54:15.851 --> 01:54:18.460
<v Speaker 4>people for marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to find jobs for people</v>

2294
01:54:18.461 --> 01:54:20.470
<v Speaker 4>that are doing something that should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>against the law.</v>

2295
01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:23.380
<v Speaker 4>Arresting people for marijuana is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking crime.</v>

2296
01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:26.680
<v Speaker 4>And I've said this time and time again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you lock someone in a cage</v>

2297
01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:28.840
<v Speaker 4>because they smoke a plant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes them happy,</v>

2298
01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:31.210
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucking criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a criminal,</v>

2299
01:54:31.211 --> 01:54:33.730
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are doing a crime against human</v>

2300
01:54:33.731 --> 01:54:36.970
<v Speaker 4>beings and freedom and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're participating in.</v>

2301
01:54:36.971 --> 01:54:41.260
<v Speaker 4>So the dea is doing is a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we have to find jobs for</v>

2302
01:54:41.261 --> 01:54:43.210
<v Speaker 4>criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the only thing that's saving</v>

2303
01:54:43.211 --> 01:54:46.780
<v Speaker 4>them from being labeled as a criminal is</v>
<v Speaker 4>some shit that's written down on paper</v>

2304
01:54:46.781 --> 01:54:49.870
<v Speaker 4>by a bunch of people that are profiting</v>
<v Speaker 4>from keeping it in that same way.</v>

2305
01:54:50.230 --> 01:54:51.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all crime.</v>

2306
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:53.650
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's nothing.</v>

2307
01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zilch.</v>

2308
01:54:55.090 --> 01:54:57.910
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you talking about the side effects</v>

2309
01:54:58.090 --> 01:55:00.790
<v Speaker 4>or the negative effects of cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing.</v>

2310
01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:02.530
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence.</v>

2311
01:55:02.531 --> 01:55:03.730
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if there was,</v>

2312
01:55:03.731 --> 01:55:06.400
<v Speaker 4>they would parade it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even if they did paraded out there,</v>

2313
01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:10.090
<v Speaker 4>what we're finding time and time again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most recent story that was in the</v>

2314
01:55:10.090 --> 01:55:14.460
<v Speaker 4>New York Times about the sugar industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying off scientists to say that sugar</v>

2315
01:55:14.461 --> 01:55:16.450
<v Speaker 4>is okay for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's saturated fat,</v>

2316
01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:19.510
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is so important that it's one of</v>

2317
01:55:19.511 --> 01:55:21.910
<v Speaker 4>the main substrates for creating sex</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones.</v>

2318
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.260
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the most important parts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>human diet that saturated fat is bad.</v>

2319
01:55:26.261 --> 01:55:27.640
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's giving people heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>attacks.</v>

2320
01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people getting fat as fuck from shower.</v>

2321
01:55:30.110 --> 01:55:30.410
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2322
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I love to talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which came to light to me 10 years ago.</v>

2323
01:55:36.150 --> 01:55:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in the fifties when they put</v>

2324
01:55:38.591 --> 01:55:41.070
<v Speaker 2>fluoride in our water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2325
01:55:41.290 --> 01:55:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Wade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they put it in there for our.</v>

2326
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that your parent's job to teach</v>

2327
01:55:46.381 --> 01:55:49.530
<v Speaker 2>you how to brush your teeth and Gargle</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Florida dated mouthwash?</v>

2328
01:55:49.531 --> 01:55:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Is there any benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>White Flora?</v>

2329
01:55:51.090 --> 01:55:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you put a chemical in the</v>

2330
01:55:53.131 --> 01:55:53.990
<v Speaker 2>water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2331
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:55.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll explain it.</v>

2332
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you think was the first people to</v>

2333
01:55:58.771 --> 01:56:01.350
<v Speaker 2>put fluoride in water but the Nazis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2334
01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Now why they do that now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2335
01:56:03.691 --> 01:56:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd questioned anything the Nazis did</v>
<v Speaker 2>right away.</v>

2336
01:56:06.421 --> 01:56:06.931
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2337
01:56:06.931 --> 01:56:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have really people in mind</v>

2338
01:56:09.451 --> 01:56:11.400
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were really good at making engines.</v>

2339
01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Well that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2340
01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:14.701
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2341
01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:18.900
<v Speaker 2>they did it because fluoride is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>major ingredient of PROZAC.</v>

2342
01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:26.530
<v Speaker 2>So you think that played in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting these daily dose,</v>

2343
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:29.740
<v Speaker 2>daily dose of PROZAC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does.</v>

2344
01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2345
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Why would the Nazis do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would be the only reason to.</v>

2346
01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Not People Docile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but did they do it in a large scale</v>

2347
01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.620
<v Speaker 2>fashion or they do it as an experiment</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they did a lot of fucked up</v>

2348
01:56:41.621 --> 01:56:42.670
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>

2349
01:56:42.671 --> 01:56:47.170
<v Speaker 2>they put it in their water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany was the first country that put</v>

2350
01:56:47.171 --> 01:56:49.960
<v Speaker 2>fluoride in the water under the Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 2>rule.</v>

2351
01:56:50.110 --> 01:56:53.050
<v Speaker 2>And did they picked it up for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth?</v>

2352
01:56:53.051 --> 01:56:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I guess that was why they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2353
01:56:55.930 --> 01:56:58.930
<v Speaker 2>but that's what we sold our people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>

2354
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.510
<v Speaker 2>And here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the movie Fargo?</v>

2355
01:57:01.690 --> 01:57:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Member of the town.</v>

2356
01:57:02.951 --> 01:57:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Brainerd?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2357
01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brainerd Minnesota.</v>

2358
01:57:05.951 --> 01:57:07.990
<v Speaker 2>About 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it.</v>

2359
01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:12.130
<v Speaker 2>They voted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not want fluoride in their</v>

2360
01:57:12.131 --> 01:57:14.110
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't going to put it in.</v>

2361
01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Federal government came in and made</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2362
01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:19.630
<v Speaker 2>And why do you think they did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the fluoride industry paying them</v>

2363
01:57:19.631 --> 01:57:21.160
<v Speaker 2>off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because they want to get</v>

2364
01:57:21.161 --> 01:57:24.730
<v Speaker 2>rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would the federal government come</v>

2365
01:57:24.731 --> 01:57:29.731
<v Speaker 2>into a city who their own water supply</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forced them to put fluoride in the</v>

2366
01:57:31.091 --> 01:57:31.924
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

2367
01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think they did it because the</v>

2368
01:57:34.811 --> 01:57:38.350
<v Speaker 2>fluoride industry paid them off because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to lose profits?</v>

2369
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:42.760
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or did they not want an example that you</v>

2370
01:57:42.761 --> 01:57:46.030
<v Speaker 2>can have water without fluoride?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible,</v>

2371
01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:49.090
<v Speaker 2>but if they really wanted to protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>people from Wednesday,</v>

2372
01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:52.480
<v Speaker 2>go after sugar or is it like Vince</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcmahon?</v>

2373
01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:57.730
<v Speaker 2>He fired me because I wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>relinquish my copyrighted name so he</v>

2374
01:57:57.731 --> 01:58:01.660
<v Speaker 2>could exploit that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I owned it and I refused to give it up.</v>

2375
01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:04.780
<v Speaker 2>The copywriter named Jesse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesse Ventura.</v>

2376
01:58:05.230 --> 01:58:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I had it before I worked for them and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>copyrighted it federally so that I would</v>

2377
01:58:09.461 --> 01:58:14.410
<v Speaker 2>own it and I wouldn't release it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what ended up getting me</v>

2378
01:58:14.411 --> 01:58:18.790
<v Speaker 2>fired in the end where I had to leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wwf because,</v>

2379
01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:19.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2380
01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:24.340
<v Speaker 2>he had to control all of the marketing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was old school before wwe.</v>

2381
01:58:25.450 --> 01:58:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2382
01:58:27.041 --> 01:58:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why fluoride in the water.</v>

2383
01:58:29.621 --> 01:58:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at it very peripheral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no reason for it really.</v>

2384
01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:37.240
<v Speaker 2>They tell you it's for your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shouldn't you do that yourself?</v>

2385
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Will not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thinking is if they really were</v>

2386
01:58:38.981 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 2>concerned about people's teeth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's health wouldn't look at all the</v>

2387
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:45.580
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of sugar that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming.</v>

2388
01:58:45.730 --> 01:58:49.390
<v Speaker 3>All the corn syrup and people's Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the sugar and that tell you the</v>

2389
01:58:49.410 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 3>fluoride there for another reason then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think there's a large scale</v>

2390
01:58:54.071 --> 01:58:59.071
<v Speaker 3>organized conspiracy to keep people</v>
<v Speaker 3>docile by putting Florida and the water.</v>

2391
01:58:59.410 --> 01:59:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's a large scale</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy or if it was just done and</v>

2392
01:59:03.881 --> 01:59:08.881
<v Speaker 3>it's too difficult to unchange it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants government gets established</v>

2393
01:59:09.191 --> 01:59:12.340
<v Speaker 3>doing something and it's done for</v>
<v Speaker 3>decades.</v>

2394
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:17.550
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to get them to change</v>
<v Speaker 3>their position and is it in some ways a</v>

2395
01:59:17.591 --> 01:59:21.520
<v Speaker 3>lot like the dea in that once fluoride</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a business,</v>

2396
01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:24.640
<v Speaker 3>is a business and selling fluoride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting fluoride in the water.</v>

2397
01:59:24.641 --> 01:59:26.290
<v Speaker 3>There's people that have jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing that.</v>

2398
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:29.650
<v Speaker 3>They lobby to keep that in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what evidence is there?</v>

2399
01:59:29.651 --> 01:59:31.600
<v Speaker 3>The floor has beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any evidence?</v>

2400
01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:33.273
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2401
01:59:33.610 --> 01:59:35.410
<v Speaker 3>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you know about this,</v>

2402
01:59:35.411 --> 01:59:39.340
<v Speaker 3>why don't you look into that because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't drink fluoridated water,</v>

2403
01:59:39.341 --> 01:59:41.290
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't affect Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have Florida.</v>

2404
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:42.250
<v Speaker 3>You drink out of A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2405
01:59:42.610 --> 01:59:43.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2406
01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:44.920
<v Speaker 3>and in all my home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2407
01:59:44.921 --> 01:59:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I only learned this a decade ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ironically,</v>

2408
01:59:47.921 --> 01:59:52.420
<v Speaker 3>all the homes I've lived in have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of rural and I've had my own.</v>

2409
01:59:52.421 --> 01:59:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Well all your life pretty much other</v>
<v Speaker 3>than when I grew up as a kid.</v>

2410
01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's why he still rebellious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't get your dose of Flora.</v>

2411
01:59:59.541 --> 02:00:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I asked questions and stuff.</v>

2412
02:00:02.801 --> 02:00:05.920
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been on PROZAC aided.</v>

2413
02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not on the PROZAC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2414
02:00:08.561 --> 02:00:12.050
<v Speaker 3>it didn't work with me because I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>drank a lot of fucking fluorided water</v>

2415
02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:15.940
<v Speaker 3>constitutions are different than mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2416
02:00:16.090 --> 02:00:19.210
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm just better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say it calcifies your pineal gland,</v>

2417
02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:21.100
<v Speaker 3>but the people that say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all smell,</v>

2418
02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:24.190
<v Speaker 3>they all smell like natural deodorant</v>
<v Speaker 3>and feet.</v>

2419
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:26.200
<v Speaker 3>When mother fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said it,</v>

2420
02:00:26.250 --> 02:00:26.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2421
02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:31.000
<v Speaker 3>the brainerd tried to do it and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal government came in and just</v>

2422
02:00:31.001 --> 02:00:32.680
<v Speaker 3>slapped him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't matter,</v>

2423
02:00:32.681 --> 02:00:34.660
<v Speaker 3>the people voted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't matter,</v>

2424
02:00:34.661 --> 02:00:37.240
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Federal government came in and said,</v>

2425
02:00:37.241 --> 02:00:41.010
<v Speaker 3>you will have fluoride in your water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year was this thick?</v>

2426
02:00:41.070 --> 02:00:44.620
<v Speaker 3>It was back in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that would fly today because</v>

2427
02:00:44.650 --> 02:00:49.410
<v Speaker 3>people today are so concerned with</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified foods and I think</v>

2428
02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:51.430
<v Speaker 3>they'd still do it today because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>still got it.</v>

2429
02:00:51.730 --> 02:00:53.460
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's ever said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2430
02:00:53.890 --> 02:00:56.260
<v Speaker 3>why don't we remove fluoride from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>water?</v>

2431
02:00:58.570 --> 02:00:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2432
02:00:59.330 --> 02:01:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2433
02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.110
<v Speaker 3>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody brings it up.</v>

2434
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:03.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

2435
02:01:03.551 --> 02:01:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Florida is beneficial in toothpaste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2436
02:01:05.690 --> 02:01:07.590
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe floor at should be in</v>

2437
02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:09.820
<v Speaker 3>toothpaste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that with the cleaning of your</v>

2438
02:01:09.821 --> 02:01:13.360
<v Speaker 3>teeth is really what gets the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The plan goes.</v>

2439
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:14.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2440
02:01:14.201 --> 02:01:18.520
<v Speaker 3>But someone must have just a major</v>
<v Speaker 3>ingredient of PROZAC.</v>

2441
02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:20.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go looking into that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dammit.</v>

2442
02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:23.080
<v Speaker 3>Another rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to whitewash.</v>

2443
02:01:23.081 --> 02:01:25.210
<v Speaker 3>I got to go down on PROZAC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rabbit hole.</v>

2444
02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.160
<v Speaker 3>PROZAC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fluoride,</v>

2445
02:01:27.161 --> 02:01:28.130
<v Speaker 3>rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flora.</v>

2446
02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.220
<v Speaker 3>Just flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you think about it,</v>

2447
02:01:30.221 --> 02:01:34.210
<v Speaker 3>why would they put it for your teeth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your parents do that.</v>

2448
02:01:34.211 --> 02:01:36.610
<v Speaker 3>They teach you how to brush your teeth</v>
<v Speaker 3>and use mouthwash.</v>

2449
02:01:36.611 --> 02:01:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Why would you put a chemical in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>water?</v>

2450
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why</v>

2451
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 2>would a chemical be introduced into</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean drinking water?</v>

2452
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

2453
02:01:44.811 --> 02:01:48.080
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that don't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink water from the faucet anymore.</v>

2454
02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people use the faucet water for</v>

2455
02:01:50.691 --> 02:01:53.630
<v Speaker 2>bathing and cooking and they drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottled water.</v>

2456
02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's another scam they pulled on</v>

2457
02:01:55.770 --> 02:01:56.850
<v Speaker 2>the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2458
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:58.820
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

2459
02:01:58.821 --> 02:02:00.860
<v Speaker 2>And conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went up to Michigan.</v>

2460
02:02:00.861 --> 02:02:02.300
<v Speaker 2>We're nationally is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2461
02:02:02.301 --> 02:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take water.</v>

2462
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law says you cannot take water from</v>

2463
02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:07.620
<v Speaker 2>the Great Lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2464
02:02:07.730 --> 02:02:12.470
<v Speaker 2>And the Great Lakes region is 20 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the fresh water of the world,</v>

2465
02:02:13.130 --> 02:02:16.490
<v Speaker 2>so naturally goes up there and builds a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million square foot,</v>

2466
02:02:16.491 --> 02:02:19.970
<v Speaker 2>plant the things huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than our dome stadium.</v>

2467
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.720
<v Speaker 2>For the Vikings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got this huge plant up there and</v>

2468
02:02:23.721 --> 02:02:26.120
<v Speaker 2>all they do is they punch in at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tributary,</v>

2469
02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:29.120
<v Speaker 2>so they're technically not taking it</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Great Lakes.</v>

2470
02:02:29.121 --> 02:02:31.250
<v Speaker 2>They're taking it before it gets there.</v>

2471
02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:35.900
<v Speaker 2>The Great Lakes have now fallen there</v>
<v Speaker 2>six inches lower than they used to be</v>

2472
02:02:36.230 --> 02:02:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and I was taken to a stream that used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have white water rafting.</v>

2473
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:44.840
<v Speaker 2>It now does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dead water just because of Nestle.</v>

2474
02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sucking it all out of the ground</v>

2475
02:02:46.671 --> 02:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>before it can get to the Great Lakes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're putting it in plastic bottles</v>

2476
02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:53.180
<v Speaker 2>and selling it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More expensive than gas.</v>

2477
02:02:53.670 --> 02:02:56.990
<v Speaker 2>It is bottled water costs more than gas</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that fucking.</v>

2478
02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you've got a company and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell a product that's free and you and</v>

2479
02:03:02.241 --> 02:03:06.230
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to do nothing to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but put it into a bottle and sell it for</v>

2480
02:03:06.231 --> 02:03:09.020
<v Speaker 2>more than gas cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They persuaded us.</v>

2481
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:12.860
<v Speaker 2>It was the only way to consume water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was a kid,</v>

2482
02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.490
<v Speaker 2>you'd go to the schoolyard and play</v>
<v Speaker 2>football all day on the way home.</v>

2483
02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:21.410
<v Speaker 2>You'd run up to somebody whos you'd turn</v>
<v Speaker 2>it on and everybody would drink out of</v>

2484
02:03:21.411 --> 02:03:22.244
<v Speaker 2>the hose.</v>

2485
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:25.520
<v Speaker 2>We didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody got sick.</v>

2486
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.940
<v Speaker 2>We survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet all of a sudden here came.</v>

2487
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Bottled water had to be bottled and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a whole thing they did on people.</v>

2488
02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:39.470
<v Speaker 2>The only pure clear water you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get comes from bottle.</v>

2489
02:03:39.471 --> 02:03:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Well at eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pumping it out of the ground the</v>

2490
02:03:42.141 --> 02:03:44.690
<v Speaker 2>same way as they pump anything else out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the ground.</v>

2491
02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:48.440
<v Speaker 2>They're just putting it into a bottle</v>
<v Speaker 2>and selling it to you for more than</v>

2492
02:03:48.441 --> 02:03:51.410
<v Speaker 2>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your friend is interrupting here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>people in the studio,</v>

2503
02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:24.860

<v Speaker 2>the only thing I worry about every book</v>

<v Speaker 2>signing I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get pleads from people on why I'm not</v>

<v Speaker 2>somebody needs to run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not corrupted by the system as</v>

2508
02:04:36.771 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think you're corrupted by the system.</v>

2509
02:04:38.311 --> 02:04:39.750
<v Speaker 2>There's only me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2510
02:04:39.751 --> 02:04:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Well I think there's probably a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people that are thinking right</v>

2511
02:04:42.271 --> 02:04:43.590
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want this.</v>

2512
02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:48.210
<v Speaker 2>I only raised 300,000 bucks to become</v>
<v Speaker 2>the governor of Minnesota,</v>

2513
02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:49.980
<v Speaker 2>but that's Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2514
02:04:49.981 --> 02:04:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I think my dog might be able to win</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

2515
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Not really because the devolution repub</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent $12 million that year.</v>

2516
02:04:56.430 --> 02:05:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Well they spent 12 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Jesse Ventura was famous or</v>

2517
02:05:00.381 --> 02:05:01.830
<v Speaker 2>thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2518
02:05:01.831 --> 02:05:06.831
<v Speaker 2>but I had to go through the media of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them a degrading me.</v>

2519
02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:10.080
<v Speaker 2>How could a wrestler be a governor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2520
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:12.930
<v Speaker 2>How could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could somebody from the private</v>

2521
02:05:12.931 --> 02:05:17.931
<v Speaker 2>sector who's never come up through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt system be expected to govern,</v>

2522
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:21.570
<v Speaker 2>but also don't you think it helps you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an awesome Minnesota accent?</v>

2523
02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:24.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the building official.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely do.</v>

2524
02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that.</v>

2525
02:05:25.531 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 2>If my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Randall Carlson,</v>

2526
02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know it.</v>

2527
02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:31.800
<v Speaker 2>My friend ran from Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have.</v>

2528
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:34.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't have an accent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alabama.</v>

2529
02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:37.740
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to know my friend Randall</v>

2530
02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Carlson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds exactly like you.</v>

2531
02:05:38.970 --> 02:05:40.410
<v Speaker 2>And he's from Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2532
02:05:40.590 --> 02:05:42.690
<v Speaker 2>You said you have a very clear of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota accent.</v>

2533
02:05:42.691 --> 02:05:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have it and uh,</v>

2534
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:45.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm born and raised there,</v>

2535
02:05:45.241 --> 02:05:47.730
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how to skate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a skate?</v>

2536
02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

2537
02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2538
02:05:50.131 --> 02:05:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it because I in the winter I swam.</v>

2539
02:05:53.110 --> 02:05:54.080
<v Speaker 2>We have in common.</v>

2540
02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:56.280
<v Speaker 2>You and me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like fanny packs.</v>

2541
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:59.130
<v Speaker 2>We both don't know how to skate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both like pot.</v>

2542
02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:01.110
<v Speaker 2>I was a swimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could swim.</v>

2543
02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2544
02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:03.840
<v Speaker 2>I did it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean all winter and summer I was</v>

2545
02:06:03.841 --> 02:06:05.430
<v Speaker 2>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now my claim to fame,</v>

2546
02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I actually swam in the same pool once</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Mark Spitz.</v>

2547
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:14.510
<v Speaker 2>That's big for me because as a swimmer</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was God the Var air right in the long</v>

2548
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:15.601
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phelps,</v>

2549
02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:19.890
<v Speaker 2>who I never thought could win another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more medals than mark did know the guy</v>

2550
02:06:19.891 --> 02:06:21.360
<v Speaker 2>who likes pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2551
02:06:21.550 --> 02:06:23.790
<v Speaker 2>remember that he got shamed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fought shame.</v>

2552
02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I woulda did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'd have been him and they did that</v>

2553
02:06:26.371 --> 02:06:27.540
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you have done?</v>

2554
02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I would have immediately moved to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

2555
02:06:30.690 --> 02:06:35.690
<v Speaker 2>applied for Australian citizenship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would have came back and beat the</v>

2556
02:06:35.790 --> 02:06:37.830
<v Speaker 2>United States if they prosecuted me for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pot.</v>

2557
02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't prosecuting.</v>

2558
02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:41.250
<v Speaker 2>You thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they really?</v>

2559
02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about prosecuting.</v>

2560
02:06:43.050 --> 02:06:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went onto.</v>

2561
02:06:44.610 --> 02:06:45.421
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2562
02:06:45.421 --> 02:06:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it like South Carolina?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2563
02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all I know is a fight of been</v>

2564
02:06:50.190 --> 02:06:52.230
<v Speaker 2>phelps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've moved to Australia.</v>

2565
02:06:52.231 --> 02:06:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd applied for Australian citizenship</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would've come back and swam</v>

2566
02:06:55.621 --> 02:06:59.250
<v Speaker 2>against the United States and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick that up your ass.</v>

2567
02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:01.440
<v Speaker 2>That's very rude of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2568
02:07:01.441 --> 02:07:02.910
<v Speaker 2>at a renegade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2569
02:07:02.911 --> 02:07:05.040
<v Speaker 2>it ain't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rude of them.</v>

2570
02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:08.610
<v Speaker 2>After winning those medals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think he earned a joint?</v>

2571
02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2573
02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:16.350
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't have said nothing if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had guzzled a bottle of beer.</v>

2574
02:07:16.410 --> 02:07:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to find out what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Narc Dunham.</v>

2575
02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:21.300

2581
02:07:33.261 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 2>in in western Massachusetts or near</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amherst?</v>

2582
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:39.520
<v Speaker 4>She's an old lady and she grew her own</v>
<v Speaker 4>medical marijuana.</v>

2583
02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Her son was in the house and a swat team</v>
<v Speaker 4>showed up guns blazing for one plant,</v>

2584
02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:49.190
<v Speaker 4>one plant in this woman's backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how fucking ridiculous.</v>

2585
02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:51.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you all ridiculously are.</v>

2586
02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:53.530
<v Speaker 2>When I was governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll finish with this.</v>

2587
02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:57.370
<v Speaker 2>When I was governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a three panel myself.</v>

2588
02:07:57.730 --> 02:08:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Kathleen blatch who was head of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota Supreme Court and the attorney</v>

2589
02:08:01.871 --> 02:08:05.050
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the three of us with the pardon board</v>

2590
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:07.570
<v Speaker 2>where we could expunge records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2591
02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:13.000
<v Speaker 2>And I was glad they thought like me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everybody that came to us that</v>

2592
02:08:13.001 --> 02:08:16.330
<v Speaker 2>had a marijuana conviction of 10:20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

2593
02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:21.160
<v Speaker 2>we cleaned it off and one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll always remember wally here,</v>

2594
02:08:21.190 --> 02:08:23.680
<v Speaker 2>this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

2595
02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:27.400
<v Speaker 2>when he sat down in front of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I did,</v>

2596
02:08:27.401 --> 02:08:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I looked at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2597
02:08:28.241 --> 02:08:30.310
<v Speaker 2>how are you and your sister getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>along?</v>

2598
02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:32.110
<v Speaker 2>And he smiled at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2599
02:08:32.111 --> 02:08:33.640
<v Speaker 2>we're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2600
02:08:33.641 --> 02:08:34.960
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to check.</v>

2601
02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:39.610
<v Speaker 2>You know what happened to this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 18 years old at home.</v>

2602
02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:43.300
<v Speaker 2>His little sister was going to dare at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

2603
02:08:43.301 --> 02:08:48.301
<v Speaker 2>you know that dare class while they</v>
<v Speaker 2>teach at dare to turn everyone in to</v>

2604
02:08:48.491 --> 02:08:48.880
<v Speaker 2>rap.</v>

2605
02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Everybody turned them in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy's got a bag of weed in his</v>

2606
02:08:53.621 --> 02:08:57.040
<v Speaker 2>bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His little sister sees it,</v>

2607
02:08:57.550 --> 02:09:00.940
<v Speaker 2>calls the police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police come.</v>

2608
02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:05.830
<v Speaker 2>She's there to let them in so they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>need a warrant and they go bust her</v>

2609
02:09:05.831 --> 02:09:09.490
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She ends up her brother and her brother</v>

2610
02:09:09.491 --> 02:09:14.491
<v Speaker 2>now has had this on his record for 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking years of marijuana bust that</v>

2611
02:09:15.791 --> 02:09:20.791
<v Speaker 2>his sister turned him over on because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was at Derr and Derr said your rad</v>

2612
02:09:22.031 --> 02:09:25.540
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the sister thinks she's doing the</v>

2613
02:09:25.541 --> 02:09:29.560
<v Speaker 2>right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puts her brother in jail for having a</v>

2614
02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:32.080
<v Speaker 2>bag of weed in his bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sad.</v>

2615
02:09:32.210 --> 02:09:35.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you and your sister getting</v>

2616
02:09:35.231 --> 02:09:36.430
<v Speaker 2>along?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said we're fine,</v>

2617
02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:40.420
<v Speaker 2>and I sit and we cleaned his record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wiped it right off of there.</v>

2618
02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Now who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that for child molesters,</v>

2619
02:09:44.411 --> 02:09:49.411
<v Speaker 2>who came in and I had a girl there who</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to testify against this guy so we</v>

2620
02:09:51.491 --> 02:09:52.324
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't do it.</v>

2621
