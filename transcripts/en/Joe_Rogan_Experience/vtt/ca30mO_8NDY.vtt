<v Speaker 1>Is it live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says it's alive.</v>

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.010

<v Speaker 1>This is it for.</v>

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely more of an echo in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this room.</v>

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to do some tweaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 1>this is episode number one in the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

8
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's fucking up already.</v>

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Jesus does extra mics on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all the mics on.</v>

10
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mics are off now.</v>

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds bad.</v>

12
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changed everything.</v>

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your wizard.</v>

14
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>How'd you notice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could feel it.</v>

15
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>He could sense it in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should be behind a curtain.</v>

16
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Like the wizard of Oz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>What color was the wizard of Oz curtain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was green,</v>

18
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't it?</v>

19
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Ain't no city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emerald city.</v>

22
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Gregory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>

23
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I feel so happy to be here on the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

24
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm honored.</v>

25
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm honored that you're number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.641
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>this is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck crazy.</v>

28
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just gave me a tour of this place and</v>

29
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the first half and was like,</v>

30
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's he going to do with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this space?</v>

31
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Speaker 1>The back half is bigger than the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

32
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a gym.</v>

33
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An actual full gym.</v>

34
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't like going places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

35
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Alright here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch your,</v>

36
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Speaker 1>your tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your sauna does a 47 yard indoor archery</v>

37
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:28.334
<v Speaker 1>range in here.</v>

38
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.180
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.373
<v Speaker 1>It's why not fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the big thing is to set up the </v>

40
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>studio and have it as close to the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>one as possible.</v>

41
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.993
<v Speaker 1>We basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we built it sort of the only </v>

42
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sky,</v>

43
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to octo lights.</v>

44
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Now we have clouds in the sky instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>

45
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Decided to mix it up a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the curtain color.</v>

46
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.923
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels the same as the other one now </v>

47
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.163
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dimensions or are they exact </v>

48
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.840
<v Speaker 1>dimensions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very close.</v>

49
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a standalone.</v>

50
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was built so it was built to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same size.</v>

51
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this did not exist.</v>

52
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>So this is all constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

53
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all these ideas like,</v>

54
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:13.484
<v Speaker 1>well I'll do it this way and I'll do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way and I'll make a table that's </v>

55
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

56
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.703
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then as time went on and I started </v>

57
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>doing the planning and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

58
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:21.100
<v Speaker 1>do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

59
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I want to change much at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

60
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Like this table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all is giant.</v>

61
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Like I love this table and it's got all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird history to it.</v>

62
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>A little bend to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Well when we got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wood hadn't been killed.</v>

64
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Killed dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiln dried.</v>

65
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.873
<v Speaker 1>So it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would sits out or it goes and where it </v>

67
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:42.824
<v Speaker 1>gets damp and then when it dries out it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to warp a little bit and change </v>

68
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:48.044
<v Speaker 1>and shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a little warp to it at this </v>

69
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got History.</v>

70
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.500
<v Speaker 1>It's got history and the red brick wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks exactly the same.</v>

71
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.993
<v Speaker 1>Pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty close per Roland Cheney's over </v>

72
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his spot,</v>

73
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like it doesn't,</v>

74
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I have to remind myself that we're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new spot.</v>

75
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.893
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after we do a few episodes here will be </v>

77
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

78
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the spot.</v>

79
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if I companion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

80
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.533
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially once the booze and starts </v>

81
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:19.954
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once the boozing and the weeds start </v>

82
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>again in November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard has that been for you?</v>

83
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super easy.</v>

84
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.063
<v Speaker 1>Like is he the other day went to Mexican</v>
<v Speaker 1>food and I wanted a Margarita and I </v>

85
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

86
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't have a margaret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

87
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.043
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's literally my only craving people </v>

88
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His initial thing wasn't quitting.</v>

89
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.054
<v Speaker 1>We'd write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The initial thing was just getting Bert </v>

90
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Kreischer to not die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like our idea was like,</v>

91
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we can get them to go sober</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a month.</v>

92
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

93
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I can run a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

94
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucked this.</v>

95
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to run a marathon.</v>

96
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.891
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

97
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>how about instead of you running a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon,</v>

98
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>we just have you do 15 hot yoga classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

99
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:59.471
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be easy,</v>

100
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:00.304
<v Speaker 1>but she hasn't even done one yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know if it's easy and now </v>

101
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're slogging away through like,</v>

102
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I think they're all like number six or </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

103
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Do we have video of a bird in a hot yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>

104
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Video.</v>

105
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

106
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>they take videos after him and tom get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and they're both,</v>

107
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beet red and it's covered in sweat.</v>

108
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty obviously drenched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but burdens done amazing.</v>

109
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:22.864
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his blood pressure has dropped </v>

110
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:24.994
<v Speaker 1>radically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was actually on high blood pressure </v>

111
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:27.934
<v Speaker 1>medication and after this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after stopping drinking just </v>

112
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.550
<v Speaker 1>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his blood pressure dropped radically.</v>

113
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he doesn't even need blood </v>

114
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>pressure medication if he doesn't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

115
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing that's doing them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the booze.</v>

116
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

117
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.053
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people would come up to me about </v>

118
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:45.514
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd see the weed wasn't in the </v>

119
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The original bet was just no booze,</v>

120
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 1>which I thought would be pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>

121
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.091
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go,</v>

122
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no weed too.</v>

123
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.011
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

124
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

125
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just doing this for Bert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to stop.</v>

126
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>And then they were giving me a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

127
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>They started this Hashtag pray for Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Campaign because I was addicted to pot,</v>

128
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.550
<v Speaker 1>so I initially thought I'll just get off</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed and not tell them until the end and</v>

129
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:10.080
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking easy.</v>

130
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.923
<v Speaker 1>Pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>But then our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was making such a big deal out of it.</v>

132
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

133
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not smoking pot either,</v>

134
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>just to let the cat out of the bag.</v>

135
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Tom Ziglar already knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people would come up to you like,</v>

136
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.710
<v Speaker 1>like you're not eating for a month like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

137
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:23.501
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:24.191
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

139
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you off heroin for good.</v>

140
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's such a part of it for you is it</v>

141
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 1>never seemed like an addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drugs to,</v>

142
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.013
<v Speaker 1>for my vision of you doing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always mind expanding and it's </v>

143
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>always just to relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never like an addiction.</v>

144
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.744
<v Speaker 1>It never felt like you needed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't need it obviously </v>

145
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.163
<v Speaker 1>because I've had some great sets too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been very interesting because </v>

146
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I usually like to go on state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

147
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done that at all though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

148
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>no pot for 17 days.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So no pot for 17 days or do you miss it </v>

150
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>the most before going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

151

<v Speaker 1>I haven't missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

152
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.343
<v Speaker 1>It's been weird.</v>

153
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.293
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's going gonna be a moment </v>

154
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:08.421
<v Speaker 1>where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

155
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:09.254
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have some weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little nervous about smoking </v>

156
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:11.920
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

157
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.913
<v Speaker 1>because I know I'm going to get so high </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm be so paranoid and all these </v>

158
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.830
<v Speaker 1>demons are going to come creeping up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into my consciousness.</v>

159
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:22.831
<v Speaker 1>He gets paranoid psychic demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is going to come floating by.</v>

160
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like that first orgasm after you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your prostate removed.</v>

161
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>

162
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like once,</v>

163
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.290
<v Speaker 1>once you're back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.124
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems like it seems like it's </v>

165
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 1>going to hit you way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

166
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:40.510
<v Speaker 1>way harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

167
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.353
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take a month off and then you get </v>

168
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:43.904
<v Speaker 1>back on the pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you know why everybody freaks out </v>

169
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.500
<v Speaker 1>when you get them high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

170
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>because we're so used to getting high </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will we get high.</v>

171
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.014
<v Speaker 1>It's no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when people don't get high and </v>

172
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:53.741
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

173
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll smoke a little weed with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't smoked pot.</v>

174
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like six months or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

175
00:06:57.891 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are fucked.</v>

176
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in a bad place.</v>

177
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a nice easy rhythm going.</v>

178
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I got the little vape pen and I'm seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm on the road,</v>

179
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thursday,</v>

180
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Friday night couple</v>

181
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.650
<v Speaker 1>hits and that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you never do it before shows,</v>

182
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>

183
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.410
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

184
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And you took a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

185
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.930
<v Speaker 1>when I first met you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we back in the day,</v>

186
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we first started out you would just</v>

187
00:07:25.691 --> 00:07:28.030
<v Speaker 1>quit boots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just quit.</v>

188
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And you weren't doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Pot,</v>

189
00:07:30.401 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 1>no booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

190
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Like what was it that made you realize I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could smoke a little weed?</v>

191
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.260
<v Speaker 2>It was New Year's eve of 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

192
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.590
<v Speaker 2>So I had not smoked pot for 14 years or </v>
<v Speaker 2>drank or anything.</v>

193
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm standing outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Improv in San Francisco and I'm with,</v>

194
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.903
<v Speaker 2>I won't mention the manager's name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it manager who smokes a lot of pot </v>

195
00:07:58.161 --> 00:07:58.994
<v Speaker 2>that we all know and love and the entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>cast of the marijuana logs this Doug </v>

<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

197
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:05.294
<v Speaker 2>a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm Brian Hossein and they're all </v>

198
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a weird thing where,</v>

199
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:12.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever done New </v>

200
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.083
<v Speaker 2>Year's eve in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's like three different venues </v>

201
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 2>that all do comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 2>there's cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the punchline and then there's a</v>

203
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 2>big theater that the pal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a the palace of fine arts or whatever.</v>

204
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.073
<v Speaker 2>And then there's an after party at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>punchline and it's the greatest after </v>

205
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:28.374
<v Speaker 2>party because usually go on the road and</v>
<v Speaker 2>after your show you're just kind of </v>

206
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>

207
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you got your opener or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you hang out.</v>

208
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 2>But this is always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

209
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 2>every Comic Sans Francisco comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and I'm standing up front and,</v>

210
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:41.720
<v Speaker 2>and they're standing there with a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hand it to me and I just,</v>

211
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I felt like this is the moment I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to smoke pot again.</v>

212
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.350
<v Speaker 2>And I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

213
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.150
<v Speaker 2>and then the weirdest fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened is I went down to help molly,</v>

214
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had a,</v>

215
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.124
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the van coming from the palace and she </v>

216
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.184
<v Speaker 2>had a box of booze that had been the </v>
<v Speaker 2>backstage bar and she's carrying a </v>

217
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.871
<v Speaker 2>bottle of vodka and she's walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the steps and this group we were</v>

218
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 2>talking about San Francisco homeless </v>
<v Speaker 2>people before group of like,</v>

219
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like 21 and they're like street </v>

220
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 2>urchins there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

221
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>

222
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the warrior has come out.</v>

223
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like that type of person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they grabbed the bottle of booze out</v>

224
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 2>of molly's hand and I'm standing there </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Todd Barry,</v>

225
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Paula Tompkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

226
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I think Greg proops is like two guys in </v>
<v Speaker 2>suits.</v>

227
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.380
<v Speaker 2>And so they grabbed this bottle from </v>
<v Speaker 2>molly and she chases after them.</v>

228
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing this?</v>

229
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Not your booze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the clubs,</v>

230
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:44.250
<v Speaker 2>booze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she runs right in the middle of them</v>

231
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.970
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

232
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.823
<v Speaker 2>she grabs a bottle and she's fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this woman over it and these guys </v>

233
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 2>are surrounding her and I run in and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>grab her and start pulling her out.</v>

234
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys a fist cocked,</v>

258
00:11:06.681 --> 00:11:09.580
<v Speaker 3>is just a little bit too lenient with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their homeless population.</v>

259
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.423
<v Speaker 3>There were just a little silly with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we were talking about how they have </v>

263
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:23.714

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.520
<v Speaker 2>People are growing a little toilet paper</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

282
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little dog is a.</v>

283
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.890
<v Speaker 1>he's not that little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a medium sized dog.</v>

284
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.110
<v Speaker 1>He's a Shiba Inu English bulldog mix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

285
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

287
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>he has an issue with any dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little cunt,</v>

288
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>like any dogs or her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the poppy is 11 months old.</v>

289
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I have a golden retriever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the sweetest dog in the world.</v>

290
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.970
<v Speaker 1>He's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can't go near the bulldog.</v>

291
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Bulldog beat him in his face when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a puppy.</v>

292
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Speaker 1>No Shit really hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

293
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:49.501
<v Speaker 1>put a big cut in his nose to the vet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so to have the dogs sleep in this</v>

294
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 1>one little contained area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they opened up the door and wandered</v>

295
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 1>around the house and just took a shit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the living room,</v>

296
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>pissed on the wall and they did all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other dogs in the house,</v>

297
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the other dogs.</v>

298
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.221
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

299
00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:06.054
<v Speaker 1>if he's in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to shit all over the </v>

300
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 1>place and mark this place up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never,</v>

301
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:09.723
<v Speaker 1>never done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was really interesting like dog </v>

302
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were pissed that the other dog</v>

303
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.583
<v Speaker 1>gets to be in better spots than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they decided to shit in the living </v>

304
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:21.910
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

305
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their statement,</v>

306
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.160
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because the big one,</v>

307
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I could have him with the new dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

308
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.530
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves them,</v>

309
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 1>they play together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a great time,</v>

310
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:40.180
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't trust that other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are you going to do?</v>

311
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Shoot the other one in the head hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident?</v>

312
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep them separated.</v>

313
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

314
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I can have morale and together when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

315
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

316
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.610
<v Speaker 1>he's a cool dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes people.</v>

317
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 1>He loves people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people come over,</v>

318
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:57.200
<v Speaker 1>he loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

319
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>he's a very sweet dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't.</v>

320
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 1>It's apparently an English bulldog </v>
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>

321
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 1>They just do not like other dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't.</v>

322
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.120
<v Speaker 1>They want dogs and they and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of health issues.</v>

323
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Say fucking wheeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had two surgeries on his knees.</v>

324
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Both his front knees are fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just got like,</v>

325
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible thing what they've done.</v>

326
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.593
<v Speaker 1>Designing them like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking them and putting them into this </v>

327
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 1>shape that it's really not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

328
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.833
<v Speaker 1>Shortening their nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's really fucked up what </v>

329
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

330
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>just hit that breed may need to be put </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

331
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

332
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.643
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did anybody decide to have a dog </v>

333
00:14:37.661 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 1>that has a flat face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't breathe.</v>

334
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:41.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't walk very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

335
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.750
<v Speaker 1>they're always in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just want to lie down.</v>

336
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Like those dogs aren't done on ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasers.</v>

337
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.050
<v Speaker 1>You throw a ball to an English bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

338
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not running after that thing.</v>

339
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Everything hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just waddle everywhere.</v>

340
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.410
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because the original bull dog</v>

341
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.720
<v Speaker 1>was a dog that they literally used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use for what they call bull baiting with</v>

342
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:06.344
<v Speaker 1>bull baiting is they would tie a bull </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and so it couldn't go anywhere and </v>

343
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 1>then they would sic the dogs on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

344
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what a bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

345
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the point of that?</v>

346
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to fuck with the ball.</v>

347
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

348
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a betting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:29.141
<v Speaker 1>so like a bloodsport thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's originally what a bull dog looked</v>

350
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.113
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what American bulldog looks </v>

351
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.264
<v Speaker 1>like now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>American bulldog is like sort of pit </v>

352
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:35.624
<v Speaker 1>bull ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but larger much larger American bulldog </v>

353
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.930
<v Speaker 1>has got kind of a pit bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like face,</v>

354
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of a flat nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like an English bulldog.</v>

355
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.500
<v Speaker 1>They're really smart dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very good dogs.</v>

356
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Like a buddy of mine had one and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>great dog there.</v>

357
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Tanks filled like this big jacked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

358
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 1>but a totally functional dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run,</v>

359
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.300
<v Speaker 1>they use them for protection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

360
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

361
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 1>they're just really good dogs and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>English version of them is like,</v>

362
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 1>what that dog is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be fucking this up,</v>

363
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:14.051
<v Speaker 1>but I think they took the dog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another bread it down to this</v>

364
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 1>really gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute fat flat nose,</v>

365
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:19.004
<v Speaker 1>shitty breathing English bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they want it to look like the royal </v>

366
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:27.311
<v Speaker 1>family had the sisters only fuck your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister only fuck your sister.</v>

367
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 1>And then they took those properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

368
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

369
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

370
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Fuck your sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

371
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.560
<v Speaker 1>And then the baby's fuck each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your baby's fucking each other.</v>

372
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as Irish just,</v>

373
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

374
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.240
<v Speaker 1>it's weird that they all came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>

375
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wolf could fucking English bulldog and</v>

376
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.860
<v Speaker 1>get it pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's incredible.</v>

377
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:49.813
<v Speaker 1>It's like the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The genetics are the same and they </v>

378
00:16:51.981 --> 00:16:56.090
<v Speaker 1>didn't know this until like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say less than a decade ago.</v>

379
00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>They used to think that all wolves were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like wolves.</v>

380
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.633
<v Speaker 1>And then dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like a combination of a bunch of </v>

381
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:04.754
<v Speaker 1>different things while candidates like </v>
<v Speaker 1>jackals and coyotes and all these </v>

382
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:09.764
<v Speaker 1>different things and that we had somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another bread them down because </v>

383
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 1>there's no real record of how anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did that.</v>

384
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 1>And if you go back to the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>domesticated dogs spans over 10,000</v>

385
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:21.800
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it predates human history.</v>

386
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.650
<v Speaker 1>We don't really don't know how the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody made a Chihuahua.</v>

387
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.663
<v Speaker 1>We just know that it's Chihuahuas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that the first domesticated dogs </v>

388
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>were the ones that basically we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

389
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>docile.</v>

390
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.930
<v Speaker 1>They could come near the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

391
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And so the ones that were friendlier and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer,</v>

392
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>captain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed the other ones.</v>

393
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I put up a picture on instagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

394
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>a re posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sent me with this fucking lady,</v>

395
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.553
<v Speaker 1>found a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young coyote and she thought it was a </v>

396
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 1>dog and she washed it</v>

397
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 2>and they put it up on facebook and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of aggressive,</v>

398
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.233
<v Speaker 2>but now it's sleeping and it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little coyote and this lady's washing a </v>

399
00:18:01.841 --> 00:18:03.650
<v Speaker 2>fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just writing.</v>

400
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:13.070
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a period that just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunges at attacks are.</v>

401
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.300
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that Chamberlain road.</v>

402
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.130
<v Speaker 2>No collar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems a bit aggressive.</v>

403
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Also doesn't like bass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was pretty dirty.</v>

404
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took most of the night,</v>

405
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.690
<v Speaker 2>but she's resting comfy now on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

406
00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:31.691
<v Speaker 2>That is a fucking coyote obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's obviously a little one too.</v>

407
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.970
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a young one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a yearling or something.</v>

408
00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't domesticate a coyote,</v>

409
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.530
<v Speaker 2>but you can in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy</v>

410
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know him,</v>

411
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 1>but I follow his instagram account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>

412
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

413
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.593
<v Speaker 1>oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy has dogs that he uses to hunt </v>

414
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 1>coyotes width,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really crazy to kill.</v>

415
00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Hunt to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he found coyote puppies in a den and</v>

416
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:02.604
<v Speaker 1>so they found these coyote puppies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the den and he felt bad that these </v>

417
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.263
<v Speaker 1>little coyote puppies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know what happened to the </v>

418
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they raised one,</v>

419
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.920
<v Speaker 1>so he took a coyote puppy in and now it </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives with them.</v>

420
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.933
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And it gets a lot like the only problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when they feed it.</v>

422
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.743
<v Speaker 1>Is that him?</v>

423
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a German shepherd.</v>

424
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

425
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 1>but he's had it since it was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dog,</v>

426
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's him,</v>

427
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but this guy has all this video of it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his site of him with this coyote puppy,</v>

428
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:42.270
<v Speaker 1>with his other dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all barking together and shit.</v>

429
00:19:42.271 --> 00:19:43.104
<v Speaker 1>And he said the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only problem they get along great </v>

430
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:45.924
<v Speaker 1>until it's time to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when Simon to eat the coyote is </v>

431
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:49.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

432
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

433
00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 1>This is like full feral as soon as it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to eat.</v>

434
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:56.124
<v Speaker 1>But he's had the thing since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said it was like a couple </v>

435
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.140
<v Speaker 1>months old when he got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just freshly weaned.</v>

436
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

437
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:04.080
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can raise them.</v>

438
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.860
<v Speaker 1>But they're wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolves.</v>

439
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 1>My friends have a Dingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did it eat?</v>

440
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:11.004
<v Speaker 1>The baby</v>

441
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.710
<v Speaker 4>dangling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A dingo ate my baby.</v>

442
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.003
<v Speaker 2>And this thing is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get some food on the counter and </v>

443
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:21.220
<v Speaker 2>it's four feet off the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking thing.</v>

444
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.990
<v Speaker 2>You leave the room for one second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That food is gone.</v>

445
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

446
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.730
<v Speaker 1>they're just feral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

447
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.743
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my puppy was like that when he was </v>

448
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.580
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I was.</v>

449
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how puppies are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot because I haven't had a </v>

450
00:20:32.261 --> 00:20:37.261
<v Speaker 1>puppy in a while and I was eating and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>put some food on his plate and he saw it</v>

451
00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:39.100
<v Speaker 1>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They jumped up,</v>

453
00:20:41.111 --> 00:20:41.944
<v Speaker 1>put his feet on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaned in and tried to try to bite it </v>

<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

479
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird relationship that humans </v>
<v Speaker 5>have with dogs because you know a lot of</v>

480
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:45.394
<v Speaker 5>people have dogs to sleep in their beds </v>
<v Speaker 5>that come with you places they hop in </v>

481
00:21:48.401 --> 00:21:49.234
<v Speaker 5>the car and then then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>assholes that have those emotional </v>

482
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:55.270
<v Speaker 5>support dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>what is the jury out on that still?</v>

484
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:03.660
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of modern 21st century life that we</v>

485
00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:07.090
<v Speaker 5>allow that stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in a fucking restaurant,</v>

486
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.313
<v Speaker 5>like a really nice restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This lady came in and she's a lady from </v>

487
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.060

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.923
<v Speaker 5>Very pretty lady.</v>

492
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.580
<v Speaker 5>She hit the skids though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

493
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.730
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's bringing,</v>

494
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.970
<v Speaker 5>brings in this fucking dog and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people are looking at her like what?</v>

497
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Speaker 5>sitting there eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's dogs on the floor where like</v>

498
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:40.520

<v Speaker 5>pick it up and wipe it off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

556

<v Speaker 1>civilization as that you get to share </v>

570

571
00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.053
<v Speaker 1>listened to each other's music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to each other's jokes and </v>

<v Speaker 1>appropriation,</v>

576
00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:12.464
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they thought that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>white girls like Katy Perry wearing the </v>

577
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:17.360
<v Speaker 1>geisha outfit was cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

579
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:24.170
<v Speaker 1>we're happy that people love Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and that they do that.</v>

580
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.670
<v Speaker 1>They're happy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>of respect and I think as minorities,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You want to be black,</v>

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.200
<v Speaker 3>like we get it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>well he's said that the other guy who </v>

609
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:38.990
<v Speaker 3>was the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenyon Martin is.</v>

610
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.550
<v Speaker 3>There was a picture of his but it's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>removed.</v>

611
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he's a dummy and that Jeremy Lin </v>

612
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 3>guys are very classic character for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you answered it.</v>

613
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.030
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dreads or not black.</v>

614
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 3>They were a sign of people not washing </v>
<v Speaker 3>their hair.</v>

615
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 3>That dates back to the Greeks and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Romans.</v>

616
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:58.140
<v Speaker 3>There's ancient sculptures of Caucasian </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking people with dreadlocks.</v>

617
00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.393
<v Speaker 3>Dreadlocks were worn by the vikings is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not a black thing because some black </v>

618
00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:05.790
<v Speaker 3>people wear them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does not mean it's the idea that this is</v>

619
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:06.624
<v Speaker 3>a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cultural appropriation that </v>

620
00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:08.544
<v Speaker 3>people go around pointing at people </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying you can't wear your hair a </v>

621
00:28:12.451 --> 00:28:13.284
<v Speaker 3>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're limiting hairstyles and it's </v>

622
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:19.470
<v Speaker 3>just so many people are just looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward to criticizing,</v>

623
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 3>getting shitty with people over almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

624
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just no.</v>

625
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:23.913
<v Speaker 2>The whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole energy of this country is </v>

626
00:28:26.441 --> 00:28:30.340
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be complete assimilation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>

627
00:28:30.341 --> 00:28:31.174
<v Speaker 2>let's pick the best shit from each </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and may get just American </v>

628
00:28:34.661 --> 00:28:38.290
<v Speaker 2>hodgepodge and that's what it's about </v>
<v Speaker 2>with gentrification.</v>

629
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.153
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want people to not all live in one </v>

630
00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:44.170
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and all dress exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as each other.</v>

631
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.140
<v Speaker 2>You want there to be a merging of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different looks,</v>

632
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.150
<v Speaker 2>different addresses.</v>

635
00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.940

<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

636

<v Speaker 2>That's what we fucking did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

637
00:28:57.011 --> 00:28:59.890

<v Speaker 2>famine,</v>

639
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.380
<v Speaker 2>they just got off the boat hungry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they threw a fucking uniform,</v>

640
00:29:05.381 --> 00:29:10.060
<v Speaker 2>honest and sent us into fight lines </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the south or you were a cop</v>

641
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 3>and then after that they got into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trades.</v>

642
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.090
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of Irish people in unions.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you were born with a certain ethnicity.</v>

673
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.003
<v Speaker 3>You don't own that ethnicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you can keep other people </v>

674
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:08.400
<v Speaker 3>from enjoying it and appreciate the </v>

<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We were criticizing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

678
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:20.370
<v Speaker 3>based on various aspects of culture that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they enjoy.</v>

679
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 3>It's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insanity.</v>

680
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.753
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about how Italians have affected </v>

681
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:28.563
<v Speaker 3>the like fashion in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean from high fashion all the way </v>

682
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:37.381
<v Speaker 3>down to like the disco era when all of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden music were all calling themselves</v>

683
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Gadi and they were all calling the Al </v>
<v Speaker 3>Capone.</v>

<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

687
00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:52.420
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid and that's my culture.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you can have it.</v>

689
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.573
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love one of the seminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments in American culture was </v>

690
00:31:56.921 --> 00:31:59.950
<v Speaker 3>aerosmith,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's what America's bus today.</v>

693
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.993
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

694
00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.200
<v Speaker 3>it's kids today looking to point the </v>
<v Speaker 3>finger,</v>

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.383
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He maybe he is violent.</v>

837
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's a little nuts.</v>

838
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.300
<v Speaker 5>He likes guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I've never heard his rap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do we have even wrapped available?</v>

840
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.860
<v Speaker 5>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure rich guys who grow up rich,</v>

841
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:45.723
<v Speaker 5>who severely overcompensate because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like they live in this soft </v>

842
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:53.960
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they fucking go to crossfit every day</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't think Tom Hanks was beating his </v>

845
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:01.150
<v Speaker 5>ass at night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't.</v>

846
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.253
<v Speaker 5>I just think what he's doing is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to be hard and trying to respond </v>

847
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 5>to Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 5>calling them out about that.</v>

848
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 5>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on kid.</v>

<v Speaker 5>If he's under 23,</v>

854
00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:25.430
<v Speaker 5>I'll give them a pass.</v>

<v Speaker 5>with the mafia,</v>

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.960
<v Speaker 5>but he's not like Dr Dre is kid.</v>

865
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:58.480
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he did his job or not.</v>

866
00:39:58.481 --> 00:39:59.314

867
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:00.574
<v Speaker 5>being around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just got to assume that if you're </v>

868
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:03.250
<v Speaker 5>doing that many movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not around.</v>

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.860
<v Speaker 5>It's producing to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't he?</v>

870
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.750
<v Speaker 5>Didn't you have a studio also?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

871
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.090
<v Speaker 5>I think he's got his hand in a studio as</v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

872
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.660
<v Speaker 5>That's always amazing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're being handed literally.</v>

873
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:14.494
<v Speaker 5>If you're Tom Hanks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're the first guy that gets offered </v>

874
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.180
<v Speaker 5>every script.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in your age range that comes along.</v>

<v Speaker 5>produce.</v>

876
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:24.220

<v Speaker 5>of producing movies.</v>

877
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.083

<v Speaker 5>but what have been enjoying hanging out </v>

<v Speaker 5>with your family a little bit.</v>

879
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.713
<v Speaker 5>I got weirded out with him when he </v>
<v Speaker 5>started doing those movies about like </v>

880
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.550

885
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:44.763

888
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:49.403
<v Speaker 5>this just seems to me like something </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone does when they don't have </v>

889
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:54.730
<v Speaker 5>anything else to do.</v>

891
00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.053

<v Speaker 5>would ever chance it had of upgrading </v>

892

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>did they want to upgrade the fucking.</v>

897
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:16.510

<v Speaker 2>hundred yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and um,</v>

934
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:11.414
<v Speaker 2>in the fucking eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to beat a bit about the beach </v>

<v Speaker 2>boys phoning it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties,</v>

936
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

937
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.480
<v Speaker 2>You can tell they're just looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>their watch away.</v>

938
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Big California Yoga.</v>

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what though,</v>

940
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.840
<v Speaker 2>fucking gives you goosebumps when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear it.</v>

941
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really because you will,</v>

942
00:43:28.311 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 2>you realize he's not going to be doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this much longer.</v>

943
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

944
00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:33.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that way when I see the stones.</v>

945
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to see the stock and show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you see?</v>

946
00:43:36.141 --> 00:43:36.974
<v Speaker 2>The stones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw them in giant stadium and then I </v>

947
00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:44.531
<v Speaker 2>saw them at the staples center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard Mick Jagger is a very frugal.</v>

948
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a nice one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard of you.</v>

949
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

950
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Like how could you be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

951
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.540
<v Speaker 2>He's got to be worth hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>

952
00:43:51.541 --> 00:43:52.374
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still performing all over the </v>

953
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:54.320
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

954
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Just saving that cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

955
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Putting it away for a rainy day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's got a lot.</v>

956
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of wives.</v>

957
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.060
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a bunch of baby mamas,</v>

958
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.500
<v Speaker 2>but still the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy money.</v>

959
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:08.660
<v Speaker 2>He's got a recent one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he?</v>

960
00:44:08.661 --> 00:44:09.494
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knocked a checkup a couple of years </v>

961
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.390
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mc.</v>

962
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.793
<v Speaker 2>She's hot too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's Brazilian and I think </v>

963
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:17.960
<v Speaker 2>she's like 28 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how old is he?</v>

964
00:44:17.961 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Seventy five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ballerina.</v>

965
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Feel like she's a ballerina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he's 75,</v>

966
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.863
<v Speaker 2>you're guaranteeing that this child will</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience his father's death in the </v>

967
00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:28.100
<v Speaker 2>first 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of his life,</v>

968
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 2>you don't want something really crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens like technologically,</v>

969
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 1>like medical technology gets to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where they can reverse aging,</v>

970
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.083
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently when you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are like legitimate </v>

971
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:45.560
<v Speaker 1>scientists about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

972
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:46.403
<v Speaker 1>this is not outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility by any stretch of the </v>

973
00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:51.270
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like within our lifetime.</v>

974
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.133
<v Speaker 1>It is entirely possible that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to stop the aging </v>

975
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:56.960
<v Speaker 1>process dead in its tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

976
00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Well Silicon Valley believes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those dudes,</v>

977
00:45:00.091 --> 00:45:00.924
<v Speaker 1>if got think tanks gallon for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryogenically saving well cryogenics I </v>

978
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 1>would imagine if you do it regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet that difference.</v>

979
00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:08.733
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cryogenics is actually freezing the </v>

980
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:12.590
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

981
00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

982
00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therapy I would think would add some,</v>

983
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.620
<v Speaker 1>some time with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a company in northern California,</v>

984
00:45:19.621 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 1>the takes the blood of young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>injects it into the bodies of old people</v>

985
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:25.703
<v Speaker 1>and there's anecdotal research and </v>
<v Speaker 1>research with mice that points to the </v>

986
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's opposed to radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve behavior and energy and mice.</v>

987
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.073
<v Speaker 1>And conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they take the older mice is blood </v>

988
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.630
<v Speaker 1>and they put it in a younger mouse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger males like,</v>

989
00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.513
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All just starts acting like an old </v>

990
00:45:45.901 --> 00:45:47.820
<v Speaker 1>mouse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

991
00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:48.654
<v Speaker 1>And so we had um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Weinstein on the other day who </v>

992
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:53.154
<v Speaker 1>works for Peter Teal and Peter Teal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that billionaire guy in Silicon Valley </v>

993
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:57.563
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

994
00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:01.380
<v Speaker 1>he was the guy that funded that Hulk </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hogan lawsuit against Gawker.</v>

995
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.790
<v Speaker 1>That crushed Gawker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

996
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they outed him.</v>

997
00:46:04.141 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they outed him as being gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was really pissed at them.</v>

998
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:10.170
<v Speaker 1>They wrote some really shitty articles </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him and he was like,</v>

999
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1000
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.660
<v Speaker 1>How about I just use my money and crush </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

1001
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.420
<v Speaker 1>So he went after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

1002
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:16.254
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he's offering the women who </v>

1003
00:46:18.441 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 1>have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault.</v>

1004
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.300
<v Speaker 1>He's offering each one of them $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go after him.</v>

1005
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.150
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1007
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting,</v>

1008
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 1>very interesting character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but super rich,</v>

1009
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:35.250
<v Speaker 1>super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1010
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.010
<v Speaker 1>And so the rumor was that he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this therapy,</v>

1011
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:39.683
<v Speaker 1>but since I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that does not confirmed was </v>

1012
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:47.420
<v Speaker 1>that Jamie Teal is not harvesting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood of the county.</v>

1013
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a good picture of Elon musk </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1014
00:46:50.971 --> 00:46:54.720
<v Speaker 1>trying to work on some kind of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>longevity thing.</v>

1015
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably working on everything.</v>

1016
00:46:56.461 --> 00:46:58.740
<v Speaker 1>That fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes me feel really stupid.</v>

1017
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.413
<v Speaker 1>He was at a comedy show once that I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that chick that he just dumped </v>

1018
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Depp's old girlfriend and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got legitimately nervous did he was in</v>

1019
00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:12.951
<v Speaker 1>the audience and the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bit about inventors.</v>

1020
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a guy like I as a comedian,</v>

1021
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:20.003
<v Speaker 1>and I hope this doesn't come out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong way in order for me to be able to </v>

1022
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 1>get on stage in front of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and take the reins and go,</v>

1023
00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.133
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hundreds of people are going to all </v>

1024
00:47:28.771 --> 00:47:29.770
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>

1025
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm the funniest one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I merit you all being quiet for an hour.</v>

1026
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 2>You have to do mind games with yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

1027
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're starting out.</v>

1028
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.053
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes if it's a Gig I'm intimidated </v>

1029
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:44.440
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll think to myself,</v>

1030
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm smarter than everybody in this room</v>

1031
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:49.643
<v Speaker 2>and I know I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to tell myself that that's a </v>

1032
00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:55.620
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's so hard when you get up.</v>

1033
00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:56.813
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I did a Gig at this very </v>

1034
00:47:59.521 --> 00:48:03.150
<v Speaker 2>hipster place in New York and Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 2>Depp was in the audience and he was with</v>

1035
00:48:03.151 --> 00:48:03.984
<v Speaker 2>some fucking model who looked like she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was literally starving to death and </v>

1036
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:11.400
<v Speaker 2>everybody in the crowd was just in black</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were all here.</v>

1037
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.160
<v Speaker 2>And I really felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said it on stage,</v>

1038
00:48:14.161 --> 00:48:14.994
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually I just tell myself I'm better </v>

1039
00:48:16.651 --> 00:48:19.620
<v Speaker 2>looking and I'm richer than everybody in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience.</v>

1040
00:48:19.621 --> 00:48:23.040
<v Speaker 2>And tonight I realized I'm the poorest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugliest person here</v>

1041
00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 1>trying to convince yourself I'm the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking down a of ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1044
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.450
<v Speaker 6>shimming onstage.</v>

1045
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.690
<v Speaker 2>But that's the mind game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the trick.</v>

1046
00:48:45.691 --> 00:48:47.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like visualization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1047
00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Why that trick you're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I get scared.</v>

1048
00:48:50.611 --> 00:48:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I get intimidated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>

1049
00:48:52.501 --> 00:48:54.480
<v Speaker 2>But when I was starting out I used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1050
00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I come back and I look at like </v>

1051
00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.350
<v Speaker 1>starting out when you and I both started</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1052
00:49:00.351 --> 00:49:03.950
<v Speaker 1>we were both like 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck does a 21 year old have to</v>

1053
00:49:03.951 --> 00:49:04.920
<v Speaker 1>say about anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1054
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:06.890
<v Speaker 1>we're so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1055
00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I imagined myself today going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage at 21,</v>

1056
00:49:12.651 --> 00:49:13.484
<v Speaker 1>like being in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching myself going onstage at 21 and </v>

1057
00:49:15.951 --> 00:49:17.840
<v Speaker 1>just thinking what a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1058
00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know anything about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.310
<v Speaker 1>You're basically fresh out of high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1060
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Just paying your own bills for like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years.</v>

1061
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here you are talking into a </v>

1062
00:49:28.461 --> 00:49:30.620
<v Speaker 1>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're grown adults.</v>

1063
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I went on stage exactly 16 days </v>
<v Speaker 1>after it was legal for me to drink.</v>

1064
00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.730
<v Speaker 2>And you get middle aged people that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>real jobs,</v>

1066
00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:45.260
<v Speaker 2>mortgages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortgages,</v>

1067
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.410
<v Speaker 1>back from the war.</v>

1068
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.960
<v Speaker 2>People with college degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>master's degrees.</v>

1069
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.930
<v Speaker 1>People have pulled people out of burning</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>

1070
00:49:53.931 --> 00:49:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1071
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I've lost friends and gunfights guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>widows 21 year old talking to a widow,</v>

1072
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.550
<v Speaker 1>trying to make them laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking idiot.</v>

1073
00:50:01.551 --> 00:50:02.384
<v Speaker 1>I was</v>

1074
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:06.300
<v Speaker 6>but this.</v>

1075
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.553
<v Speaker 1>But there's no other way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Dane Cook said this once and is a </v>

1076
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:15.330
<v Speaker 1>very insightful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1077
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.750
<v Speaker 1>if I had to do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've had to start comedy again.</v>

1078
00:50:18.751 --> 00:50:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1079
00:50:20.581 --> 00:50:22.140
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so overwhelming.</v>

1080
00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:24.780
<v Speaker 1>The idea of starting again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 years in,</v>

1081
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:27.620
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind what</v>

1083
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.160
<v Speaker 2>we've done with podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We start over again.</v>

1084
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean we had momentum because we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been in an entertainment,</v>

1085
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like it was the healthiest </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in the world,</v>

1086
00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:44.081
<v Speaker 2>the podcast for me because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been all these years would do</v>

1087
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:48.500
<v Speaker 2>and stand up and you get to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where I always think of it as like</v>

1088
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:51.830
<v Speaker 2>your bottom and your top rise over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1089
00:50:51.831 --> 00:50:52.664
<v Speaker 2>They should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should get to like the worst bomb </v>

1090
00:50:54.381 --> 00:50:55.214
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have now is so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than the worst bomb you would </v>

1091
00:50:58.211 --> 00:51:00.050
<v Speaker 2>have had five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago,</v>

1092
00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:03.550
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you do need to challenge yourself</v>

1093
00:51:03.551 --> 00:51:04.384
<v Speaker 2>and like with the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole different rhythm and if </v>

1094
00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.533
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting immediate feedback </v>

1095
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:10.190
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and plus it's a business.</v>

1096
00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:12.250
<v Speaker 2>You've got to build it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get your equipment and you</v>

1097
00:51:12.251 --> 00:51:13.084
<v Speaker 2>got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1098
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.660
<v Speaker 2>sell ads and all that shit.</v>

1099
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.493
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it was really good at woke me up </v>

1100
00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:17.781
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1101
00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:18.620
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got.</v>

1102
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 2>It gave me confidence that I could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new.</v>

1103
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.300
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because you already </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the radio show,</v>

1104
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:24.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1105
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I did the podcast about a year after I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started the radio show.</v>

1106
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.840
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize?</v>

1107
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Like eight or nine years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1108
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of it at all that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought of the podcast is just fun.</v>

1109
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was something to do for a goof and I </v>

1110
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:42.941
<v Speaker 2>did it for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like irregularly before I ever wanted up</v>

1111
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:43.993
<v Speaker 2>committing to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like every few weeks and then </v>

1112
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:46.583
<v Speaker 2>finally in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the green room we would do in the </v>

1113
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.850
<v Speaker 2>greenroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz would always get mad.</v>

1114
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.043
<v Speaker 3>Shut that fucking thing off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys were always fucking online to </v>

1115
00:51:54.201 --> 00:51:56.180
<v Speaker 3>fuck around online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut it off.</v>

1116
00:51:56.181 --> 00:51:58.070
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll would get mad.</v>

1117
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like it.</v>

1118
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.340
<v Speaker 3>You waste your fucking time on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

1119
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was relentless.</v>

1120
00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.360
<v Speaker 2>That's like the biggest part of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1121
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His podcast is gigantic for him.</v>

1122
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>up on this dark road.</v>

1127

<v Speaker 2>back of his house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>chewing down those.</v>

<v Speaker 2>His eyes are shut.</v>

1140
00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:00.760
<v Speaker 2>His eyes are shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how he does it.</v>

1141
00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't handle it</v>

1142
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:03.710
<v Speaker 3>in his eyes sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1143
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 3>I've been on the show before and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone says something,</v>

1144
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:08.623
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like we're having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation and someone says something </v>

1145
00:53:09.951 --> 00:53:10.850
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what do you mean by that?</v>

1146
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll have a talk.</v>

1147
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.240
<v Speaker 3>But if you say like Lee said something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1148
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:15.870
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

1149
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 3>lock up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just way too high to have this</v>

1150
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:26.030
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about how he</v>

1151
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.873
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like audio is the thing of the </v>

1152
00:53:29.071 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1153
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

1154
00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1155
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.633
<v Speaker 1>just seems like people like they always </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their phones while they're on tv or </v>

1156
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:37.014
<v Speaker 1>the watched the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking on their phone or </v>

1157
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:40.163
<v Speaker 1>they're looking through their phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're listening to things while </v>

1158
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:42.534
<v Speaker 1>they're doing other things are at what </v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1273
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:36.260
<v Speaker 1>The question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the fraud?</v>

1274
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Lance Mirror off a board member who </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiated the Weinstein.</v>

1275
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:40.243
<v Speaker 1>200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

1276
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 1>2015 contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said in an interview,</v>

1277
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:43.543
<v Speaker 1>and we've confirmed the board knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein had settled prior lawsuits </v>

1278
00:59:46.551 --> 00:59:47.384
<v Speaker 1>brought by various women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they assumed it was the coverup </v>

1279
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.790
<v Speaker 1>consensual affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure it was.</v>

1280
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.660
<v Speaker 1>The board's assumption does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute fraud on Weinstein's part.</v>

1281
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Scroll up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's keep going.</v>

1282
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>More surprisingly is how twc fired </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein's.</v>

1283
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Suppose Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Weinstein supposedly without giving a</v>

1284
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:10.694
<v Speaker 1>specific reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could potentially violate the </v>

1285
01:00:12.471 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>terms of the contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1286
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the kicker.</v>

1287
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:18.943
<v Speaker 1>Even if Weinstein had committed fraud by</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fully informing the board of </v>

1288
01:00:22.101 --> 01:00:22.934
<v Speaker 1>directors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contract says before he can be </v>

1289
01:00:24.711 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has the right to mediation.</v>

1290
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:29.360
<v Speaker 1>If that doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's entitled to arbitration.</v>

1291
01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.373
<v Speaker 1>He got neither.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was summarily fired and sources </v>

1292
01:00:32.391 --> 01:00:33.224
<v Speaker 1>connected with Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell tmz he was never given a specific </v>

1293
01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1294
01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting it.</v>

1295
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

1296
01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Where do you get the balls to fight</v>

1297
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.473
<v Speaker 1>back right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he feels like he's the only way </v>

1298
01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>to sort of reclaim some ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1299
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a way to look at it?</v>

1300
01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that mentality and you know,</v>

1301
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:58.460
<v Speaker 2>at that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power brokers that run Hollywood,</v>

1302
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all fucking.</v>

1303
01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.080
<v Speaker 2>It's trump is like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all aggression.</v>

1304
01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:05.190
<v Speaker 2>It's all come at you when you come here.</v>

1305
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:06.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's got to be a crazy position </v>

1306
01:01:09.121 --> 01:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the head of Miramax.</v>

1307
01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:12.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1308
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the biggest,</v>

1309
01:01:15.031 --> 01:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1310
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>What's the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the biggest studio,</v>

1311
01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>if it's not Miramax is universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miramax,</v>

1312
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>so at the very least he's responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some of the most iconic movies over.</v>

1313
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1314
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Certainly the most Oscar is of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>studio in the last year,</v>

1315
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everyone's kissing his ass.</v>

1316
01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massive amounts of power and this </v>

1317
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>influence over people like royalty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1318
01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Barks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all come,</v>

1319
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's at his whim constantly and </v>

1320
01:01:49.261 --> 01:01:50.094
<v Speaker 1>then tries to fuck all these starlets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if he had just stuck with like </v>

1321
01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably still would come out,</v>

1322
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't come out the same way.</v>

1323
01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.313
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will think about the fact that they </v>

1324
01:02:01.691 --> 01:02:06.550
<v Speaker 2>covered up sexual assault on it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a weekly basis.</v>

1325
01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this story broke what five days ago,</v>

1326
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.033
<v Speaker 2>something like that and is already so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many women that have come out and now </v>

1327
01:02:14.441 --> 01:02:16.480
<v Speaker 2>you've got a bounty on more women to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out.</v>

1328
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that somebody is offering</v>

1329
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 5>a certain amount of money for every </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman that comes out against him,</v>

1330
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 5>so it's going to be like cosby all over </v>
<v Speaker 5>again and you think about.</v>

1331
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:31.480
<v Speaker 5>But God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because bea was drugging and raping,</v>

1332
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 5>nobody just means it's another step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another step more evil though.</v>

1333
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.413
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just talking about like the </v>

1334
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 5>frequency of it and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the complicity of people that set up</v>

1335
01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:44.630
<v Speaker 5>the meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're covered up to lawsuits.</v>

1336
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gave the women work after the meetings.</v>

1337
01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:49.710
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them got script deals,</v>

1338
01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 5>got roles in movies because that's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of them didn't walk out of the room.</v>

1339
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.540
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them gave him the back rub or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever else.</v>

1340
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1341
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.340
<v Speaker 5>Well that was what Whitney was talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the other day.</v>

1342
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 5>Whitney.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cummings was telling me,</v>

1343
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:04.020
<v Speaker 5>her and one of her friends who's an </v>
<v Speaker 5>actress,</v>

1344
01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:04.854
<v Speaker 5>I did their show at the largo the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>night and they were in the green room </v>

1345
01:03:07.681 --> 01:03:08.514
<v Speaker 5>and they were talking about how many </v>
<v Speaker 5>women literally wrote into their </v>

1346
01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 5>contract,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like not wrote into it,</v>

1347
01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:17.730
<v Speaker 5>but there was an agreement that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>would fuck him to get like editor's cut.</v>

1348
01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.300
<v Speaker 5>They would fuck him to get more lines </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1349
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:21.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1350
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.033
<v Speaker 5>Girls like prominent actresses had sex </v>
<v Speaker 5>with him to ensure that they got big </v>

1351
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:28.890
<v Speaker 5>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was written down.</v>

1352
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 5>Some of it was agreed upon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they wrote it,</v>

1353
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:34.343
<v Speaker 5>but these things were agreed upon and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he always kept his end of the </v>

1354
01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 5>bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was known.</v>

1355
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:43.671
<v Speaker 5>She's known for hooking them up is part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of how he got this whole thing to work,</v>

1356
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:46.283
<v Speaker 5>which means every director and editor </v>
<v Speaker 5>that kept those lines in new because </v>

1357
01:03:51.121 --> 01:03:54.840
<v Speaker 5>editors all the time or chop chop out </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole scenes because they don't work.</v>

1358
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's only.</v>

1359
01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:01.860
<v Speaker 5>That's like say like when did it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did it happen before the film was shot?</v>

1360
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:05.220
<v Speaker 5>Like she would give them final cut like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you would allow them to,</v>

1361
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.083
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be in the editing room or was it </v>

1362
01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:10.241
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1363
01:04:10.241 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 5>I will give you the choice part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1364
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.940
<v Speaker 5>It was like some sneaky deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:16.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows who,</v>

1366
01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:18.450
<v Speaker 5>how he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows how they did it,</v>

1367
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.960
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that all these actors are </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming out and like,</v>

1368
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.580
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe it.</v>

1369
01:04:23.581 --> 01:04:24.414
<v Speaker 5>I'm so horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you not know that I'm a road </v>

1370
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 5>comic and I knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not in the middle of Hollywood.</v>

1371
01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:31.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've known about it for 15 years.</v>

1372
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:35.040
<v Speaker 5>What did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew that he was a casting couch guy.</v>

1373
01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:37.530
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knew that he was the sleazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>fat.</v>

1374
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.633
<v Speaker 5>I always would joke about how like I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think he makes himself less attractive </v>

1375
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.290
<v Speaker 5>because it's more of a power trip for </v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

1376
01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.443
<v Speaker 5>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1377
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:45.833
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To have his fat gut resting on their </v>

1378
01:04:47.401 --> 01:04:49.130
<v Speaker 5>forehead was shoots a load in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>mouth.</v>

1379
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:53.500
<v Speaker 5>You got the part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1380
01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.193
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't blow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't wash on purpose as his balls </v>

1381
01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:03.270
<v Speaker 5>just stink like locker rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1382
01:05:03.271 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1383
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.220
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird thing that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That went on for forever in this,</v>

1384
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.620
<v Speaker 5>in this industry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not this industry and the music,</v>

1385
01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 5>the movie industry,</v>

<v Speaker 1>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Radio and record sales were inexorably </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected.</v>

1398
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>You could not sell records unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the radio.</v>

1399
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:59.830
<v Speaker 1>The only band that that managed to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that was kiss,</v>

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.513
<v Speaker 1>almost no radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were like mocked relentlessly </v>

1405
01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:21.970
<v Speaker 1>by people who really loved rock.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do they really have good shitloads?</v>

1411
01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Depends on if you like that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

1426
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.333
<v Speaker 1>like uncharacteristic for like what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would think of when you think about </v>

<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like the same way I'm going </v>

<v Speaker 2>should never</v>

1446
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.963
<v Speaker 5>do those movie anthems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did those like armageddon </v>

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:26.143
<v Speaker 5>music for stupid blockbuster film.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They started trying to figure out what </v>

1449
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 5>the audience wanted and giving it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>them instead of being themselves.</v>

1450
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:36.740

<v Speaker 5>of thought in that band.</v>

<v Speaker 5>about fame.</v>

1454
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.883
<v Speaker 5>Joe Perry's like a guy from Boston who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a bad ass guitarist who loves </v>

1455
01:08:50.301 --> 01:08:51.620

<v Speaker 5>doing like what is he on?</v>

1459

1463
01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:11.893
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could imagine Mick Jagger doing </v>

01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:17.024
<v Speaker 5>Just to bank checks just to bank checks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think Mick Jagger and Keith </v>

1467
01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.900
<v Speaker 5>Richards have a similar kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

1468
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Mick wanted to be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keith is just a bad ass rocker.</v>

1469
01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.340
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>

<v Speaker 5>wanting to be famous.</v>

1472
01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.413
<v Speaker 5>That's what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when the music suffers or the music </v>

<v Speaker 5>You fuck him because he fucked her.</v>

1501
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:46.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't go that far.</v>

1502
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:47.803
<v Speaker 5>But do you think I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would worry that you would break </v>

1503
01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:50.963
<v Speaker 5>because she's 64.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Send it home here at cracking in her </v>

1506
01:10:59.871 --> 01:11:01.820
<v Speaker 5>women falling?</v>

<v Speaker 5>But see that's the thing I didn't,</v>

1515
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can have a 64 year old</v>
<v Speaker 5>ass.</v>

1516
01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:32.110
<v Speaker 5>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1517
01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:32.963
<v Speaker 5>every picture is like from the front and</v>
<v Speaker 5>noticed the bent leg to kind of hide </v>

<v Speaker 5>any.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will they all do that?</v>

1519
01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:40.890
<v Speaker 5>It's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1520
01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:41.724

<v Speaker 5>you don't see your but go google </v>

1521
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:48.630

<v Speaker 5>But listen,</v>

1522
01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 5>you're objectifying women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1523
01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.213
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing a on anatomical survey or </v>

1524
01:11:54.121 --> 01:11:57.420
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something that's a famous shot.</v>

1525
01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's like,</v>

1526
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 5>that's her sports illustrated shot.</v>

1527
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 5>Christine blinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at 60.</v>

1528
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.990
<v Speaker 5>Well either way she's done a remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 5>job of staying attractive.</v>

1529
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:13.973
<v Speaker 5>Very proud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I guess what that is is just </v>

1530
01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 5>constant effort.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1531
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:20.700
<v Speaker 5>And maybe some surgery but at the very </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of DNA involved too,</v>

1532
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Must Be.</v>

1533
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:22.523
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1534
01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.300
<v Speaker 5>But constant effort,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1535
01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:27.510
<v Speaker 5>Like constant gym time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching the Diet.</v>

1536
01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:29.240
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that stuff.</v>

1537
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:31.290
<v Speaker 5>A lot of water creates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1538
01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:34.260
<v Speaker 5>And also they have take it all the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>skincare products.</v>

1539
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:37.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the business,</v>

1540
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's her business.</v>

1541
01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.330
<v Speaker 5>It's super shocking is when a woman was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1542
01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.310
<v Speaker 5>just some smoke and hot and then she </v>
<v Speaker 5>just lets it go.</v>

1543
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.980
<v Speaker 5>Just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Kathleen Turner.</v>

1544
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Speaker 5>Ever Seen Kathy Turner today.</v>

1545
01:12:56.370 --> 01:13:00.990
<v Speaker 5>She could be Joey d as a starting level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you have sex with a.</v>

1546
01:13:00.991 --> 01:13:02.970
<v Speaker 5>just to say you had sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kathleen Turner though.</v>

1547
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:05.650
<v Speaker 5>What do you think now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1548
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:07.230
<v Speaker 5>we'll get that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1549
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:08.243
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was fucking smoke and she had that </v>

1550
01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 5>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I feel like there's a health issue.</v>

1551
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:18.930
<v Speaker 5>Like she's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense a lot of times.</v>

1552
01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:19.890
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1553
01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:20.724
<v Speaker 5>they have to take a steroid for </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and they blow up from the </v>

1554
01:13:23.221 --> 01:13:25.230
<v Speaker 5>steroid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>

1555
01:13:25.231 --> 01:13:28.050
<v Speaker 5>Is that real good?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make that bigger.</v>

1556
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:31.690
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's probably alcohol too.</v>

1557
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.920
<v Speaker 5>When you see someone that big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1558
01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.510
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to eat a lot of foods.</v>

1559
01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:36.820
<v Speaker 5>Stay that big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1560
01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.260
<v Speaker 5>Unless your booze in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I know this lady,</v>

1561
01:13:40.261 --> 01:13:43.140
<v Speaker 5>she works out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she boozes all the time.</v>

1562
01:13:43.890 --> 01:13:44.723
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Her legs are always like just thick and </v>

1563
01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.253
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck the fucking empty calories and </v>

1564
01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:55.490
<v Speaker 5>booze for people who drink like </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyday.</v>

1565
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.120
<v Speaker 5>Those everyday drinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

1566
01:13:57.630 --> 01:14:01.290
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a fucking drunk.</v>

1567
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:03.510
<v Speaker 5>You're not a real health nut about what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you eat.</v>

1568
01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 5>Pizza and fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when you wake up in the morning</v>

1569
01:14:07.471 --> 01:14:08.310
<v Speaker 5>you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

1570
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:10.710
<v Speaker 5>eat more shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1571
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.153
<v Speaker 5>some P,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>

1572
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.993
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Kathleen Turner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she made so much money and her </v>

1573
01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:18.910
<v Speaker 2>natural body is big and she just went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1574
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:22.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to enjoy my life and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer like Kathleen,</v>

1575
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>like I'm Christie Brinkley.</v>

1576
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:25.563
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman who got really big would say no </v>

1577
01:14:29.561 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 1>one's natural bodies overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not that.</v>

1578
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:33.603
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're eating the wrong </v>

1579
01:14:35.081 --> 01:14:37.060
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not exercising,</v>

1580
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:40.600
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely overeating and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely drinking.</v>

1581
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not someone who's thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1582
01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an obese woman.</v>

1583
01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1584
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.300
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get our dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She was the hottest woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was hot.</v>

1586
01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Was that movie body heat with her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Romancing the stone?</v>

1588
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.053
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like a rip off of Indiana </v>

1589
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:03.131
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:07.900

<v Speaker 1>Indiana Jones character,</v>

1592
01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:11.260
<v Speaker 1>but it was kinda like a semi comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romancing the stone.</v>

1593
01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like he was the archaeologist.</v>

1594
01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.273
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to remember why they made a </v>

1616
01:16:14.391 --> 01:16:19.391

<v Speaker 2>She was hot back in the alien days,</v>

1617
01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:25.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was so hot.</v>

1618
01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.810

<v Speaker 1>Look at Harrison Ford Hansen bastard.</v>

1619
01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:31.003
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that we're watching these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people age to like the point of decay </v>

1620
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:41.020
<v Speaker 1>right in front of us because that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a thing until about 50 years ago,</v>

1621
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:44.270
<v Speaker 1>but if you really stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never got to see that.</v>

1622
01:16:44.271 --> 01:16:46.520
<v Speaker 1>You never got to see someone that age in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you like that,</v>

1623
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:50.420

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1624
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.780

<v Speaker 1>Maybe let's get generous.</v>

1625
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:54.643
<v Speaker 1>Seventy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 years like this is a new cultural </v>

1626
01:16:56.841 --> 01:17:01.841
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon to have visual evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>decay that you go over with a fine tooth</v>

1627
01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:05.360
<v Speaker 1>comb and never like this where I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>doughboys,</v>

1712
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.140

<v Speaker 1>when they don't look physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive,</v>

<v Speaker 1>have had to deal with so many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking with them their whole life that </v>

1716
01:20:43.431 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 1>the develop this sort of like Werewolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then they just keep coming.</v>

1719
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:54.270
<v Speaker 1>They keep coming at you and they just </v>

<v Speaker 1>They never get discouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1721
01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:57.773
<v Speaker 1>and those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of times guys are not </v>

1722
01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:00.564
<v Speaker 1>physically gifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have incredible work ethic because </v>

1723
01:21:03.481 --> 01:21:07.240
<v Speaker 1>they have to because that's the only way</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can compete and so they like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>toughness.</v>

1725
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.770

<v Speaker 1>all the extreme beating,</v>

1726
01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:18.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1727
01:21:18.301 --> 01:21:23.301
<v Speaker 1>And then one day they run into a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was both like see there's discipline and</v>

1728
01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:25.314
<v Speaker 1>there's talent and a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>talented people don't have discipline </v>

1729
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:29.423
<v Speaker 1>and you just wish they did because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be the greatest ever will the </v>

1730
01:21:32.641 --> 01:21:35.310
<v Speaker 1>greatest ever or the guys with talent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and discipline,</v>

1731
01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.590
<v Speaker 1>like Anderson Silva or someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1732
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.513
<v Speaker 1>like talented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also like physically superior just </v>

1733
01:21:42.451 --> 01:21:46.650
<v Speaker 1>moves faster and then also works </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly hard.</v>

1734
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also can perform under pressure</v>

1735
01:21:49.741 --> 01:21:50.574
<v Speaker 1>and knows how to come back from behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like knows that knows that it turned </v>

1736
01:21:53.851 --> 01:21:56.040
<v Speaker 1>around when he's getting his ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1737
01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the third aspect is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the psychological.</v>

1738
01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.473
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to be the hammer or </v>

1739
01:22:02.041 --> 01:22:02.874
<v Speaker 1>the nail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1740
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:05.490
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be able to be the nail bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys can't be the nail.</v>

1741
01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.020
<v Speaker 1>They start getting hit on me like fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1742
01:22:07.021 --> 01:22:07.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some guys are great in there like </v>

1743
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:13.620
<v Speaker 1>that some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some great fighters that just</v>

1744
01:22:13.621 --> 01:22:15.990
<v Speaker 1>can't take a beating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange.</v>

1745
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Fighting is the weirdest of all sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not really a sport.</v>

1746
01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 1>It may kind of is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an athletic endeavor,</v>

1747
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.093
<v Speaker 1>but it's so much more emotional intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>than just a regular sport like calling </v>

1748
01:22:30.391 --> 01:22:33.780
<v Speaker 1>it a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's so much more to.</v>

1749
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:36.150
<v Speaker 1>It's more personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taken off to the bathroom.</v>

1750
01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Jamie can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie can't handle it now.</v>

1751
01:22:40.321 --> 01:22:42.470
<v Speaker 1>We don't get to see him sneak around </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you anymore.</v>

1752
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.980
<v Speaker 1>We have a new setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1753
01:22:43.981 --> 01:22:45.750
<v Speaker 1>You should have a camera in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom.</v>

1754
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:49.090
<v Speaker 1>You can get sued for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1755
01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever hear about Chuck Berry?</v>

1756
01:22:51.370 --> 01:22:52.203
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1757
01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.790
<v Speaker 2>That came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another thing I knew.</v>

1758
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I had heard rumors and again am I in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking music industry.</v>

1759
01:23:03.170 --> 01:23:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I had heard rumors that chuck had hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hours</v>

1760
01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.713
<v Speaker 5>of footage of women pissing and shitting</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that he had cameras hidden in the </v>

1761
01:23:13.361 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 5>toilet seats of his restaurant in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Illinois.</v>

1762
01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:17.463
<v Speaker 5>I knew this shit for years and then all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden it came out in the news and </v>

1763
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:24.820
<v Speaker 5>there was a class action law suit that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe he lost,</v>

1764
01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:28.900
<v Speaker 5>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should say all of this with supposedly</v>

1765
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:30.700
<v Speaker 5>allegedly don't get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Allegedly.</v>

1766
01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:31.563
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's dead.</v>

1767
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:32.433
<v Speaker 5>He can get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1768
01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.940
<v Speaker 5>is he dead?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

1769
01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:36.790
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing that this shit is out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1770
01:23:36.791 --> 01:23:37.624
<v Speaker 5>Bill Cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew that Bill Cosby was molesting </v>

1771
01:23:39.311 --> 01:23:40.144
<v Speaker 5>women soda juice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew it because when I was on the set </v>

1772
01:23:42.431 --> 01:23:43.264
<v Speaker 5>of news radio people knew him from </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever thing and there was always the </v>

1773
01:23:47.741 --> 01:23:49.390
<v Speaker 5>thing that bill cosby drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Women.</v>

1774
01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:51.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I had heard it like what he does.</v>

1775
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:53.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was always some weird thing.</v>

1776
01:23:53.541 --> 01:23:54.730
<v Speaker 5>I never met him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1777
01:23:54.731 --> 01:23:58.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think I knew someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been around him.</v>

1778
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:02.840
<v Speaker 5>I think it was just like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>things where people just knew.</v>

1779
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:08.230
<v Speaker 5>You just knew like that Michael Jackson </v>
<v Speaker 5>was probably Dylan kids.</v>

1780
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.070
<v Speaker 5>We knew it because we knew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh Oh,</v>

1781
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:13.450
<v Speaker 5>well that's a thing that's coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do we know?</v>

1782
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:14.583
<v Speaker 5>Do we know somebody who did we know we </v>
<v Speaker 5>knew somebody who was sent a boy to the </v>

1783
01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 5>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>

1784
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.863
<v Speaker 5>who's we?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say on the air who it </v>

1785
01:24:25.301 --> 01:24:26.134
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

1786
01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:31.460
<v Speaker 5>Somebody in the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you say we knew like who's we?</v>

1787
01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:33.550
<v Speaker 5>You and I me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.360
<v Speaker 5>I did not know someone who sent a boy to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

1789
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:39.050
<v Speaker 5>Unless I didn't know they send a boy the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ranch.</v>

1790
01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.630
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't know.</v>

1791
01:24:41.631 --> 01:24:43.550
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

1792
01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:46.120
<v Speaker 5>What about all these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to this fence right now?</v>

1793
01:24:46.190 --> 01:24:48.410
<v Speaker 5>I know I shouldn't have brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1794
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:53.500
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't have some of the pitch </v>
<v Speaker 5>night making all these people out there.</v>

1795
01:24:54.201 --> 01:24:57.530
<v Speaker 5>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Girl.</v>

1796
01:24:57.531 --> 01:24:59.660
<v Speaker 5>Hanging out with Fred.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who Was it?</v>

1797
01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I think it's one of the reasons why</v>

1798
01:25:02.841 --> 01:25:05.030
<v Speaker 5>we like really good stuff too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1799
01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.180
<v Speaker 5>Because we can't imagine being able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>

1800
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:08.103
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you see someone who's like </v>

1801
01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:13.850
<v Speaker 5>playing like you see like Gary Clark Jr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something playing guitar on stage.</v>

1802
01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.530
<v Speaker 5>Mesmer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>

1803
01:25:15.531 --> 01:25:17.660
<v Speaker 5>That guy's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Holy Shit.</v>

1804
01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.940
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something about watching someone</v>

1805
01:25:19.941 --> 01:25:20.774
<v Speaker 5>who's mesmerizing that's equally </v>
<v Speaker 5>captivating as watching someone who's </v>

1806
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:24.830
<v Speaker 5>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1807
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:27.530
<v Speaker 5>Look at um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's his name from Queen?</v>

1808
01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.500
<v Speaker 5>Freddie Mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freddie Mercury.</v>

1809
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:33.200
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that guy fucking went for it.</v>

1810
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:37.310
<v Speaker 5>He went for it back in the day when no </v>
<v Speaker 5>one even knew he was gay.</v>

1811
01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.213
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't understand like what a gay </v>

1812
01:25:39.561 --> 01:25:44.060
<v Speaker 5>front man was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you could be a gay front man now,</v>

1813
01:25:44.061 --> 01:25:44.894
<v Speaker 5>like Elton John is openly gay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone knows it and he goes out there </v>

1814
01:25:48.321 --> 01:25:52.360
<v Speaker 5>and sayings and everybody goes nuts and </v>
<v Speaker 5>back then you couldn't.</v>

1815
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:57.370
<v Speaker 5>Then he Lindley stadium with a mustache </v>
<v Speaker 5>sticking out and a leather vast.</v>

1816
01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:01.190
<v Speaker 5>We have champions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 5>But you got to think he must gotten that</v>
<v Speaker 5>big</v>

1818
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.650
<v Speaker 2>when they were playing bars and saloons </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their way up.</v>

1819
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.100
<v Speaker 2>He must've been going big then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:26:09.101 --> 01:26:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it probably looked ridiculous,</v>

1821
01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:12.710
<v Speaker 2>but certain people got it.</v>

1822
01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so good that even when he was doing</v>

1823
01:26:16.621 --> 01:26:17.454
<v Speaker 3>those bars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people must have heard that voice and </v>

1824
01:26:18.631 --> 01:26:20.040
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1825
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1826
01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Because he could carry a fucking note.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

1827
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:25.363
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's from the movie that they're </v>

1828
01:26:26.971 --> 01:26:28.280
<v Speaker 2>making about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1829
01:26:28.410 --> 01:26:30.000
<v Speaker 2>That's not him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1830
01:26:30.001 --> 01:26:31.430
<v Speaker 2>That guy looks amazingly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can.</v>

1831
01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1832
01:26:32.281 --> 01:26:37.281
<v Speaker 2>I thought his name is Malik is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actor's name was Brian j singer.</v>

1833
01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:39.993
<v Speaker 2>Is that that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Sasha Baron Cohen wanted that </v>

1834
01:26:42.121 --> 01:26:43.110
<v Speaker 2>role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1835
01:26:43.170 --> 01:26:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably would have nailed it.</v>

1836
01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonder whether they give it to them.</v>

1837
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like a keep bob.</v>

1838
01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

1839
01:26:52.801 --> 01:26:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Live aid where they were simulcasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>from London and Philadelphia at the same</v>

1840
01:26:57.001 --> 01:26:57.900
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll up,</v>

1841
01:26:57.930 --> 01:27:00.750
<v Speaker 2>scroll up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he fucking stole the shell.</v>

1842
01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:05.910
<v Speaker 2>That's him for real live aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where Sasha Baron Cohen stole the show.</v>

1843
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Who now we're a Freddie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mercury.</v>

1844
01:27:08.161 --> 01:27:13.161
<v Speaker 2>Did know it was back in 80 fourish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did he die?</v>

1845
01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:19.630
<v Speaker 3>He was like one of the first big names </v>
<v Speaker 3>to diabetes.</v>

1846
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Where you heard about you on what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1847
01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety one.</v>

1848
01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Eighty one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety one.</v>

1849
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Ninety one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody dies ways.</v>

1850
01:27:27.570 --> 01:27:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very rare.</v>

1851
01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't say nobody,</v>

1852
01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:34.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's saying like nobody dies a </v>
<v Speaker 3>syphilis and you still can,</v>

1853
01:27:34.151 --> 01:27:39.040
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the California just recently reduced the</v>

1854
01:27:39.041 --> 01:27:44.041
<v Speaker 3>penalty of not telling someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have HIV.</v>

1855
01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they?</v>

1856
01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wantonly infecting someone with HIV</v>

1857
01:27:48.971 --> 01:27:51.070
<v Speaker 3>is no longer a felony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1858
01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:55.120
<v Speaker 3>The guy who introduced it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the senator,</v>

1859
01:27:55.121 --> 01:27:55.954
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucking picture of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New California law reduces penalty for </v>

1860
01:27:58.631 --> 01:28:01.690
<v Speaker 3>knowingly exposing someone to HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why the fuck would you do that?</v>

1861
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:04.480
<v Speaker 3>HIV is a public health issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a criminal issue.</v>

1862
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:08.140
<v Speaker 3>California state Senator Scott Wiener </v>
<v Speaker 3>said in support of the bill,</v>

1863
01:28:08.141 --> 01:28:13.141
<v Speaker 3>which takes now Google that guy and find</v>
<v Speaker 3>a picture of him with his shirt off with</v>

1864
01:28:13.301 --> 01:28:14.134
<v Speaker 3>a leather vest on a six pack and a dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>collar around his neck and I'm not </v>

1865
01:28:17.051 --> 01:28:17.740
<v Speaker 3>kidding.</v>

1866
01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:21.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a fucking image of him.</v>

1867
01:28:21.011 --> 01:28:22.810
<v Speaker 3>That's him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's jacked.</v>

1868
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:24.700
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a photo.</v>

1869
01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1870
01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a dog collar.</v>

1871
01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:31.360
<v Speaker 3>He's got a leather tie wrapped around </v>
<v Speaker 3>his neck.</v>

1872
01:28:31.361 --> 01:28:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Might as well be a dog collar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at this.</v>

1873
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.270
<v Speaker 3>This is the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he's not gay,</v>

1874
01:28:37.271 --> 01:28:38.104
<v Speaker 3>he's certainly sympathetic to the cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the guy that's supporting </v>

1875
01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:44.350
<v Speaker 3>this bill saying that HIV is a health </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

1876
01:28:44.351 --> 01:28:46.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a health issue.</v>

1877
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:47.103
<v Speaker 3>If you fucking knowingly give it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody via knowingly shoot a hot load </v>

1878
01:28:51.761 --> 01:28:54.820
<v Speaker 3>into someone knowing you have HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get back from the doctor.</v>

1879
01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Doctor says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg,</v>

1880
01:28:55.781 --> 01:28:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I got some bad news for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got the Hib and you're like,</v>

1881
01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:00.634
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got bad news for everyone's shooting </v>

1882
01:29:02.251 --> 01:29:04.150
<v Speaker 3>loads to because I'm not going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1883
01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I like shooting loads into people.</v>

1884
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't like condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're doing a criminal act.</v>

1885
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:10.740
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a deadly weapon.</v>

1886
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Your semen is a deadly weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Today if you get treatment,</v>

1887
01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 3>but what if someone doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors?</v>

1888
01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have they're afraid of?</v>

1889
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are afraid.</v>

1890
01:29:19.650 --> 01:29:22.470
<v Speaker 3>They're afraid to go into the doctor so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't go to the doctor.</v>

1891
01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:24.450
<v Speaker 3>HIV turns into a's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd die of AIDS.</v>

1892
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:27.720
<v Speaker 3>You fucking gave it to him that that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that not a felony.</v>

1893
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would want to reduce that crime?</v>

1894
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.073
<v Speaker 3>Who'd want to reduce the crime of </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowingly exposing someone to a death </v>

1895
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:36.623
<v Speaker 3>dealing disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a disease that's killed untold hundreds </v>

1896
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.330
<v Speaker 3>of thousands if not millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>worldwide.</v>

1897
01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:43.164
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mean,</v>

1898
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:45.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably the millions,</v>

1899
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:46.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:47.453
<v Speaker 3>But why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who's clamoring for that to be </v>

1901
01:29:50.701 --> 01:29:53.940
<v Speaker 3>reduced?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I think about how many guys are,</v>

1902
01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 3>what do they call it on the down low </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they go out and they have sex with</v>

1903
01:29:57.211 --> 01:29:58.044
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get sick and then have sex with their </v>

1904
01:30:00.001 --> 01:30:00.740
<v Speaker 3>wives.</v>

1905
01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:04.580
<v Speaker 3>A lot of wives get aids or HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1906
01:30:04.581 --> 01:30:06.460
<v Speaker 3>I get HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1907
01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:09.200
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

1908
01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:13.110
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those diseases where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially found a cure for it.</v>

1909
01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a treatment and that treatment</v>

1910
01:30:15.931 --> 01:30:18.840
<v Speaker 3>reduces it to the point where it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>

1911
01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.110
<v Speaker 3>You can't even detect it in the blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1912
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:23.443
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that good.</v>

1913
01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:24.803
<v Speaker 3>It's undetectable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Magic Johnson said that Jesus did </v>

1914
01:30:27.391 --> 01:30:28.920
<v Speaker 3>it for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus made,</v>

1915
01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:32.730
<v Speaker 3>made my hiv go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No longer detectable.</v>

1916
01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:36.990
<v Speaker 3>That is so cool to magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnson accent is horrible impression.</v>

1917
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.311
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1918
01:30:38.311 --> 01:30:41.610
<v Speaker 3>they literally have gotten into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where it's undetectable.</v>

1919
01:30:41.611 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 3>What does it say number of deaths due to</v>
<v Speaker 3>HIV AIDS estimates by country?</v>

1920
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a million last year,</v>

1921
01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:50.300
<v Speaker 3>but it has no data for United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1922
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:51.383
<v Speaker 3>the thing about that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is how it's been explained to </v>

1923
01:30:53.611 --> 01:30:54.444
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sure if someone will correct me </v>

1924
01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:58.200
<v Speaker 3>if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with this distinction,</v>

1925
01:30:58.230 --> 01:30:59.063
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the real problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the way they used it to describe </v>

1926
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.903
<v Speaker 3>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were saying all these people in </v>

1927
01:31:06.121 --> 01:31:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Africa get aids and die.</v>

1928
01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doctor was telling me,</v>

1929
01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:13.710
<v Speaker 3>and he's just completely off the record </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was telling me this because he's</v>

1930
01:31:13.711 --> 01:31:14.340
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1931
01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:16.420
<v Speaker 3>progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart liberal guy.</v>

1932
01:31:16.421 --> 01:31:17.870
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1933
01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.600
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about is people with</v>

1934
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.463
<v Speaker 3>extremely compromised immune systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's from a variety of different </v>

1935
01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:26.310
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1936
01:31:26.311 --> 01:31:28.110
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not getting HIV tests,</v>

1937
01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.033
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people in these really poor areas </v>

1938
01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:31.620
<v Speaker 3>in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1939
01:31:31.621 --> 01:31:33.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking like early two thousands.</v>

1940
01:31:34.190 --> 01:31:35.023
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not giving these people HIV </v>

1941
01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:37.524
<v Speaker 3>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not flying to Africa and </v>

1942
01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:41.130
<v Speaker 3>administering these expensive tests on </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people.</v>

1943
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:42.143
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people have extremely compromised </v>

1944
01:31:43.141 --> 01:31:45.060
<v Speaker 3>immune systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They checked their t cell count,</v>

1945
01:31:45.061 --> 01:31:45.894
<v Speaker 3>low t cell counts are very low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very unhealthy and so they say </v>

1946
01:31:48.781 --> 01:31:52.830
<v Speaker 3>they have aids and that's how you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>funding and get funding.</v>

1947
01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:53.664
<v Speaker 3>As you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a million cases of AIDS in </v>

1948
01:31:54.871 --> 01:31:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>

1949
01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:56.243
<v Speaker 3>You don't get funding when you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a million cases of people who </v>

1950
01:31:58.111 --> 01:32:02.260
<v Speaker 3>are malnourished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have a host of horrific diseases and</v>

1951
01:32:02.261 --> 01:32:03.094
<v Speaker 3>acceptable that we're trending to 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of African American gay bi men </v>

1952
01:32:07.301 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 3>having HIV must end this health </v>
<v Speaker 3>disparity.</v>

1953
01:32:09.581 --> 01:32:10.271
<v Speaker 3>Why are you pulling that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1954
01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:11.500
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wiener.</v>

1955
01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name's wiener,</v>

1956
01:32:13.631 --> 01:32:16.400
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're wiener wiener,</v>

1957
01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:17.643
<v Speaker 3>but unacceptable that we're trending to </v>
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of African American gay bi </v>

1958
01:32:20.081 --> 01:32:22.870
<v Speaker 3>men having HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile he says,</v>

1959
01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:23.704
<v Speaker 3>must end this health disparity and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best way to end it is to reduce the </v>

1960
01:32:26.861 --> 01:32:30.140
<v Speaker 3>penalty from knowingly giving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1961
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:35.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say that he has it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he just wants to make it a little easier</v>

1962
01:32:35.021 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 3>on himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

1963
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why would you want to reduce that?</v>

1964
01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Owen Benjamin had a great tweet about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1965
01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Allow Charlie something about allowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Sheen to,</v>

1966
01:32:47.591 --> 01:32:48.424
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>California is allowing Charlie Sheen to </v>

1967
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:51.423
<v Speaker 3>have less of a penalty for having </v>
<v Speaker 3>unprotected sex with unsuspecting young </v>

1968
01:32:56.591 --> 01:32:58.460
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking psychos like that.</v>

1969
01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1970
01:33:00.251 --> 01:33:00.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1971
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:03.760
<v Speaker 2>the question is can you legislate </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

1972
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:04.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1973
01:33:04.530 --> 01:33:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a tricky one.</v>

1974
01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Can you lead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to write?</v>

1975
01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to legislate behavior or do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want people to just be like,</v>

1976
01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:19.290
<v Speaker 3>but you have to punish people for why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

1977
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:22.770
<v Speaker 3>if you have some sort of an incurable </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

1978
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.040
<v Speaker 3>aids obviously is curable or HIV is </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1979
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:29.670
<v Speaker 3>At least at this point it's treatable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say curable,</v>

1980
01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.580
<v Speaker 3>but if you have something like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>would it be?</v>

1981
01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1982
01:33:33.570 --> 01:33:34.680
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Member.</v>

1983
01:33:34.710 --> 01:33:35.543
<v Speaker 3>When that woman came back from Africa </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they suspected that she had been </v>

1984
01:33:38.401 --> 01:33:39.234
<v Speaker 3>exposed to Ebola and people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>freaking the fuck out because she was </v>

1985
01:33:41.671 --> 01:33:42.840
<v Speaker 3>wandering around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>

1986
01:33:42.841 --> 01:33:44.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be quarantined.</v>

1987
01:33:44.190 --> 01:33:45.810
<v Speaker 3>Fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

1988
01:33:45.811 --> 01:33:47.650
<v Speaker 3>this bitch is a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1989
01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:53.520
<v Speaker 3>That's much more communicable than HIV </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1990
01:33:53.521 --> 01:33:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not much difference in terms of like</v>

1991
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:59.190
<v Speaker 3>what it can do and then you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about something that kills people,</v>

1992
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:00.053
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda the same thing and a lot of </v>

1993
01:34:01.681 --> 01:34:02.514
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

1994
01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:07.640
<v Speaker 3>we tend to look past things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexually transmitted because I don't get</v>

1995
01:34:08.461 --> 01:34:09.291
<v Speaker 3>fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1996
01:34:09.291 --> 01:34:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1997
01:34:10.171 --> 01:34:11.004
<v Speaker 3>don't do anything that Jesus wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want you to do and you don't have any </v>

1998
01:34:13.321 --> 01:34:14.850
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you take it in the ass,</v>

1999
01:34:14.851 --> 01:34:18.150
<v Speaker 3>you fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You horrible person.</v>

2000
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:19.583
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2001
01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're there.</v>

2002
01:34:21.071 --> 01:34:21.904
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're allowing companies to not have </v>

2003
01:34:24.851 --> 01:34:29.140
<v Speaker 2>to cover women's birth control and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they want to shame.</v>

2004
01:34:29.141 --> 01:34:31.780
<v Speaker 2>They want to shame people from having </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

2005
01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:34.150
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2006
01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2007
01:34:35.410 --> 01:34:37.960
<v Speaker 2>not paying for abortions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you really think that's what it is?</v>

2008
01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.310
<v Speaker 2>I think orgasms are free and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2009
01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:41.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2010
01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:45.370
<v Speaker 2>the haves fucking drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's what it is.</v>

2011
01:34:45.690 --> 01:34:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a financial issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you look behind it,</v>

2012
01:34:48.961 --> 01:34:52.260
<v Speaker 3>I bet there's probably insurance </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies that are involved in.</v>

2013
01:34:52.261 --> 01:34:54.300
<v Speaker 3>This was probably a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2014
01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.970
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have to pay or companies,</v>

2015
01:34:57.150 --> 01:34:57.983
<v Speaker 3>if company has to pay for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>employee's birth control pills and you </v>

2016
01:35:00.921 --> 01:35:02.390
<v Speaker 3>have 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>employees,</v>

2017
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:04.220
<v Speaker 3>how many birth control pills you paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>for?</v>

2018
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.860
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2019
01:35:05.861 --> 01:35:08.090
<v Speaker 3>and you go across the board and also you</v>
<v Speaker 3>set a precedent.</v>

2020
01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.670
<v Speaker 3>If you have to pay for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you have to pay for something that</v>

2021
01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:11.504
<v Speaker 3>comes along with similar to for men or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some other issue that women might have </v>

2022
01:35:14.301 --> 01:35:15.134
<v Speaker 3>that has to be covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's all financial expensive </v>

2023
01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.680
<v Speaker 3>though to have women missing work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnancies,</v>

2024
01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:22.573
<v Speaker 3>firearm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck them.</v>

2025
01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2026
01:35:26.151 --> 01:35:27.770
<v Speaker 3>It's because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if somebody works for you,</v>

2027
01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.690
<v Speaker 3>they don't just work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2028
01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:32.480
<v Speaker 3>We are assuming that person is dependent</v>
<v Speaker 3>upon you.</v>

2029
01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Just one of the weirder things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>employment.</v>

2030
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's not just someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>works for you.</v>

2031
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:39.554
<v Speaker 3>You have to take care of that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to provide them with </v>

2032
01:35:42.771 --> 01:35:43.604
<v Speaker 3>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to provide them with </v>

2033
01:35:45.261 --> 01:35:49.580
<v Speaker 3>benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's supposed to allow them to take time</v>

2034
01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:53.500
<v Speaker 3>off and it's a weird thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2035
01:35:53.501 --> 01:35:54.334
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've settled into the idea that this </v>

2036
01:35:56.061 --> 01:35:58.310
<v Speaker 3>person is completely dependent upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>their employer.</v>

2037
01:35:58.760 --> 01:35:59.593
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm like this idea that if a </v>

2038
01:36:03.291 --> 01:36:08.291
<v Speaker 3>woman has a child that you have to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>her maternity leave,</v>

2039
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:09.343
<v Speaker 3>we have to pay her while she has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby and that you have to maybe pay </v>

2040
01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:13.934
<v Speaker 3>child support or some sort of child care</v>
<v Speaker 3>while she has the baby that people </v>

2041
01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:20.990
<v Speaker 3>really want that they want that as part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it because people,</v>

2042
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:23.990
<v Speaker 3>the way people live in this country in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

2043
01:36:23.991 --> 01:36:28.991
<v Speaker 3>and we just assume that you have to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>this way because we compare ourselves to</v>

2044
01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:29.984
<v Speaker 3>people that live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like indigenous tribes are in third </v>

2045
01:36:31.791 --> 01:36:32.624
<v Speaker 3>world countries where they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>constant employment and they don't have </v>

2046
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 3>high overhead.</v>

2047
01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.353
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rent,</v>

2048
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.580
<v Speaker 3>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the different things that we have,</v>

2049
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:44.420
<v Speaker 3>but we have this system set up where </v>
<v Speaker 3>once you're in the system,</v>

2050
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:45.733
<v Speaker 3>once you start making that money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need that money and when the kid </v>

2051
01:36:48.021 --> 01:36:48.854
<v Speaker 3>comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just quit work like no one </v>

2052
01:36:50.721 --> 01:36:51.554
<v Speaker 3>does that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we don't think anyone should do </v>

2053
01:36:52.821 --> 01:36:55.280
<v Speaker 3>that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We assume that woman is eventually going</v>

2054
01:36:55.281 --> 01:36:56.114
<v Speaker 3>to go back to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she's going to get maternity leave </v>

2055
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:58.723
<v Speaker 3>because the company values are as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>employee and then once she's done with </v>

2056
01:37:02.931 --> 01:37:03.764
<v Speaker 3>her maternity leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there'll be some sort of </v>

2057
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:06.014
<v Speaker 3>compensation or some sort of a and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely won't be working long hours </v>

2058
01:37:09.621 --> 01:37:10.454
<v Speaker 3>or overtime anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just got to get home and take care </v>

2059
01:37:11.781 --> 01:37:12.614
<v Speaker 3>of a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2060
01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:17.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the hidden thing in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument against the financial,</v>

2061
01:37:19.911 --> 01:37:20.744
<v Speaker 3>the difference in the amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like income disparity between men and </v>

2062
01:37:23.181 --> 01:37:24.830
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the big one,</v>

2063
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:27.950
<v Speaker 3>one of the big ones is the number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours that women are willing to work.</v>

2064
01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 3>There's a series of choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2065
01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:30.853
<v Speaker 3>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2066
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.790
<v Speaker 3>the jobs they gravitate towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the number of hours that they're</v>

2067
01:37:34.791 --> 01:37:35.624
<v Speaker 3>willing to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's taking time off when they have </v>

2068
01:37:37.611 --> 01:37:38.444
<v Speaker 3>children and another one of the big ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this is one that works sort of </v>

2069
01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:43.874
<v Speaker 3>against them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't get discussed when men are </v>

2070
01:37:46.581 --> 01:37:49.160
<v Speaker 3>trying to say that the income inequality</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is all bullshit.</v>

2071
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Women are not as good at negotiating for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a better salary.</v>

2072
01:37:53.421 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>They're not as aggressive in negotiating</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a better salary</v>

2073
01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.293
<v Speaker 1>and even if they do just as good a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the man that that's the one area </v>

2074
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:02.693
<v Speaker 1>where they sort of seem to fall behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like a rational distinction </v>

2075
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:10.890
<v Speaker 1>that a woman is doing the same job as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man and not getting paid as well because</v>

2076
01:38:10.891 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the income inequality </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women,</v>

2077
01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:15.540
<v Speaker 1>you know it's like 77 percent cents on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dollar.</v>

2078
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:16.703
<v Speaker 1>It's really not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're working the same </v>

2079
01:38:18.001 --> 01:38:20.400
<v Speaker 1>job next to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were telling me it's because they've</v>

2080
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:23.130
<v Speaker 1>mental work more dangerous jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to pay more.</v>

2081
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More dangerous jobs tend to pay more.</v>

2082
01:38:25.321 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Men are much more likely to die on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

2083
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:28.103
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more likely to get injured on </v>

2084
01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:30.084
<v Speaker 1>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of fields that men </v>

2085
01:38:31.801 --> 01:38:32.634
<v Speaker 1>gravitates toward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitate towards that are particularly </v>

2086
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:37.583
<v Speaker 1>just interesting and attractive to men </v>
<v Speaker 1>that women don't gravitate towards and </v>

2087
01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:43.800
<v Speaker 1>if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in lower numbers.</v>

2088
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.633
<v Speaker 1>And this obviously these are gross </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalizations because there's women </v>

2089
01:38:47.071 --> 01:38:48.840
<v Speaker 1>who are MMA fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2090
01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:51.120
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I see him all the time.</v>

2091
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:53.700
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are lesbians that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them with a few.</v>

2092
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's like people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2093
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:58.350
<v Speaker 1>you can't like just pigeonhole people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2094
01:38:58.351 --> 01:38:59.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of men that are florists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2095
01:39:00.230 --> 01:39:01.063
<v Speaker 1>Is you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to just like say a </v>

2096
01:39:03.181 --> 01:39:04.014
<v Speaker 1>man is this and a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that because this trends obviously </v>

2097
01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:08.053
<v Speaker 1>for sure trends and to deny those trends</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be the state of discourse </v>

2098
01:39:13.351 --> 01:39:15.170
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like to deny those,</v>

2099
01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:20.210
<v Speaker 1>those trends and any accepting of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>trends is some sort of accepting of this</v>

2100
01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:21.953
<v Speaker 1>systematic oppression of women or </v>
<v Speaker 1>systematic oppression of gay people or </v>

2101
01:39:25.621 --> 01:39:29.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this woman who wrote that book,</v>

2102
01:39:29.281 --> 01:39:31.050
<v Speaker 1>lean in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a lot about that.</v>

2103
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Like negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2104
01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:34.283
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be mandated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to go in and fight </v>

2105
01:39:36.511 --> 01:39:38.640
<v Speaker 1>for your salary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a better salary,</v>

2106
01:39:38.641 --> 01:39:40.850
<v Speaker 1>fight for the corner off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know.</v>

2107
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:41.703
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't wait for it to be handed to you </v>

2108
01:39:42.721 --> 01:39:47.310
<v Speaker 1>because the patriarchal system is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to suddenly just make things fair,</v>

2109
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:48.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's a patriarchal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>

2110
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Is there a patriarchal system like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein?</v>

2111
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2112
01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a different thing because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a power issue,</v>

2113
01:39:55.501 --> 01:39:56.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

2114
01:39:56.671 --> 01:40:00.240
<v Speaker 1>when you have absolute power like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy had and you're also a fat,</v>

2115
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:01.103
<v Speaker 1>ugly fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you realize this is a way to get </v>

2116
01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:06.320
<v Speaker 1>gwenyth paltrow suck my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2117
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:07.830
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2118
01:40:07.890 --> 01:40:10.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a unique situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

2119
01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think the dynamic of it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>since men do obvious,</v>

2120
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.713
<v Speaker 1>quantifiably have more power positions </v>
<v Speaker 1>on boards of companies and management </v>

2121
01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:20.843
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women are intimidated by that </v>

2122
01:40:23.641 --> 01:40:25.470
<v Speaker 1>they're intimidated to go up against it.</v>

2123
01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also a thing where women</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be a bitch,</v>

2124
01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:32.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>

2125
01:40:32.671 --> 01:40:33.504
<v Speaker 1>men don't view a woman who's aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way they view a man as </v>

2126
01:40:37.321 --> 01:40:38.154
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you and I work in an office and </v>

2127
01:40:39.331 --> 01:40:40.164
<v Speaker 1>you're like always hustling and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead and always fighting for what's </v>

2128
01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:43.164
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Greg's Greg's and aggressive </v>

2129
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:45.630
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get shit done.</v>

2130
01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.880
<v Speaker 1>But if a woman is doing the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2131
01:40:47.881 --> 01:40:49.770
<v Speaker 1>that fucking bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be around her.</v>

2132
01:40:49.771 --> 01:40:51.310
<v Speaker 1>She's such a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2133
01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.310
<v Speaker 1>like a woman who exhibits the same of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive tendencies</v>

2134
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:55.720
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's negative.</v>

2135
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the guy's an ass kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2136
01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.190
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2137
01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.150
<v Speaker 2>do you remember who was the comic up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston?</v>

2138
01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:02.550

<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

2139

<v Speaker 2>every comic had one great joke and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's choke was,</v>

2140

2141

<v Speaker 2>guys calling her a lesbian.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2176
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.860
<v Speaker 2>the Greeks invented the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the Greeks and Italians.</v>

2177
01:42:48.190 --> 01:42:52.510
<v Speaker 2>The Greeks invented making love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Italians did it to women.</v>

2178
01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:57.513
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We were both in Italy last summer and </v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like looking at the statues of the </v>

2181
01:43:04.181 --> 01:43:07.570
<v Speaker 2>men and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking beautiful.</v>

2182
01:43:07.571 --> 01:43:08.404
<v Speaker 2>Like their abs are just perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they have dicks and it's so </v>

2183
01:43:12.191 --> 01:43:17.080
<v Speaker 2>weird because if you were to statue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that realistic in like the Grove,</v>

2184
01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:21.880
<v Speaker 2>some Christian would cloak it and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>carted off because it was too graphic.</v>

2185
01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.133
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta think like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're the sculptor and you're </v>

2186
01:43:25.841 --> 01:43:26.674
<v Speaker 2>putting that much effort where the Deq </v>
<v Speaker 2>has like a slightly bent shaft and you </v>

2187
01:43:30.341 --> 01:43:33.420
<v Speaker 2>can see the crown and there's almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a slit at the tip of the day.</v>

2188
01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:35.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like after a couple of days you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at the fit.</v>

2189
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:37.180
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sculpted like,</v>

2190
01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:38.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think you got it.</v>

2191
01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a puddle of drool on carving out</v>

2192
01:43:42.191 --> 01:43:43.024
<v Speaker 2>this car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got his hand on the balls fall </v>

2193
01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:47.270
<v Speaker 2>follies working on this shaft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2194
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:48.303
<v Speaker 2>here's what was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two different things that are </v>

2195
01:43:49.901 --> 01:43:51.730
<v Speaker 2>interesting about dicks in those</v>

2196
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.540
<v Speaker 3>ancient Roman times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing is that the original,</v>

2197
01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:57.433
<v Speaker 3>the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these two days to have just the cock </v>

2198
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:00.360
<v Speaker 3>hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2199
01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:01.693
<v Speaker 3>Then there came a period of time where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they started because of some religious </v>

2200
01:44:05.301 --> 01:44:08.060
<v Speaker 3>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started covering them with leaves and</v>

2201
01:44:08.061 --> 01:44:10.220
<v Speaker 3>that was like after the fact and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2202
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:13.430
<v Speaker 3>they actually added leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>says dig under there.</v>

2203
01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them.</v>

2204
01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.113
<v Speaker 3>And then they start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started doing some statues where </v>

2205
01:44:19.731 --> 01:44:23.360
<v Speaker 3>they put the leaf over the Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as they were constructing it,</v>

2206
01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:26.750
<v Speaker 3>but they did retrofit some some statutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Dick's,</v>

2207
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.460
<v Speaker 3>but he'll go back to that again real </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>

2208
01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Is pictures of Dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

2209
01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Here's what's interesting about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>dicks.</v>

2210
01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:32.533
<v Speaker 3>You look at these guys and these like </v>
<v Speaker 3>big athletic looking like wrestle </v>

2211
01:44:35.151 --> 01:44:35.984
<v Speaker 3>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all have little decks and one of </v>

2212
01:44:37.431 --> 01:44:41.570
<v Speaker 3>the reasons why they had little dicks is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because in this time of.</v>

2213
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is my interpretation of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2214
01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:45.433
<v Speaker 3>And this is what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a really good professor that took </v>

2215
01:44:47.901 --> 01:44:50.690
<v Speaker 3>us on a tour in Rome of the Vatican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2216
01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:51.733
<v Speaker 3>we got super lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hired a professor and he was </v>

2217
01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:59.660
<v Speaker 3>fantastic and he loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew a lot about ancient history,</v>

2218
01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:03.740
<v Speaker 3>particularly their use of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like we were talking about that giant</v>

2219
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:06.860
<v Speaker 3>pine cone that's in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vatican.</v>

2220
01:45:06.861 --> 01:45:11.090
<v Speaker 3>They have this outdoor area with a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>pine cone and he goes and he goes,</v>

2221
01:45:11.091 --> 01:45:12.260
<v Speaker 3>do you know what that represents?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2222
01:45:12.261 --> 01:45:14.960
<v Speaker 3>that's the pineal gland that he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know?</v>

2223
01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:18.590
<v Speaker 3>And then we started talking and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>started talking about like drugs and you</v>

2224
01:45:18.591 --> 01:45:19.424
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endogenous production of </v>

2225
01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:22.210
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no shit.</v>

2226
01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.710
<v Speaker 3>And he and I like fucking ignored my </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

2227
01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:28.670
<v Speaker 3>We were holding hands and wander through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Vatican together.</v>

2228
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:33.110
<v Speaker 3>But as this guy was explaining that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

2229
01:45:33.111 --> 01:45:35.540
<v Speaker 3>why are their dicks also a little?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2230
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:36.403
<v Speaker 3>that's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that a large dick was </v>

2231
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:44.360
<v Speaker 3>thought to be like a gross primitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing like this,</v>

2232
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.433
<v Speaker 3>like to have a large Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were like a non evolved thing and </v>

2233
01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:54.820
<v Speaker 3>that hit when you think about how close </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people were to cave people,</v>

2234
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're thinking about a thousand,</v>

2235
01:45:58.790 --> 01:46:00.500
<v Speaker 3>2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2236
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Go back 2000 years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what the fuck do you have?</v>

2237
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:07.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have ancient Egypt and a few,</v>

2238
01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:08.593
<v Speaker 3>but you have essentially like small </v>
<v Speaker 3>villages 2000 years before that you </v>

2239
01:46:12.651 --> 01:46:14.120
<v Speaker 3>don't have the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2240
01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.190
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the wheel,</v>

2241
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:21.170
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes back somewhere around 5,500</v>

2242
01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:22.004
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the first evidence of the wheel </v>

2243
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:23.923
<v Speaker 3>that is super recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people were essentially </v>

2244
01:46:27.441 --> 01:46:30.650
<v Speaker 3>realizing that there's a better way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now we have Rome,</v>

2245
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:33.710
<v Speaker 3>we have a sophistication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have art,</v>

2246
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:34.723
<v Speaker 3>we have culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have music and wine and we're not </v>

2247
01:46:36.861 --> 01:46:37.694
<v Speaker 3>going to go back to those big dick ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smashing heads and just fucking like </v>

2248
01:46:41.210 --> 01:46:42.043
<v Speaker 3>wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think when they thought of like </v>

2249
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:46.820
<v Speaker 3>the barbarian hordes that would come and</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2250
01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 3>just fucking rape and pillage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably those big</v>

2251
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:50.963
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>juicy dicks were one of the reasons why </v>

2252
01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:54.953
<v Speaker 1>there was so horrible and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so base and vile and primitive and has </v>

2253
01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:03.750
<v Speaker 1>been hogs and smash and skulls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>raping and killing.</v>

2254
01:47:04.210 --> 01:47:05.043
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to move past that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one way that they tried to express </v>

2255
01:47:08.071 --> 01:47:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that was in their art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sophisticated,</v>

2256
01:47:10.651 --> 01:47:14.400
<v Speaker 1>incredibly anatomically correct art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they all have these little tiny baby</v>

2257
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:16.303
<v Speaker 1>and these baby dicks were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent like culture and </v>

2258
01:47:18.301 --> 01:47:19.134
<v Speaker 1>sophistication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like how a fat woman was </v>

2259
01:47:21.871 --> 01:47:24.690
<v Speaker 1>supposed to represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a woman who ate a lot,</v>

2260
01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a woman of culture.</v>

2261
01:47:26.281 --> 01:47:28.110
<v Speaker 1>So they were attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look at that guy.</v>

2262
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:32.820
<v Speaker 1>He's built like Brock Lesnar and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a dick like peewee Herman,</v>

2263
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

2264
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if people are hurting us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

2265
01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:36.173
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was because over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time the Deq must've just got knocked </v>

2266
01:47:39.181 --> 01:47:40.950
<v Speaker 1>off and that's why they were so small.</v>

2267
01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:41.851
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2268
01:47:41.851 --> 01:47:42.684
<v Speaker 1>They purposely represented these </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic muscular men as having tiny </v>

2269
01:47:48.931 --> 01:47:49.764
<v Speaker 1>penises which showed sophistication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there were almost in this </v>

2270
01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 1>transitionary period of like the muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>were big.</v>

2271
01:47:57.151 --> 01:48:00.300
<v Speaker 1>The body was obviously like very primal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2272
01:48:00.301 --> 01:48:03.780
<v Speaker 1>they were there obviously very fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had these little tiny cox in.</v>

2273
01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they,</v>

2274
01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:06.630
<v Speaker 1>what they admired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that holds.</v>

2275
01:48:06.631 --> 01:48:07.464
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that translates to the myth </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the African American man has a big </v>

2276
01:48:12.631 --> 01:48:16.460
<v Speaker 1>penis goes to that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a myth pal,</v>

2277
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:21.450
<v Speaker 1>you got news for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have movies lacked.com</v>

2278
01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:26.000
<v Speaker 1>is a website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called blacked out.</v>

2279
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:26.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple porn stars that have </v>

2280
01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:30.150
<v Speaker 1>followed on twitter and they'll just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like post,</v>

2281
01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:32.010
<v Speaker 1>like that's the weird thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

2282
01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll forget that I'll follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn stars.</v>

2283
01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going through my twitter feed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2284
01:48:36.301 --> 01:48:37.134
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dick and an ass just out of </v>

2285
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:40.143
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>

2286
01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:41.003
<v Speaker 1>There's a girl like taking a hot with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>face like like twitter is one of the </v>

2287
01:48:45.841 --> 01:48:48.090
<v Speaker 1>things that I actually love about </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

2288
01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Twitter in a lot of ways is still wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2289
01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying to get ahold of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2290
01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get jack from twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head guy on the podcast.</v>

2291
01:48:58.711 --> 01:49:01.650
<v Speaker 1>We've been going back and forth and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed some interest about it,</v>

2292
01:49:01.651 --> 01:49:02.484
<v Speaker 1>but a little trepidation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little worried about how to </v>

2293
01:49:04.050 --> 01:49:04.883
<v Speaker 1>because they're trying to censor people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people they're trying to censor </v>

2294
01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.350
<v Speaker 1>or the people that are actively </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassing people,</v>

2295
01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:14.273
<v Speaker 1>the people that are using unwanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual advances and sending unwanted </v>

2296
01:49:18.541 --> 01:49:22.560
<v Speaker 1>naked photos and things on those lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people right up ending elections.</v>

2297
01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:24.173
<v Speaker 1>That's a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something I thought was </v>

2298
01:49:25.171 --> 01:49:26.310
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

2299
01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:27.213
<v Speaker 1>I fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I retweeted it and accidentally </v>

2300
01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.310
<v Speaker 1>unreached tweeted it and then I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>find it.</v>

2301
01:49:33.450 --> 01:49:36.870
<v Speaker 1>She never do things on my computer when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's late at night and I'm barely paying</v>

2302
01:49:36.871 --> 01:49:37.704
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone posted something that this </v>

2303
01:49:41.341 --> 01:49:44.700
<v Speaker 1>person that was claiming they were from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhode Island,</v>

2304
01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:46.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posted the tweeting about Hillary </v>

2305
01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Clinton.</v>

2306
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.353
<v Speaker 3>It was like in response to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Donald Trump had done really </v>

2307
01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:52.053
<v Speaker 3>recently that was fucked up and about </v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary and are deleted emails and they </v>

2308
01:49:55.631 --> 01:49:58.510
<v Speaker 3>left their location on and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

2309
01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's tons of that.</v>

2310
01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:03.970
<v Speaker 3>There's tons of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these unknown accounts.</v>

2311
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:08.020
<v Speaker 3>It was like Kevin Underscore 2012 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

2312
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:13.350
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of these accounts where these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are attacking Hillary Clinton and</v>

2313
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:18.790
<v Speaker 3>supporting trump and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing talking points.</v>

2314
01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:21.880
<v Speaker 3>We literally have to understand this </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't just,</v>

2315
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:22.893
<v Speaker 3>this isn't just a trope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't just like some weird talking </v>

2316
01:50:27.791 --> 01:50:28.624
<v Speaker 3>point the Democrats keep using.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are thousands and thousands of </v>

2317
01:50:34.481 --> 01:50:35.314
<v Speaker 3>fake Internet accounts that are designed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to attack people that are supporting </v>

2318
01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:42.994
<v Speaker 3>someone who's in opposition of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>interests and to support someone who is </v>

2319
01:50:47.081 --> 01:50:50.050
<v Speaker 3>on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these are these people,</v>

2320
01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:50.913
<v Speaker 3>these online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're real people or whether </v>

2321
01:50:52.991 --> 01:50:55.600
<v Speaker 3>they're bought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all pro trump,</v>

2322
01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:56.620
<v Speaker 3>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're all</v>

2323
01:50:56.690 --> 01:50:57.523
<v Speaker 2>pro trump and a lot of them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stoking the racial tension because </v>

2324
01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:03.890
<v Speaker 2>that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That helped trump get elected.</v>

2325
01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:04.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2326
01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>

2327
01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:09.260
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating that people are denying</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2328
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:10.123
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of people in the right or </v>

2329
01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:12.530
<v Speaker 3>denying this and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2330
01:51:12.531 --> 01:51:15.050
<v Speaker 3>the Democrats are just whining and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost.</v>

2331
01:51:15.051 --> 01:51:16.730
<v Speaker 3>Get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot of that.</v>

2332
01:51:16.731 --> 01:51:17.564
<v Speaker 3>You lost get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to understand what's happening </v>

2333
01:51:20.391 --> 01:51:23.300
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not necessarily dealing with real</v>

2334
01:51:23.301 --> 01:51:25.310
<v Speaker 3>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really the right.</v>

2335
01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:28.790
<v Speaker 3>And the left communicating stand each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other's points.</v>

2336
01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Debating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2337
01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:32.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a fuck.</v>

2338
01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:36.170
<v Speaker 3>They're not even here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're pretending that they're here</v>

2339
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:37.243
<v Speaker 3>and they're talking shit about the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're talking shit about Anthony </v>

2340
01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:42.373
<v Speaker 3>Wiener or Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're not even necessarily real </v>

2341
01:51:44.511 --> 01:51:46.370
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might be,</v>

2342
01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:47.293
<v Speaker 3>but they might just be people that meant</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might just have scripts that they </v>

2343
01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:52.460
<v Speaker 3>send out from hundreds of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>accounts.</v>

2344
01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:57.680
<v Speaker 3>They might be looking for key words like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a weird information war going on</v>

2345
01:51:57.681 --> 01:52:00.050
<v Speaker 3>right now and an influence war going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

2346
01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:02.300
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to admit it's real.</v>

2347
01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:04.480
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking a hundred percent.</v>

2348
01:52:04.730 --> 01:52:05.740
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2349
01:52:05.741 --> 01:52:10.090
<v Speaker 2>facebook has already gotten rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of accounts because they found</v>

2350
01:52:10.091 --> 01:52:10.924
<v Speaker 2>that they were Russian accounts and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ads that were being taken out on </v>

2351
01:52:13.811 --> 01:52:14.644
<v Speaker 2>facebook where they track the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were ads that were bought by </v>

2352
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was the government or</v>

2353
01:52:21.221 --> 01:52:22.054
<v Speaker 2>just the oligarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were purchasing ads on </v>

2354
01:52:24.881 --> 01:52:25.960
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2373
01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:19.640
<v Speaker 3>not limited by the twitter API because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't use it.</v>

2374
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:21.080
<v Speaker 3>Exclamation point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2375
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:22.303
<v Speaker 3>We should do an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should buy that and see how much we </v>

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:42.393
<v Speaker 3>80 5,000</v>

<v Speaker 3>like a quarter million and like a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of months at about 7 million.</v>

2383
01:53:47.811 --> 01:53:48.644
<v Speaker 3>Probably by the end of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A million by the end of the week might </v>

2384
01:53:51.771 --> 01:53:52.604
<v Speaker 3>get noticed because I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as we're really open about what </v>

2385
01:54:01.671 --> 01:54:02.504
<v Speaker 3>we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that will be really a </v>

2386
01:54:03.231 --> 01:54:05.170
<v Speaker 3>fascinating experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2387
01:54:05.250 --> 01:54:09.070
<v Speaker 3>and you do it well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We use these things and then we,</v>

2388
01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:12.090
<v Speaker 3>we buy you a bunch of fake accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2389
01:54:12.710 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean not fake accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fake followers.</v>

2390
01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:16.880
<v Speaker 3>We get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just use it.</v>

2391
01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:19.070
<v Speaker 3>You can get fake followers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2392
01:54:19.130 --> 01:54:21.650
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I checked the other day how many of</v>

2393
01:54:21.651 --> 01:54:22.484
<v Speaker 3>my followers are fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God it was the exact same </v>

2394
01:54:24.081 --> 01:54:26.630
<v Speaker 3>feeling I had when I took an HIV test </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 93.</v>

2395
01:54:26.631 --> 01:54:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoo,</v>

2396
01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.140
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Kinda.</v>

2397
01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:32.053
<v Speaker 3>I kinda enjoy looking at the number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>followers I have and they were all </v>

2398
01:54:35.421 --> 01:54:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Russian bots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not mine.</v>

2399
01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:42.920
<v Speaker 3>It's almost all real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the number of that the president has</v>

2400
01:54:42.921 --> 01:54:45.680
<v Speaker 3>is like 50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 50 percent fan accounts.</v>

2401
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:46.963
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if he hired or if they just </v>

2402
01:54:50.031 --> 01:54:50.864
<v Speaker 3>follow him because he's the president </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a good thing to have like a </v>

2403
01:54:53.991 --> 01:54:57.560
<v Speaker 3>fake account falling the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially these Russian troll accounts.</v>

2404
01:54:58.010 --> 01:54:58.843
<v Speaker 5>I think this came up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like the first time when John </v>

2405
01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:01.513
<v Speaker 5>Kerry was running against Obama and they</v>

2474
01:57:54.651 --> 01:57:58.280
<v Speaker 3>doing it was because the amount of likes</v>

2509
01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:41.230
<v Speaker 5>He just went and popped it out through </v>
<v Speaker 5>some gauze on it.</v>

2510
01:59:41.231 --> 01:59:43.530
<v Speaker 5>I did three shows that night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No worries.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Nothing just pop right out now.</v>

2514
01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:51.373
<v Speaker 5>And so what do they do now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put a like a crown in there or </v>

2515
01:59:53.651 --> 01:59:56.080
<v Speaker 5>something or a wisdom tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they just leave it out.</v>

2516
01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:57.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2518
02:00:01.181 --> 02:00:03.480

<v Speaker 5>Otherwise you get a infection,</v>

2519
02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:08.520
<v Speaker 5>dry hole or something they call it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because your bone underneath is exposed.</v>

2520
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:12.370
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need a blood clot to get in there.</v>

2521
02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.233
<v Speaker 5>And if the blood clot doesn't form then </v>
<v Speaker 5>your bone is exposed and your breath </v>

2522
02:00:16.431 --> 02:00:17.264
<v Speaker 5>apparently becomes like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>nightmare and you get an infection and </v>

2523
02:00:21.491 --> 02:00:23.470
<v Speaker 5>you'll get a pain all the way through </v>
<v Speaker 5>your ear.</v>

2524
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:26.740
<v Speaker 5>And it happens to like five percent of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that get their wisdom teeth taken</v>

2525
02:00:26.741 --> 02:00:27.030
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2526
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.863
<v Speaker 5>Do you know the people that get mouth </v>
<v Speaker 5>infections oftentimes get heart attacks </v>

2527
02:00:30.701 --> 02:00:32.050
<v Speaker 5>because of him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that.</v>

2528
02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck man?</v>

2529
02:00:34.110 --> 02:00:35.560
<v Speaker 5>You would think you just have bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>breath.</v>

2530
02:00:35.710 --> 02:00:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2531
02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:37.540
<v Speaker 5>he could die,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2532
02:00:37.541 --> 02:00:40.210
<v Speaker 5>What do you do when somebody you know </v>
<v Speaker 5>well has bad brown.</v>

2533
02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:42.420
<v Speaker 5>Do you fucking done that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2534
02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well me too.</v>

2535
02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:44.553
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell me,</v>

2536
02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:48.610
<v Speaker 5>tell you my breath stinks sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I trick a lot of coffee.</v>

2537
02:00:48.611 --> 02:00:50.830
<v Speaker 5>That's my downfall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my mind as well.</v>

2538
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:52.620
<v Speaker 5>You also have your brush your tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2539
02:00:52.710 --> 02:00:56.560
<v Speaker 5>You got to brush your tongue goodbye and</v>
<v Speaker 5>account that had 240,000</v>

2540
02:00:56.561 --> 02:00:57.394
<v Speaker 5>plus followers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's over five years old for 150 </v>

2541
02:00:59.261 --> 02:01:00.160
<v Speaker 5>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2542
02:01:00.161 --> 02:01:03.160
<v Speaker 5>but that's all a whole account taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the account.</v>

2543
02:01:03.161 --> 02:01:06.160
<v Speaker 5>But when you switch the name of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>followers wouldn't know the difference.</v>

2544
02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:08.590
<v Speaker 5>Why does to count?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was following.</v>

2545
02:01:08.591 --> 02:01:09.424
<v Speaker 5>It must have been some meme account.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just noticed that it switched to like </v>

2546
02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:15.310
<v Speaker 5>booty pics or some shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2547
02:01:15.311 --> 02:01:17.530
<v Speaker 5>when did I start following like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2548
02:01:17.531 --> 02:01:19.320
<v Speaker 5>But that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not good.</v>

2549
02:01:19.670 --> 02:01:21.010
<v Speaker 5>So it won't be the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could,</v>

2550
02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:23.140
<v Speaker 5>instead of having $85,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow,</v>

2551
02:01:23.141 --> 02:01:25.030
<v Speaker 5>he will have $250,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2552
02:01:25.031 --> 02:01:26.890
<v Speaker 5>But they wouldn't be the same followers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2553
02:01:27.390 --> 02:01:29.140
<v Speaker 5>I think it makes it blends them </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

2554
02:01:29.170 --> 02:01:31.710
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he adds those followers.</v>

2555
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:33.310
<v Speaker 5>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens when that goes down?</v>

2556
02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:36.490
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would add an additional 250,000</v>

2557
02:01:36.491 --> 02:01:38.440
<v Speaker 5>followers or 240,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>followers.</v>

2558
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm</v>

2559
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:40.873
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm apparently when you eat a ketogenic </v>

2560
02:01:46.041 --> 02:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm on,</v>

2561
02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like a low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high fat diet.</v>

2562
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:54.350
<v Speaker 1>It makes your breath smell like fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2563
02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2564
02:01:55.311 --> 02:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pretty cognizant of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty aware I was it a lot.</v>

2565
02:01:59.610 --> 02:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2566
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Because the meat doesn't digest just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

2567
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:03.163
<v Speaker 1>It's just fat burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I did your body burns fat as a fuel </v>

2568
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>instead of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or excuse me,</v>

2569
02:02:08.710 --> 02:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>instead of carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the standard American diet,</v>

2570
02:02:12.170 --> 02:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>we eat a lot of refined carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breads,</v>

2571
02:02:14.901 --> 02:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>pastas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>

2572
02:02:16.190 --> 02:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And what I try to do is lean to a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more fat based Diet.</v>

2573
02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of coconut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of avocado meet things along those</v>

2574
02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:28.130
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have very much carbs.</v>

2575
02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>My carbon takes pretty low except when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go off the rails,</v>

2576
02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:32.893
<v Speaker 1>I go off the rails like maybe once a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week or so I'll have like pasta or </v>

2577
02:02:35.571 --> 02:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2578
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.863
<v Speaker 1>not pizza.</v>

2579
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had pizza in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my super off the rails.</v>

2580
02:02:41.121 --> 02:02:41.954
<v Speaker 1>Food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you're in New York for a </v>

2581
02:02:43.131 --> 02:02:43.964
<v Speaker 1>couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You eat a full pizza and then just feel </v>

2582
02:02:46.041 --> 02:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking slob too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So disco.</v>

2583
02:02:49.190 --> 02:02:51.200
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing what I'm willing to do for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

2584
02:02:51.201 --> 02:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for that second.</v>

2585
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Trish and then you just feel like </v>

2586
02:02:57.351 --> 02:02:58.184
<v Speaker 1>shit for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the taste only lasts for like 20 </v>

2587
02:03:00.591 --> 02:03:02.060
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2588
02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:03.193
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to sacrifice hours of </v>

2589
02:03:05.241 --> 02:03:07.790
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what do you sacrificed for an orgasm</v>

2590
02:03:07.791 --> 02:03:08.624
<v Speaker 1>when you're single?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of booze that you'll buy a </v>

2591
02:03:10.641 --> 02:03:13.580
<v Speaker 1>girl and conversation you'll listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

2592
02:03:13.581 --> 02:03:16.340
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't have their own size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second Orgasm.</v>

2593
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:17.263
<v Speaker 1>The only downside is you fuck someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really like and then you have </v>

2594
02:03:19.611 --> 02:03:23.000
<v Speaker 1>to talk to them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those brutal days,</v>

2595
02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:24.113
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the most brutal move was </v>

2596
02:03:25.341 --> 02:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>ever when I was young and stupid.</v>

2597
02:03:27.590 --> 02:03:30.680
<v Speaker 1>You would go on a vacation with a girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you didn't really know that.</v>

2598
02:03:30.710 --> 02:03:31.543
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or invite her to come out with you on </v>

2599
02:03:33.561 --> 02:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2600
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working in Philadelphia this weekend</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>

2602
02:03:42.170 --> 02:03:45.800

<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2603
02:03:45.801 --> 02:03:49.010
<v Speaker 1>an an hour after you came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't deal with them.</v>

2604
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:51.470
<v Speaker 1>You would just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I did this.</v>

2605
02:03:51.471 --> 02:03:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Like you thought it was the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

2606
02:03:53.391 --> 02:03:55.400
<v Speaker 1>We'll get together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have some fun.</v>

2607
02:03:55.401 --> 02:03:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll take her to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have.</v>

2608
02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:01.490
<v Speaker 1>She can come see my shows and back then </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2609
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:02.833
<v Speaker 1>like people didn't have cell phones so </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like on top of each other and </v>

2610
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:08.790
<v Speaker 1>didn't have anything to do phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2611
02:04:09.090 --> 02:04:10.520
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got to.</v>

2612
02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:11.373
<v Speaker 1>You Got Cable TV and you're gluing had </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable and if you're on the road you a </v>

2613
02:04:16.131 --> 02:04:19.670
<v Speaker 1>lot of times just staying back then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're staying in these terrible hotels.</v>

2614
02:04:20.090 --> 02:04:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any money,</v>

2615
02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:22.813
<v Speaker 1>so you stayed in some bullshit ass hotel</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like three channels that you could </v>

2616
02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:27.110
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one restaurant,</v>

2617
02:04:27.111 --> 02:04:27.944
<v Speaker 1>some Shitty Deli and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have nothing in common with the </v>

2618
02:04:30.681 --> 02:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just had sex with zero.</v>

2619
02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:37.100
<v Speaker 1>That's when you just start drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That leads to the fight.</v>

2620
02:04:37.530 --> 02:04:38.363
<v Speaker 1>There's a bus stop involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it fucking trailways station </v>

2621
02:04:41.461 --> 02:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>involved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2622
02:04:43.890 --> 02:04:46.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about like finding someone that</v>

2623
02:04:46.711 --> 02:04:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you are compatible with that you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fuck.</v>

2624
02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2625
02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Because those are two totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2626
02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:53.903
<v Speaker 1>Like you could find someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have amazing conversation with but you </v>

2627
02:04:56.551 --> 02:05:00.990
<v Speaker 1>have zero sexual attraction to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to find a combo.</v>

2628
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:02.183
<v Speaker 1>You have to find someone that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually attracted to but you really </v>

2629
02:05:03.871 --> 02:05:04.704
<v Speaker 1>enjoy them as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking to and sometimes those are just </v>

2630
02:05:07.591 --> 02:05:09.230
<v Speaker 1>not the same things.</v>

2631
02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:10.483
<v Speaker 1>Like especially for guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's must be that way for girls </v>

2632
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:13.283
<v Speaker 1>obviously can't speak for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're a guy and you meet a </v>

2633
02:05:15.451 --> 02:05:20.451
<v Speaker 1>girl like who's got a little ways and </v>
<v Speaker 1>big tits and a big ass willing to put up</v>

2634

<v Speaker 1>with a lot of nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even notice.</v>

2635
02:05:22.921 --> 02:05:27.840
<v Speaker 1>You're not even putting up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so fascinated by the looks at the</v>

2636
02:05:27.841 --> 02:05:28.674
<v Speaker 1>whatever she's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of flowing through bar </v>

2637
02:05:30.901 --> 02:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's talking nonsense,</v>

2638
02:05:32.251 --> 02:05:36.060

<v Speaker 1>The promise of pleasure.</v>

2640
02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>She put her claws on a brow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>eat in front of men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like.</v>

2660

<v Speaker 1>eating by them,</v>

2662
02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:27.413
<v Speaker 1>eating in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you judging how much </v>

<v Speaker 1>She's going to be a big car.</v>

2664
02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:37.551
<v Speaker 1>When she gets older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just fucking shoveling in a face.</v>

2665
02:06:38.430 --> 02:06:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford the upkeep or keeping up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this fucking food dispenser.</v>

2666
02:06:42.630 --> 02:06:45.330
<v Speaker 1>She's going to take a giant shit in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

2667
02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.193
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if a girl has to shit but tries to </v>

2668
02:06:49.081 --> 02:06:51.240
<v Speaker 1>hold it in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't want you to know.</v>

2669
02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy of mine and he had a,</v>

2670
02:06:54.361 --> 02:06:56.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a one bedroom,</v>

2671
02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:57.293
<v Speaker 1>not even a one bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a studio and the bathroom is </v>

2672
02:07:00.241 --> 02:07:03.390
<v Speaker 1>right beside the bed was just like right</v>
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

2673
02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:08.730
<v Speaker 1>And he was dating this girl and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sweating there and just wrecked it.</v>

2674
02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Just wrecked his bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's,</v>

2675
02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:13.123
<v Speaker 1>she would do it like every time she came</v>
<v Speaker 1>over she would just go in there and </v>

2676
02:07:15.210 --> 02:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>records bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always complained about it and know what</v>

2677
02:07:23.041 --> 02:07:24.360
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2678
02:07:24.361 --> 02:07:26.310
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is such a killer.</v>

2679
02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I would show her right to the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time that happened as she came</v>

2680
02:07:30.841 --> 02:07:33.360
<v Speaker 1>out of the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd take her arm gently and say,</v>

2681
02:07:33.361 --> 02:07:34.590
<v Speaker 1>it's time for you to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2682
02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>But what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do</v>

2683
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:36.910
<v Speaker 5>if you have to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

2684
02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:40.000
<v Speaker 5>Like what is you go over a girl's house </v>
<v Speaker 5>and she lives in a studio apartment.</v>

2685
02:07:40.290 --> 02:07:42.820
<v Speaker 5>He could take a walk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go to a Mcdonald's or something?</v>

2686
02:07:42.930 --> 02:07:43.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be right back.</v>

2687
02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.270
<v Speaker 5>I left something in my car and you go </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit in the bushes shit.</v>

2688
02:07:46.271 --> 02:07:47.950
<v Speaker 5>And the bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>San Francisco.</v>

2689
02:07:47.951 --> 02:07:52.480
<v Speaker 5>You go ride on the sidewalk and going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2690
02:07:52.481 --> 02:07:56.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean even with my wife like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I closed the door.</v>

2691
02:07:56.741 --> 02:07:59.200
<v Speaker 5>I hide the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't care.</v>

2692
02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:03.820
<v Speaker 5>Door open sits with their legs crossed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hear him taking a dump and it's just</v>

2693
02:08:03.821 --> 02:08:04.654
<v Speaker 5>so discouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That echo from the fart before the shit </v>

2694
02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:10.114
<v Speaker 5>comes up.</v>

2695
02:08:12.890 --> 02:08:13.980
<v Speaker 5>PLOP.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2696
02:08:14.130 --> 02:08:17.080
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go race a race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bad memory.</v>

2697
02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:21.670
<v Speaker 5>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know everyone shits.</v>

2698
02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:22.533
<v Speaker 5>It's like why is it so disturbing to us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we have this idealized image of </v>

2699
02:08:26.981 --> 02:08:28.990
<v Speaker 5>like some movie woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2700
02:08:28.991 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 5>and when it doesn't turn out to be that </v>
<v Speaker 5>way turned out to be.</v>

2701
02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 5>She's an actual human who shits like </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular people were so discouraged,</v>

2702
02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.560
<v Speaker 5>which so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Show upset.</v>

2703
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:41.260
<v Speaker 5>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I see certain beautiful women,</v>

2704
02:08:41.261 --> 02:08:43.990
<v Speaker 5>I remind myself that they shit and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>

2705
02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:45.820
<v Speaker 5>I can't process it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>

2706
02:08:45.821 --> 02:08:47.260
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no she doesn't.</v>

2707
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:48.094
<v Speaker 5>She can't.</v>

2708
02:08:50.070 --> 02:08:52.990
<v Speaker 5>Such as Kathleen Turner Shits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2709
02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:55.750
<v Speaker 5>Giant dumpster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just probably never really wipes good.</v>

2710
02:08:56.890 --> 02:08:57.723
<v Speaker 5>Probably was disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She just gives up halfway and starts </v>

2711
02:09:00.161 --> 02:09:02.770
<v Speaker 5>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She does one light no matter what.</v>

2712
02:09:02.771 --> 02:09:06.760
<v Speaker 5>That's her file as they got a flask </v>
<v Speaker 5>right there sitting on the bowl.</v>

2713
02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:11.880
<v Speaker 5>So she just doesn't even look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One wife doesn't inspect,</v>

2714
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:14.440
<v Speaker 5>just drops it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2715
02:09:14.441 --> 02:09:15.274
<v Speaker 5>We got here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those Japanese toilets and has a </v>

2716
02:09:16.811 --> 02:09:17.644
<v Speaker 5>button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You press a button and it shoots water </v>

2717
02:09:18.431 --> 02:09:19.720
<v Speaker 5>up your ass.</v>

<v Speaker 5>flotation tank in it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2720
02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:26.740
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one over here.</v>

2721
02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:27.551
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>those things here.</v>

2723
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:34.120
<v Speaker 5>What temperature is the water though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always warm.</v>

2724

<v Speaker 5>Arms War.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nice.</v>

2725
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:40.390
<v Speaker 5>I need to go there before I leave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even have to.</v>

2726
02:09:40.391 --> 02:09:42.190
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>released in your body or anybody denies </v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2799
02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:14.510
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

2800
02:13:15.070 --> 02:13:15.903
<v Speaker 2>uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we went into the club and it </v>

2801
02:13:17.601 --> 02:13:20.150
<v Speaker 2>was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a roadhouse,</v>

2802
02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:24.410
<v Speaker 2>just like in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this just boxy kind of a room.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And we go in and uh,</v>

2805
02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:31.093
<v Speaker 2>I was doing this joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably remembered as one of my </v>

2806
02:13:33.061 --> 02:13:37.440
<v Speaker 2>standard jokes back then have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually now,</v>

2807
02:13:37.450 --> 02:13:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was about the sign,</v>

2808
02:13:39.631 --> 02:13:40.464
<v Speaker 2>no radio in car and people used to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>those signs because they didn't want </v>

2809
02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:45.930
<v Speaker 2>someone breaking into the car and stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the radio.</v>

2810
02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:51.710
<v Speaker 2>So I had a joke about how I had that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that somebody then broke into my car and</v>

2811
02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:53.604
<v Speaker 2>they took the sign or Sunday took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio and the sign wood or whatever it </v>

2812
02:13:55.981 --> 02:13:56.814
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody yelled at it was probably </v>

2813
02:13:58.951 --> 02:14:02.190
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said n word and I went,</v>

2814
02:14:02.191 --> 02:14:04.230
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2815
02:14:04.231 --> 02:14:05.310
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I may,</v>

2816
02:14:05.311 --> 02:14:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I've repeated it to make them say like </v>
<v Speaker 2>as if to shame them.</v>

2817
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:11.010
<v Speaker 2>And then somebody else on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the crack goes.</v>

2818
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:14.640

<v Speaker 2>And she drove me back.</v>

2823
02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:36.090
<v Speaker 2>She drove back to Boston and I,</v>

02:16:28.081 --> 02:16:29.090
<v Speaker 1>people in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2862
02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:30.633
<v Speaker 1>People run out of things to get mad at </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll go after people for </v>

2863
02:16:33.311 --> 02:16:34.560
<v Speaker 1>saying the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2864
02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:35.673
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't even acknowledge it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to get it out of our front </v>

2865
02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:39.460
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely.</v>

2866
02:16:39.610 --> 02:16:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By acknowledging it,</v>

2867
02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:42.723
<v Speaker 1>you're not helping.</v>

2868
02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:47.170
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only just started saying the n word.</v>

2869
02:16:47.171 --> 02:16:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I used to say the n word on my radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2870
02:16:50.531 --> 02:16:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I would just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why did you stop saying that?</v>

2871
02:16:53.350 --> 02:16:54.183
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that by not saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like this ridiculously </v>

2872
02:16:57.731 --> 02:17:01.420
<v Speaker 1>charged magic word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a racist like wire words.</v>

2873
02:17:01.421 --> 02:17:02.254
<v Speaker 1>Magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't words supposed to be sounds that </v>

2874
02:17:04.631 --> 02:17:08.740
<v Speaker 1>you make that convey intent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intent or description?</v>

2875
02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:09.881
<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2876
02:17:09.881 --> 02:17:10.714
<v Speaker 1>that's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use the n word or you can say </v>

2877
02:17:13.181 --> 02:17:13.770
<v Speaker 1>the n word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2878
02:17:13.770 --> 02:17:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

2879
02:17:14.310 --> 02:17:15.143
<v Speaker 1>You're conveying intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your intent is to describe a scenario </v>

2880
02:17:18.461 --> 02:17:23.461
<v Speaker 1>where someone said something in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular way that showed racism.</v>

2881
02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:24.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2882
02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:28.420
<v Speaker 1>That's your intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say the n word,</v>

2883
02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you're saying the kid cannot be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It cannot be altered.</v>

2884
02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It is sacred word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a magic word.</v>

2885
02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:38.050
<v Speaker 1>If you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candy man will come.</v>

2886
02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very weird.</v>

2887
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:42.520
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird that we've ever allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2888
02:17:42.730 --> 02:17:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing like you could say spic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to get mad,</v>

2889
02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:51.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not as racially charged,</v>

2890
02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:54.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2891
02:17:54.410 --> 02:17:55.670
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's other ones,</v>

2892
02:17:55.671 --> 02:17:57.590
<v Speaker 1>so like you can just get away with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

2893
02:17:58.130 --> 02:17:58.963
<v Speaker 1>like Irish ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italian bank or Guido or they don't </v>

2894
02:18:02.331 --> 02:18:03.590
<v Speaker 1>give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2895
02:18:03.770 --> 02:18:06.170
<v Speaker 1>you can call me a guido all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2896
02:18:06.171 --> 02:18:09.170
<v Speaker 1>No one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get very upset about.</v>

2897
02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about Google?</v>

2898
02:18:12.090 --> 02:18:14.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a really rough one now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the n word,</v>

2899
02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:15.673
<v Speaker 1>you won't say it.</v>

2900
02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.900
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>look at you</v>

2901
02:18:20.610 --> 02:18:25.610
<v Speaker 1>nigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a charged word.</v>

2902
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:30.180
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you say someone,</v>

2903
02:18:30.210 --> 02:18:33.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're saying that you're at the club</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone yells out,</v>

2904
02:18:33.901 --> 02:18:37.350
<v Speaker 1>it was probably in that gap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably exactly.</v>

2905
02:18:37.351 --> 02:18:40.410
<v Speaker 1>They said that that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not racist.</v>

2906
02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Not being racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by saying he yells out,</v>

2907
02:18:44.041 --> 02:18:44.874
<v Speaker 1>it was probably an n word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're putting all this weight on </v>

2908
02:18:47.791 --> 02:18:48.760
<v Speaker 1>that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2909
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2910
02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And you're not using it in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

2911
02:18:53.491 --> 02:18:57.540
<v Speaker 1>You personally are not using it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>promote racism.</v>

2912
02:18:57.600 --> 02:18:58.433
<v Speaker 1>You're doing the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about what apes you're </v>

2913
02:19:01.711 --> 02:19:06.330
<v Speaker 1>doing standup for a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl was laughing at those apes.</v>

2914
02:19:07.670 --> 02:19:12.670
<v Speaker 2>And also the crazy thing is that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can get Latino.</v>

2915
02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:17.930
<v Speaker 2>They can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can still say it even like a,</v>

2916
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:20.690
<v Speaker 2>you see Middle Eastern kids that grow up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hood.</v>

2917
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:21.703
<v Speaker 2>They say it.</v>

2918
02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:23.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you seem to be in some sort </v>

2919
02:19:25.531 --> 02:19:27.680
<v Speaker 1>of a marginalized group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2920
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:30.140
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a lot of Chinese people use </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2921
02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:31.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2922
02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:33.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting.</v>

2923
02:19:33.051 --> 02:19:35.440
<v Speaker 5>And then like into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2924
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:37.540
<v Speaker 5>People are really into hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2925
02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:38.893
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll use it and they use with the a </v>

2926
02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:42.284
<v Speaker 5>on the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but black people just throw it around </v>

2927
02:19:44.961 --> 02:19:46.040
<v Speaker 5>like a beach ball to concert.</v>

2928
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:47.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son likes rap and I go and he sings </v>

2929
02:19:48.901 --> 02:19:49.734
<v Speaker 2>it and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do when you hit the end </v>

2930
02:19:50.811 --> 02:19:54.860
<v Speaker 2>where he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say player friends,</v>

2931
02:19:55.050 --> 02:19:56.100
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>player,</v>

2932
02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:02.280
<v Speaker 5>what do you think Tom Hanks' son says?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says it be losing power.</v>

2933
02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:06.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's getting dark and that's back.</v>

2934
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:07.623
<v Speaker 5>That's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a stupid thing to have said that </v>

2935
02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:13.060
<v Speaker 5>like four times yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they set that up on purpose?</v>

2936
02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:16.450
<v Speaker 5>Now we need to switch that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get to say for the first show,</v>

2937
02:20:16.810 --> 02:20:18.280
<v Speaker 5>it's gone very smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2938
02:20:18.281 --> 02:20:19.114
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have a few hiccups that we need to </v>

2939
02:20:19.931 --> 02:20:20.764
<v Speaker 5>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought that echo was going to be an </v>

2940
02:20:22.061 --> 02:20:22.894
<v Speaker 5>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it seems like it's just those </v>

2941
02:20:23.411 --> 02:20:24.640
<v Speaker 5>microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the echo,</v>

2942
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:25.630
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is right.</v>

2943
02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:27.220
<v Speaker 5>Because it doesn't sound any different </v>
<v Speaker 5>than me.</v>

2944
02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:30.480
<v Speaker 5>I like the purple behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fetching.</v>

2945
02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:32.560
<v Speaker 5>It's really for your skin tone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me say.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Put me up on like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a nice change,</v>

2948
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:36.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the real,</v>

2949
02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:38.290
<v Speaker 5>the only reason in all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

<v Speaker 5>doing it,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Some purple cabbage or some shit to </v>

2977
02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:46.060
<v Speaker 5>cauliflower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cauliflower.</v>

2978
02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:48.311
<v Speaker 5>Pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty.</v>

2979
02:21:48.311 --> 02:21:51.730
<v Speaker 5>Pretty color purple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was associated with prince.</v>

2980
02:21:52.450 --> 02:21:54.280
<v Speaker 5>That's her right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>

2981
02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:57.010
<v Speaker 5>That was the one of the biggest bummers </v>
<v Speaker 5>for me of,</v>

2982
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:59.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of like celebrity deaths.</v>

2983
02:21:59.390 --> 02:22:01.060
<v Speaker 5>Prince was one of the all time biggest.</v>

2984
02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:02.453
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to because when Tom Petty </v>

2985
02:22:04.711 --> 02:22:06.770
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one really goes a hard one too.</v>

2986
02:22:06.810 --> 02:22:11.810
<v Speaker 2>That was a hard one because he was such </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking soundtrack of our teen years</v>

2987
02:22:13.050 --> 02:22:13.883
<v Speaker 2>and older years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean free fallen when I was in my </v>

2988
02:22:15.961 --> 02:22:20.961
<v Speaker 2>thirties and like his songs continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But somehow prince who didn't have,</v>

2989
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:25.200
<v Speaker 2>you could name more than three prince </v>
<v Speaker 2>songs and yet I could.</v>

2990
02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Most people can't.</v>

2991
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:27.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a dude.</v>

2992
02:22:28.350 --> 02:22:32.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Prince played a big part in my late teen</v>

2993
02:22:32.011 --> 02:22:33.030
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2994
02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:35.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was always a huge purple rain,</v>

2995
02:22:35.121 --> 02:22:37.080
<v Speaker 5>tight controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even before that,</v>

2996
02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:38.333
<v Speaker 5>I was a fan of prince from his first </v>
<v Speaker 5>cassette when it was just him with no </v>

2997
02:22:43.501 --> 02:22:44.334
<v Speaker 5>shirt on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a on the cover looking very androgynous </v>

2998
02:22:47.311 --> 02:22:50.010
<v Speaker 5>like there was no one like him before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember seeing that,</v>

2999
02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:53.790
<v Speaker 5>that cover somewhere and going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this?</v>

3000
02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:57.180
<v Speaker 5>Like what is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I heard some of the songs.</v>

3001
02:22:57.181 --> 02:23:00.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember what the big hits </v>
<v Speaker 5>were off of the first one.</v>

3002
02:23:00.091 --> 02:23:03.030
<v Speaker 5>This is pre purple rain though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember controversy.</v>

3003
02:23:03.250 --> 02:23:05.590
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>

3004
02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:06.920
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>

3005
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:07.783
<v Speaker 5>no controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You remember that song now do I believe </v>

3006
02:23:12.991 --> 02:23:13.824
<v Speaker 5>in God to believe in me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people want so they can be free </v>

3007
02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:23.960
<v Speaker 5>controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've done it.</v>

3008
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:27.090
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the cover.</v>

3009
02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:29.453
<v Speaker 5>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a little tiny patch of hair in the </v>

3010
02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:31.680
<v Speaker 5>middle of his chest now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

3011
02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:36.680
<v Speaker 5>But my point being for not knowing a big</v>
<v Speaker 5>catalog of his music,</v>

3012
02:23:37.170 --> 02:23:38.730
<v Speaker 5>it did mean a lot to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was.</v>

3013
02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:41.130
<v Speaker 5>What was that released in the seventies?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3014
02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:43.590
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seventy nine.</v>

3015
02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:47.130
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Released in 1979.</v>

3016
02:23:47.131 --> 02:23:48.600
<v Speaker 5>October 19th.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3017
02:23:48.601 --> 02:23:53.420
<v Speaker 5>Real close to today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Real close to today in 79.</v>

3018
02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.290
<v Speaker 5>Almost 40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3019
02:23:55.350 --> 02:23:56.220
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3020
02:23:58.400 --> 02:23:59.233
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3021
02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:04.450
<v Speaker 5>Bit more of an impact on you than Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3022
02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:05.510
<v Speaker 5>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3023
02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:07.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a big Bowie fan too,</v>

3024
02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:08.553
<v Speaker 5>but the thing about prince that was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>harder than Bowie for me was that Bowie </v>

3025
02:24:13.331 --> 02:24:15.460
<v Speaker 5>died of a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3026
02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:16.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Disney.</v>

3027
02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:18.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a.</v>

3028
02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:21.400
<v Speaker 5>was a cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you have some type of cancer.</v>

3029
02:24:21.700 --> 02:24:23.540
<v Speaker 5>Prince died from painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3030
02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:26.920
<v Speaker 5>That's what drove me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that goddamn fentanyl.</v>

3031
02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:32.100
<v Speaker 5>They found fentanyl in his body and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>remember thinking at the time like,</v>

3032
02:24:32.651 --> 02:24:37.150
<v Speaker 5>God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe these fucking pills.</v>

3033
02:24:37.151 --> 02:24:40.600
<v Speaker 5>Gun prince like potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the Michael Jackson drug to,</v>

3034
02:24:40.601 --> 02:24:41.500
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3035
02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:41.921
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3036
02:24:41.921 --> 02:24:43.780
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael Jackson died.</v>

3037
02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:46.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he died from anesthesia.</v>

3038
02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:49.510
<v Speaker 5>He was so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was before he died.</v>

3039
02:24:50.350 --> 02:24:53.320
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he would get a nest of ties.</v>

3040
02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:54.753
<v Speaker 5>Just stop and think about how many </v>
<v Speaker 5>demons you have to have where Ambien </v>

3041
02:24:58.301 --> 02:25:03.301
<v Speaker 5>doesn't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The amazing thing is he would get up out</v>

3042
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:06.300
<v Speaker 5>of that and they said he was first guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the set,</v>

3043
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:10.230
<v Speaker 5>choreograph in his own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rehearsing harder than anybody.</v>

3044
02:25:10.450 --> 02:25:12.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder when he started doing that,</v>

3045
02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:14.700
<v Speaker 5>because you know his last tour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was like that.</v>

3046
02:25:14.701 --> 02:25:19.470
<v Speaker 5>He was preparing for his final tour and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was working his fucking balls off.</v>

3047
02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:22.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do that very long apparently.</v>

3048
02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 5>Apparently that's part</v>

3049
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:28.420
<v Speaker 1>of the problem was that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It limits your rem sleep,</v>

3050
02:25:29.530 --> 02:25:30.670
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3051
02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:32.793
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest things that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to me since I'm not smoking </v>

3052
02:25:36.401 --> 02:25:38.980
<v Speaker 1>pot for all these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these many,</v>

3053
02:25:38.981 --> 02:25:42.040
<v Speaker 1>many moons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 days that we said 17 days.</v>

3054
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:47.650
<v Speaker 1>The dreams are way different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Different.</v>

3055
02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Like intense dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have weird dreams man.</v>

3056
02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Like they're very vivid and I never </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about that before.</v>

3057
02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Are they the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same dreams over and over again?</v>

3058
02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:00.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all,</v>

3059
02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:01.893
<v Speaker 1>but they're very vivid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way more vivid than when I was </v>

3060
02:26:04.331 --> 02:26:05.164
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot or like way more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you think you're in a deeper </v>

3061
02:26:08.291 --> 02:26:12.340
<v Speaker 1>rems cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard things,</v>

3062
02:26:12.341 --> 02:26:13.480
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

3063
02:26:13.481 --> 02:26:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Pull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull up that.</v>

3064
02:26:14.471 --> 02:26:18.310
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the cause for it?</v>

3065
02:26:18.311 --> 02:26:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I thought it had to do with the Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 1>waves.</v>

3066
02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:24.250
<v Speaker 1>State that marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

3067
02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:26.913
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body is not at rest or your brain </v>

3068
02:26:28.211 --> 02:26:30.100
<v Speaker 1>isn't restful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to an Alpha Beta waves.</v>

3069
02:26:30.101 --> 02:26:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I think for rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what what it is,</v>

3070
02:26:33.011 --> 02:26:35.560
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you don't smoke pot,</v>

3071
02:26:35.561 --> 02:26:38.200
<v Speaker 1>when you smoke pot all the time for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and then you don't smoke pot,</v>

3072
02:26:38.201 --> 02:26:41.190
<v Speaker 1>you have some fucking dreams baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3073
02:26:41.570 --> 02:26:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Like they're intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I wake up to pee and I go,</v>

3074
02:26:45.101 --> 02:26:48.640
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on in my head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like weird,</v>

3075
02:26:48.641 --> 02:26:49.474
<v Speaker 1>crazy dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like being in a plane where it comes </v>

3076
02:26:53.021 --> 02:26:53.854
<v Speaker 1>really close to hitting a mountain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing you know you're hanging </v>

3077
02:26:55.961 --> 02:26:56.794
<v Speaker 1>on the ledge of a building and the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you know you're running through </v>

3078
02:26:58.301 --> 02:26:59.134
<v Speaker 1>the woods and next thing you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's fucking freezing cold and </v>

3079
02:27:03.221 --> 02:27:05.490
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to stay warm and you got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire going.</v>

3080
02:27:06.450 --> 02:27:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Kind of fucking Wacky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primal dreams.</v>

3081
02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:10.660
<v Speaker 1>My going through here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3082
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:15.490
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird because I'm waking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just like,</v>

3083
02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:17.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to wake up and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

3084
02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I wake up going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

3085
02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Studies on cannabis and sleep were </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted in 19 seventies.</v>

3086
02:27:25.690 --> 02:27:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Some information about the possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of cannabis and sleep.</v>

3087
02:27:29.170 --> 02:27:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Low dose of Thc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four to 20 milligrams.</v>

3088
02:27:32.290 --> 02:27:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Mildly decreased rem sleep in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular users and non users.</v>

3089
02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:36.933
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep sleep was increased when cannabis </v>

3090
02:27:39.911 --> 02:27:40.744
<v Speaker 1>was initially used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this effect disappeared after </v>

3091
02:27:43.031 --> 02:27:48.031
<v Speaker 1>repeated use with high doses of thc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty to 210 milligrams.</v>

3092
02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Now stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And think about Lisa.</v>

3093
02:27:50.311 --> 02:27:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I'd eaten $500 and that's edible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is way different.</v>

3094
02:27:55.390 --> 02:27:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Rem Sleep was decreased in both regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>users and non users.</v>

3095
02:27:58.901 --> 02:27:59.734
<v Speaker 1>Total sleep time was not affected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but deep sleep was decreased when thc </v>

3096
02:28:03.431 --> 02:28:07.630
<v Speaker 1>was stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some rebound in rem sleep was found with</v>

3097
02:28:07.631 --> 02:28:11.410
<v Speaker 1>reduced sleep time and increased time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall asleep.</v>

3098
02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:12.783
<v Speaker 1>Now this is interesting because what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know who that some people do </v>

3099
02:28:16.061 --> 02:28:16.894
<v Speaker 1>have withdrawal symptoms when stopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>prolonged and heavy use of cannabis and </v>

3100
02:28:19.961 --> 02:28:24.770
<v Speaker 1>this can adversely affects sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms.</v>

3101
02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

3102
02:28:26.090 --> 02:28:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Not One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting to me is I wonder</v>

3103
02:28:30.381 --> 02:28:31.214
<v Speaker 1>if there's any benefit to not have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>having those dreams rather versus not </v>

3104
02:28:35.841 --> 02:28:36.674
<v Speaker 1>having those dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wonder if in some way I'm doing </v>

3105
02:28:38.661 --> 02:28:41.960
<v Speaker 1>myself a disservice by smoking pot all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

3106
02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3107
02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:47.900
<v Speaker 1>is there like a point of diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>returns about [inaudible]?</v>

3108
02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of benefits for </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>

3109
02:28:49.611 --> 02:28:50.444
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of benefits in terms of </v>

3110
02:28:51.141 --> 02:28:51.974
<v Speaker 1>the antiinflammatory effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is neuroprotective effects of </v>

3111
02:28:54.921 --> 02:28:55.754
<v Speaker 1>cannabis that they found that regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>users like they think it might actually </v>

3112
02:28:58.791 --> 02:29:01.190
<v Speaker 1>like hold off Alzheimer's and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3113
02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:02.940
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3114
02:29:03.010 --> 02:29:05.150
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the balance?</v>

3115
02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really considered that it was</v>

3116
02:29:08.361 --> 02:29:09.194
<v Speaker 1>an issue at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like there was zero </v>

3117
02:29:11.211 --> 02:29:12.044
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like negative health effects of using </v>

3118
02:29:14.481 --> 02:29:15.440
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me personally,</v>

3119
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get my blood work done regularly.</v>

3120
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat really well.</v>

3121
02:29:21.411 --> 02:29:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I take a lot of vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I exercise regularly and I like pot so I</v>

3122
02:29:24.981 --> 02:29:26.900
<v Speaker 1>smoked pot and obviously it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting me.</v>

3123
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.943
<v Speaker 1>It's not like people drink all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fuck up their liver and their body </v>

3124
02:29:30.111 --> 02:29:31.970
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm wondering,</v>

3125
02:29:32.050 --> 02:29:34.160
<v Speaker 1>does it affect your memory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great memory.</v>

3126
02:29:34.490 --> 02:29:35.930
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'd be better.</v>

3127
02:29:36.860 --> 02:29:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially what do,</v>

3128
02:29:39.450 --> 02:29:40.283
<v Speaker 1>what do you have here at Jimmy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The longer article about alcohol and </v>

3129
02:29:42.861 --> 02:29:45.410
<v Speaker 1>marijuana effects on sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the marijuana part.</v>

3130
02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:45.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3131
02:29:45.951 --> 02:29:47.150
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore?</v>

3132
02:29:47.151 --> 02:29:47.984
<v Speaker 1>Can increase slow wave nrem deep sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good because that's where </v>

3133
02:29:52.701 --> 02:29:55.610
<v Speaker 1>experts believe most of your actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>recuperation takes place.</v>

3134
02:29:55.610 --> 02:29:56.443
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you continue to consume your slow </v>

3135
02:29:59.361 --> 02:30:00.194
<v Speaker 1>wave sleep will get severely reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reducing the restfulness of your sleep </v>

3136
02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:05.233
<v Speaker 1>is supposed to provide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reducing rather the restfulness you're </v>

3137
02:30:07.701 --> 02:30:09.950
<v Speaker 1>asleep is supposed to provide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3138
02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

3139
02:30:12.021 --> 02:30:12.854
<v Speaker 1>like what if I get high during the day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it affecting my sleep at </v>

3140
02:30:15.741 --> 02:30:17.810
<v Speaker 1>night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's confusing because it's not</v>

3141
02:30:17.811 --> 02:30:18.644
<v Speaker 1>like I get high a lot at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes me and the missus we'll smoke </v>

3142
02:30:22.321 --> 02:30:24.050
<v Speaker 1>a little before it gave her something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3143
02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3144
02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:26.180
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels better.</v>

3145
02:30:26.181 --> 02:30:28.810
<v Speaker 1>That one punch her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You smoked that stuff.</v>

3146
02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ugh.</v>

3147
02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard.</v>

3148
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:34.850
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm scared of Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he's too old.</v>

3149
02:30:35.330 --> 02:30:36.163
<v Speaker 1>She can't take it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you to duck Christy and I want </v>

3150
02:30:40.251 --> 02:30:42.530
<v Speaker 1>him to bleed like your butthole did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3151
02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:47.870
<v Speaker 1>A couple days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you have sex with someone.</v>

3152
02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:49.970
<v Speaker 1>They start breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

3153
02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:54.470
<v Speaker 1>But I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering like I need to know.</v>

3154
02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:55.473
<v Speaker 1>I want to find out like what's the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start looking into this </v>

3155
02:30:58.911 --> 02:31:01.940
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is that different than a.</v>

3156
02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:05.210
<v Speaker 1>That stuff that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A CBDS?</v>

3157
02:31:05.211 --> 02:31:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very different.</v>

3158
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very different.</v>

3159
02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Psyche psychoactivity disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3160
02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:12.920
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>

3161
02:31:12.921 --> 02:31:14.600
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about that Charlotte's </v>
<v Speaker 1>web.</v>

3162
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See she gets me high.</v>

3163
02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it doesn't get me high,</v>

3164
02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:20.093
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3165
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:24.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if we have the same.</v>

3166
02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:26.760
<v Speaker 5>Obviously we have the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't have the same body,</v>

3167
02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:28.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what affects you,</v>

3168
02:31:28.380 --> 02:31:31.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>food wise and everybody's different when</v>

3169
02:31:31.171 --> 02:31:35.370
<v Speaker 5>it comes to that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Charlotte's web has a bunch of other</v>

3170
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:36.653
<v Speaker 5>cannabinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not just cbd and that's one of the </v>

3171
02:31:38.851 --> 02:31:41.430
<v Speaker 5>more beneficial aspects of it is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

3172
02:31:41.490 --> 02:31:46.490
<v Speaker 5>It uses the full plant so maybe cbd </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't get you high,</v>

3173
02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:52.440
<v Speaker 5>but maybe that kind of hemp oil or more </v>
<v Speaker 5>comprehensive cannabis oil would get you</v>

3174
02:31:52.441 --> 02:31:53.760
<v Speaker 5>high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

3175
02:31:53.761 --> 02:31:55.350
<v Speaker 5>They get you high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how high?</v>

3176
02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:56.813
<v Speaker 5>Nice high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like mellow more like takes the </v>

3177
02:31:58.771 --> 02:32:03.000
<v Speaker 5>anxiety out and makes me just really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really nice.</v>

3178
02:32:03.001 --> 02:32:04.710
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>around 5:00</v>

3179
02:32:04.711 --> 02:32:05.544
<v Speaker 5>when you're reentering the family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you have maybe some of that </v>

3180
02:32:10.381 --> 02:32:11.214
<v Speaker 5>anxiety is coming from inflammation and </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe what it's doing is reducing </v>

3181
02:32:14.341 --> 02:32:15.770
<v Speaker 5>inflammation and relaxing.</v>

3182
02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:18.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I would guess.</v>

3183
02:32:18.300 --> 02:32:19.133
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it doesn't make people test </v>

3184
02:32:20.581 --> 02:32:21.414
<v Speaker 5>positive for thc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like if you had a company and you're </v>

3185
02:32:24.211 --> 02:32:26.220
<v Speaker 5>working for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get anybody fired,</v>

3186
02:32:26.430 --> 02:32:27.263
<v Speaker 5>but I'm pretty sure they've tested this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff and if you had a company and </v>

3187
02:32:31.141 --> 02:32:31.974
<v Speaker 5>you're working for them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they piss test you and if you're taking </v>

3188
02:32:35.060 --> 02:32:37.350
<v Speaker 5>like Charlotte's web oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it doesn't even do.</v>

3189
02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:38.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3190
02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:42.660
<v Speaker 5>How fucked up is that man having a job </v>
<v Speaker 5>that tests your pis?</v>

3191
02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:44.033
<v Speaker 5>Hey Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you having fun over the </v>

3192
02:32:45.570 --> 02:32:45.930
<v Speaker 5>weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3194
02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:50.790
<v Speaker 5>It does the same job to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't date anybody from work.</v>

3195
02:32:50.791 --> 02:32:51.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

3196
02:32:51.570 --> 02:32:52.403
<v Speaker 5>so you got me working 12 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see anybody else in my life and </v>

3197
02:32:56.251 --> 02:32:58.590
<v Speaker 5>I can't date the women that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3198
02:32:58.660 --> 02:33:00.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's complications,</v>

3199
02:33:00.451 --> 02:33:02.730
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that they should make it illegal.</v>

3200
02:33:03.090 --> 02:33:03.630
<v Speaker 5>Fake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>

3201
02:33:03.630 --> 02:33:07.260
<v Speaker 5>They can suggest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It felt weird to tell people what to do.</v>

3202
02:33:07.290 --> 02:33:08.123
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They fucking tell a manager he can't </v>

3203

<v Speaker 5>Isn't not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's entirely possible.</v>

3225

02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:17.300
<v Speaker 5>We can't tell you folks because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3230
02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:20.560
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

3232
02:34:22.510 --> 02:34:24.370
<v Speaker 5>But who knows what was actually going </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

3233
02:34:24.970 --> 02:34:25.803
<v Speaker 5>You Know My,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always had the weirdest theory </v>

3234
02:34:26.891 --> 02:34:29.560
<v Speaker 5>about Michael Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he was castrated.</v>

3235
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:32.560
<v Speaker 5>He's a castrol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would buy that.</v>

3236
02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:34.000
<v Speaker 5>The voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the voice,</v>

3237
02:34:34.001 --> 02:34:38.830
<v Speaker 5>the body extremely thin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't look like any muscle at all,</v>

3238
02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:40.293
<v Speaker 5>which is like what someone has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>castrated would look like no </v>

3239
02:34:42.490 --> 02:34:45.820
<v Speaker 5>testosterone at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't sleep super high pitched voice,</v>

3240
02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:48.100
<v Speaker 5>kept down high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pitched voice deep into his fifties.</v>

3241

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3242
02:34:49.931 --> 02:34:50.764

<v Speaker 5>I think just riddled with anxiety and </v>

3243
02:34:53.081 --> 02:34:55.660
<v Speaker 5>craziness and all the fucking plastic </v>
<v Speaker 5>surgery.</v>

<v Speaker 5>in madness.</v>

02:35:00.460 --> 02:35:04.060
<v Speaker 5>That was a person who went mad from </v>
<v Speaker 5>people paying attention to them.</v>

3246
02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:06.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3320
02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:12.673
<v Speaker 5>kids like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's intention span is too short for </v>

3321
02:38:14.310 --> 02:38:16.550
<v Speaker 5>slow movie like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really think I'm moving slow.</v>

3322
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:18.530
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard blade runner.</v>

3323
02:38:18.531 --> 02:38:22.190
<v Speaker 5>The new blade runner is very slow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now the old one was very awesome.</v>

3324
02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:23.031
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3325
02:38:23.031 --> 02:38:26.170
<v Speaker 5>I heard it's like super underrated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are like,</v>

3326
02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:27.750
<v Speaker 5>it's not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3327
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:29.870
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I need to see it,</v>

3328
02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:32.690
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of people are saying that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really slow.</v>

3329
02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:35.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no movies are doing well this year.</v>

3330
02:38:35.930 --> 02:38:39.830
<v Speaker 5>What do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe people were watching Netflix more.</v>

3331
02:38:39.890 --> 02:38:40.723
<v Speaker 5>I think that's exactly what it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the movie experience is an hour </v>

3332
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:45.260
<v Speaker 5>and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two hours.</v>

3333
02:38:45.261 --> 02:38:48.350
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus get their parking a lot of money.</v>

3334
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Netflix is like,</v>

3335
02:38:49.851 --> 02:38:50.684
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nine bucks a month and you can just </v>

3336
02:38:52.641 --> 02:38:55.400
<v Speaker 5>binge watch house of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your fucking head falls off.</v>

3337
02:38:55.930 --> 02:38:58.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm watching the OAA right now.</v>

3338
02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.620
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So weird.</v>

3339
02:39:00.621 --> 02:39:04.910
<v Speaker 5>Supernatural thriller on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really great.</v>

3340
02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:06.013
<v Speaker 5>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although some assholes on twitter </v>

3341
02:39:08.931 --> 02:39:11.610
<v Speaker 5>thought it was a good idea to give me </v>
<v Speaker 5>some spoiler.</v>

3342
02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:12.493
<v Speaker 5>That's fucked up.</v>

3344
02:39:17.881 --> 02:39:20.960
<v Speaker 5>found a good show and then I fucked up </v>
