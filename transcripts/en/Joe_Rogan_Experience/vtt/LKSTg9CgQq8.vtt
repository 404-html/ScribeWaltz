<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

18
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insider information.</v>

19
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Being at Fox for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

20
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>but I'll let her go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you can talk about moby though </v>

21
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>right here we can talk about Mobi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mobi says he has like inside information</v>

22
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>about Donald Trump that he knows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump talked to the Russians.</v>

23
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at Mobi with his fucking </v>

24
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.451
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Vegan tee shirt on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really think anybody in the </v>

25
00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Russian fucking intelligence communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to moby?</v>

26
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a brilliant ploy from the </v>

27
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.831
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just give a little info to moby </v>

28
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:08.831
<v Speaker 1>like you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell them and he's going to do it,</v>

29
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely leaked decent formation.</v>

30
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be the downfall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they found out he wasn't Enya and </v>

31
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 1>they'd made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

32
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so costume designer for a show called </v>

34
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.980

<v Speaker 1>Letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Kinda like Graham Norton in </v>

36
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:29.111
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'd have stars coming all the </v>

37
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:29.111
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And moby was there.</v>

38
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>He was just a headcase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was just absolutely out of his </v>

39
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.381
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing was good enough and you would </v>

40
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:35.381
<v Speaker 1>want something and then say he wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change it.</v>

41
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of things did he want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change?</v>

42
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you this.</v>

43
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>There were only two people who made my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom like,</v>

44
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 1>come home crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was Brett Butler and uh,</v>

45
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>she just thought live from grace under </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire was all pilled out of her head in </v>

46
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>the nineties when she was crying to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom.</v>

47
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>She was the wardrobe person you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

48
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:59.791
<v Speaker 1>even if you did one of the gallows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never did the gallows because I wanted </v>

49
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>me to work clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they put you in the nasty shell?</v>

50
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.920
<v Speaker 1>So it was always on the advertising and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on my own shows.</v>

62
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>like the way that the festival would </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of differentiate.</v>

65
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 1>like they're little kids in the school </v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

79

<v Speaker 1>I wanted to come up with a better name </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the name.</v>

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>So you went to Mr Rogers' neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

81

<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I always wanted to smoke a pipe </v>

82
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.721

00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>that that's actually for my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother out there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He knows more than I do.</v>

86
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.990
<v Speaker 1>So this isn't like a seersucker the type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of suit.</v>

87
00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:28.991

98
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Here's the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're gotta do is put it up to the </v>

102
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>don't pack it in yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general rule is the first one.</v>

103
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>You Tamp it down with your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strength of a child.</v>

104
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Then you fill it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strength of a woman and you fill it </v>

105
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.420
<v Speaker 1>a third time with the strength of a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

106
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>so fill it just barely now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then more strength of a woman.</v>

107
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a woman man?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's not talk about that because that </v>

110
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>can go sideways and this show.</v>

111

<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's already gone sideways.</v>

112
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.580

<v Speaker 1>Once it goes out and then you light it </v>

<v Speaker 1>Can I use the lighter?</v>

167
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.430
<v Speaker 1>As long as it's not a jet lighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that'll damage the briar.</v>

168
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.430
<v Speaker 1>So like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not A.</v>

169
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a,</v>

170
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.600
<v Speaker 1>a distinguished gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who's at a Nigel Farrage.</v>

171
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

172
00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:30.600
<v Speaker 1>He's not distinguished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an asshole,</v>

173
00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:35.601
<v Speaker 1>but he's a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun to listen to them talk to </v>

174
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:36.540
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when you guys had that thing,</v>

175
00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:39.210

<v Speaker 1>the thug life thing.</v>

176
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.100
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Gay.</v>

177
00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Jarrod came over and gave you a lap </v>
<v Speaker 1>dance and getting silly.</v>

178
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got word that night or liked that </v>

179
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how true it is,</v>

180
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

181
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you guys are one of the very few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're a conservative guy,</v>

182
00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.860
<v Speaker 1>but I would say you get a bad rap dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really do.</v>

183
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.730
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because you are.</v>

184
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.780
<v Speaker 1>You're a pretty much fact oriented guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to a lot of issues,</v>

185
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.810
<v Speaker 1>political issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social issues.</v>

186
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't bullshit and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like try to sway things toward</v>

187
00:07:12.841 --> 00:07:15.960
<v Speaker 1>one side or the other when it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

188
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that and by the way these,</v>

189
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these probably will go out.</v>

190
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:21.420
<v Speaker 1>You have to relight it because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an art.</v>

191
00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:26.421
<v Speaker 1>So I've had people talk to me about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they give me this bullshit take on </v>

192
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:28.800
<v Speaker 1>you and I know he's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

193
00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>he's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

194
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:31.980
<v Speaker 1>he's conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

195
00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:36.981
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people that are liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of people that are in the </v>

196
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:39.981
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you can't talk to someone because </v>

197
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:39.981
<v Speaker 1>they appreciate that and that's to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to kiss him,</v>

198
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 1>but people out there that need to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Joe has been incredibly fair and </v>

199
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>very kind behind the scenes you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like because there do,</v>

200
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:47.070
<v Speaker 1>you have every reason not to and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big reason of it honestly.</v>

201
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good example,</v>

202
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 1>the young Turks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen this transition with </v>

203
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.030
<v Speaker 1>trump or people who were really afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak out.</v>

204
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:59.031
<v Speaker 1>Now you're seeing that change online </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the establishment has been </v>

205
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.991
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so kids who were raised for eight years </v>

206
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:02.991
<v Speaker 1>under Bushmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight Bush,</v>

207
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:02.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to no effects,</v>

208
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:04.110
<v Speaker 1>go to the vans warped tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

209
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>and now they've been raised under Obama </v>
<v Speaker 1>for eight years and all this political </v>

210
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>correctness run amok and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejecting that.</v>

211
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>So for the longest time I had this small</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube channel and I was on Fox so it </v>

212
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>was kind of muddled a little bit because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there and there were certain </v>

213
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.111
<v Speaker 1>things that I could say or couldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>online because it was a liability young </v>

214
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:21.750
<v Speaker 1>issue at the time as well as to take you</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

215
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.860
<v Speaker 1>That's 21 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:25.420
<v Speaker 1>He a little fresh faced little lad now.</v>

217
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.300
<v Speaker 1>You're not even that old now holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 29.</v>

218
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>You're a young fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

219
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what happened is they kind of had</v>

220
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:34.380
<v Speaker 1>their interpretation from whenever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young Turks said about me because when I</v>

221
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:37.290
<v Speaker 1>had 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers it was like their day job to</v>

222
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:42.291
<v Speaker 1>go after me and now when I've had Alex </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones and we'd been doing proactive </v>

223
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:43.950
<v Speaker 1>parodies of the young Turks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call them out asthma debate,</v>

224
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.640
<v Speaker 1>they will trash talk every conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not named Steven crowder.</v>

225
00:08:47.641 --> 00:08:50.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm Voldemort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name won't be spoken when at 50,000</v>

226
00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:53.640
<v Speaker 1>subscribers they would talk about me all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and they had,</v>

227
00:08:53.641 --> 00:08:54.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million or 2 million.</v>

228
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Now that's changed and people were able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to come here directly and only that you </v>

229
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>will give me your lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The matches are getting annoying.</v>

230
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

231
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

232
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I like to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

234
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:10.131
<v Speaker 1>there's also the real possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just don't like me because I'm </v>

235
00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:10.131
<v Speaker 1>kind of a Dick.</v>

236
00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be a dick sometimes,</v>

237
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>but you're a funny Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you do some funny shit.</v>

238
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that you did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really funny was a will.</v>

239
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>What was that feminist rally thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you went to?</v>

240
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>The recent one where?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tranny.</v>

241
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I actually interviewed Wendy Davis.</v>

242
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're supposed to as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trainee,</v>

243
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

244
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>so that's why people don't like me </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

246
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>but I think now you're seeing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say that they don't care.</v>

247
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's funny when they start </v>
<v Speaker 1>making words taboo,</v>

248
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:40.221
<v Speaker 1>I really do like people said tranny </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever and then all of a sudden it's </v>

249
00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:40.350
<v Speaker 1>like disparaging like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

250
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I haven't noticed in the new build burst</v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

251
00:09:42.161 --> 00:09:43.000
<v Speaker 1>He said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

252
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.010
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll fucking Mary.</v>

253
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

254
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.750
<v Speaker 1>he would've said fag four years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he did in his special and used </v>

255
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.860
<v Speaker 1>the word Mary talking about like a sissy</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't.</v>

256
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a word we ever heard him use </v>

257
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:56.860
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

258
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Bill uses that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>

259
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a Boston word.</v>

260
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking marry people called guys </v>

261
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Mary's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

262
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>he's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's trying to be a little bit </v>

263
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>more politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I do?</v>

264
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I use the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do it in character.</v>

265
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if I say like Faggot,</v>

266
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

267
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigel said it.</v>

268
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>That was not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this joke about tigers in Texas </v>

269
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know if you know my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

270
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a true story from my last,</v>

271
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.470
<v Speaker 1>a Netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more tigers in captivity in </v>

272
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.261
<v Speaker 1>Texas than there are in all of the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in private collections,</v>

273
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 1>in people's backyards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more tigers in Texas than the </v>

274
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 1>rest of the fucking planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a fact.</v>

275
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.260
<v Speaker 1>That is a real step because they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have them.</v>

276
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Just a bunch of dentists who carried him</v>
<v Speaker 1>back just because I know people that </v>

277
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.371
<v Speaker 1>know people that have tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people in Texas who's friends </v>

278
00:10:49.371 --> 00:10:49.371
<v Speaker 1>have tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

279
00:10:49.371 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>you can have a title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware?</v>

280
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the biggest category?</v>

281
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 1>You probably know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest,</v>

282
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 1>a predatory cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what it ligers,</v>

283
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not viable.</v>

284
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>They can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

285
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I thought the lion at first tiger with </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much bigger back in the Roman Roman </v>

286
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>times and the coliseum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what,</v>

287
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.350
<v Speaker 1>and I can't entirely corroborate this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say this,</v>

288
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.470
<v Speaker 1>corroborate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do the lions,</v>

289
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.480
<v Speaker 1>the lions have to be on three points and</v>
<v Speaker 1>can Paul,</v>

290
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 1>where's the Siberian tigers would </v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage back in pounds.</v>

291
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said it wasn't even close.</v>

292
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention that the tigers are way </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

293
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>but they were able to just go back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their two legs,</v>

294
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:27.210
<v Speaker 1>whereas the lion has to have three </v>
<v Speaker 1>points of contact,</v>

295
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>which is like a dog given the POC.</v>

296
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

297
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So when I saw him I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

298
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.330
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible because you see a lion.</v>

299
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:38.981
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the ghost in the darkness and </v>

301
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:38.981
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty scary.</v>

302
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even close to mountain lion </v>

303
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:41.360
<v Speaker 1>will fuck you up dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just a small mountain line.</v>

304
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.900
<v Speaker 1>That 80 pound mountain lion fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a Siberian tiger will fuck you up in</v>

305
00:11:45.901 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 1>ways you couldn't possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

306
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I have a dog hopper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dogo Argentino.</v>

307
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are big dogs.</v>

308
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Well you can google it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

309
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>They are not trained them good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But their sketch.</v>

310
00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Well he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran for president with Dean Cain and </v>

311
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.361
<v Speaker 1>he had like a few hundred votes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I felt bad about cause it was a </v>

312
00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:05.761
<v Speaker 1>gag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows if that changed the state </v>

313
00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:05.761
<v Speaker 1>of Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

314
00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:06.670
<v Speaker 1>if it starts going out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put two fingers over,</v>

315
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:09.210
<v Speaker 1>kind of create a slipstream and suck it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and I'll give you.</v>

316
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Probably not now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably need to relate it.</v>

317
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good to talk and smoke a pipe.</v>

318
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:18.181
<v Speaker 1>It's meant to be more contemplated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Bertrand Russell used to smoke a </v>

319
00:12:18.181 --> 00:12:18.181
<v Speaker 1>pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trinity,</v>

320
00:12:18.181 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing the voice,</v>

321
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.020
<v Speaker 1>the voice to speak and it was a one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the things like he wanted </v>

322
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:32.251
<v Speaker 1>to fly and he would only fly if he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke on the plane because he was so </v>

323
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>addicted to tobacco that he had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly smoke.</v>

324
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 1>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at him,</v>

325
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:40.140
<v Speaker 1>look at him smoking a pipe or a pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how he would speak,</v>

326
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

327
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>it is very relaxing because it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jujitsu.</v>

328
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.920
<v Speaker 1>You said you've used the term moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation when you're sitting down </v>

329
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:49.920
<v Speaker 1>there outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

330
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 1>if you don't focus on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go out.</v>

331
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a cigarette.</v>

332
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:55.330
<v Speaker 1>So you have to sit there and focus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the draw,</v>

333
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 1>focus on the exhale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all you're thinking about is,</v>

334
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.520
<v Speaker 1>is the pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it really is kind of a contemplate of</v>

335
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:01.420
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

336
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 1>you're getting fucked up on tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you lying?</v>

337
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.490
<v Speaker 1>You're lying to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

338
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.220
<v Speaker 1>what were we talking about before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was tigers in Texas.</v>

339
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 1>There's more time to bring her in May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

340
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:17.581
<v Speaker 1>You're going all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Run a youtube search on Doug Argentino </v>

341
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:18.210
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will see doug.</v>

342
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Argentina was messing up actual mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions.</v>

343
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

344
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Because the mountain lion wants to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

345
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.640
<v Speaker 1>It's probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of mine doesn't want to fight</v>

346
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mountain lion is a predatory animal.</v>

347
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Predatory animals don't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight to the death.</v>

348
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:33.781
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why dogs are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking dangerous because dogs are bred </v>

349
00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 1>to not feel pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not recognize me.</v>

350
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things about pit </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulls.</v>

351
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.570
<v Speaker 1>They're not the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest dogs,</v>

352
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.820
<v Speaker 1>but they're bred to ignore pain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

353
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:44.821
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drive to attack and ignore pain </v>

354
00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 1>makes some very problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just you just used the word problematic.</v>

355
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:51.361
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's span that word a little bit and </v>

356
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 1>use an anecdote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smoking a pipe.</v>

357
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.620
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

358
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're bred for.</v>

359
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:57.820
<v Speaker 1>They're actually really people oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're bred to be protective of</v>

360
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 1>people in hunt with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not bred to fight dogs.</v>

361
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.600
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of actually people there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we got robberies or rescue </v>

362
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:05.920
<v Speaker 1>out in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Michigan.</v>

363
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys in the inner cities bought</v>

364
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:10.000
<v Speaker 1>them thinking this is like a bigger pit </v>
<v Speaker 1>bull.</v>

365
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:15.001
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be great dog fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were horrible and they just got </v>

366
00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:15.550
<v Speaker 1>abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's all kinds of dog out there in</v>

367
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 1>western Michigan.</v>

368
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if there still are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wild dogs will just,</v>

369
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 1>our dog howl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look cute.</v>

370
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Speaker 1>That looks very much like guard dog or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute photo.</v>

371
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 1>They're so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a big dog.</v>

372
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of a runt.</v>

373
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>He's about 90 pounds because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

374
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>we found him with a broken leg roaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets.</v>

375
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Alopecia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lyme disease.</v>

376
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>So you rescue them right off the street?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

377
00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:41.401
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was rescued into a lady who </v>

378
00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:42.600
<v Speaker 1>specialized in Dagos and then we took </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from her and uh,</v>

379
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Speaker 1>he's the most people oriented dog we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>

380
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where he'll actually,</v>

381
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:49.780
<v Speaker 1>the biggest problem you have is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop petting him and you don't know him,</v>

382
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>he'll growl free to keep petting him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So kids and they're terrified her.</v>

383
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Well that seems like a Dickie dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

384
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a dog called a regency massive.</v>

385
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are no joke.</v>

386
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a neapolitan is bread with a pit </v>
<v Speaker 1>bull.</v>

387
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>So there are about 140 pounds to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the athletes is great.</v>

388
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 1>My kids ride him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally ride them,</v>

389
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 1>they get on top of him and he'll just </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it again.</v>

390
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Pita on you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now these shouldn't be writing because </v>

391
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 1>he's older now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor,</v>

392
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>poor fella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like 11.</v>

393
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 1>He's got some hip problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Susan walks with a limp.</v>

394
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for having me back.</v>

395
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Even though part of your audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like it,</v>

396
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.830
<v Speaker 1>but don't be defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say that.</v>

397
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Have you noticed a change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a new sort of trump?</v>

398
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally I think there's.</v>

399
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 1>I know this is sound sounds like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken record,</v>

400
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:40.031
<v Speaker 1>but counterculture why's he have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people who were afraid to even speak </v>

401
00:15:40.031 --> 00:15:43.901
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even from the last time I was on the </v>

402
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:43.901
<v Speaker 1>show where they've been called racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>

403
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:44.840
<v Speaker 1>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transphobic is a new thing we're in.</v>

404
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Was going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

405
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

406
00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you were to hold the election</v>

407
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:50.870
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump would win in a landslide.</v>

408
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't even be close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because.</v>

409
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because of how bad the behavior </v>

410
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 1>has been from the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the rest of America.</v>

411
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I had my uber driver coming here and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed every lie.</v>

412
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a Latino.</v>

413
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Why ever talked to Uber Drivers about </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics?</v>

414
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:09.281
<v Speaker 1>It always seems to end in a TMZ value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain why I have a four point two </v>

415
00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:12.461
<v Speaker 1>rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm right at the threshold of losing </v>

416
00:16:12.461 --> 00:16:12.461
<v Speaker 1>my uber privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>

417
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.790
<v Speaker 1>So like you get a rating as a customer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Speaker 1>You get to rating as a customer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a good rating?</v>

419
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:18.290
<v Speaker 1>A 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a four point two?</v>

420
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

421
00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:19.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

422
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>It's at a five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

423
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Speaker 1>that's not that bad.</v>

424
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that bad.</v>

425
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 1>But if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>

426
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>You're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go like someone could find you </v>

427
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.201
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber drivers could be like unite and </v>

428
00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:32.201
<v Speaker 1>blackball you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could.</v>

429
00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:32.201
<v Speaker 1>Well my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

430
00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't say his name because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

431
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:38.171
<v Speaker 1>Actually had his concealed carry with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in an Uber and he forgot his </v>

432
00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 1>magazine and that person rated him like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a one.</v>

433
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.960
<v Speaker 1>So it took one bad rating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drop his score because he had to call </v>

434
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:43.960
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

435
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:43.960
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

436
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I think I forgot something in the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your car.</v>

437
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

438
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Like a magazine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

439
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a people magazine.</v>

440
00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

441
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:56.831
<v Speaker 1>just look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy was just on the phone with </v>

442
00:16:56.831 --> 00:16:56.831
<v Speaker 1>them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do in my car?</v>

443
00:16:56.831 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And he just said I was going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>

444
00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.240
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he carries a gun and I'm everywhere.</v>

445
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.470
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

446
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this lady,</v>

447
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Uber La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she decided to start talking about it,</v>

448
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.170
<v Speaker 1>talking about the women's March and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

449
00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:08.060
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to say nothing,</v>

450
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 1>but we ended up on very good terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a different story.</v>

451
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:12.530
<v Speaker 1>This is not the message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the magazine story.</v>

452
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And she on drugs right now and the speed</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything on new drugs.</v>

453
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Speaker 1>It's very quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going quick.</v>

454
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I settled into the show.</v>

455
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

456
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I had that nitro coffee and I came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee bean and tea leaf right already.</v>

457
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.950
<v Speaker 1>That is 270 milligrams caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've probably got about five,</v>

458
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:32.951
<v Speaker 1>600 milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's two grand day starbucks </v>

459
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:32.951
<v Speaker 1>coffees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>

460
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I think there's kind of the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 200.</v>

461
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's closing,</v>

462
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>closing in on two Grande's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

463
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.130
<v Speaker 1>but she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

464
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump called all Mexicans.</v>

465
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Rapists said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

466
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.680
<v Speaker 1>she was Donald Trump is gonna ruin gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

467
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.340
<v Speaker 1>People want what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's because it's just in my </v>

468
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:51.340
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

469
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:51.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

470
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.561
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Donald trump removed the gay </v>

471
00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:54.561
<v Speaker 1>rights thing on the website as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the fact that all presidents,</v>

472
00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 1>they remove everything from the previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and they put up new,</v>

473
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 1>a whole new whitehouse.gov</v>
<v Speaker 1>website and these people,</v>

474
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 1>they buy it in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in such an insular bubble.</v>

475
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:07.881
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they realize that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of people who voted for </v>

476
00:18:07.881 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump and I wasn't a fan of him </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the primaries,</v>

477
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't vote for him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're racist.</v>

478
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.560
<v Speaker 1>They didn't vote for him because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want Caitlyn Jenner to take a dump at </v>

479
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.081
<v Speaker 1>trump towers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't vote for him because they </v>

480
00:18:18.081 --> 00:18:18.081
<v Speaker 1>hate brown people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They voted for him because they're tired</v>

481
00:18:18.081 --> 00:18:23.061
<v Speaker 1>of being called all those things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think you see a lot of </v>

482
00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 1>these young people who just kind of want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be instigators and provoca tours,</v>

483
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:29.270
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciating more traditionalism and </v>

484
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.051
<v Speaker 1>some of the values that our parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to instill in them because that's </v>

485
00:18:33.051 --> 00:18:33.510
<v Speaker 1>kind of more rebellious and going along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the entertainment industry.</v>

486
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always this sort of longing for </v>

487
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.120
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia that people exhibit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always like back in the good old</v>

488
00:18:39.121 --> 00:18:44.121
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like back in the good old days is </v>

489
00:18:44.121 --> 00:18:45.771
<v Speaker 1>bullshit because the good old days you </v>
<v Speaker 1>died of syphilis and the good old days </v>

490
00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>people got fucking plague from rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no good old days.</v>

491
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.480
<v Speaker 1>This is the good old days right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's always that.</v>

492
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.550
<v Speaker 1>There's always this longing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia,</v>

493
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>but I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right with some people,</v>

494
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>but for sure there's some people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are racist.</v>

495
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 1>There voted for Donald trump just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because some people are racist.</v>

496
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

497
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to try and paint,</v>

498
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:08.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge percentage of people who voted </v>

499
00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:08.211
<v Speaker 1>for Barack Obama had to have voted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>

500
00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 1>particularly in Michigan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania.</v>

501
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.750
<v Speaker 1>There just aren't the numbers there </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

502
00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that they probably voted</v>
<v Speaker 1>for him?</v>

503
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:19.010
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is for economic reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they thought that he's going to </v>

504
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>loosen up some regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage industry.</v>

505
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the Union voters,</v>

506
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 1>they thought Hillary Clinton was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket of Goldman Sachs and they thought</v>

507
00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:31.191
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump was his sort of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionism is going to bring jobs </v>

508
00:19:31.191 --> 00:19:31.760
<v Speaker 1>back to the Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

509
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.860
<v Speaker 1>which encourage industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of the things I disagree </v>

510
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

511
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I've been in Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unions have a stranglehold.</v>

512
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I would rather be able to move to Texas </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anywhere they want to be competitive </v>

513
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.921
<v Speaker 1>in the car market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't even get to that because as </v>

514
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:48.921
<v Speaker 1>soon as I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

515
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump made a mistake here.</v>

516
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:54.591
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with them because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a women's march where their </v>

517
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:57.051
<v Speaker 1>lighting hair on fire and calling him </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally Hitler and sliding hair on </v>

518
00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:57.051
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

519
00:19:57.051 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the woman's March girl got her hair </v>

520
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 1>lit on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A girl?</v>

521
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By someone with one of those pussy hat </v>

522
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:03.440
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

523
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.751
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about that stuff is it's </v>

524
00:20:05.751 --> 00:20:07.560
<v Speaker 1>always one fucking person or a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out of hundreds of thousands that</v>

525
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:11.000
<v Speaker 1>are acting in that mob mentality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupt violence.</v>

526
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incorrect.</v>

527
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

528
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:17.781
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not that many people that do </v>

529
00:20:17.781 --> 00:20:17.781
<v Speaker 1>violence shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At those women's marches,</v>

530
00:20:17.781 --> 00:20:17.781
<v Speaker 1>there was no arrests?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

531
00:20:17.781 --> 00:20:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there are no rest of the lansing </v>

532
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.610
<v Speaker 1>protest either where they cut down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tent with box cutters.</v>

533
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:27.140
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were the lansing protests when it </v>

534
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.140
<v Speaker 1>went right to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big thing where I was there,</v>

535
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but even the inauguration protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one you got punched?</v>

536
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did get punched,</v>

537
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 1>so that wasn't fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

538
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.740
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

539
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're not expecting,</v>

540
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>why throw a punch when you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to punch.</v>

541
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

542
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Think about everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leftists gather though,</v>

543
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.360
<v Speaker 1>whether it's woodstock back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodstock,</v>

544
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.230
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 Woodstock High Wall Street.</v>

545
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

546
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.480
<v Speaker 1>There are so many rapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know you there?</v>

547
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.540
<v Speaker 1>There are reports of rape that's rapes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that occurred where they rape rapes or </v>

548
00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.091
<v Speaker 1>were they like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think back then they were back then </v>

549
00:21:00.091 --> 00:21:00.091
<v Speaker 1>Lena Dunham wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

550
00:21:00.091 --> 00:21:04.370
<v Speaker 1>shoving fast food napkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And her sister's cooch claiming she was </v>

551
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.370
<v Speaker 1>raped because she saw the condom in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>potted plant.</v>

552
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lena Dunham,</v>

553
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:12.211
<v Speaker 1>she claimed she was raped because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the condom on a plant after she was </v>

554
00:21:12.211 --> 00:21:14.941
<v Speaker 1>drunk and muscle relaxers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we always go back to Lena </v>

555
00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:14.941
<v Speaker 1>Dunham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

556
00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about that story.</v>

557
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:19.981
<v Speaker 1>I knew that there was some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gross interaction with her younger </v>

558
00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 1>sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was reaching inner inner,</v>

559
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 1>inner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inner Vagina.</v>

560
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 1>But the point is anywhere leftists </v>
<v Speaker 1>gather,</v>

561
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>there's always violence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggeration.</v>

562
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the women's March,</v>

563
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.890
<v Speaker 1>no violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no arrest.</v>

564
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 1>There was no nothing else that can you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say there was no violence,</v>

565
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 1>but people said there was no violence at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these other marches.</v>

566
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls I can.</v>

567
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like isolated incidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you have to look at a trend,</v>

568
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:48.571
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying everyone got a million </v>

569
00:21:48.571 --> 00:21:48.571
<v Speaker 1>people in la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A million people march,</v>

570
00:21:48.571 --> 00:21:49.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 970,000</v>

571
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:50.270
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

572
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 1>but you have way more than that with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tea party,</v>

573
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:54.220
<v Speaker 1>which was accused of being racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not One minute.</v>

574
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:55.940
<v Speaker 1>There are way more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

575
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

576
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:56.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

577
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

578
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:02.010
<v Speaker 1>You never had a march in la that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>more people than 970 across the country </v>

579
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 1>with the first year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

580
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people across the country with the </v>

581
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:07.920
<v Speaker 1>tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

582
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a model.</v>

583
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.650
<v Speaker 1>The day of the women's March when there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were hundreds of thousands of people all</v>

584
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 1>over the country marching together in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one day.</v>

585
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 1>There was never a movement like that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tea party.</v>

586
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a day with the tea party.</v>

587
00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Had One day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one day Glen Beck,</v>

588
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Washington DC.</v>

589
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's less than was in la for the </v>

590
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.671
<v Speaker 1>women's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but across the country because there </v>

591
00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:32.671
<v Speaker 1>were so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in Dallas,</v>

592
00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 1>there were four or five different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I crossed out the same day.</v>

593
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Come on in the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

594
00:22:36.941 --> 00:22:41.941
<v Speaker 1>not how many different city here's had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>march like that for the tea party.</v>

595
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.460
<v Speaker 1>They were in hundreds of cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of cities simultaneously in one</v>

596
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:50.461
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was bigger than the women's </v>

597
00:22:50.461 --> 00:22:50.461
<v Speaker 1>march.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly comparable with a comparable,</v>

598
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.810
<v Speaker 1>comparable and not a single incident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they left.</v>

599
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:54.250
<v Speaker 1>The place is cleaner than they found </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

600
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 1>You look at occupy Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suite 500 crimes including felonies.</v>

601
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:03.210
<v Speaker 1>You look at the women's March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's disregard the crime people up </v>

602
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.421
<v Speaker 1>there with pussy hats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing their two year old with the </v>

603
00:23:06.421 --> 00:23:08.731
<v Speaker 1>most profane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting signs you can imagine when </v>

604
00:23:08.731 --> 00:23:11.470
<v Speaker 1>leftist congregate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's generally not a peaceful assembly,</v>

605
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 1>not in the same way as when people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are right wing congregate.</v>

606
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Look at Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jake shields of Vegan from Berkeley is </v>

607
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.901
<v Speaker 1>becoming a vegetarian from Berkeley is </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming conservative because if he just</v>

608
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:23.740
<v Speaker 1>said this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was the rule,</v>

609
00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>not the exception in Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I know Jake,</v>

610
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:31.171
<v Speaker 1>he's a buddy of mine and essentially he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying that these people that were </v>

611
00:23:31.171 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 1>doing what they're claiming they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting fascist.</v>

612
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being a fascist.</v>

613
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand what a fascist means </v>
<v Speaker 1>using violence to enforce your ideology </v>

614
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.251
<v Speaker 1>and your tolerating no deviations from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ideology that is being a fascist.</v>

615
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pipe smoker blows,</v>

616
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 1>bro to the on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes too much effort.</v>

617
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:54.941
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had them on the show and he was </v>

618
00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:54.941
<v Speaker 1>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:54.941
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changed where the left.</v>

620
00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:58.751
<v Speaker 1>We need to call this out and we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to take ownership over this and </v>

621
00:23:58.751 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 1>when you need to squash it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a real problem.</v>

622
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 1>It's also a problem when you say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

623
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:08.110
<v Speaker 1>the left or the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not necessarily just the </v>

624
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.110
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's these fucking idiots.</v>

625
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.981
<v Speaker 1>They go to these things and put masks on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and want to beat people up and mace </v>

626
00:24:11.981 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that girl with a make make bitcoin</v>

627
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:17.861
<v Speaker 1>great again hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a joke hat and someone hit her </v>

628
00:24:17.861 --> 00:24:17.861
<v Speaker 1>over the head with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

629
00:24:17.861 --> 00:24:21.080
<v Speaker 1>that was holding up a sign and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>another guy master face.</v>

630
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think that they can spend it on</v>

631
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 1>people getting pulled out of cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting punched,</v>

632
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy Wall Street.</v>

633
00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You had people putting bloody rags on </v>
<v Speaker 1>tents that they claimed had aids.</v>

634
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

635
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>just go back through history in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade,</v>

636
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 1>it's very different and not saying all </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

637
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're speaking.</v>

638
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 1>You have to speak in generalities to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save time.</v>

639
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 1>But as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the right,</v>

640
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.590
<v Speaker 1>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

641
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 1>the tea party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the movement,</v>

642
00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:47.270
<v Speaker 1>people who were complaining about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus package,</v>

643
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:49.220
<v Speaker 1>you look at people at economic problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Barack Obama.</v>

644
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:54.460
<v Speaker 1>They didn't riot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't beat people up in record </v>

645
00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.621
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was not a single trash can lid on </v>

646
00:24:56.621 --> 00:24:59.081
<v Speaker 1>fire thrown through a window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a common occurrence at </v>

647
00:24:59.081 --> 00:24:59.081
<v Speaker 1>these leftist protests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

648
00:24:59.081 --> 00:24:59.480
<v Speaker 1>it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is now.</v>

649
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 1>It certainly isn't now power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

650
00:25:01.671 --> 00:25:06.671
<v Speaker 1>it's also these people feel like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump represents is the worst </v>

651
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 1>possible scenario for the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like he represents this,</v>

652
00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:15.401
<v Speaker 1>like really arrogant businessman who </v>
<v Speaker 1>promotes rape culture and grabbing </v>

653
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:17.540
<v Speaker 1>pussies and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how,</v>

654
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that's how they're looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>

655
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it's time to act like there was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who was on Fox News,</v>

656
00:25:22.551 --> 00:25:22.800
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

657
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Who's the one that Dude Tucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tucker Carlson.</v>

658
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

659
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Is he a Fox News Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

660
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 1>He used to be CNN on crossfire and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had some woman on and she was talking a </v>

661
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:32.500
<v Speaker 1>little Asian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

662
00:25:32.501 --> 00:25:32.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

663
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking school teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's talking about Bob Blop and I was </v>

664
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

665
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Like she's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She called Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

666
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:45.700
<v Speaker 1>who's a gay Jew by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She called them homophobic and prefers </v>

667
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.300
<v Speaker 1>prefers black men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

668
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do you call it gang guy?</v>

669
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Homophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what?</v>

670
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's a Nazi now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

671
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I was not for trump in the primary so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could call the Kuk right.</v>

672
00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>

673
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.790
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the most liberal Republican ever.</v>

674
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the only one,</v>

675
00:25:57.171 --> 00:26:02.171
<v Speaker 1>a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of his last president to ever take </v>

676
00:26:02.171 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>office being pro gay marriage when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was sworn in.</v>

677
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama can't even claim that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

678
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It was the first person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that people need to </v>

679
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.100
<v Speaker 1>recognize about Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was anti gay marriage is recently as</v>

680
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:12.380
<v Speaker 1>2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

681
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.020
<v Speaker 1>she was speaking in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

682
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:20.021
<v Speaker 1>I believe that marriage is a bond </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a man and a woman in 2013.</v>

683
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:25.690
<v Speaker 1>And she was making arguments to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like she was put on the spot </v>

684
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.241
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was out there arguing </v>

685
00:26:28.241 --> 00:26:28.241
<v Speaker 1>against same sex marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

686
00:26:28.241 --> 00:26:29.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

687
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.350
<v Speaker 1>my point here is they're out of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they declare everyone a Nazi,</v>

688
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they declared me a Nazi,</v>

689
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:36.740
<v Speaker 1>they'll declare Milo Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you say,</v>

690
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:37.070
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

691
00:26:37.071 --> 00:26:39.920
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to punch Nazis in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Hitler walked in here,</v>

692
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.650
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably have a tussle with Adolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

693
00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's acceptable if you</v>

694
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 2>make me or even you or milo equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Hitler.</v>

695
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the point that I'm making is </v>

696
00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 2>I think because they behaved so poorly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more Americans would,</v>

697
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:59.090
<v Speaker 2>would vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw you with a lever and vote for </v>

698
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump now than they did under </v>
<v Speaker 2>member eighth.</v>

699
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's highly speculative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is highly strict crowder,</v>

700
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.510
<v Speaker 2>hence the pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can speculate and highly speculative.</v>

701
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Not sure if I buy it might maybe let me </v>
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>

702
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:14.001
<v Speaker 2>People are also freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're freaking out about his </v>

703
00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:17.301
<v Speaker 2>appointment of a Golden Sachs executive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're freaking out over what's </v>

704
00:27:17.301 --> 00:27:20.841
<v Speaker 2>happening with that Flynn fellow who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>forced to resign because he was </v>

705
00:27:20.841 --> 00:27:24.740
<v Speaker 2>coordinating with Russia and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about removing sanctions before </v>

706
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.690
<v Speaker 2>they got into office and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

707
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 2>that was a screw up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

708
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not here to defend Donald Trump.</v>

710
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Screw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it trees.</v>

711
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:35.910
<v Speaker 2>It is by making them a five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a whole new man.</v>

712
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is delicious though,</v>

713
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:38.480
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

714
00:27:38.481 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 2>It really is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High as fuck right now.</v>

715
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

716
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:47.150
<v Speaker 2>He hits some marijuana after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably like takes it to the next </v>

717
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.990
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gets you high as fuck man.</v>

718
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.300
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty low in nicotine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>aromantic like that.</v>

719
00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm a rookie or you don't?</v>

720
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't smoke any weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoke a cigar.</v>

721
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty occasional.</v>

722
00:27:58.061 --> 00:27:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe once a month I'll puff a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigar.</v>

723
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That one's already broken in.</v>

726
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Can keep this pipe yet because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real process with a pipe.</v>

727
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

728
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:12.621
<v Speaker 2>you have to smoke it really slow when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you first get it because the briar </v>

729
00:28:12.621 --> 00:28:15.531
<v Speaker 2>expands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know pure faggotry sending a </v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

734
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.240
<v Speaker 2>You take someone like Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son of a bitch,</v>

735
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.430
<v Speaker 2>he explained to relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drink.</v>

736
00:28:29.431 --> 00:28:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you drink?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't drink.</v>

737
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.170
<v Speaker 2>You drink some whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get some whiskey up in here and we</v>

738
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:36.010
<v Speaker 2>need to make a beer if you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very.</v>

739
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 2>We need drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink real booze.</v>

740
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.040
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to relax a little.</v>

741
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to be a human.</v>

742
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:46.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't want all these talking points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These aren't talking fired up to fucking</v>

743
00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 2>defend the write and promote your </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda.</v>

744
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:53.421
<v Speaker 2>I'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know you said people like to </v>

745
00:28:53.421 --> 00:28:53.421
<v Speaker 2>think you're an asshole because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing.</v>

746
00:28:53.421 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think I'm a fucking meathead.</v>

747
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>

748
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.030
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am in a way,</v>

749
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 2>very meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>

750
00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not well.</v>

751
00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat meat a,</v>

752
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cage fighting commentator.</v>

753
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I look like a meathead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of meathead qualities that</v>

754
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:10.050
<v Speaker 2>I possess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I'm a kind person,</v>

755
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.500
<v Speaker 2>very openminded and more probably more </v>
<v Speaker 2>left than I am.</v>

756
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you looked at a giant spectrum,</v>

757
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 2>don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

758
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not anymore.</v>

759
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's such a narrow path on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>

760
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:25.490
<v Speaker 2>There's so unaccepting of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you've seen all this very </v>

761
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:25.490
<v Speaker 2>accepting in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

762
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm very accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even have ridiculous ideas.</v>

763
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.450
<v Speaker 2>I want you to talk about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

764
00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I just think one of the real problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have right now with all these </v>

765
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.951
<v Speaker 2>protestors and all these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going crazy and calling everybody Nazis </v>

766
00:29:36.951 --> 00:29:39.801
<v Speaker 2>is you're stifling communication and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stifling the marketplace of </v>

767
00:29:39.931 --> 00:29:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Freddy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want real booze broke.</v>

768
00:29:42.121 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out some whiskey straight.</v>

769
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 2>What's good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even better.</v>

770
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Make it hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring out some whiskey.</v>

771
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Trying to bring out that Alex Jones </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiskey the stuff that makes you talk </v>

772
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.361
<v Speaker 2>about interdimensional child molesters </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually stopped talking about pizza </v>

773
00:29:57.361 --> 00:29:57.361
<v Speaker 2>gate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>

774
00:29:57.361 --> 00:29:58.840
<v Speaker 2>That was a big contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't want to have them on here.</v>

775
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

776
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Eddie was probably instigating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie was out of his fucking mind drunk.</v>

777
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:08.911
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember you asked me the one thing </v>

778
00:30:08.911 --> 00:30:08.911
<v Speaker 2>about this pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good thing.</v>

779
00:30:08.911 --> 00:30:10.000
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to go.</v>

780
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may not be true,</v>

781
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 2>but what do you think about what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bright Bart was saying?</v>

782
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Like way back in 2011 about pedesta that</v>
<v Speaker 2>pedesta like shields files.</v>

783
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be a pussy with a beer.</v>

784
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm going with a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go to the airport.</v>

785
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 2>You and Jack gets marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he gave it to me for free.</v>

786
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gentleman.</v>

787
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack.</v>

788
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Jack Daniels did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

789
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.120
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>

790
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy Jack Town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually never had gentleman.</v>

791
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

792
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm well [inaudible] you asked me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it in the first thing where my </v>

793
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:52.840
<v Speaker 2>antenna went up with pizza gate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

794
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Jane James Alefantis means I love kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>in French and I.</v>

795
00:30:56.631 --> 00:30:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I know where they're trying to get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

796
00:30:57.671 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a Jim Lee's on fa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not James Alefantis.</v>

797
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.220
<v Speaker 2>So right away when it's the PR,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first premise that I read is a lie.</v>

798
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

799
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:12.180
<v Speaker 2>well there was a bunch of weird ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was some stuff that was like </v>

800
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.860
<v Speaker 2>really odd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the pizza place that had that </v>

801
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.590
<v Speaker 2>symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the international fucking symbol</v>

802
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:21.500
<v Speaker 2>for pedophilia and trauma lasting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond says in the Illuminati and.</v>

803
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:26.510
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this as a symbol that the FBI admits </v>

804
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.760
<v Speaker 2>that they use in these secret </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations that when they capture </v>

805
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:29.760
<v Speaker 2>pedophiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they do all the time.</v>

806
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use that symbol.</v>

807
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean they agree upon that symbol that </v>
<v Speaker 2>says there's a lot of weirdness to it.</v>

808
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

809
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.400
<v Speaker 2>this is my take on it and I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a side and I'm not,</v>

810
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not claiming that I have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

811
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 2>but there absolutely are pedophile </v>
<v Speaker 2>rings.</v>

812
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.960
<v Speaker 2>They exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have caught them before they busted</v>

813
00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:50.640
<v Speaker 2>them before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Jerry Sandusky kid just got busted.</v>

814
00:31:50.641 --> 00:31:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I know yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the beauty of Michael Jackson.</v>

815
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.700
<v Speaker 2>The guy was so clever about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

816
00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.760
<v Speaker 2>He screwed every kid in Hollywood except</v>
<v Speaker 2>Macaulay Culkin.</v>

817
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.410
<v Speaker 2>So he's at Canary in the coal mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Macola caulkins and no,</v>

818
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to Neverland ranch.</v>

819
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:07.321
<v Speaker 2>He never touched me here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would say to other kids </v>

820
00:32:07.321 --> 00:32:09.391
<v Speaker 2>are coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still swear up and that's what I </v>

821
00:32:09.391 --> 00:32:09.391
<v Speaker 2>would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you went,</v>

822
00:32:09.391 --> 00:32:11.170
<v Speaker 2>if you went to a bachelor party and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody got their Dick sucked and your</v>

823
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:11.920
<v Speaker 2>wife said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

824
00:32:11.921 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

825
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Bobby says he got his dick suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Me.</v>

826
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she just didn't like me.</v>

827
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:22.050
<v Speaker 2>You get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Macaulay Culkin has no reason to say </v>

828
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:22.050
<v Speaker 2>that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

829
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:22.050
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

830
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to know that you got </v>

831
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 2>molested by Michael Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll never get a girlfriend again.</v>

832
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Should we get one hell of a book deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

833
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.600
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be about to go down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

834
00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:29.410
<v Speaker 2>And she'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

835
00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:34.411
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think you'll get one hell of a</v>

836
00:32:34.451 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 2>book deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

837
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Breitbart actually not Breitbart </v>

838
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the trademark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Breitbart,</v>

839
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the name is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

840
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:40.200
<v Speaker 2>he was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

841
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 1>got my start and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote about that,</v>

842
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neverland ranch.</v>

843
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:48.551
<v Speaker 1>His photographer was a pornographer who </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized in European actors who </v>

844
00:32:49.221 --> 00:32:52.760
<v Speaker 1>looked under age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so once he talked about this,</v>

845
00:32:52.761 --> 00:32:57.761
<v Speaker 1>the guy was fired from Neverland ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was six months later he was </v>

846
00:32:57.761 --> 00:32:57.761
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my point was like,</v>

847
00:32:57.761 --> 00:32:59.960
<v Speaker 1>the pizza good stuff is there are things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are provable like that,</v>

848
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.990
<v Speaker 1>which people can go search Andrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>Breitbart and find that story and </v>

849
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.500
<v Speaker 1>because people are cocked and loaded to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate someone from the right online </v>

850
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.430
<v Speaker 1>cocked what you really do go into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different voice was with nasty words.</v>

851
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:15.560
<v Speaker 1>That was my beavis and butthead voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>

852
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:20.561
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather dwell on stories that we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can prove or commentary because it's </v>

853
00:33:20.561 --> 00:33:20.561
<v Speaker 1>really easy to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

854
00:33:20.561 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 1>crowder was wrong with pizza gate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

855
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:24.170
<v Speaker 1>So we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much there that's real.</v>

856
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 1>That's where I focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my issue with Alex Jones.</v>

857
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones go super deep and I did not </v>
<v Speaker 1>know him before I had him,</v>

858
00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:33.200
<v Speaker 1>that he was a sandy hook denier and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw that and it's pretty rough.</v>

859
00:33:33.201 --> 00:33:34.970
<v Speaker 1>It hurt my soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really did.</v>

860
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's um,</v>

861
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.540
<v Speaker 1>he's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His son is a fan.</v>

862
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:43.541
<v Speaker 1>He's been really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good to me and coming on the </v>

863
00:33:43.541 --> 00:33:45.851
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done the young Turks sketches with </v>

864
00:33:45.851 --> 00:33:47.471
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's doing less of the </v>

865
00:33:47.471 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy stuff now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like less now.</v>

866
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Get them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them drunk,</v>

867
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.770
<v Speaker 1>get them drunk and watch it come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

868
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex has been my friend for a long time.</v>

869
00:33:55.341 --> 00:33:59.030
<v Speaker 1>He's 84 percent crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

870
00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

871
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:05.620
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where if you </v>

872
00:34:06.081 --> 00:34:11.081
<v Speaker 1>chase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's enough corruption and enough </v>

873
00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:11.081
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit in the world that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>chase it down,</v>

874
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find it right?</v>

875
00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:17.740
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to be careful what you call </v>

876
00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.981
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption and what you call </v>

877
00:34:20.981 --> 00:34:20.981
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

878
00:34:20.981 --> 00:34:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Because there are a fuck ton of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's missing the mark.</v>

879
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Like the sandy hook thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

880
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the sandy hook thing is so fucked.</v>

881
00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:31.520
<v Speaker 1>There was a great article that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>written about a guy who was a conspiracy</v>

882
00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:35.810
<v Speaker 1>theorist until his kid was killed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandy Hook.</v>

883
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then realized like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>diamond beforehand.</v>

940
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:56.490

<v Speaker 1>That's a bad song.</v>

942
00:36:58.561 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>would you assume?</v>

944
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:07.701

<v Speaker 1>to the main stage probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>

946

<v Speaker 1>I didn't read the lyrics so I didn't see</v>

<v Speaker 1>trying to be understanding of another </v>

948

<v Speaker 1>culture and it backfired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna give you that.</v>

949
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't he just washed his dick?</v>

950
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Like when you go to the crab shack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have that automatic hand cleaner,</v>

951
00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have hand sanitizer and keeps in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fucking.</v>

952
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Ben's just spray thieves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essential oil.</v>

953
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Like my wife's not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Brown,</v>

954
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.880
<v Speaker 1>dirty bitch coming home with a dirty </v>
<v Speaker 1>dick.</v>

955
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's worse than adultery start.</v>

956
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.630
<v Speaker 1>That's not his wife for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

957
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:47.670
<v Speaker 1>they're not married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a marriage we're talking </v>

958
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.670
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not saying,</v>

959
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

960
00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:49.590
<v Speaker 1>More booze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring it out.</v>

961
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Both bring them both out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy needs to get drunk talks.</v>

962
00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Too much shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want we want to talk about everything?</v>

963
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Life Generale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

964
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's say this generally a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been as mad as I was watching</v>

965
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:04.380
<v Speaker 1>that Holly Holm fight.</v>

966
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the uh,</v>

967
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:11.930
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you hit someone after the </v>

968
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.881
<v Speaker 1>bell and it's really clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be an immediate point </v>

969
00:38:13.881 --> 00:38:14.160
<v Speaker 1>deduction and they should be given time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to recover more than a minute.</v>

970
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 1>That's just an opinion you twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I agree with you.</v>

971
00:38:17.941 --> 00:38:19.500
<v Speaker 1>But here's why I disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

972
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm even more extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that hitting someone after the </v>

973
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.460
<v Speaker 1>bell is grounds for disqualification </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

974
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

975
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.590
<v Speaker 1>fam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know down your whole mindset </v>

976
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:33.590
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not expecting it.</v>

977
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 1>She definitely heard the bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was stepping in,</v>

978
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 1>she threw</v>

979
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.830
<v Speaker 2>the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's grounds for disqualification.</v>

980
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

981
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:44.200
<v Speaker 2>it's been a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did and I heard bells and I didn't</v>

982
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:46.420
<v Speaker 2>hit anybody afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what the fuck it is,</v>

983
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

984
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:52.771
<v Speaker 2>if you do the point deduction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holly wins that fight or a draw for </v>

985
00:38:52.771 --> 00:38:52.771
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germain de Randamie is fucking awesome.</v>

986
00:38:52.771 --> 00:38:57.661
<v Speaker 2>She's an awesome fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she is a 46 and o 10 time world </v>

987
00:38:57.661 --> 00:38:59.020
<v Speaker 2>champion and for that to happen with her</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

988
00:38:59.021 --> 00:39:01.480
<v Speaker 2>it upsets me in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in two ways.</v>

989
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it upsets me because holly got fouled.</v>

990
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Intuit upsets me because she's a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

991
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.290
<v Speaker 2>For her to do something like that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

992
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:11.530
<v Speaker 2>why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

993
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she rocked holly.</v>

994
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.830
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you rock someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how much that affects them for the</v>

995
00:39:17.831 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 2>rest of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holly is so bad ass.</v>

996
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:25.950
<v Speaker 2>She not only came back from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she came back from that wound up head </v>

997
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.730
<v Speaker 2>kicking Jermaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping her and then rocking her little</v>

998
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:30.040
<v Speaker 2>hook that you threw that we've looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that first.</v>

999
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:32.660
<v Speaker 2>With just straight left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was like a hook.</v>

1001
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.650
<v Speaker 2>All he rocked her straight legs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight left that she was coming in,</v>

1002
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:37.690
<v Speaker 2>so it's just really short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then perfect shot.</v>

1003
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's incredible.</v>

1004
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 2>She's so bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that question.</v>

1005
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Mark kick that she hit her with over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the shoulder,</v>

1006
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:46.330
<v Speaker 2>drops down and hits her in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny though that she doesn't.</v>

1007
00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't fight like a boxer in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>octagon at all.</v>

1008
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:53.281
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more like an American </v>

1009
00:39:53.281 --> 00:39:54.601
<v Speaker 2>kickboxer well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was also an American </v>

1010
00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:57.211
<v Speaker 2>kickboxer and she's also trained by Mike</v>
<v Speaker 2>Winkeljohn who was one of the best </v>

1011
00:39:57.211 --> 00:39:58.600
<v Speaker 2>American kickboxing from his era.</v>

1012
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.840
<v Speaker 2>He was world class in his time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really good.</v>

1013
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:03.520
<v Speaker 2>When he fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fought Rick Rufus.</v>

1014
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:06.860
<v Speaker 2>He fought some really good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said great striking coach man.</v>

1015
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Very similar to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when I'm in Dallas,</v>

1016
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Guy Metzger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar style to that kind of stand</v>

1017
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.360
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not as much head movement.</v>

1018
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.730
<v Speaker 2>That Guy Metzger is a good friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

1019
00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really just an awesome guy.</v>

1020
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I won't get into personal stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's been.</v>

1021
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 2>He's done some really nice things for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and he's a really.</v>

1022
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.810
<v Speaker 2>He's the exact example of when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>say fighters are our meatheads,</v>

1023
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.870
<v Speaker 2>you just really kindhearted guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1024
00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:33.871
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely not immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more of a meathead than him for </v>

1025
00:40:33.871 --> 00:40:33.871
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

1026
00:40:33.871 --> 00:40:35.860
<v Speaker 2>he's not just a kindhearted guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very intelligent,</v>

1027
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 2>soft spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never hear Guy Metzger yelling at </v>

1028
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 2>people and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's also,</v>

1029
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's worked really hard to mitigate some</v>

1030
00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:45.000
<v Speaker 2>of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1031
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.650
<v Speaker 2>brain trauma and been really open about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1032
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 2>which I think is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1033
00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:54.001
<v Speaker 2>very important because it's like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>silent thing that guys don't want to </v>

1034
00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:54.001
<v Speaker 2>talk about the issues that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with from fighting.</v>

1035
00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he also.</v>

1036
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear the story about when he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the fight in a parking lot?</v>

1037
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.410
<v Speaker 2>It was like a bunch of guys who jumped </v>
<v Speaker 2>him you about,</v>

1038
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long this one?</v>

1039
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 2>That long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were probably thinking the one where </v>

1040
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.721
<v Speaker 2>the guy had a knife and stabbed him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the face because he got in between an </v>

1041
00:41:09.721 --> 00:41:09.980
<v Speaker 2>altercation between a minute and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't do that.</v>

1042
00:41:09.981 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 2>And when it was done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out fighting,</v>

1043
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:11.940
<v Speaker 2>stay home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1044
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.290
<v Speaker 2>this was something maybe he may not want</v>
<v Speaker 2>me to tell the story,</v>

1045
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 2>but it was in a parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something happened.</v>

1046
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:20.761
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happened was there were three </v>

1047
00:41:20.761 --> 00:41:22.591
<v Speaker 2>or four guys and all he did was he </v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbed one guy just got him to the </v>

1048
00:41:22.591 --> 00:41:23.320
<v Speaker 2>ground somehow and put him in a choke </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold.</v>

1049
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.310
<v Speaker 2>And he told his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1050
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:25.960
<v Speaker 2>if you come forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to choke your friend out.</v>

1051
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 2>And they just got back into their rav </v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

1052
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.730
<v Speaker 2>close the doors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He let the guy go.</v>

1053
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.100
<v Speaker 2>They were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really nice person.</v>

1054
00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Most people chose that guy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also,</v>

1055
00:41:36.591 --> 00:41:37.910
<v Speaker 2>he's a striker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have really hurt him.</v>

1056
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the beauty of grappling.</v>

1057
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 2>You can hurt them or not as much as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>

1058
00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Master is a very high level striker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1059
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:47.750
<v Speaker 2>he's not known as a grappler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why he's a grappler to.</v>

1060
00:41:47.751 --> 00:41:51.670
<v Speaker 2>He choked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tito Ortiz was one of his first UFC.</v>

1061
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.870
<v Speaker 2>He just won worlds at Brown in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>senior division.</v>

1062
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Did it really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1063
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1064
00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 2>he's still competing and doing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1065
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:02.771
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a nice thing for people that </v>

1066
00:42:02.771 --> 00:42:03.250
<v Speaker 2>don't want to strike anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Baba loose abroad,</v>

1067
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 2>he's been doing a lot of grappling </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitions,</v>

1068
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 2>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1069
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.080
<v Speaker 2>guys that just have taken a lot of head </v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma,</v>

1070
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.060
<v Speaker 2>a lot of crazy fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long careers.</v>

1071
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.790
<v Speaker 2>They still like to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do that.</v>

1072
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:14.990
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Bob Ballou has,</v>

1073
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:17.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Bob Lose Iron Jim,</v>

1074
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:22.601
<v Speaker 2>I think that is what he calls it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a really nice high level jim </v>

1075
00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:26.540
<v Speaker 2>down in Orange County and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an explanation every time parents</v>

1076
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:30.270
<v Speaker 2>taking their kids for lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they walk in and see Bob Ballou great.</v>

1077
00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.750
<v Speaker 2>But they have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of.</v>

1078
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

1079
00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.920
<v Speaker 2>let you see the tattoos up his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Parents are going to be a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>apprehensive.</v>

1081
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy and he's a real pioneer</v>

1082
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:43.020
<v Speaker 2>in Bob Ballou was in the early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early days of fighting.</v>

1083
00:42:43.021 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 2>You say there's a fight with him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brad Kohler.</v>

1084
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:49.871
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the fucking scariest </v>
<v Speaker 2>knockouts ever because it was back when </v>

1085
00:42:49.871 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you could soccer kick on the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1086
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:55.120
<v Speaker 2>he dropped Brad Colt because Bob Ballou </v>
<v Speaker 2>was one of the first Brazilian </v>

1087
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.180
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people don't know.</v>

1088
00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:01.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was a black belt in Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and very good striker and all </v>

1089
00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.301
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he also was on the Brazilian </v>

1090
00:43:04.301 --> 00:43:04.930
<v Speaker 2>national wrestling team back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Brad Kohler,</v>

1091
00:43:04.931 --> 00:43:08.940
<v Speaker 2>who was like this really beefed up </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking just jacked dude could,</v>

1092
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.680
<v Speaker 2>couldn't touch them on the feet and Bob </v>
<v Speaker 2>will eventually got them tired out.</v>

1093
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:14.800
<v Speaker 2>And when he dropped him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got him down to the ground,</v>

1094
00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 2>he fucking soccer kicked him into </v>
<v Speaker 2>oblivion.</v>

1095
00:43:16.971 --> 00:43:21.971
<v Speaker 2>It was just those days when you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you could soccer kick someone who </v>

1096
00:43:21.971 --> 00:43:23.150
<v Speaker 2>was already tired and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>

1097
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.360
<v Speaker 2>those are dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to put it into context of Brazilian </v>

1098
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.491
<v Speaker 2>national wrestling team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like ventures to Oklahoma </v>

1099
00:43:30.491 --> 00:43:31.670
<v Speaker 2>state wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not even the same level maybe,</v>

1100
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 2>but a high level wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A high level roadside is,</v>

1101
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's like Sarah Mcmahon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1102
00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:40.121
<v Speaker 2>she was silver at the Olympics number </v>
<v Speaker 2>when people said she was going to beat </v>

1103
00:43:40.121 --> 00:43:40.121
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda with the wrestling.</v>

1104
00:43:40.121 --> 00:43:40.121
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1105
00:43:40.121 --> 00:43:43.841
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The talent pool in women's wrestling is </v>

1106
00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:43.841
<v Speaker 2>nowhere near where it is judo at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1107
00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:45.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have women in Japan in judo who</v>

1108
00:43:45.521 --> 00:43:46.700
<v Speaker 2>are criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1109
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Kayla Harrison to following her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was actually one of the first guests</v>

1110
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 2>on our show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just a monster,</v>

1111
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no one in female wrestling.</v>

1112
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:59.290
<v Speaker 2>No one who will even come close to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of experience with them in the </v>

1113
00:43:59.290 --> 00:43:59.290
<v Speaker 2>same can be said about Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

1114
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:00.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

1115
00:44:00.201 --> 00:44:02.690
<v Speaker 2>which isn't in the Olympics yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really should be,</v>

1116
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 2>is there's some phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen Mackenzie dern.</v>

1117
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I've seen her compete in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1118
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.340
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1119
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:15.341
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the most bad ass choke outs that </v>

1120
00:44:15.341 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She started with an Omoplata,</v>

1121
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 2>worked away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This girl's back.</v>

1122
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.120
<v Speaker 2>She's got this move that she does where </v>
<v Speaker 2>she gets a in on the plot that and she </v>

1123
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.030
<v Speaker 2>rolls over onto her back and chokes this</v>
<v Speaker 2>chick out.</v>

1124
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Apparently she hits this move all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1125
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Will they teach something similar to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at Marcello Garcia School in New </v>

1126
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:32.080
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where if ever someone turtling you</v>

1127
00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>said your knee into their ribs and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip crease and you kind of get around </v>

1128
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.610
<v Speaker 1>not quite an Omoplata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're bringing your other leg </v>

1129
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 1>around their front and you're wrapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're blocking.</v>

1130
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:43.050
<v Speaker 1>If let's save coming in from your right </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

1131
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 1>you blocked her left arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something we actually would,</v>

1132
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.380
<v Speaker 1>would learn in judo quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A really basic back.</v>

1133
00:44:48.381 --> 00:44:53.381
<v Speaker 1>So you black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you broke blocking by taking an </v>

1134
00:44:53.381 --> 00:44:55.791
<v Speaker 1>underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're in your admin console and </v>

1135
00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:55.791
<v Speaker 1>you're having risk control around so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not putting a hook in.</v>

1136
00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And when you control this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they taught it to me,</v>

1137
00:44:57.391 --> 00:45:02.391
<v Speaker 1>like if you watch Marcella Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just go for the choke straight </v>

1138
00:45:02.391 --> 00:45:05.301
<v Speaker 1>from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even need to get their hooks </v>

1139
00:45:05.301 --> 00:45:05.301
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1140
00:45:05.301 --> 00:45:05.301
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1141
00:45:05.301 --> 00:45:08.301
<v Speaker 1>then you have Clark race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who does the Omoplata role to the lapel </v>

1142
00:45:08.301 --> 00:45:08.301
<v Speaker 1>choke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1143
00:45:08.301 --> 00:45:08.301
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

1144
00:45:08.301 --> 00:45:12.620
<v Speaker 1>The plan is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's been a submission </v>

1145
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.680
<v Speaker 1>from that in a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's only ever in the UFC history</v>

1146
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:15.930
<v Speaker 1>was Ben Saunders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Mackenzie dern.</v>

1147
00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how she does this for me is also </v>

1148
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.000
<v Speaker 1>is that she's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she,</v>

1149
00:45:22.001 --> 00:45:24.300
<v Speaker 1>she gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets the Omoplata to the girl,</v>

1150
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:26.520
<v Speaker 1>tries to roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now watch how she handles this.</v>

1151
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.470
<v Speaker 1>When she gets her from disposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1152
00:45:28.471 --> 00:45:28.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1153
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.150
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to go back.</v>

1154
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.170
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even have her hooks.</v>

1155
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a highlight video.</v>

1156
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.790
<v Speaker 1>So she doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't need the hook.</v>

1157
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.350
<v Speaker 1>What she does is she rolls and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it from that position.</v>

1158
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a lot like a Nogi version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>clerk.</v>

1159
00:45:41.971 --> 00:45:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Racies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omoplata Lapel.</v>

1160
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Show me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if they show it here.</v>

1161
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.820
<v Speaker 1>But she does is she gets up and when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets up on her hip,</v>

1162
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 1>she the girl roles and then watch how </v>
<v Speaker 1>she scrambles.</v>

1163
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Now she takes her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1164
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:57.500
<v Speaker 1>They don't show it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She takes her right arm and she rolls </v>

1165
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:57.500
<v Speaker 1>underneath the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1166
00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her dad is Megaton Diaz who's world </v>

1167
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:02.000
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1168
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:02.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1169
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:02.850
<v Speaker 1>very respected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presented Jujitsu,</v>

1170
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:04.560
<v Speaker 1>black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1171
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the coolest things about Jujitsu </v>

1172
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 1>is it's like almost like sentences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

1173
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.670
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different ways you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go with things.</v>

1174
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:14.070
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1175
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.230
<v Speaker 1>it's almost never ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1176
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:17.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy like my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
00:46:17.161 --> 00:46:20.070
<v Speaker 1>he's in his fifties and he hasn't lost a</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1178
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:25.250
<v Speaker 1>let alone around competing up to purple </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt and he competes against guys who </v>

1179
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.800
<v Speaker 1>were 40 and open way because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one is age and uh,</v>

1180
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you played hockey,</v>

1181
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:31.731
<v Speaker 1>you have m high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high level athlete and he's not super </v>

1182
00:46:31.731 --> 00:46:31.731
<v Speaker 1>flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to do a guard game.</v>

1183
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:34.110
<v Speaker 1>He got really good at takedowns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at trips,</v>

1184
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.150
<v Speaker 1>really good at guard passing and side </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of jokes,</v>

1185
00:46:37.151 --> 00:46:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper cutter and things like that.</v>

1186
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's diverse enough where he can protect</v>

1187
00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:43.620
<v Speaker 1>himself in areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one thing too,</v>

1188
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:48.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was helping coach him for his </v>

1189
00:46:48.621 --> 00:46:48.621
<v Speaker 1>first tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1190
00:46:48.621 --> 00:46:48.621
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in training,</v>

1191
00:46:48.621 --> 00:46:49.260
<v Speaker 1>you want to work these positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1192
00:46:49.261 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you want to work your guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to work,</v>

1193
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 1>we have guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing that says in the </v>

1194
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't stuff the head get up and just</v>

1195
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:59.271
<v Speaker 1>come up on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he realized that when he </v>

1196
00:46:59.271 --> 00:47:01.371
<v Speaker 1>competes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just getting out and getting on </v>

1197
00:47:01.371 --> 00:47:01.371
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he gets on top,</v>

1198
00:47:01.371 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 1>he's going to pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what his level at a purple belt</v>

1199
00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that strategies that </v>

1200
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>only works with someone who's weaker </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>

1201
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Like as soon as you find someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at that game than you,</v>

1202
00:47:09.531 --> 00:47:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to have other options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he's not good off of his back,</v>

1203
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.180
<v Speaker 1>someone's eventually going to put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>on his.</v>

1204
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:15.840
<v Speaker 1>But he's pretty good in his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good.</v>

1205
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:16.920
<v Speaker 1>But in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a tournament,</v>

1206
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.620
<v Speaker 1>the point is there's no unwritten </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement where we're working,</v>

1207
00:47:19.621 --> 00:47:20.790
<v Speaker 1>passing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what I mean?</v>

1208
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 1>So he can try his scissor sweep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a big thing for him as a strong</v>

1209
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:30.021
<v Speaker 1>guy and if it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can do a technical standout and come </v>

1210
00:47:30.021 --> 00:47:32.541
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Helson Gracie has the best </v>

1211
00:47:32.541 --> 00:47:32.541
<v Speaker 1>description of Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1212
00:47:32.541 --> 00:47:36.720
<v Speaker 1>you do this than I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you do this than I do that forever.</v>

1213
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I love that because it's like once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried Jujitsu,</v>

1214
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1215
00:47:42.611 --> 00:47:45.030
<v Speaker 1>that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until someone taps like you,</v>

1216
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:50.390
<v Speaker 1>like Hixon Gracie has always been famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>for saying about other other athletes,</v>

1217
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:55.951
<v Speaker 1>other competitors that if they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the rhythm there will lose some </v>

1218
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Speaker 1>amazing meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like George St Pierre,</v>

1219
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:03.780
<v Speaker 1>but like meaning that he keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps attacking and you keep defending </v>

1220
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.570
<v Speaker 1>and counterattacking eventually you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to slip up.</v>

1221
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.610
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get a dominant position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1222
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.060
<v Speaker 1>And then once from there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he's world class,</v>

1223
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying he's able to learn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1224
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I know you want to Brag about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad's.</v>

1225
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Thank you gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wild Turkey one-on-one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's disgusting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why is it better for whiskey to be aged </v>

1252
00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.950

<v Speaker 1>flavor in there anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good.</v>

1258
00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:22.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a good whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best whiskey can't fuck with </v>

1259
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Koolaid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tastes better than the best whiskey.</v>

1260
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with Sinatra?</v>

1261
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:28.090
<v Speaker 1>She had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the pain.</v>

1262
00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I like feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the suffering.</v>

1263
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.050
<v Speaker 1>I like the suffering that comes with </v>

1286
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean you saw the black lives matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and you talked about the issue of </v>

1287
00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:31.050
<v Speaker 1>libertarian than anything.</v>

1294
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:48.521
<v Speaker 1>We talked pretty sensibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Gary as a human and I think he's </v>

1295
00:50:48.521 --> 00:50:52.631
<v Speaker 1>a good guy and I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Aleppo things suck that fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a goddamn torpedo when he didn't </v>

<v Speaker 1>know what Aleppo is with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1298
00:50:58.091 --> 00:50:58.280
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plays Good Pool.</v>

1299
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know about Aleppo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that happened,</v>

1300
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a spike in Google searches for</v>

1301
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Aleppo and he doesn't know what Aleppo </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

1302
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about Aleppo.</v>

1303
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I knew that Syria was in a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible situation.</v>

1304
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I knew the Syrian refugees that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleeing,</v>

1305
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I knew the bombings and who I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the name of the city.</v>

1306
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.450
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1307
00:51:17.451 --> 00:51:22.451
<v Speaker 1>he got caught not knowing the name of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the city and he should have known the </v>

1308
00:51:22.451 --> 00:51:22.451
<v Speaker 1>name of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you asked me,</v>

1309

<v Speaker 1>but I'm a man.</v>

1314
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.560

<v Speaker 1>That is part of my job.</v>

1315
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.930
<v Speaker 1>If you're running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your job.</v>

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that chickens.</v>

1379
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1380
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't live in Los Angeles.</v>

1381
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I live outside of Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1382
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I have several locations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And which to sleep.</v>

1383
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1384
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem with high </v>

1385
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:10.890
<v Speaker 2>population areas and that problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is two things.</v>

1386
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:12.780
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a diffusion of responsibility.</v>

1387
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:13.740
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people.</v>

1388
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 2>You just feel like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't value,</v>

1389
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.690
<v Speaker 2>you don't value each other because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too many,</v>

1390
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.840
<v Speaker 2>there's everyone's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see an accident you don't pull </v>

1391
00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:23.840
<v Speaker 2>over to try to help because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>

1392
00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 2>people on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just keep going.</v>

1393
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you saw that same accident on a </v>

1394
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 2>single lane road in the country and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1395
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:32.550
<v Speaker 2>some cops you might pull over and help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1396
00:54:32.551 --> 00:54:35.380
<v Speaker 2>you might add about New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Yorkers care about each other.</v>

1397
00:54:35.381 --> 00:54:40.381
<v Speaker 2>I got you walk past the Hobo on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street in New York for a lot of people </v>

1398
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:40.381
<v Speaker 2>they just ignore it because they're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to it.</v>

1399
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:41.590
<v Speaker 2>They did after nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

1400
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to New York after nine slash 11.</v>

1401
00:54:43.591 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 2>We filmed a fear factor there and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you man,</v>

1402
00:54:45.631 --> 00:54:47.260
<v Speaker 2>it was a beautiful thing because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1403
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:52.270
<v Speaker 2>there was a real palpable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a tangible feeling of community </v>

1404
00:54:52.291 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 2>there that doesn't exist there anymore.</v>

1405
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>

1406
00:54:55.230 --> 00:55:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Also the New York that existed in 2001 </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not the New York that he is here in </v>

1407
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.150
<v Speaker 2>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1408
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1409
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I've had some like Judah freelander is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine is a stand up comic and </v>

1410
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:07.500
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was telling me,</v>

1411
00:55:07.501 --> 00:55:07.920
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1412
00:55:07.921 --> 00:55:09.390
<v Speaker 2>it's all bankers now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1413
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no artist in New York anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't afford it.</v>

1414
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.280
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to Brooklyn maybe,</v>

1415
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:19.850
<v Speaker 2>but in New York City the rents are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking expensive and there's so much </v>

1416
00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:23.631
<v Speaker 2>international money in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I can tell you that's flipped </v>

1417
00:55:23.631 --> 00:55:23.790
<v Speaker 2>a little bit having when I lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1418
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:27.000
<v Speaker 2>the lower east side in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived there when I was with Fox for,</v>

1419
00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there are two different stints,</v>

1420
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:33.140
<v Speaker 2>one time sleeping on couches and a one </v>
<v Speaker 2>time this would've been 2011,</v>

1421
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2012.</v>

1422
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:40.640
<v Speaker 2>And the rent was cheaper in old money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upper east side than an east village or </v>

1423
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.330
<v Speaker 2>lower east side because that's where all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hipsters and the artists were.</v>

1424
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:47.690
<v Speaker 2>So they don't want it to be there now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the upper east side was seen as not </v>

1425
00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got a place that was so inexpensive</v>

1426
00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 2>compared to if I wanted to live down </v>
<v Speaker 2>downtown.</v>

1427
00:55:51.301 --> 00:55:53.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's Kinda switched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no one,</v>

1428
00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.700
<v Speaker 2>none of the artists want to live with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the wasp.</v>

1429
00:55:55.701 --> 00:56:00.701
<v Speaker 2>So this is always a problem when too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people have too much money and </v>

1430
00:56:00.701 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 2>they're all congregated in one area </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then they're just annoying.</v>

1431
00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:07.080
<v Speaker 2>It's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all trying to buy the same </v>

1432
00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.081
<v Speaker 2>fucking cars on your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Bertrand Russell short pipes and </v>

1433
00:56:09.841 --> 00:56:12.060
<v Speaker 2>stomp on the little mat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1434
00:56:12.061 --> 00:56:12.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1435
00:56:12.901 --> 00:56:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1436
00:56:13.951 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it also,</v>

1437
00:56:15.031 --> 00:56:20.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's obviously this is where </v>
<v Speaker 2>leftest tend to congregate leftist </v>

1438
00:56:20.031 --> 00:56:21.270
<v Speaker 2>ideology in big cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want you on public transportation.</v>

1439
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>They want you to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they don't want you riding,</v>

1440
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1441
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:24.970
<v Speaker 1>they won't get well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bikes,</v>

1442
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:25.540
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans,</v>

1443
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:31.020
<v Speaker 1>public transport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly they want to limit what </v>

1444
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:31.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of cars you can drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far you can drive them.</v>

1445
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:35.011
<v Speaker 1>You look in any big city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they definitely wanna reduce </v>

1446
00:56:35.011 --> 00:56:35.011
<v Speaker 1>independence and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real art.</v>

1447
00:56:35.011 --> 00:56:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's what it really is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1448
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.400
<v Speaker 1>They want to reduce carbon emissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to reduce independence.</v>

1449
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1450
00:56:40.061 --> 00:56:45.061
<v Speaker 1>I think it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's both and less consistent than </v>

1451
00:56:45.061 --> 00:56:45.061
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

1452
00:56:45.061 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 1>If kids say that people want you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>buses and dependent on government,</v>

1453
00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:49.460
<v Speaker 1>just like they want you on welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1454
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.470
<v Speaker 1>the transit people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some percentage of the people do.</v>

1455
00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:58.471
<v Speaker 1>But if Tesla came out with some car that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could drive across the country on </v>

1456
00:56:58.471 --> 00:57:01.351
<v Speaker 1>one charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think people would be suppressing </v>

1457
00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:01.351
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would welcome it.</v>

1458
00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Zero emissions car that give you total </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

1459
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.260
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to try to suppress that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is,</v>

1460
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:07.300
<v Speaker 1>is the only one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1461
00:57:07.301 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 1>How and why they would do is remove all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government subsidies that make tesla</v>

1462
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 1>even remotely competitive as they this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have started them a crazy.</v>

1463
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:20.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and the subsidies that go </v>

1464
00:57:20.431 --> 00:57:20.431
<v Speaker 1>into a tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1465
00:57:20.431 --> 00:57:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Prius could still be losing Toyota on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone sold.</v>

1466
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 1>But you look at the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies,</v>

1467
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:26.860
<v Speaker 1>the government incentives for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to buy these cars.</v>

1468
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Tesla.</v>

1469
00:57:28.031 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not a prius.</v>

1470
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.500
<v Speaker 1>That's not true either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a bunch of people bought Prius is</v>

1471
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Prius a Brendan Schaub as a Prius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My buddies have drives a prius.</v>

1472
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:39.280
<v Speaker 1>He's got off fucking Prius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has even fit in a prius and a Bentley.</v>

1473
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Well there you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barely fucking.</v>

1474
00:57:43.121 --> 00:57:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Big Gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He barely fits in.</v>

1475
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I would say those things handled like </v>
<v Speaker 1>trash.</v>

1476
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.390
<v Speaker 1>There's shit cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Burr has a prius.</v>

1477
00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:50.860
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Jaguar?</v>

1478
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>

1479
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white guilt symbol in Los Angeles,</v>

1480
00:57:56.041 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 1>or you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to say that,</v>

1481
00:57:58.751 --> 00:58:01.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's people that don't want to spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money on gas.</v>

1482
00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:03.170
<v Speaker 1>They bought a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought them in 2000.</v>

1483
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to spend a lot of </v>

1484
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:09.691
<v Speaker 1>money on gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would do the cost savings </v>

1485
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:09.691
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would see buying a used car,</v>

1486
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 1>any used car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a Ford Fiesta,</v>

1487
00:58:10.841 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Speaker 1>which would get more mileage and a prius</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1488
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.280
<v Speaker 1>So White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>

1489
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1490
00:58:14.831 --> 00:58:18.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fiesta gets more money or American small</v>

1491
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:20.620
<v Speaker 1>cars will get over 40 miles per gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1492
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 1>but a praise gets over 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's ride.</v>

1495
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's an eight mileage </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

1496
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what you want.</v>

1497
00:58:28.601 --> 00:58:30.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't want an old car's gonna break </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1498
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.770
<v Speaker 1>You want a new car that's reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gets really,</v>

1499
00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:34.450
<v Speaker 1>really shouldn't be enhanced with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prius.</v>

1500
00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.280
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't want.</v>

1502
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be tar straight into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lungs.</v>

1503
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:40.150
<v Speaker 1>If you inhale that and switched into </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed,</v>

1504
00:58:40.151 --> 00:58:41.020
<v Speaker 1>you're driving me crazy.</v>

1505
00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is so much better.</v>

1506
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the.</v>

1507
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1508
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's that?</v>

1509
00:58:50.531 --> 00:58:53.390
<v Speaker 1>A Prius is Ford Fiesta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

1510
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.880
<v Speaker 1>so 40 highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>29 city sun,</v>

1511
00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 1>40 highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now pull up,</v>

1512
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:04.560
<v Speaker 1>pull up a preschool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have way more in the city because </v>

1513
00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:04.560
<v Speaker 1>there was a battery work here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better.</v>

1514
00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Son of a bitch point sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1515
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:09.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the point though.</v>

1516
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:14.790
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a side trying to say that if </v>

1517
00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:18.571
<v Speaker 1>you really wanted to save money on gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get a fucking shitty old Ford </v>

1518
00:59:18.571 --> 00:59:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Fiesta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's absolutely.</v>

1519
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1520
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.020
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Son,</v>

1521
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.360
<v Speaker 1>are you it more in the city but all you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

1522
00:59:26.361 --> 00:59:30.720
<v Speaker 1>But here's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many tens of miles per gallon.</v>

1523
00:59:30.721 --> 00:59:35.721
<v Speaker 1>You are incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the actual price of a </v>

1524
00:59:35.721 --> 00:59:37.571
<v Speaker 1>Prius versus the best thing you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the environment is by an old beater </v>

1525
00:59:37.571 --> 00:59:37.571
<v Speaker 1>car by an old Camaro.</v>

1526
00:59:37.571 --> 00:59:40.130
<v Speaker 1>This poorly understood that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>$24,000.</v>

1527
00:59:40.131 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 1>It's cheap as fuck for a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1528
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:46.010
<v Speaker 1>you'd be better off buying an old beater</v>
<v Speaker 1>car recycle than buying a prius.</v>

1529
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Dig Your heels in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the other side,</v>

1530
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you buy a Prius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two giant non recyclable batteries.</v>

1531
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Dig Your heels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your giant non-recyclable non recyclable</v>

1532
00:59:59.361 --> 01:00:01.370
<v Speaker 1>for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but much like nuclear waste.</v>

1533
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:04.250
<v Speaker 1>It's making a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1534
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that they can make diamonds batteries on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a diamonds with nuclear waste now that </v>

1535
01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>last thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give what do we want?</v>

1536
01:00:11.061 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1537
01:00:11.721 --> 01:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>they make batteries that have diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear waste,</v>

1538
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>nuclear diamond waste batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of years.</v>

1539
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear energy that we could be using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't be using because people </v>

1540
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>thought it was worse for the environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're using it.</v>

1541
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Whether people thought it was worse or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

1542
01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:27.920
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is like the old plants </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Fukushima,</v>

1543
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.080
<v Speaker 1>that they have huge difficulties with </v>
<v Speaker 1>shutting down.</v>

1544
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Someone told me that is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1545
01:00:33.841 --> 01:00:38.841
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the other day that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone had said that the radiation </v>

1546
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:38.841
<v Speaker 1>levels are growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This business not growing,</v>

1547
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>that the real issue is a aerosol or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1548
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>The old global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cfcs sort of noticed but not aerosols.</v>

1549
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>What was the airborne airborne?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1550
01:00:50.811 --> 01:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>radiation is an issue with Fukushima </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're monitoring it.</v>

1551
01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't surprise me,</v>

1552
01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>but my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point on that one is why?</v>

1553
01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Why are leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1554
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:02.860
<v Speaker 1>against the sharing economy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would Bernie Sanders,</v>

1555
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're plastic forks just abandoned,</v>

1556
01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:11.891
<v Speaker 1>left versus right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tries to tell people what are the </v>

1557
01:01:11.891 --> 01:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>innovations or the Bernie social </v>
<v Speaker 1>ascenders against the sharing economy.</v>

1558
01:01:16.101 --> 01:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>You can you give them a nickname?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1559
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>you son of a socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a self about European socialists.</v>

1560
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Why would they be against the sharing </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand dollars a year?</v>

1561
01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1562
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>let's stay on the ground.</v>

1563
01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>What are you telling me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bouncing all over it.</v>

1564
01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>You bring up your fucking dog again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about your dad is Jitsu guy not </v>

1565
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>talk about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to say.</v>

1566
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I says,</v>

1567
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>this is the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sharing economy,</v>

1568
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber,</v>

1569
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>and Airbnb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't everyone be on board with </v>

1570
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have?</v>

1571
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.161
<v Speaker 1>People like Bernie Sanders or Nancy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pelosi banning them or poor Austin </v>

1572
01:01:51.161 --> 01:01:52.730
<v Speaker 1>politicians and constituents banning </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from their city.</v>

1573
01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>If we're talking about sharing </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

1574
01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do uber and Austin.</v>

1575
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders doesn't want to uber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AIRBNB.</v>

1576
01:01:58.821 --> 01:02:03.821
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they're doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they're doing that because </v>

1577
01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:05.891
<v Speaker 1>they want taxis to survive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're doing it because just </v>

1578
01:02:05.891 --> 01:02:09.341
<v Speaker 1>like people like to throw out this big </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy about big bankers and their </v>

1579
01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:09.341
<v Speaker 1>own self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>

1580
01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that people don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge that the left is beholden to</v>

1581
01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:16.271
<v Speaker 1>giant cabby unions who are punching </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the face in New York because </v>

1582
01:02:16.271 --> 01:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Uber removes their surcharge and decides</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ignore the trump travel ban.</v>

1583
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I think they're against airbnb because</v>

1584
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.480
<v Speaker 2>they're beholden to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1585
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:25.980
<v Speaker 2>the culinary union who might sneak in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the side about the trump travel ban.</v>

1586
01:02:25.981 --> 01:02:30.981
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that was that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't even road testing and Uber in </v>

1587
01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:34.731
<v Speaker 2>New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went in and they were still going </v>

1588
01:02:34.731 --> 01:02:34.731
<v Speaker 2>to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cabbies unions in New York said,</v>

1589
01:02:34.731 --> 01:02:38.931
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so people were punching over </v>

1590
01:02:38.931 --> 01:02:38.931
<v Speaker 2>drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People getting furious about it.</v>

1591
01:02:38.931 --> 01:02:38.931
<v Speaker 2>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're you're scams.</v>

1592
01:02:38.931 --> 01:02:40.860
<v Speaker 2>You're coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber actually removed their surcharge.</v>

1593
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.210
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] remember all the airport </v>
<v Speaker 2>protests,</v>

1594
01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a quagmire.</v>

1595
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1596
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1597
01:02:44.731 --> 01:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Join the airplane mode of the trump's </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel ban.</v>

1598
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 2>There were protests at all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different airports about that.</v>

1599
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1600
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:51.870
<v Speaker 2>what does that have to do with Uber?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is in New York,</v>

1601
01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.470
<v Speaker 2>the cabbies unions went on strike </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the travel ban,</v>

1602
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber's going in weren't clear,</v>

1603
01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.220
<v Speaker 2>and they're moving their surcharge.</v>

1604
01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're talking about the sharing </v>

1605
01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.721
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're talking about bringing in </v>

1606
01:03:05.721 --> 01:03:05.721
<v Speaker 2>refugees and resettling them against </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's will,</v>

1607
01:03:05.721 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we want to be compassionate.</v>

1608
01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:07.470
<v Speaker 2>We'll just take that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1609
01:03:07.471 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 2>instead of resettling refugees against </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's will,</v>

1610
01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:14.451
<v Speaker 2>because you want to share what about </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody deciding to share their car at </v>

1611
01:03:14.451 --> 01:03:17.580
<v Speaker 2>an agreed upon service or share their </v>
<v Speaker 2>house and the the left,</v>

1612
01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:20.820
<v Speaker 2>the political left has fought against </v>
<v Speaker 2>that vehemently.</v>

1613
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It is inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were band.</v>

1614
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Who is this day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1615
01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:29.850
<v Speaker 2>So the board or he polosi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth Warren.</v>

1616
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:32.970
<v Speaker 2>What they want to do is either get uber </v>
<v Speaker 2>banned in cities,</v>

1617
01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:37.971
<v Speaker 2>as you see in cities like Austin or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities in Europe or they want to make </v>

1618
01:03:37.971 --> 01:03:39.180
<v Speaker 2>sure that unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that caveat is either get first,</v>

1619
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:41.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or that Uber Hires these union workers.</v>

1620
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1621
01:03:42.121 --> 01:03:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have an issue with that,</v>

1622
01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.660
<v Speaker 2>so let's pull up that.</v>

1623
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Pull up that story that Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in favor of banning uber,</v>

1624
01:03:50.071 --> 01:03:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber,</v>

1625
01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.780
<v Speaker 2>and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's break that down and unpack it </v>

1626
01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.301
<v Speaker 2>because I think when something comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>along that's better and it fucks with a </v>

1627
01:03:59.701 --> 01:04:04.701
<v Speaker 2>business that is worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better things should win because </v>

1628
01:04:04.701 --> 01:04:04.810
<v Speaker 2>that's progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1629
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I think uber is progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think lyft is progress.</v>

1630
01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:13.251
<v Speaker 2>I think what lyft is doing and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>these these programs are doing where you</v>

1631
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:18.501
<v Speaker 2>have an application on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can turn it on and off anytime you </v>

1632
01:04:18.501 --> 01:04:18.501
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can work anytime you want,</v>

1633
01:04:18.501 --> 01:04:21.960
<v Speaker 2>as long as they certify and test you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>run it.</v>

1634
01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you're not a crazy person as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as they know where you are at every</v>

1635
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:30.531
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can actually monitor your location </v>

1636
01:04:30.531 --> 01:04:31.170
<v Speaker 2>through gps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they can and everybody saves money</v>

1637
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.630
<v Speaker 2>and the people who drive the car make </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1638
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Like you can make like 35 bucks an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

1639
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you rather do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a car like a prius that gets</v>

1640
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 2>50 fucking eight miles to the gallon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you rather do that?</v>

1641
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:47.510
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in favor of 100 percent in </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress and I think that anybody that </v>

1642
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:50.811
<v Speaker 2>opposes that because somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to challenge other people's </v>

1643
01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:50.811
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1644
01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:52.680
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to something like uber </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus cab,</v>

1645
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is pretty black and white.</v>

1646
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:59.750
<v Speaker 2>This is a new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disruptive technology that benefits a </v>

1647
01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:02.070
<v Speaker 2>lot of individual users.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence it's good.</v>

1648
01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Well also benefits the middle class more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than anybody and there's no union for </v>

1649
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Uber drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big problem.</v>

1650
01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>No lobbying and there's no money that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to politician.</v>

1651
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not aware of this.</v>

1652
01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:14.910
<v Speaker 2>You're more balls deep in politics than </v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

1653
01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:19.911
<v Speaker 2>So let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's going to pull up a story and </v>

1654
01:05:19.911 --> 01:05:19.911
<v Speaker 2>we're going to figure out what</v>

1655
01:05:19.911 --> 01:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is wrong with Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take on it from an individual point of </v>

1656
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1657
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>or you can look up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1658
01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:28.711
<v Speaker 1>you can even look up European cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have banded are awesome and I know </v>

1659
01:05:28.711 --> 01:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge issue in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching those cab drivers </v>

1660
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.621
<v Speaker 1>that had decided to block streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided to shut their cars off in </v>

1661
01:05:34.621 --> 01:05:35.130
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the street and literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop cars from passing.</v>

1662
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>People had to go way around them and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a huge issue.</v>

1663
01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>The reason the term political left and </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and matters right now to me anyway</v>

1664
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:48.420
<v Speaker 1>and matter to some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason it matters to me is </v>

1665
01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:48.420
<v Speaker 1>because you do look at one side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum right now and I think</v>

1666
01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.891
<v Speaker 1>the line's been pretty clear in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>last election where there's an </v>

1667
01:05:52.891 --> 01:05:55.531
<v Speaker 1>ideological divide and where one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately looking at marginalizing </v>

1668
01:05:55.531 --> 01:05:59.731
<v Speaker 1>and targeting and dividing victimized </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups and they do so and ignore other </v>

1669
01:05:59.731 --> 01:06:04.021
<v Speaker 1>groups of people who are victimized as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>result of them complaining about </v>

1670
01:06:04.021 --> 01:06:04.021
<v Speaker 1>victimization.</v>

1671
01:06:04.021 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what this is.</v>

1672
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.720
<v Speaker 1>That's very vague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let going to give you want a concrete</v>

1673
01:06:07.721 --> 01:06:12.721
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find this with Bernie Sanders may </v>

1674
01:06:12.721 --> 01:06:14.650
<v Speaker 1>go into this thought as Janice guidance </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what he was trying to find a quote </v>

1675
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:16.680
<v Speaker 1>about what he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's about what I guess he has some</v>

1676
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:21.730
<v Speaker 1>serious problems with serious problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with popular mobile ride hailing </v>

1677
01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:24.040
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber speaking with Bloomberg,</v>

1678
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:29.041
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic presidential candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>contender rather called the service </v>

1679
01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:32.761
<v Speaker 1>unregulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting into one of the most closely </v>

1680
01:06:32.761 --> 01:06:35.461
<v Speaker 1>watched economic debates of the 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>race workers on demand at on demand </v>

1681
01:06:36.881 --> 01:06:38.440
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Companies like Uber,</v>

1682
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Airbnb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Lyft,</v>

1683
01:06:39.701 --> 01:06:44.701
<v Speaker 1>are considered independent contractors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore I do not receive the </v>

1684
01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.090
<v Speaker 1>benefits and protections afforded to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulltime employees.</v>

1685
01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could see that,</v>

1686
01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:50.230
<v Speaker 1>but they do make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1687
01:06:50.231 --> 01:06:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to pay a huge commission</v>

1689
01:06:53.171 --> 01:06:58.171
<v Speaker 1>to the cabbies union and they're totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent and they have their own car </v>

1690
01:06:58.171 --> 01:06:58.171
<v Speaker 1>and they make more money.</v>

1691
01:06:58.171 --> 01:06:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't mean is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1692
01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's make sure that that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's true,</v>

1693
01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.600
<v Speaker 1>but let's just have the choice to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>google uber drivers make more than car </v>

1694
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.251
<v Speaker 1>companies versus how much uber makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their drivers because that's the </v>

1695
01:07:11.251 --> 01:07:14.851
<v Speaker 1>real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say Uber as a company and they're </v>

1696
01:07:14.851 --> 01:07:17.581
<v Speaker 1>pumping out all these drivers and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>making shit tons of money and then </v>

1697
01:07:17.581 --> 01:07:19.420
<v Speaker 1>they're not given the drivers enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then given the uncertainty,</v>

1698
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I think they take a much smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>commission and then the cab driver's </v>

1699
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:24.990
<v Speaker 1>license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have enough in front of me,</v>

1700
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:26.410
<v Speaker 1>reiterate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro uber 100 percent.</v>

1701
01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend of mine is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big wig at Uber.</v>

1702
01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even if I wasn't what's matter </v>

1703
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.200
<v Speaker 1>this how uber fails to prove its drivers</v>
<v Speaker 1>make more than tax post that's happened </v>

1704
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.690
<v Speaker 1>in post those sons of bitches.</v>

1705
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the blade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1706
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:47.100
<v Speaker 1>they feel the need to be defensive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they failed to prove how they failed to </v>

1707
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:47.100
<v Speaker 1>prove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1708
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Claim and Huffington post can't disprove</v>

1709
01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:55.051
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying uber is failed to </v>

1710
01:07:55.051 --> 01:07:55.051
<v Speaker 1>prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this isn't going to help that crowd.</v>

1711
01:07:55.051 --> 01:07:58.441
<v Speaker 1>Or read the fucking quotes going crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and defend your right wing,</v>

1712
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.020
<v Speaker 1>right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1713
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Time Dot Com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then instead having that beer bearson </v>

1714
01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:07.360
<v Speaker 1>time.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1715
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Uber reveals how much is drivers really </v>
<v Speaker 1>earned?</v>

1716
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:14.851
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber has long said the drivers get paid </v>

1717
01:08:14.851 --> 01:08:16.230
<v Speaker 1>more than traditional cabbies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do they driver surveys,</v>

1718
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.310
<v Speaker 1>strikes and class action lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests otherwise.</v>

1719
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Most recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buzzfeed.</v>

1720
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay if it's bud?</v>

1721
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that too left wing you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

1722
01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Buzz feed is fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your fat.</v>

1723
01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Those estimates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buzzfeed,</v>

1724
01:08:28.431 --> 01:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>you fake estimate that terrible trauma </v>
<v Speaker 1>impression that drivers in Denver,</v>

1725
01:08:32.601 --> 01:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Houston make less than 13 point two,</v>

1726
01:08:36.081 --> 01:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>five cents an hour.</v>

1727
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.400
<v Speaker 1>$13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twenty five cents an hour after expenses</v>

1728
01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:42.800
<v Speaker 1>using calculations based on the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a million trips.</v>

1729
01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

1730
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:48.910
<v Speaker 1>This spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uber was hit with two class action </v>

1731
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:51.281
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits from drivers in Florida and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Illinois who seek to recover unpaid </v>

1732
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:55.730
<v Speaker 1>overtime wages and other expenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is after the company.</v>

1733
01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.760
<v Speaker 1>This is our shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have one Shitty TV that can't </v>

1734
01:09:01.611 --> 01:09:04.280
<v Speaker 1>handle an htmi cable and it cuts out </v>
<v Speaker 1>every minute and a half.</v>

1735
01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:06.920
<v Speaker 1>We have one of those when Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1736
01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:07.220
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1737
01:09:07.221 --> 01:09:07.520
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1738
01:09:07.521 --> 01:09:09.500
<v Speaker 1>blah who seek to recover unpaid </v>
<v Speaker 1>overtime.</v>

1739
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpaid overtime wages and other </v>

1740
01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:17.741
<v Speaker 1>expenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is after the company paid </v>

1741
01:09:17.741 --> 01:09:18.890
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to settle similar lawsuits in California</v>

1742
01:09:18.891 --> 01:09:19.880
<v Speaker 1>and Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1743
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Massachusetts big union strong if </v>

1744
01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:27.370
<v Speaker 1>they have lawsuits and if there is a law</v>
<v Speaker 1>suit that does make sense enough where a</v>

1745
01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:32.300
<v Speaker 1>judge decides that they're going to rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>against Uber.</v>

1746
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1747
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the law.</v>

1748
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1749
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:39.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on a right to work state,</v>

1750
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but wouldn't you assume that the lawyers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the judges in Massachusetts would </v>

1751
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:50.051
<v Speaker 1>make a strong enough case where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would show the legality of it to the </v>

1752
01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:51.410
<v Speaker 1>point where it wouldn't lose $100 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000</v>

1753
01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:52.610
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1754
01:09:52.611 --> 01:09:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't assume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anything about the lawsuit?</v>

1755
01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1756
01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.880
<v Speaker 1>here's what I would know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a right to work state or </v>

1757
01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.461
<v Speaker 1>not and that will determine the lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why people like Bernie </v>

1758
01:10:03.461 --> 01:10:03.461
<v Speaker 1>Sanders and that's why people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Geez,</v>

1759
01:10:03.461 --> 01:10:04.160
<v Speaker 1>what happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You opened that too fast.</v>

1760
01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Just go do it like you did the pilot </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared good enough.</v>

1761
01:10:09.531 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 1>And Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so.</v>

1762
01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:12.530
<v Speaker 1>It depends if it's a right to work state</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

1763
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:13.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1764
01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:14.990
<v Speaker 1>They make less than cab drivers.</v>

1765
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1766
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:20.591
<v Speaker 1>let's eliminate people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between a right </v>

1767
01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:21.440
<v Speaker 1>to work state effectively means you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to join a union means you can</v>

1768
01:10:21.441 --> 01:10:24.650
<v Speaker 1>work without being a part of the labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>union and determine the case.</v>

1769
01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Just for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what when we do hidden camera </v>

1770
01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:29.980
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to make sure that it's a two,</v>

1771
01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.370
<v Speaker 1>a one party consent state as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a two party consent state.</v>

1772
01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Nevada,</v>

1773
01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:34.040
<v Speaker 1>when they used to do this prank call </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>

1774
01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:35.860
<v Speaker 1>they would do like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember crank anchors?</v>

1775
01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would do it in Nevada,</v>

1776
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:38.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he calls.</v>

1777
01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Lorna is a one party consent state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1778
01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:43.370
<v Speaker 1>it's too well in Nevada and California </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one.</v>

1779
01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean California?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1780
01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definition wrong,</v>

1781
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'm thinking is we both have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree.</v>

1782
01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1783
01:10:49.581 --> 01:10:54.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will do it in Nevada instead of </v>

1784
01:10:54.581 --> 01:10:54.581
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

1785
01:10:54.581 --> 01:10:54.581
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1786
01:10:54.581 --> 01:10:54.581
<v Speaker 1>Right in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only like,</v>

1787
01:10:54.581 --> 01:10:55.600
<v Speaker 1>you can call me up a prank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and not doing it.</v>

1788
01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have to agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1789
01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>That might've changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might change.</v>

1790
01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Michigan it was really controversial.</v>

1791
01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:06.131
<v Speaker 1>It was a one party consent state that </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the judge read as a two </v>

1792
01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:10.001
<v Speaker 1>party consent state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really scary because you can </v>

1793
01:11:10.001 --> 01:11:10.001
<v Speaker 1>be in the clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1794
01:11:10.001 --> 01:11:12.010
<v Speaker 1>we recorded a prank call or we found </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of corruption and it should be</v>

1795
01:11:12.011 --> 01:11:17.011
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little wiggle room where they </v>

1796
01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:19.371
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually this isn't legal and you </v>

1797
01:11:19.371 --> 01:11:19.371
<v Speaker 1>committed a felony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a problem with that.</v>

1798
01:11:19.371 --> 01:11:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in these right to work states,</v>

1799
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have this uber situation,</v>

1800
01:11:24.811 --> 01:11:29.811
<v Speaker 1>is the issue that it's taking cabs out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of business or is the issue that they </v>

1801
01:11:30.241 --> 01:11:35.241
<v Speaker 1>are not paying people enough and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking cabs out of business so that </v>

1802
01:11:35.241 --> 01:11:39.851
<v Speaker 1>people like the or cab drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they switched over to becoming uber </v>

1803
01:11:39.851 --> 01:11:43.851
<v Speaker 1>drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would actually lose money because </v>

1804
01:11:43.851 --> 01:11:45.090
<v Speaker 1>these companies aren't regulated so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to pay insurance,</v>

1805
01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:45.780
<v Speaker 1>health insurance.</v>

1806
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like what the issue is,</v>

1807
01:11:47.641 --> 01:11:52.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they would say the issues </v>

1808
01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:52.641
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not true.</v>

1809
01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:52.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1810
01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:52.641
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1811
01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:53.460
<v Speaker 1>that depends on the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first off,</v>

1812
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I would want to clarify just people </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>

1813
01:11:55.051 --> 01:11:56.580
<v Speaker 1>It would not be the right to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

1814
01:11:56.581 --> 01:11:58.350
<v Speaker 1>The right to work states would be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1815
01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm a right to work state means I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to say,</v>

1816
01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to work for this amount?</v>

1817
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:06.240
<v Speaker 1>And you have the right to say yes or non</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to work above minimum wage.</v>

1818
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1819
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:09.180
<v Speaker 1>As long as they're as cool as you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1820
01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:09.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1821
01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And report is a non right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Towards stage is when,</v>

1822
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:15.300
<v Speaker 1>depending on the profession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is an established union in that</v>

1823
01:12:15.301 --> 01:12:17.520
<v Speaker 1>profession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't work outside of that union.</v>

1824
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

1825
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case with trades like </v>
<v Speaker 1>plumbing being a carpenter?</v>

1826
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Generally repair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's auto repair that they have a union.</v>

1828
01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the state,</v>

1829
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:33.710
<v Speaker 1>depends on the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she'll son and actually would have </v>

1830
01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:33.710
<v Speaker 1>some stories about his dad being in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1831
01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 1>the plumber's union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had some stories about that.</v>

1832
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Vince Vaughn and some funny stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>

1833
01:12:36.091 --> 01:12:38.370
<v Speaker 1>he's told actually when he worked at his</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad's like papermill,</v>

1834
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1835
01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:41.190
<v Speaker 1>but to go back to it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first off,</v>

1836
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if someone agrees to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>price and the service,</v>

1837
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's a marketplace of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and services and you have the right to </v>

1838
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.060
<v Speaker 1>do it and I have the right to provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>those services.</v>

1839
01:12:51.061 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Now if Uber is doing a poor job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God there's lift,</v>

1840
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's some competition there,</v>

1841
01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but if the government steps in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1842
01:12:57.481 --> 01:13:02.481
<v Speaker 1>you have to use the cabbies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unions will even then you can </v>

1843
01:13:02.481 --> 01:13:05.391
<v Speaker 1>artificially increased wages at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expense of the taxpayer who now has to </v>

1844
01:13:05.391 --> 01:13:05.391
<v Speaker 1>pay more for a taxi ride.</v>

1845
01:13:05.391 --> 01:13:10.010
<v Speaker 1>So I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people should be able to </v>

1846
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.010
<v Speaker 1>make their own decisions if they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do uber,</v>

1847
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:11.790
<v Speaker 1>if they want to rent out their house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And airbnb.</v>

1848
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:17.060
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that Nancy Pelosi in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bay area representing our district </v>

1849
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:17.060
<v Speaker 1>should have any say in whether I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

1850
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you 100 percent on that.</v>

1851
01:13:18.721 --> 01:13:23.721
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's also a real problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people resisting change because </v>

1852
01:13:23.721 --> 01:13:25.920
<v Speaker 1>technologically influenced changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming at such a high rate.</v>

1853
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:28.650
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can put a finger in </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the holes in the dam.</v>

1854
01:13:28.651 --> 01:13:33.651
<v Speaker 1>It's just you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many things that are </v>

1855
01:13:33.651 --> 01:13:36.171
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to change the way we </v>

1856
01:13:36.171 --> 01:13:36.171
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the way we do business,</v>

1857
01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:39.180
<v Speaker 1>change everything from top to bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to stop it.</v>

1858
01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.490
<v Speaker 1>So anytime we try to stop something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Uber,</v>

1859
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.930
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that I think is that who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to figure out where's the,</v>

1860
01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.690
<v Speaker 1>how's the money being distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that fair?</v>

1861
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:51.090
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

1862
01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.120
<v Speaker 1>what's the solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a solution alert people to </v>

1863
01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.950
<v Speaker 1>what the actual numbers are and let it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorted itself out.</v>

1864
01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Or is it passing regulation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firm believer that the less </v>

1865
01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 1>regulation you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

1866
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what songs,</v>

1867
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not like environmental pollution </v>
<v Speaker 1>type shit,</v>

1868
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the invisible hand write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more that moves the market.</v>

1869
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly believe that the market is </v>

1870
01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.941
<v Speaker 1>more efficient at regulating itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the government creating a monopoly </v>

1871
01:14:20.941 --> 01:14:23.680
<v Speaker 1>will also because unions can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced and when you get large groups</v>

1872
01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:28.681
<v Speaker 1>of people together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good because like what a </v>

1873
01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>union can do is they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1874
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stand strong when I got </v>

1875
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:35.000
<v Speaker 1>to let these people take advantage of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of slave labor factory in</v>

1876
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East or wherever the fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1877
01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:36.930
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>

1878
01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Figure out a way to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1879
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.800
<v Speaker 1>if you work here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get an honest wage and </v>

1880
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that you get giant groups</v>

1881
01:14:46.901 --> 01:14:51.901
<v Speaker 1>of people that you can't go against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's going to be in control of </v>

1882
01:14:51.901 --> 01:14:55.831
<v Speaker 1>those giant notion that that's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than being the mayor of a city</v>

1883
01:14:56.051 --> 01:15:01.051
<v Speaker 1>or the leader of a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No different than being beholden to </v>

1884
01:15:01.051 --> 01:15:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the top political </v>

1885
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.660
<v Speaker 1>donors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can bring it up from open secrets.</v>

1886
01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:09.661
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the top 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 16 out of the top 20 are big </v>

1887
01:15:09.661 --> 01:15:12.331
<v Speaker 1>unions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's this idea that it's big banks </v>

1888
01:15:12.331 --> 01:15:12.331
<v Speaker 1>and the Koch brothers and energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

1889
01:15:12.331 --> 01:15:16.640
<v Speaker 1>no one wields more influence in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics today than big unions </v>

1890
01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.031
<v Speaker 1>particularly come into the party because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's power because they can influence </v>

1891
01:15:21.031 --> 01:15:24.301
<v Speaker 1>the people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can also take cues from you give 100 </v>

1892
01:15:24.301 --> 01:15:24.301
<v Speaker 1>percent of Democrats and you have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1893
01:15:24.301 --> 01:15:28.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the big contributors to the </v>

1894
01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:28.680
<v Speaker 1>war against drugs.</v>

1895
01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.040
<v Speaker 1>One of the big things that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country is the prison guard </v>

1896
01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.671
<v Speaker 1>unions have spent money to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocuous things like marijuana or they </v>

1897
01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:42.271
<v Speaker 1>stay illegal because if they stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal then they keep their jobs like </v>

1898
01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:45.580
<v Speaker 1>they've literally fought for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fought to keep more people in cages</v>

1899
01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:48.580
<v Speaker 1>because that would earn them more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

1900
01:15:48.581 --> 01:15:51.010
<v Speaker 1>We break it down to black and white and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1901
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Did you just make a joke about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory prison system in the </v>

1902
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.270
<v Speaker 1>United States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was cold.</v>

1903
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:58.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say black and white because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>at black and white people I met.</v>

1904
01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It could have been black and white </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

1905
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:05.700
<v Speaker 1>The reality of the situation is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison guard unions are spending money </v>

1906
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:09.670
<v Speaker 1>and using their influence to ensure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work.</v>

1907
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Influential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>influential.</v>

1908
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like from south off that edge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that marijuana stays illegal and </v>

1909
01:16:16.241 --> 01:16:18.310
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they're doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they profit off of it,</v>

1910
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:21.040
<v Speaker 1>so that's not an altruistic ideal.</v>

1911
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 1>That's not someone who cares about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that they represent.</v>

1912
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.840
<v Speaker 1>That's not someone who cares about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>community as a whole,</v>

1913
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that someone is looking out for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>best interests in a way that is negative</v>

1914
01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:31.620
<v Speaker 1>towards the general population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With you and I,</v>

1915
01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:36.621
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where the wool was pulled</v>
<v Speaker 1>over people's eyes with people like </v>

1916
01:16:36.621 --> 01:16:36.621
<v Speaker 1>Bernie will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's from the people.</v>

1917
01:16:36.621 --> 01:16:37.390
<v Speaker 1>He's never gotten big donors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually not true.</v>

1918
01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:42.391
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the collective donations </v>
<v Speaker 1>from union members and from union </v>

1919
01:16:42.391 --> 01:16:45.001
<v Speaker 1>organizations and when you look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what bothers me is when people </v>

1920
01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:48.031
<v Speaker 1>follow the money trail and only one side</v>
<v Speaker 1>and act as though the political left is </v>

1921
01:16:48.031 --> 01:16:49.720
<v Speaker 1>on beholden to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big point,</v>

1922
01:16:49.721 --> 01:16:53.620
<v Speaker 1>what you just said on one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think you can see the benefits</v>

1923
01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:58.621
<v Speaker 1>in unions as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see the benefits and </v>

1924
01:16:58.621 --> 01:17:00.901
<v Speaker 1>protecting wages and making sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get insurance and making sure </v>

1925
01:17:00.901 --> 01:17:01.090
<v Speaker 1>that people live a good life.</v>

1926
01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.160
<v Speaker 1>That like if you're going to work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this company,</v>

1927
01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:05.200
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be well compensated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to.</v>

1928
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.440
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be an agreement between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workers and the people that run the </v>

1929
01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.471
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a problem with that and the </v>

1930
01:17:14.471 --> 01:17:16.271
<v Speaker 1>problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not always a problem with </v>

1931
01:17:16.271 --> 01:17:16.271
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is occasionally sometimes.</v>

1932
01:17:16.271 --> 01:17:16.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

1933
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:18.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the rule rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception.</v>

1934
01:17:18.171 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 1>And I talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1935
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.190
<v Speaker 1>the Walmart CEO for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes $19 million,</v>

1936
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are curious about that.</v>

1937
01:17:23.781 --> 01:17:28.781
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walmart employs two point 5 million </v>

1938
01:17:28.781 --> 01:17:28.781
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One point 5 million people a full time.</v>

1939
01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:31.510
<v Speaker 1>So he had that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's getting less than than uh,</v>

1940
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you add up all the workers,</v>

1941
01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:38.561
<v Speaker 1>not the full time workers will be less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than $10 per person he's employing and </v>

1942
01:17:38.561 --> 01:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>providing an active living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have workers who say,</v>

1943
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:41.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is 19 million,</v>

1944
01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:43.550
<v Speaker 1>that's more than I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no million,</v>

1945
01:17:43.551 --> 01:17:45.290
<v Speaker 1>19 is 19 more millions.</v>

1946
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.390
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pick an arbitrary number.</v>

1947
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:49.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what Bernie Sanders we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the debate with Ted Cruz,</v>

1948
01:17:49.881 --> 01:17:54.881
<v Speaker 1>whether you like them or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was such a floor mopping because </v>

1949
01:17:54.881 --> 01:17:57.731
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders dealt with these phantom </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears and again tried to victimize </v>

1950
01:17:57.731 --> 01:18:02.081
<v Speaker 1>groups and marginalized groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my point that I was talking about </v>

1951
01:18:02.081 --> 01:18:02.081
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1952
01:18:02.081 --> 01:18:05.561
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the victimized groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>and marginalized groups who don't have </v>

1953
01:18:05.561 --> 01:18:05.561
<v Speaker 1>insurance in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1954
01:18:05.561 --> 01:18:06.800
<v Speaker 1>It was 40 something thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them were young people who chose</v>

1955
01:18:06.801 --> 01:18:11.801
<v Speaker 1>not to buy insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you can stay on your parent's </v>

1956
01:18:11.801 --> 01:18:11.801
<v Speaker 1>insurance till 26.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1957
01:18:11.801 --> 01:18:15.581
<v Speaker 1>We bought some votes because you talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them and they're getting more </v>

1958
01:18:15.581 --> 01:18:18.131
<v Speaker 1>affordable insurance now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now the play is we're going to take </v>

1959
01:18:18.131 --> 01:18:18.131
<v Speaker 1>all these people off of insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1960
01:18:18.131 --> 01:18:19.340
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking about that victimized </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

1961
01:18:19.341 --> 01:18:24.341
<v Speaker 1>People who didn't buy insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about the people who have seen </v>

1962
01:18:24.341 --> 01:18:24.341
<v Speaker 1>their premiums go up?</v>

1963
01:18:24.341 --> 01:18:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Hardworking Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty something percent,</v>

1964
01:18:25.491 --> 01:18:28.610
<v Speaker 1>24 percent on average in certain states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty six percent,</v>

1965
01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:30.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes 60 something percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>premiums have gone up.</v>

1966
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramifications of the everyday Americans </v>

1967
01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:39.190
<v Speaker 1>who now can no longer afford healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance and don't qualify for a </v>

1968
01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:41.180
<v Speaker 1>government subsidy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the trend,</v>

1969
01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I will argue this and I'll dig my heels </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I feel I have to,</v>

1970
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:49.350
<v Speaker 1>the political left seeks to divide and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquer and find for sure the most </v>

1971
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:52.130
<v Speaker 1>victimized group of that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>W W how so?</v>

1972
01:18:52.131 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean the most most </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimized group of that day to do what?</v>

1973
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1974
01:18:56.001 --> 01:18:57.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now for example,</v>

1975
01:18:57.261 --> 01:18:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm just using that as an example </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you said a concrete example with</v>

1976
01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:04.810
<v Speaker 1>obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now it's these people aren't </v>

1977
01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:04.810
<v Speaker 1>gonna be able to afford insurance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1978
01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:08.171
<v Speaker 1>there are times people cycle too far </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from unions because you were way </v>

1979
01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:09.880
<v Speaker 1>out into the obamacare pool.</v>

1980
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1981
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 1>because we were talking about that deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>and long.</v>

1982
01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:12.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no it's not.</v>

1983
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.920
<v Speaker 1>It's really not obamacare's subsidized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically healthcare sub costs of </v>

1984
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.100
<v Speaker 1>other taxpayers who couldn't afford it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they can't afford to live.</v>

1985
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's start from the beginning because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you went way out there and you started </v>

1986
01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:28.280
<v Speaker 1>out with the CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went out there and have Alex Jones and</v>

1987
01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Speaker 1>I went out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you went out there in terms of you </v>

1988
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:35.621
<v Speaker 1>covered so many different things before </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody could address either one of </v>

1989
01:19:35.621 --> 01:19:35.930
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to like slow down and like take</v>

1990
01:19:35.931 --> 01:19:40.931
<v Speaker 1>it point by point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said that this guy makes so much </v>

1991
01:19:40.931 --> 01:19:41.930
<v Speaker 1>money that if everybody gave him 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks,</v>

1992
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.900
<v Speaker 1>like why should they give him 10 bucks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

1993
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:50.140
<v Speaker 1>like what is this guy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Single biggest employer of people in </v>

1994
01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:50.840
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a guy who works for them.</v>

1995
01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:53.570
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even own it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this guy makes so much money?</v>

1996
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he shouldn't.</v>

1997
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:59.000
<v Speaker 1>He should make that much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why defend that?</v>

1998
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Why defend that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

1999
01:20:00.561 --> 01:20:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Why not have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's like,</v>

2000
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.670
<v Speaker 1>can I get a raise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say no.</v>

2001
01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And he'd go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy makes $15,000,000</v>

2002
01:20:07.531 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 1>a year and it doesn't</v>

2003
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.690
<v Speaker 2>even work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he do?</v>

2004
01:20:09.691 --> 01:20:11.390
<v Speaker 2>He sits behind there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of punches.</v>

2005
01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.500
<v Speaker 2>What you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot of assumptions.</v>

2006
01:20:13.501 --> 01:20:15.990
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does that guy make that much money?</v>

2007
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:17.060
<v Speaker 2>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

2008
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:22.830
<v Speaker 2>who sees this factory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This gutters need to have a real job </v>

2009
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:23.880
<v Speaker 2>that's much driven around a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>limousine.</v>

2010
01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.280
<v Speaker 2>He gets $50 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't get a raise.</v>

2011
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.930
<v Speaker 2>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2012
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.810
<v Speaker 2>you can just tell them this is too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think,</v>

2013
01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:33.690
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that guy really does make that amount</v>

2014
01:20:33.691 --> 01:20:38.691
<v Speaker 2>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably like how the fuck am I </v>

2015
01:20:38.691 --> 01:20:40.220
<v Speaker 2>pulling and extracting numbers from some</v>
<v Speaker 2>system by his choice thing.</v>

2016
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:45.230
<v Speaker 2>So at all ones and Zeros and moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>things around and making sure that </v>

2017
01:20:45.230 --> 01:20:48.261
<v Speaker 2>profit margin trees and he gets a piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that and he just live in like a </v>

2018
01:20:48.261 --> 01:20:51.921
<v Speaker 2>fucking baller on a yacht,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a golden bikini with a bottle of Dom </v>

2019
01:20:51.921 --> 01:20:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Perignon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cross dresser now,</v>

2020
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:57.050
<v Speaker 2>and seven fun is fucking gold.</v>

2021
01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Made $15,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

2022
01:20:58.741 --> 01:21:03.741
<v Speaker 2>You can do whatever the fuck he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's there's room for debate as </v>

2023
01:21:03.741 --> 01:21:08.691
<v Speaker 2>to what a job is worth and good job on </v>
<v Speaker 2>my show of having people on or disagree </v>

2024
01:21:09.061 --> 01:21:11.930
<v Speaker 2>in engaging in those debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't just say here,</v>

2025
01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:14.540
<v Speaker 2>just about this subject right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's.</v>

2026
01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.320
<v Speaker 2>How do I make an assumption there's room</v>
<v Speaker 2>to soon how much a job is worth.</v>

2027
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is room to debate,</v>

2028
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:25.430
<v Speaker 2>so if determined by the value of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>company and the services rendered not </v>

2029
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:27.180
<v Speaker 2>some arbitrary number because Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanders throws out a percentage point,</v>

2030
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.220
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not saying that he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

2031
01:21:29.221 --> 01:21:32.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's totally within the interest</v>

2032
01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:37.191
<v Speaker 2>of all the people that work for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>company that are critical to this </v>

2033
01:21:37.191 --> 01:21:37.740
<v Speaker 2>company actually working to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2034
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:39.150
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much should we get for this?</v>

2035
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:40.170
<v Speaker 2>How much do they get?</v>

2036
01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one guy's getting $15,</v>

2037
01:21:41.821 --> 01:21:46.821
<v Speaker 2>million bucks and the other guys getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>$15 an hour and you got to like this </v>

2038
01:21:46.821 --> 01:21:47.400
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this guy doesn't work,</v>

2039
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:49.620
<v Speaker 2>this guy doesn't get any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people have to work.</v>

2040
01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:54.650
<v Speaker 2>If they didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CEO would make $0 because there </v>

2041
01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:55.170
<v Speaker 2>would be no profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone has to work.</v>

2042
01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.440
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it's outside the realm </v>
<v Speaker 2>of rational discourse to discuss how </v>

2043
01:22:00.781 --> 01:22:03.240
<v Speaker 2>much a person should make to be a CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2044
01:22:03.241 --> 01:22:05.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational discourse.</v>

2045
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think people are wrong when they </v>

2046
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.490
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2047
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500
<v Speaker 2>to to take your argument how much a CEO </v>
<v Speaker 2>should make.</v>

2048
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be to determine that.</v>

2049
01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should either.</v>

2050
01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:18.441
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you'd be able to say $15 </v>

2051
01:22:18.441 --> 01:22:18.441
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2052
01:22:18.441 --> 01:22:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I think if somebody is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some super baller,</v>

2053
01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:24.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking steve jobs type character comes </v>

2054
01:22:24.650 --> 01:22:27.831
<v Speaker 2>in and starts running a company and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden it goes blockbuster through </v>

2055
01:22:27.831 --> 01:22:27.900
<v Speaker 2>the roof and becomes apple.</v>

2056
01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should be able to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy doesn't deserve way more money </v>

2057
01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 2>than the average person goes fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he does.</v>

2058
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:39.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is an obsessed genius who's </v>

2059
01:22:39.651 --> 01:22:39.651
<v Speaker 2>making this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2060
01:22:39.651 --> 01:22:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who does determine?</v>

2061
01:22:40.981 --> 01:22:45.981
<v Speaker 2>I think the market does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an interrelationship between </v>

2062
01:22:45.981 --> 01:22:46.230
<v Speaker 2>the people who are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Bernie Sanders point of view.</v>

2063
01:22:46.231 --> 01:22:51.231
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine the people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a say that people that are making </v>

2064
01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:56.811
<v Speaker 2>the least amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the easiest to replace and </v>

2065
01:22:56.811 --> 01:22:58.380
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones that are worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>being treated fairly well.</v>

2066
01:22:58.381 --> 01:22:59.160
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

2067
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart exactly what little I do and </v>

2068
01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:04.680
<v Speaker 2>that's where they get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say you're a conservative,</v>

2069
01:23:04.681 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 2>therefore you don't care about poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2070
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sleeping out of an 82 dots and </v>

2071
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:12.230
<v Speaker 2>when I first lived in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

2072
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I cared about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

2073
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I used to be in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to talk to those folks.</v>

2074
01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:23.930
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that they'll say is </v>

2075
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Attributed motive.</v>

2076
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.930
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we both met.</v>

2077
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I think you don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it.</v>

2078
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't attribute node of.</v>

2079
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't say will you do this because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate poor people when you do this </v>

2080
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.471
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you do have to look at the numbers </v>

2081
01:23:34.471 --> 01:23:34.471
<v Speaker 2>and you look at a certain point when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say they're underrepresented,</v>

2082
01:23:34.471 --> 01:23:34.870
<v Speaker 2>they have no voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2083
01:23:34.871 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 2>that's not true with union workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a huge voice if huge political</v>

2084
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.880
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people don't not have a voice.</v>

2085
01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Especially they have the payment </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

2086
01:23:42.521 --> 01:23:43.990
<v Speaker 2>They have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2087
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:46.930
<v Speaker 2>the entire music industry has been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far left for so long,</v>

2088
01:23:46.931 --> 01:23:48.630
<v Speaker 2>pushing for these same ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2089
01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:50.920
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those people are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty fuck.</v>

2090
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Kid Rock was just talking about how most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them are pretty far left.</v>

2091
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Country Music is not far left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're taking an extremely poor </v>

2092
01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.220
<v Speaker 2>country the fuck out of dodge to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>you remove country.</v>

2093
01:24:00.221 --> 01:24:02.230
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the biggest genres of music </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>

2094
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet they sell more fucking albums than</v>

2095
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:09.451
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His country going out there and making </v>

2096
01:24:09.451 --> 01:24:10.890
<v Speaker 2>redacted and lions for lambs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rendition and Avatar and all these.</v>

2097
01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.840
<v Speaker 2>These Suzanne Thai corporate screeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is,</v>

2098
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You his country.</v>

2099
01:24:15.811 --> 01:24:17.620

<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2100
01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Avatar.</v>

2102
01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:24.010
<v Speaker 2>The movie is possibly the biggest piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Neil environmentalist propaganda.</v>

2103
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:29.011
<v Speaker 2>You talking about Pizza Gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you son of a bitch is a fucking amazing </v>

2104
01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.600
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blue Aliens.</v>

2105
01:24:31.601 --> 01:24:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just out of boredom.</v>

2106
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 2>That guy fell in love with that blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>alien.</v>

2107
01:24:34.871 --> 01:24:35.920
<v Speaker 2>He became one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

2108
01:24:35.921 --> 01:24:40.921
<v Speaker 2>He was paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put them inside the blue alien </v>

2109
01:24:40.921 --> 01:24:42.991
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Cameron could buy an island in </v>

2110
01:24:42.991 --> 01:24:45.661
<v Speaker 2>paint people blue and have them run </v>
<v Speaker 2>around for the rest of his life if he </v>

2111
01:24:45.661 --> 01:24:48.151
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead he decides to print them out on </v>

2112
01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:48.940
<v Speaker 2>blu rays using petroleum products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a dope movie and you're a fucking</v>

2113
01:24:48.941 --> 01:24:49.570
<v Speaker 2>communist.</v>

2114
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Communist to fucking great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't enjoy it?</v>

2115
01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:55.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated it.</v>

2116
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a terrible dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Great.</v>

2117
01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Really fucking flying dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad Ass marines.</v>

2118
01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:04.840
<v Speaker 2>What else do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of a pussy am I talking to?</v>

2119
01:25:04.841 --> 01:25:07.090
<v Speaker 2>What happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been up in Michigan too long.</v>

2120
01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:09.310
<v Speaker 2>It's too cold in the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too cold in the winter.</v>

2121
01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Therefore I need to like Avatar for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

2122
01:25:11.661 --> 01:25:13.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't think straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to stay home.</v>

2123
01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:19.170
<v Speaker 2>You like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you actually like avatars that </v>

2124
01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:19.210
<v Speaker 2>can't wait for Avatar to really hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's underwater.</v>

2125
01:25:19.211 --> 01:25:22.990
<v Speaker 2>That even better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just stole that idea from Mario.</v>

2126
01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Level two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make it.</v>

2127
01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Cameron is a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the best directors of all </v>

2128
01:25:29.150 --> 01:25:29.530
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a classic.</v>

2129
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:31.990
<v Speaker 2>He's a great director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also political moron.</v>

2130
01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about his politics.</v>

2131
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.460
<v Speaker 2>He makes great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2132
01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:39.680
<v Speaker 2>The point I was making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about the media and </v>

2133
01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.260
<v Speaker 2>entertainment industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The backlash for someone who.</v>

2134
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:42.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even a huge supporter of Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

2135
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:47.791
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of us are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think we can be relatively </v>

2136
01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:47.791
<v Speaker 2>objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's remove country,</v>

2137
01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:49.160
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you turned on CNN or something?</v>

2138
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.980

<v Speaker 2>forced to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2170
01:26:57.771 --> 01:26:59.930
<v Speaker 2>He's just doing it because he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do something that helps people.</v>

2171
01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Plus you've got a dope Cadillac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen his Cadillac?</v>

2172
01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.640
<v Speaker 2>He had one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>West coast customs custom made Cadillac </v>

2173
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.320
<v Speaker 2>as the shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where he got damn impressive is that </v>

2174
01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.280
<v Speaker 2>they remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you got to touch it.</v>

2175
01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.440
<v Speaker 2>He started a beer company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called like bad ass American bad </v>

2176
01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:18.440
<v Speaker 2>ass or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beer.</v>

2177
01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I like kid rock there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said it.</v>

2178
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you like his music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just like wants to do.</v>

2179
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:23.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like some of his music is not bad.</v>

2180
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of his music is really not bad and </v>

2181
01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:28.360
<v Speaker 2>it's become popular to crap on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked them for that.</v>

2182
01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Cadillac is unabashedly friends with Ted</v>
<v Speaker 2>nugent.</v>

2183
01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Now you're still really into cars.</v>

2184
01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I love cars because I remember I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to your podcast when wants and </v>

2185
01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:40.271
<v Speaker 2>you said it's only to the point when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>make so much money that you no longer </v>

2186
01:27:40.271 --> 01:27:40.940
<v Speaker 2>care about money and you use your car as</v>
<v Speaker 2>an example.</v>

2187
01:27:40.941 --> 01:27:41.320
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2188
01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.370
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I cry,</v>

2189
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I got a dent or something in my car at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point would have lost my mind </v>

2190
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:48.320
<v Speaker 2>because that car man so much and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

2191
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:49.700
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a car.</v>

2192
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:53.420
<v Speaker 2>So that was a good point though that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>made that when you have enough money,</v>

2193
01:27:53.421 --> 01:27:55.460
<v Speaker 2>it's kind like it's what I call gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddhism.</v>

2194
01:27:55.750 --> 01:28:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of this is part of </v>

2195
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Buddhism that you should not be attached</v>
<v Speaker 2>to items.</v>

2196
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:04.460
<v Speaker 2>You should not be attached to objects </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

2197
01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:09.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine who became a </v>

2198
01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Buddhist monk and he wouldn't even have </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex anymore.</v>

2199
01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.820
<v Speaker 2>I gave up on sex all carnal pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All pleasure.</v>

2200
01:28:10.821 --> 01:28:15.821
<v Speaker 2>All attachment to women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attachment to relationships and the </v>

2201
01:28:15.821 --> 01:28:18.701
<v Speaker 2>ideas that you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to that because you are </v>

2202
01:28:18.701 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 2>connected to owns you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my take on that was okay,</v>

2203
01:28:21.650 --> 01:28:23.880
<v Speaker 2>but does it have to own you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2204
01:28:24.030 --> 01:28:27.590
<v Speaker 2>can you just enjoy automobiles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't you enjoy engineering?</v>

2205
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:29.930
<v Speaker 2>He said that you can't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2206
01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.300
<v Speaker 2>you can't own a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can possess a thing.</v>

2207
01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that is so ignorant of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that we live and it's so </v>

2208
01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:41.561
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pretend you're choosing to act in a </v>

2209
01:28:41.561 --> 01:28:44.741
<v Speaker 2>way that you're ignoring this amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological revolution that is going </v>

2210
01:28:46.101 --> 01:28:51.101
<v Speaker 2>on right before your eyes and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to fucking happen with you ride a </v>

2211
01:28:51.101 --> 01:28:53.650
<v Speaker 2>bike to work or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna happen.</v>

2212
01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:58.660
<v Speaker 2>It's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are a part of this cascade of </v>

2213
01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:03.311
<v Speaker 2>electronic progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of innovation and is never going to stop</v>

2214
01:29:03.631 --> 01:29:03.960
<v Speaker 2>and that's.</v>

2215
01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's tillie killer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want to go back to that point in </v>

2216
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:09.040
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2217
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.691
<v Speaker 2>that would be a good analogy out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>business because of iphone or we put </v>

2218
01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.620
<v Speaker 2>political arm that I want to talk cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're about that.</v>

2219
01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:18.750
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with appreciating </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that people make,</v>

2220
01:29:18.751 --> 01:29:21.180
<v Speaker 2>whether it's an automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a painting,</v>

2221
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:25.290
<v Speaker 2>a sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like cars are like.</v>

2222
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:30.790
<v Speaker 2>People look at them as just </v>
<v Speaker 2>transportation and I totally appreciate </v>

2223
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.900
<v Speaker 2>that because they have worked so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get a prius,</v>

2224
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:32.990
<v Speaker 2>it's just transportation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said they're works of art,</v>

2225
01:29:32.991 --> 01:29:37.991
<v Speaker 2>so if you get in 1969 Mustang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a goddamn marvel of time.</v>

2226
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:44.120
<v Speaker 2>It is a moment where people decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just create something that just looks </v>

2227
01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:48.660
<v Speaker 2>inherently like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like collectively bad ass.</v>

2228
01:29:48.661 --> 01:29:51.160
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one looks at a 69 mach one.</v>

2229
01:29:51.190 --> 01:29:52.530
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking gross.</v>

2230
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.330
<v Speaker 2>If you do fuck you with that is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do fuck you right.</v>

2231
01:29:57.331 --> 01:29:59.310
<v Speaker 2>If you look at a 69 Mustang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

2232
01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2233
01:30:00.211 --> 01:30:01.100
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2234
01:30:01.101 --> 01:30:06.101
<v Speaker 2>and that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a big irony that you're able </v>

2235
01:30:06.101 --> 01:30:08.571
<v Speaker 2>to appreciate it and not be attached to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because you've been more financially </v>

2236
01:30:08.571 --> 01:30:08.571
<v Speaker 2>successful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2237
01:30:08.571 --> 01:30:09.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2238
01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.370
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole point of this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2239
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not a rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal position take because most people</v>

2240
01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:18.510
<v Speaker 2>are behind the eight ball all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it always need to pay their bills.</v>

2241
01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Look at that car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look behind you,</v>

2242
01:30:19.921 --> 01:30:21.410
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2243
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the low cuts it in and now we talked </v>

2244
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:26.810
<v Speaker 2>about that earlier before you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>

2245
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:29.430
<v Speaker 2>It looks nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking amazing car man.</v>

2246
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:33.540
<v Speaker 2>That 1969 Mustang is a marvel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all came together.</v>

2247
01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just they figured it out.</v>

2248
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:40.790
<v Speaker 2>They just figured out some way to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that just is incredibly </v>

2249
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:43.800
<v Speaker 2>pleasing to your eyes and doubles as </v>
<v Speaker 2>transportation.</v>

2250
01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:45.000
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should get one right?</v>

2251
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:50.990
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a company that takes them and </v>

2252
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:50.990
<v Speaker 2>this is what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take the,</v>

2253
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:55.100
<v Speaker 2>the inside of it and the engine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff out and they put a 2000,</v>

2254
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:58.050
<v Speaker 2>12 shelby gt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 inside of it.</v>

2255
01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:02.160
<v Speaker 2>So you get like antilock brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get airbags,</v>

2256
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you get everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2257
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.120
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2258
01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.970
<v Speaker 2>they put it together and so that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to go.</v>

2259
01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:06.990
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2260
01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.880
<v Speaker 2>this was actually my experience with </v>
<v Speaker 2>very nice cars.</v>

2261
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.090
<v Speaker 2>I want to buy a car and I had very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little money.</v>

2262
01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:17.450
<v Speaker 2>So I went and I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a 2003 Ford Taurus with like </v>

2263
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:18.360
<v Speaker 2>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles on it and old guy had cataracts.</v>

2264
01:31:18.361 --> 01:31:20.700
<v Speaker 2>So they took away his license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can drive and like no,</v>

2265
01:31:20.701 --> 01:31:21.510
<v Speaker 2>they took away his license.</v>

2266
01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:24.630
<v Speaker 2>So I went in to buy this tourist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy took like four grand for it.</v>

2267
01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Not a great car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting you from point a to point </v>

2268
01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:29.890
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had to walk through cars.</v>

2269
01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:33.090
<v Speaker 2>One from George W dot Bush won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the singer,</v>

2270
01:31:33.091 --> 01:31:37.190
<v Speaker 2>and there was one that was the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>same model of car that James Dean.</v>

2271
01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:39.840
<v Speaker 2>He died and apparently they're only like</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 porsche spyder.</v>

2272
01:31:39.841 --> 01:31:40.730
<v Speaker 2>You had a poor spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2273
01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked through it.</v>

2274
01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Here's the crazy thing was this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let me,</v>

2275
01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:47.190
<v Speaker 2>let me finish with this guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling this whole 2003 tourists.</v>

2276
01:31:47.191 --> 01:31:48.840
<v Speaker 2>What are you a ghost?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what he drove,</v>

2277
01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what his business was?</v>

2278
01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:56.330
<v Speaker 2>His business was customizing cars like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that poor spider and doing high end </v>

2279
01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:57.900
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like George W dot Bush,</v>

2280
01:31:58.110 --> 01:32:03.110
<v Speaker 2>the nicest cars in the country and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove it 2003 Ford Taurus that I bought </v>

2281
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.110
<v Speaker 2>from him.</v>

2282
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:08.130
<v Speaker 2>It was the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just this surreal experience </v>

2283
01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:08.130
<v Speaker 2>walking through these cars that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't even want to touch,</v>

2284
01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:09.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to put a fingerprint on it.</v>

2285
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:11.930
<v Speaker 2>And this guy I found out later was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>multimillionaire.</v>

2286
01:32:11.931 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 2>He could afford any car that he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had 2003 tourists.</v>

2287
01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people do that because they want to</v>

2288
01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:19.770
<v Speaker 2>stay low key and they just want to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of chill man.</v>

2289
01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:20.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2290
01:32:20.441 --> 01:32:22.030
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely that.</v>

2291
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Like Henry rollins drives a Mazda six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He drives like a regular car and the </v>

2292
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 2>reason why he does it is because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

2293
01:32:29.141 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

2294
01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Henry wants to like sit in front of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic $200,000</v>

2295
01:32:33.611 --> 01:32:36.910
<v Speaker 2>speakers and listen to records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't care about his car.</v>

2296
01:32:36.911 --> 01:32:39.640
<v Speaker 2>So like for him it's like he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want a ball,</v>

2297
01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want to floss.</v>

2298
01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:43.600
<v Speaker 2>He wears the same t shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has like 100 gray tee shirts.</v>

2299
01:32:43.601 --> 01:32:45.040
<v Speaker 2>He wears the same thing every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2300
01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:50.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fascinating character in that </v>

2301
01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:50.400
<v Speaker 2>regard because he's a guy who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial means.</v>

2302
01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:54.811
<v Speaker 2>Like he has a very wealthy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he chooses not spending on things </v>

2303
01:32:54.811 --> 01:32:54.811
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2304
01:32:54.811 --> 01:32:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like my dad gave me this </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogy one time.</v>

2305
01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:58.720
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about cars or the ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>to appreciate it,</v>

2306
01:32:58.721 --> 01:33:00.280
<v Speaker 2>but you don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like air,</v>

2307
01:33:00.281 --> 01:33:05.281
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you all of a sudden you stopped </v>

2308
01:33:05.281 --> 01:33:05.281
<v Speaker 2>breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have air.</v>

2309
01:33:05.281 --> 01:33:05.281
<v Speaker 2>All you can think about is breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2310
01:33:05.281 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing that do just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do Jitsu for being suffocated by </v>

2311
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 2>300 pound guy inside control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2312
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 2>what's the same thing with money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take away the money,</v>

2313
01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:14.230
<v Speaker 2>all you can think about is money because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need money.</v>

2314
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.540
<v Speaker 2>And my point was like we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about earlier,</v>

2315
01:33:16.541 --> 01:33:21.541
<v Speaker 2>is we don't want people in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions determining exactly what I </v>

2316
01:33:21.541 --> 01:33:22.990
<v Speaker 2>have to do with my money personally.</v>

2317
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:28.470
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you get money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get this stress alleviation that's </v>

2318
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:29.440
<v Speaker 2>palpable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2319
01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:34.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's happened to you because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been really successful over the </v>

2320
01:33:34.441 --> 01:33:37.380
<v Speaker 2>last few years when you all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about whether or not you </v>

2321
01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:37.750
<v Speaker 2>could pay a gas bill this month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2322
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a different feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But until I was 25 years old,</v>

2323
01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:46.260
<v Speaker 2>every day of my life was checked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check everyday am I was barely mean </v>

2324
01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:47.080
<v Speaker 2>fucking barely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2325
01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:48.670
<v Speaker 2>lying to the landlord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent it.</v>

2326
01:33:48.671 --> 01:33:50.010
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2327
01:33:51.010 --> 01:33:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's who's been in that situation</v>

2328
01:33:53.891 --> 01:33:57.730
<v Speaker 2>where you're like literally wondering </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much can I spend today to eat,</v>

2329
01:33:58.090 --> 01:33:58.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've been,</v>

2330
01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been there and we all been there </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment I got a development deal way </v>

2331
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.660
<v Speaker 2>back in the day with Disney of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2332
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:08.170
<v Speaker 2>of all peoples on the Disney show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like either you're just there,</v>

2333
01:34:08.171 --> 01:34:09.760
<v Speaker 2>like he's a young good looking guy.</v>

2334
01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Let's put them into little stud muffin </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was young and they saw your set.</v>

2335
01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:13.870
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2336
01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:16.180
<v Speaker 2>I was boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty you wanting to be on TV.</v>

2337
01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it was,</v>

2338
01:34:17.371 --> 01:34:20.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1993 or something like that.</v>

2339
01:34:20.261 --> 01:34:23.890
<v Speaker 2>So I got a development deal because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>did an mtv half hour comedy hour.</v>

2340
01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I remember those shows do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did one episode of the MTV half hour </v>

2341
01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:30.430
<v Speaker 2>comedy hour and I got a development deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Disney because of it.</v>

2342
01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:34.400
<v Speaker 2>I got like this little thing and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent me some money and uh,</v>

2343
01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:39.600
<v Speaker 2>as soon as they sent me some money it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like literally like someone just </v>

2344
01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.130
<v Speaker 2>took a weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifted it,</v>

2345
01:34:40.131 --> 01:34:45.131
<v Speaker 2>like I was carrying around a weighted </v>
<v Speaker 2>backpack right my whole life and they </v>

2346
01:34:45.131 --> 01:34:47.410
<v Speaker 2>took it off and it wasn't enough money </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was wealthy,</v>

2347
01:34:47.411 --> 01:34:48.970
<v Speaker 2>where I could say I don't have to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2348
01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:51.880
<v Speaker 2>but it was enough money where I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to think about money for a year.</v>

2349
01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all of a sudden I was like,</v>

2350
01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:58.740
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what it feels like to not worry </v>

2351
01:34:58.740 --> 01:34:59.030
<v Speaker 2>about bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have never felt this before.</v>

2352
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:02.990
<v Speaker 2>And then I became obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining that position.</v>

2353
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Once you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2354
01:35:04.731 --> 01:35:06.250
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bulldog.</v>

2355
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

2356
01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now.</v>

2357
01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quitting anything will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2358
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I realized how important it is </v>

2359
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:19.670
<v Speaker 2>to not be dependent on anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not to not change.</v>

2360
01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Like here's the thing about looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about Hollywood and the </v>

2361
01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.210
<v Speaker 2>way people would behave in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in many ways,</v>

2362
01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:31.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a self in forcing ideology in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that someone like Meryl Streep </v>

2363
01:35:34.011 --> 01:35:39.011
<v Speaker 2>who gets up in front of the Golden </v>
<v Speaker 2>Globes or whatever the fuck it was and </v>

2364
01:35:39.011 --> 01:35:39.930
<v Speaker 2>says crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real art,</v>

2365
01:35:40.170 --> 01:35:44.300
<v Speaker 2>but when she's saying that what she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is she's like,</v>

2366
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:47.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a war cry for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the likeminded.</v>

2367
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2368
01:35:47.961 --> 01:35:51.090
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to say that and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other reason she's,</v>

2369
01:35:51.130 --> 01:35:56.130
<v Speaker 2>she wants to rally the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants to enforce her ideas and she </v>

2370
01:35:56.130 --> 01:35:58.940
<v Speaker 2>wants to make sure that everyone is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>board and the reason she said something,</v>

2371
01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.960
<v Speaker 2>she hollywood royalty because and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that she would say something </v>

2372
01:36:04.311 --> 01:36:09.311
<v Speaker 2>that stupid that was received the way it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was because she probably ran it by a </v>

2373
01:36:09.311 --> 01:36:09.650
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

2374
01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.720
<v Speaker 2>not that the point is not a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>person there.</v>

2375
01:36:11.721 --> 01:36:13.850
<v Speaker 2>They all roared and cheered them on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single person.</v>

2376
01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:15.260
<v Speaker 2>There it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2377
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Of course you're surrounded by people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2378
01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:21.920
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is that those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are reacting to that,</v>

2379
01:36:21.921 --> 01:36:25.520
<v Speaker 2>they may agree with it or they may feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have to agree with it.</v>

2380
01:36:25.521 --> 01:36:30.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever want to be the guy who </v>

2381
01:36:30.521 --> 01:36:30.521
<v Speaker 2>feels like he has to agree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2382
01:36:30.521 --> 01:36:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a weird way where like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents got.</v>

2383
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:38.680
<v Speaker 2>They broke up when I was really young </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we moved around a lot and I didn't </v>

2384
01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:42.110
<v Speaker 2>have roots like I didn't live in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>place until Massachusetts when I was 13.</v>

2385
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I lived there for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the first place I lived for a </v>

2386
01:36:47.410 --> 01:36:50.141
<v Speaker 2>long time and I got a chance to see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way people cling to ideas versus </v>

2387
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:58.270
<v Speaker 2>actually believe things and I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important to find out what you </v>

2388
01:36:58.270 --> 01:37:00.680
<v Speaker 2>actually believe and it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible in Hollywood.</v>

2389
01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in Hollywood people have to </v>

2390
01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:05.730
<v Speaker 2>audition for things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2391
01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:05.730
<v Speaker 2>and I've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2392
01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:10.121
<v Speaker 2>it's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go in this room and some person </v>

2393
01:37:10.121 --> 01:37:12.881
<v Speaker 2>looks at you and they have a clipboard </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're judging you and they have </v>

2394
01:37:12.881 --> 01:37:16.030
<v Speaker 2>power and the same with and unions can </v>
<v Speaker 2>control groups of people.</v>

2395
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:22.090
<v Speaker 2>The same thing can happen for really </v>
<v Speaker 2>self-righteous ideologues who happen to </v>

2396
01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:26.831
<v Speaker 2>be holding that clipboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then there's also the throwing out </v>

2397
01:37:26.831 --> 01:37:29.531
<v Speaker 2>the baby with the bathwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're calling anybody who has a </v>

2398
01:37:29.531 --> 01:37:31.511
<v Speaker 2>worldview and idealog and I do think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're susceptible if you don't </v>

2399
01:37:31.511 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 2>have a framework from which you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the world.</v>

2400
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.490
<v Speaker 2>If you have a prison where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2401
01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:36.490
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a hardcore Democrat,</v>

2402
01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.870
<v Speaker 2>do or die without any exceptions </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

2403
01:37:38.871 --> 01:37:40.490
<v Speaker 2>You're an ideologue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start going,</v>

2404
01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:45.700
<v Speaker 2>US versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of had conversations with people </v>

2405
01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:46.550
<v Speaker 2>in Hollywood where they've talked to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Democratic Party.</v>

2406
01:37:46.551 --> 01:37:48.740
<v Speaker 2>They'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to win the house when the house.</v>

2407
01:37:48.741 --> 01:37:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Then we get this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2408
01:37:49.391 --> 01:37:50.700
<v Speaker 2>what is this we man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2409
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:53.240
<v Speaker 2>you make a fucking cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have people who just go,</v>

2410
01:37:53.241 --> 01:37:54.340
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's left and right.</v>

2411
01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:55.440
<v Speaker 2>It's all same.</v>

2412
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

2413
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.800
<v Speaker 2>You do need to determine a prism through</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you see the world.</v>

2414
01:37:58.801 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very clear decision you make.</v>

2415
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Do I believe in choice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I believe in freedom and personal </v>

2416
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:09.441
<v Speaker 2>liberty or do I believe in equal </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcomes and that doesn't mean that you </v>

2417
01:38:09.441 --> 01:38:10.050
<v Speaker 2>line up with either party the same on </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single issue,</v>

2418
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.870
<v Speaker 2>but it is a filter through which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be able to see it.</v>

2419
01:38:13.871 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 2>She explained those options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2420
01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:20.980
<v Speaker 2>a good example right now you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it so someone has to make a </v>

2421
01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:22.170
<v Speaker 2>decision right now to one of the three </v>
<v Speaker 2>options that you said.</v>

2422
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:24.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put two options and what do I value?</v>

2423
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Virginal liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal liberty and choice,</v>

2424
01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And choice.</v>

2425
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:32.631
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do I value the idea of equal </v>

2426
01:38:32.631 --> 01:38:32.631
<v Speaker 2>outcomes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2427
01:38:32.631 --> 01:38:36.591
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equal outcomes is ridiculous because I </v>

2428
01:38:36.591 --> 01:38:37.140
<v Speaker 2>can't play basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't understand that unless you</v>

2429
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:38.640
<v Speaker 2>have some kind of of people don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2430
01:38:38.690 --> 01:38:40.140
<v Speaker 2>There's an ism there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

2431
01:38:40.141 --> 01:38:44.070
<v Speaker 2>The law that is in things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to play dodge ball.</v>

2432
01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:49.080
<v Speaker 2>The need to bring back dodge ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta realize stay away from that </v>

2433
01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:49.650
<v Speaker 2>big fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy throws that dodge ball.</v>

2434
01:38:49.651 --> 01:38:51.750
<v Speaker 2>It's going to hurt when the little kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets hit,</v>

2435
01:38:51.751 --> 01:38:56.751
<v Speaker 2>rush them through the Asian kid with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses that's reading them as soon as </v>

2436
01:38:57.811 --> 01:38:59.580
<v Speaker 2>the lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that kid's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2437
01:38:59.581 --> 01:39:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's from Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people didn't fuck with them since</v>

2438
01:39:01.831 --> 01:39:02.880
<v Speaker 2>it was little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty rare.</v>

2439
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Catch them outside of kick you in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

2440
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 2>How about that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>

2441
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.350
<v Speaker 2>That's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is there,</v>

2442
01:39:08.351 --> 01:39:10.590
<v Speaker 2>there is an ism and people don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shy away from saying,</v>

2443
01:39:10.591 --> 01:39:11.930
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have some.</v>

2444
01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:13.960
<v Speaker 2>There is an ism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by an ism?</v>

2445
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Ism where people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we're conservatism left ism,</v>

2446
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:20.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism.</v>

2447
01:39:20.730 --> 01:39:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody's ever said to act</v>
<v Speaker 2>as though well,</v>

2448
01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 2>because liberalism is the first person </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say leftism.</v>

2449
01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:28.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so at all.</v>

2450
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Been alive for 49 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never heard a single motherfucker say </v>

2451
01:39:33.650 --> 01:39:34.110
<v Speaker 2>left is well because today's left is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same as classical liberals.</v>

2452
01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:39.140
<v Speaker 2>The word leftism don't skirt the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be the first time anybody's </v>

2453
01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.590
<v Speaker 2>ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard of leftism?</v>

2454
01:39:42.490 --> 01:39:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll stick with it.</v>

2455
01:39:46.261 --> 01:39:51.261
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think liberalism describes the </v>

2456
01:39:51.261 --> 01:39:51.261
<v Speaker 2>current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the current progressive movement,</v>

2457
01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people want people to say,</v>

2458
01:39:52.921 --> 01:39:53.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2459
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a navy log.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well actually a lot of people,</v>

2460
01:39:55.870 --> 01:40:00.870
<v Speaker 2>they don't realize they are to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree and you just had to determine to </v>

2461
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:01.410
<v Speaker 2>which degree that is and recognize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>about yourself.</v>

2462
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has a leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2463
01:40:03.271 --> 01:40:04.830
<v Speaker 2>everyone has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it easier.</v>

2464
01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.050
<v Speaker 2>It makes it easier to get along if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribe to a predetermined set.</v>

2465
01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about this and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about that.</v>

2466
01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:13.800
<v Speaker 2>There's no predetermined set of values </v>
<v Speaker 2>or ideas.</v>

2467
01:40:13.801 --> 01:40:14.610
<v Speaker 2>If someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2468
01:40:14.970 --> 01:40:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at the world through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lens,</v>

2469
01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.560
<v Speaker 2>do I look through it where we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ensure fairness and equal outcomes?</v>

2470
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:26.661
<v Speaker 2>Or do I look through it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that people should be free </v>

2471
01:40:26.661 --> 01:40:28.671
<v Speaker 2>to make their own decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean you're subscribing to </v>

2472
01:40:28.671 --> 01:40:28.671
<v Speaker 2>the Republican Party when you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your first initial.</v>

2473
01:40:28.671 --> 01:40:32.630
<v Speaker 2>See what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were talking about really </v>

2474
01:40:32.630 --> 01:40:32.630
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I agree with you.</v>

2475
01:40:32.630 --> 01:40:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2476
01:40:32.630 --> 01:40:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what we should do see,</v>

2477
01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I think a big part of the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings today is that the,</v>

2478
01:40:43.890 --> 01:40:48.890
<v Speaker 2>it's not a fair hand of cards that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt and some want to pretend that it </v>

2479
01:40:48.991 --> 01:40:50.220
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2480
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:53.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just not and you know it and I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and we say,</v>

2481
01:40:53.351 --> 01:40:53.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2482
01:40:53.831 --> 01:40:55.510
<v Speaker 2>you've got to do the best with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got.</v>

2483
01:40:55.511 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2484
01:40:57.010 --> 01:41:02.010
<v Speaker 2>The real problem with that as the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that got to fucking ones those people </v>

2485
01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:03.790
<v Speaker 2>more than a prone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2486
01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:08.791
<v Speaker 2>because for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy with four aces just got Donald </v>

2487
01:41:08.791 --> 01:41:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Trump jr.</v>

2488
01:41:11.010 --> 01:41:14.380
<v Speaker 2>He was lucky motherfucker by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump jr is a very nice guy.</v>

2489
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:16.720
<v Speaker 2>He's a sportsman and a hunter and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's.</v>

2490
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like him.</v>

2491
01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:20.320
<v Speaker 2>He's my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean hunting advocate.</v>

2492
01:41:20.321 --> 01:41:21.820
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I only text him,</v>

2493

<v Speaker 2>but he's good buddies with and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to.</v>

2494
01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.100
<v Speaker 2>The forms are going to go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe rogan illuminati.</v>

2495
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump said it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said it before.</v>

2496
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:34.390
<v Speaker 2>They're very friendly guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've every single person that I know </v>

2497
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:35.260
<v Speaker 2>that it's come in contact with Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>

2498
01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Jr said he's a lovely man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing but good things about him.</v>

2499
01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:40.780
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He became more wealthy.</v>

2500
01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:45.810
<v Speaker 2>When you become more successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you find yourself being more </v>

2501
01:41:45.810 --> 01:41:45.810
<v Speaker 2>generous?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been a generous person,</v>

2502
01:41:45.810 --> 01:41:50.610
<v Speaker 2>but whenever I could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I realized the importance of </v>

2503
01:41:50.610 --> 01:41:54.631
<v Speaker 2>comradery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that because I didn't have a </v>

2504
01:41:54.631 --> 01:41:54.631
<v Speaker 2>lot of friends because it was constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving around,</v>

2505
01:41:54.631 --> 01:41:56.510
<v Speaker 2>so when I had friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've valued them greatly there.</v>

2506
01:41:56.530 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Speaker 2>They were not disposable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my friends to me,</v>

2507
01:41:59.130 --> 01:42:01.970
<v Speaker 2>like they are as important as my family </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2508
01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:03.970
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of my friends have lived with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2509
01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:05.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they'd been broke.</v>

2510
01:42:05.441 --> 01:42:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I like when I was single,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like tate live with me,</v>

2511
01:42:08.531 --> 01:42:10.210
<v Speaker 2>duck and live with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

2512
01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I got nowhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2513
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.820
<v Speaker 2>fuck you Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

2514
01:42:12.821 --> 01:42:15.460
<v Speaker 2>So money just amplify your character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn'T change it.</v>

2515
01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2516
01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:22.140
<v Speaker 2>it helped me help people right when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the opportunity to do something.</v>

2517
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see someone and they were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good friend and your,</v>

2518
01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:28.220
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a bounty of wealth,</v>

2519
01:42:28.221 --> 01:42:31.450
<v Speaker 2>like could say a good friend is hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have all this food.</v>

2520
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:34.330
<v Speaker 2>You would have to be some kind of piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit to say,</v>

2521
01:42:34.331 --> 01:42:37.810
<v Speaker 2>don't eat my food that I can never </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly all eat myself.</v>

2522
01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would want them to eat so you feel </v>

2523
01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:42.840
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that's who you are.</v>

2524
01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I will say gi Joe has been generous </v>

2525
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:49.140
<v Speaker 2>with what you've been generous with me </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sense of actually allowing me on </v>

2526
01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:50.950
<v Speaker 2>the show content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether people get mad about it or not,</v>

2527
01:42:50.951 --> 01:42:55.951
<v Speaker 2>and I appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is the money didn't </v>

2528
01:42:55.951 --> 01:42:55.951
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would amplify.</v>

2529
01:42:55.951 --> 01:42:55.951
<v Speaker 2>It's like alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It amplifies your character.</v>

2530
01:42:55.951 --> 01:42:56.830
<v Speaker 2>You're not a racist and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2531
01:42:56.831 --> 01:42:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it amplifies my character.</v>

2532
01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Amplified your character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2533
01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:03.220
<v Speaker 2>And so that's important people to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have.</v>

2534
01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:08.250
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take that and you believe that </v>

2535
01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:10.291
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a worldview that money doesn't </v>

2536
01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:10.291
<v Speaker 2>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can.</v>

2537
01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:10.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't inherently change who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2538
01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that you'll see just as many</v>
<v Speaker 2>greedy poor people as you will wealthy </v>

2539
01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:19.441
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's important because when we're </v>

2540
01:43:19.441 --> 01:43:20.380
<v Speaker 2>deciding on some arbitrary number and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>just tossed it to democracy,</v>

2541
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:25.560
<v Speaker 2>you can have just as many greedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>portions of the masses as you would big </v>

2542
01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:28.500
<v Speaker 2>bankers and they can just vote in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own self interest and that's not right </v>

2543
01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:28.500
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2544
01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:29.290
<v Speaker 2>WHat do you mean by an arbitrary number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liquid?</v>

2545
01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying what should a ceo make?</v>

2546
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the fair minimum wage,</v>

2547
01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:35.530
<v Speaker 2>and if you understand that there can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>people making less than minimum wage.</v>

2548
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Who if they got the joe rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made their break,</v>

2549
01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.200
<v Speaker 2>you worked really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden they have millions </v>

2550
01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.330
<v Speaker 2>of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just as greedy as they are </v>

2551
01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:45.330
<v Speaker 2>making $13 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2552
01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:45.520
<v Speaker 2>it's no at the human condition question </v>
<v Speaker 2>leah,</v>

2553
01:43:45.521 --> 01:43:50.521
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there are people that don't care </v>

2554
01:43:50.521 --> 01:43:50.521
<v Speaker 2>about other people's feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't matter what they make,</v>

2555
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.460
<v Speaker 2>but I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have kids?</v>

2556
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:53.450
<v Speaker 2>not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2557
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I would say to you as a parent that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big part of that was how they were </v>

2558
01:43:58.870 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 2>treated while they were developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>trend.</v>

2559
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 2>There's genetic variables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have illnesses,</v>

2560
01:44:04.761 --> 01:44:06.140
<v Speaker 2>mental illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's is,</v>

2561
01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:11.170
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of variables wheN it </v>

2562
01:44:11.170 --> 01:44:12.220
<v Speaker 2>comes to who is steven crowder at 29 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of age now?</v>

2563
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get to this point?</v>

2564
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Or who am I at 49 years of age?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did I get to this point?</v>

2565
01:44:17.211 --> 01:44:18.200
<v Speaker 2>40 nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 nIne.</v>

2566
01:44:18.610 --> 01:44:20.520
<v Speaker 2>Moisturize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2567
01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I was watching the day where you lifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kettlebell.</v>

2568
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.460
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a strong motherfucker,</v>

2569
01:44:26.250 --> 01:44:28.280
<v Speaker 2>although I probably didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did say tHat.</v>

2570
01:44:28.281 --> 01:44:29.210
<v Speaker 2>You said those exact words.</v>

2571
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2572
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:38.330
<v Speaker 2>He was talking to me about like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about 450 pounds,</v>

2573
01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:39.380
<v Speaker 2>like dead lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2574
01:44:39.381 --> 01:44:44.381
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not that much yet because you </v>

2575
01:44:44.381 --> 01:44:44.381
<v Speaker 2>think you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2576
01:44:44.381 --> 01:44:44.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2577
01:44:44.381 --> 01:44:44.381
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2578
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I had knee surgery recently and so for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2579
01:44:46.221 --> 01:44:51.221
<v Speaker 2>I know you went through the jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawbacks and then got back in and blew </v>

2580
01:44:51.221 --> 01:44:51.320
<v Speaker 2>your acl out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2581
01:44:51.321 --> 01:44:54.140
<v Speaker 2>actually I tore my lcl and the acl was </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly torn,</v>

2582
01:44:54.141 --> 01:44:59.141
<v Speaker 2>but they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the guy who does the surgery </v>

2583
01:44:59.141 --> 01:44:59.141
<v Speaker 2>and the redwings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came out.</v>

2584
01:44:59.141 --> 01:44:59.141
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you wrestle?</v>

2585
01:44:59.141 --> 01:44:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2586
01:44:59.541 --> 01:44:59.900
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2587
01:44:59.901 --> 01:45:03.500
<v Speaker 2>We rarely ever see an lcl that torn </v>
<v Speaker 2>without a blown acl.</v>

2588
01:45:03.501 --> 01:45:04.670
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you do anything with your ankle?</v>

2589
01:45:04.671 --> 01:45:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Was going towards your face guard pass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is they went in and they</v>

2590
01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:14.320
<v Speaker 2>fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't the real raw real </v>

2591
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:14.320
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

2592
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:14.320
<v Speaker 2>THe real problem is my kneecap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess whatever it is,</v>

2593
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:18.941
<v Speaker 2>the tissue that holds that in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone and they said it would be </v>

2594
01:45:18.941 --> 01:45:20.060
<v Speaker 2>easier if you had a torn acl to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we know what it is like with the</v>

2595
01:45:20.061 --> 01:45:21.320
<v Speaker 2>kneecap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it out,</v>

2596
01:45:21.321 --> 01:45:23.570
<v Speaker 2>do a replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really a vacatIon.</v>

2597
01:45:23.571 --> 01:45:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Kneecap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they saId.</v>

2598
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:30.250
<v Speaker 2>He basically said there's no reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything with a kneecap because we </v>

2599
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:30.250
<v Speaker 2>don't know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they replace it,</v>

2600
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:34.960
<v Speaker 2>replace it with an iron one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just start still rich franklin versus </v>

2601
01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:42.371
<v Speaker 2>anderson silva just rearrange this face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was so heartbreaking to watch.</v>

2602
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:47.720
<v Speaker 2>A lot of dudes were steel cups to tie </v>
<v Speaker 2>cups necessarily.</v>

2603
01:45:47.721 --> 01:45:49.580
<v Speaker 2>think there's a law against it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ufc.</v>

2604
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:53.120
<v Speaker 2>They started making laws against it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>brazilian jujitsu.</v>

2605
01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're talking to.</v>

2606
01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2607
01:45:56.690 --> 01:45:57.500
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal.</v>

2608
01:45:57.970 --> 01:45:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I had a buddy of mine did it to me once.</v>

2609
01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:02.840
<v Speaker 2>My friend amir ren have already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got on top.</v>

2610
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:04.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got on top of me,</v>

2611
01:46:04.131 --> 01:46:09.131
<v Speaker 2>mounted me and he had a steel cup on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was essentially fucking my solar </v>

2612
01:46:09.131 --> 01:46:12.750
<v Speaker 2>plexus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was totally uncomfortable because I'm</v>

2613
01:46:12.751 --> 01:46:13.160
<v Speaker 2>asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2614
01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:18.580
<v Speaker 2>it's metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have a metal piece and it </v>

2615
01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:21.520
<v Speaker 2>really affects armbars in particular it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It creates an unnatural fulcrum.</v>

2616
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a back take two is really uncomfortable.</v>

2617
01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going into your lower spine.</v>

2618
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Regular cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I use a diamond mma cup,</v>

2619
01:46:28.671 --> 01:46:30.830
<v Speaker 2>you know those aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are their compression shorts.</v>

2620
01:46:30.831 --> 01:46:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2621
01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:36.580
<v Speaker 2>they're in compression shorts and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of them is like this rubberized </v>

2622
01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:36.580
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2623
01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:40.820
<v Speaker 2>And the outside in the front is all like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really hard plastic.</v>

2624
01:46:40.821 --> 01:46:45.821
<v Speaker 2>Like they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's videos of them showing people </v>

2625
01:46:45.821 --> 01:46:46.820
<v Speaker 2>taking like full groin shots on purpose </v>
<v Speaker 2>when that was or advertisements.</v>

2626
01:46:46.821 --> 01:46:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I can kick the ball.</v>

2627
01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 2>It really does protect you in an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2628
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:54.510
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't hurt like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of those steel tie cups.</v>

2629
01:46:54.690 --> 01:46:58.500
<v Speaker 2>So these dudes are fucking real status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get these steel tie cup.</v>

2630
01:46:58.530 --> 01:47:00.610
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

2631
01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:03.090
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think kenny,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure if I'm a pretty closely.</v>

2633
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:12.470
<v Speaker 2>If you fucking mess up and you kicked </v>
<v Speaker 2>kenny florian and she couldn't break </v>

<v Speaker 2>I kicked kenny florian.</v>

2636
01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he doesn't wear it to the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about it in a cage.</v>

2637
01:47:19.901 --> 01:47:21.240
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a judgment.</v>

2638
01:47:21.241 --> 01:47:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judge kenny.</v>

2639
01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wears tight pants.</v>

2640
01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

2641
01:47:26.371 --> 01:47:29.670
<v Speaker 2>He's got a fucking compress it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The local dive.</v>

2642
01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Just no one that he's looking to impress</v>
<v Speaker 2>a married man.</v>

2643
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:37.310
<v Speaker 2>You son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were conservative and </v>

2644
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Florida and dare you go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take more tobacco.</v>

2645
01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Packard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn manson.</v>

2646
01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't ask that tip to kiss ass and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2647
01:47:42.631 --> 01:47:43.710
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe rogan so generous,</v>

2648
01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:47.010
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe in again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go with the of isms.</v>

2649
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Generally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a message to people that like </v>

2650
01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:52.090
<v Speaker 2>wonder whether they should be generous </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>

2651
01:47:52.230 --> 01:47:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Generosity makes you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2652
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:56.790
<v Speaker 2>It Just does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2653
01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:01.820
<v Speaker 2>it's not a selfish thing to like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that um,</v>

2654
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:06.600
<v Speaker 2>oR not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily not a selfish thing.</v>

2655
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:09.570
<v Speaker 2>This idea that to keep your money </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

2656
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.700
<v Speaker 2>you protectIng yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking out for number one,</v>

2657
01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2658
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the wrong way to think because when</v>

2659
01:48:16.501 --> 01:48:21.501
<v Speaker 2>you're generous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're generous to </v>

2660
01:48:21.501 --> 01:48:23.781
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super important that people who </v>

2661
01:48:23.781 --> 01:48:24.120
<v Speaker 2>actually love that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expressed that to those people.</v>

2662
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:27.450
<v Speaker 2>When you Do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good for you too.</v>

2663
01:48:27.570 --> 01:48:30.540
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem like it's good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you because people are so survival.</v>

2664
01:48:30.541 --> 01:48:35.541
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great book called who really </v>

2665
01:48:35.541 --> 01:48:35.541
<v Speaker 2>cares abouT famine mentality or brooks </v>
<v Speaker 2>or David Brooks,</v>

2666
01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:40.850
<v Speaker 2>but he went out kind of seeing who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who actually donate and who's generous </v>

2667
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:41.700
<v Speaker 2>and kind of going by political </v>
<v Speaker 2>persuasion,</v>

2668
01:48:41.701 --> 01:48:43.070
<v Speaker 2>by geographical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2669
01:48:43.071 --> 01:48:46.410
<v Speaker 2>by just let me guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are number one.</v>

2670
01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2671
01:48:47.941 --> 01:48:48.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2672
01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:52.350
<v Speaker 2>but especially litigious ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2673
01:48:52.650 --> 01:48:53.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2674
01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:57.120
<v Speaker 2>That is actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Michigan.</v>

2675
01:48:57.750 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a minister I mentioned in my home state,</v>

2676
01:49:00.781 --> 01:49:02.190
<v Speaker 2>especially with jihadists out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2677
01:49:02.191 --> 01:49:04.620
<v Speaker 2>you've seen the muslim videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2678
01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.570
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is the,</v>

2679
01:49:06.571 --> 01:49:08.790
<v Speaker 2>the ism and this is one thing that I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I do sincerely believe,</v>

2680
01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:10.440
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I don't shy away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2681
01:49:10.441 --> 01:49:11.400
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a conservative.</v>

2682
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.090
<v Speaker 2>You saId some that was pretty telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>you said because I really wanted to work</v>

2683
01:49:15.091 --> 01:49:15.270
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

2684
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to be beholden to someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2685
01:49:16.801 --> 01:49:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you made that decision.</v>

2686
01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew that if you did that and you </v>

2687
01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:25.461
<v Speaker 2>worked hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you wouldn't be holding someone </v>

2688
01:49:25.461 --> 01:49:25.461
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2689
01:49:25.461 --> 01:49:25.461
<v Speaker 2>that was the assumption you made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2690
01:49:25.461 --> 01:49:28.080
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just go with this real quick.</v>

2691
01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:30.450
<v Speaker 2>The assumption that that is free </v>
<v Speaker 2>enterprise,</v>

2692
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:32.640
<v Speaker 2>free enterprise or capitalism to use the</v>
<v Speaker 2>term,</v>

2693
01:49:32.641 --> 01:49:35.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can only work under the,</v>

2694
01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:39.300
<v Speaker 2>under an optimistic society under people</v>
<v Speaker 2>believing they can retire and do better.</v>

2695
01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:44.540
<v Speaker 2>socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collectivism can only operate by </v>

2696
01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:46.380
<v Speaker 2>appealing to people's most selfish </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature by appealing to people saying,</v>

2697
01:49:46.381 --> 01:49:48.760
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cards or the deck is stacked against</v>

2698
01:49:48.761 --> 01:49:49.930
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do this.</v>

2699
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:52.000
<v Speaker 2>There's someone else out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an ace in the hole.</v>

2700
01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.430
<v Speaker 2>You've been born without the leg up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>

2701
01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to help you.</v>

2702
01:49:55.930 --> 01:50:00.930
<v Speaker 2>That is the big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Capitalism can only survive and </v>

2703
01:50:00.930 --> 01:50:03.121
<v Speaker 2>optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's collectivism requires the worst </v>

2704
01:50:03.121 --> 01:50:04.270
<v Speaker 2>of human nature to sustain itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I believe that,</v>

2705
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:07.540
<v Speaker 2>but what wouldn't it be nicer if people </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

2706
01:50:07.690 --> 01:50:09.970
<v Speaker 2>If someone figured out a way to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2707
01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:15.780
<v Speaker 2>how much do you really need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of saying you have to do this </v>

2708
01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:17.320
<v Speaker 2>and put on their deals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like a nightmare.</v>

2709
01:50:17.370 --> 01:50:18.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I'm saying.</v>

2710
01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:23.730
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is can you contribute a </v>
<v Speaker 2>small amount that's not even going to </v>

2711
01:50:25.291 --> 01:50:30.291
<v Speaker 2>affect you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to help other people and </v>

2712
01:50:30.291 --> 01:50:31.810
<v Speaker 2>do you do that and if you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you do it?</v>

2713
01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you do it in the form of generosity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>like do tip waitresses more than you </v>

2714
01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.961
<v Speaker 2>should do you do it in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving out to charities that you feel </v>

2715
01:50:39.961 --> 01:50:44.101
<v Speaker 2>are very worthy and you know you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>researched them and you know the people </v>

2716
01:50:44.101 --> 01:50:44.101
<v Speaker 2>that are behind them.</v>

2717
01:50:44.101 --> 01:50:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Do you do It in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2718
01:50:45.941 --> 01:50:50.941
<v Speaker 2>a social work you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do it in terms of putting out </v>

2719
01:50:50.941 --> 01:50:54.330
<v Speaker 2>informational videos that help people </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how they can advance their </v>

2720
01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:56.460
<v Speaker 2>own lives?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all do in certain one.</v>

2721
01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I know you do too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certain charitable things amongst people</v>

2722
01:51:00.281 --> 01:51:05.281
<v Speaker 2>we care about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you address causes that you care </v>

2723
01:51:05.281 --> 01:51:08.221
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go out of your way in a non selfish </v>

2724
01:51:08.221 --> 01:51:10.591
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to eliminate certain things or or </v>

2725
01:51:10.591 --> 01:51:13.030
<v Speaker 2>add to the coffers of certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations that are doing.</v>

2726
01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good things.</v>

2727
01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that should be enforced more than </v>

2728
01:51:19.710 --> 01:51:19.960
<v Speaker 2>the idea that some people are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2729
01:51:20.110 --> 01:51:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2730
01:51:21.190 --> 01:51:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2731
01:51:21.571 --> 01:51:26.571
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you and that's again that </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea like you're talking about why are </v>

2732
01:51:26.571 --> 01:51:27.490
<v Speaker 2>you giving to this cause why are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you donating your time?</v>

2733
01:51:27.490 --> 01:51:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're either,</v>

2734
01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.620
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to either donating money </v>
<v Speaker 2>or time.</v>

2735
01:51:29.621 --> 01:51:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Really the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's some sort of material goods or time</v>

2736
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:35.260
<v Speaker 2>because you're doing it with the belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you'll help people.</v>

2737
01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.330
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work if you're being forced </v>
<v Speaker 2>to because you know,</v>

2738
01:51:37.331 --> 01:51:40.480
<v Speaker 2>there's some people that do it for a tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>break now that's silly.</v>

2739
01:51:41.410 --> 01:51:43.850
<v Speaker 2>No one gives away 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars to get a kidney.</v>

2740
01:51:43.851 --> 01:51:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Got $40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax break.</v>

2741
01:51:45.161 --> 01:51:46.540
<v Speaker 2>The math doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might have to.</v>

2742
01:51:46.541 --> 01:51:51.541
<v Speaker 2>If you run some fucking llc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have some weird shit llc.</v>

2743
01:51:51.701 --> 01:51:56.701
<v Speaker 2>Aren't you an llc?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I'm talking about the other </v>

2744
01:51:56.701 --> 01:51:57.550
<v Speaker 2>llc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some pipes.</v>

2745
01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Let's smoke a pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It smells amazing though,</v>

2746
01:52:01.670 --> 01:52:02.750
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

2747
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:04.290
<v Speaker 2>It really does smell good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's um,</v>

2748
01:52:04.450 --> 01:52:06.070
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely way better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>

2749
01:52:06.071 --> 01:52:09.010
<v Speaker 2>WhIch shows you how much the fda has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been fucking you.</v>

2750
01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:12.280
<v Speaker 2>well actually they've now pipes or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled tobacco product,</v>

2751
01:52:12.281 --> 01:52:17.281
<v Speaker 2>which they didn't use to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all the chemicals that are </v>

2752
01:52:17.281 --> 01:52:17.281
<v Speaker 2>actually added two cigarettes.</v>

2753
01:52:17.281 --> 01:52:17.950
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it hard to get?</v>

2754
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I have to show my id to get piped into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the underground.</v>

2755
01:52:20.111 --> 01:52:20.840
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2756
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:24.220
<v Speaker 2>because with pipe tobaccos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these local,</v>

2757
01:52:24.221 --> 01:52:29.221
<v Speaker 2>like a local tobacco shop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do their own blends so they'll </v>

2758
01:52:29.221 --> 01:52:32.191
<v Speaker 2>buy pipe tobacco in bulk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that sear sucker from someplace in </v>

2759
01:52:32.191 --> 01:52:33.130
<v Speaker 2>one of the carolinas and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing,</v>

2760
01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:36.010
<v Speaker 2>so it actually removes the artistry </v>
<v Speaker 2>where a lot of people like this is,</v>

2761
01:52:36.011 --> 01:52:37.690
<v Speaker 2>this is the blend I can get in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2762
01:52:37.691 --> 01:52:38.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holland,</v>

2763
01:52:38.381 --> 01:52:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get anywhere else.</v>

2764
01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:41.830
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going away.</v>

2765
01:52:41.831 --> 01:52:43.880
<v Speaker 2>And what that does fda steps in is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the,</v>

2766
01:52:43.881 --> 01:52:48.881
<v Speaker 2>do it favors the big boys who send out </v>
<v Speaker 2>their tendons from one centralized </v>

2767
01:52:48.881 --> 01:52:49.370
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smaller tobacconist can compete.</v>

2768
01:52:49.371 --> 01:52:51.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the worry about mariJuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2769
01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:52.210
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>

2770
01:52:52.211 --> 01:52:57.211
<v Speaker 2>it'll go legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need these dispensary's </v>

2771
01:52:57.211 --> 01:52:57.211
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2772
01:52:57.211 --> 01:52:57.211
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that kind of what will happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be out of business.</v>

2773
01:52:57.211 --> 01:52:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's problem.</v>

2774
01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it also people,</v>

2775
01:53:00.531 --> 01:53:05.531
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to possess it and it's okay to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell it or your friends can give you </v>

2776
01:53:05.531 --> 01:53:08.450
<v Speaker 2>some on satisfying we'd ever got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My yoga teacher gave it to me.</v>

2777
01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.400
<v Speaker 2>That sounds about right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

2778
01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Every time my wife goes in there tryna </v>
<v Speaker 2>give her some kind of weird incense or </v>

2779
01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:16.180
<v Speaker 2>newest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time she goes,</v>

2780
01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:17.030
<v Speaker 2>she goes into the pot store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga,</v>

2781
01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:19.280
<v Speaker 2>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always something they're selling</v>

2782
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.640
<v Speaker 2>essential oils and pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2783
01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:26.650
<v Speaker 2>not pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're always got something you </v>

2784
01:53:26.650 --> 01:53:26.650
<v Speaker 2>really want to put on incentives or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2785
01:53:26.650 --> 01:53:29.681
<v Speaker 2>There's this my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is you're beholden to the yoga </v>

2786
01:53:29.681 --> 01:53:29.681
<v Speaker 2>instructors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they use it sometimes.</v>

2787

<v Speaker 2>my yoga instructor pure and she's my </v>

2788
01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:33.380

<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck you right wing.</v>

2792
01:53:45.450 --> 01:53:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2793
01:53:46.201 --> 01:53:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I sit firmly in the flip flopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>position of the middle.</v>

2794
01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:52.220
<v Speaker 2>You don't though.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2797
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:57.770
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to get leftists guests </v>
<v Speaker 2>on our show.</v>

2798
01:53:57.771 --> 01:54:00.290
<v Speaker 2>That's just a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We try and book them.</v>

2799
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And then after a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2800
01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the most leftist guests you've ever</v>

<v Speaker 2>uk.</v>

2806
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:16.600

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2809
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:23.670

<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't come on.</v>

2817
01:54:40.690 --> 01:54:43.970
<v Speaker 2>The christopher titus debate was one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most painful ones I've ever watched.</v>

2818
01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Was it painful for you?</v>

2819
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:46.090
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2820
01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:51.180
<v Speaker 2>It Was because I felt as though I </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually do try and get into an </v>

2821
01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:52.490
<v Speaker 2>engagement of ideas and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming so much.</v>

2822
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:55.400
<v Speaker 2>It was more painful for me because I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>

01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:59.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2825
01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:06.170
<v Speaker 2>where he's arguing about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really doesn't know the facts.</v>

2826
01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

2827
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:12.380
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was when you were throwing out laws,</v>

2828
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:16.220
<v Speaker 2>regulations and he just didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

2829
01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:18.350
<v Speaker 2>I kept arguing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2830
01:55:18.351 --> 01:55:21.230
<v Speaker 2>when someone's arguing about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know exactly what they're</v>

2831
01:55:21.231 --> 01:55:21.970
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.420
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any facts at my disposal.</v>

2835
01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Instead of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kept arguing it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:55:54.631 --> 01:55:57.090
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't shy away from an emotive thing.</v>

2848
01:55:57.091 --> 01:55:57.650
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2849
01:55:57.690 --> 01:56:01.560
<v Speaker 1>it was a conversational debate ploy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he.</v>

2850
01:56:01.561 --> 01:56:06.561
<v Speaker 1>It was a crude debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's trying to box you into a </v>

2851
01:56:06.561 --> 01:56:09.891
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say this because I appreciate </v>

2852
01:56:09.891 --> 01:56:09.891
<v Speaker 1>christopher titus and we've talked off </v>
<v Speaker 1>air a nice guy.</v>

2853
01:56:09.891 --> 01:56:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Whereas someone like a Michael Woods </v>
<v Speaker 1>junior who refused to come on the show,</v>

2854
01:56:12.541 --> 01:56:15.840
<v Speaker 1>try to leverage coming on this show to </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate me is dishonest.</v>

2855
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:18.060
<v Speaker 1>And someone who's afraid or michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ian black,</v>

2856
01:56:18.370 --> 01:56:23.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who recently got into it with hopefully </v>

2857
01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:23.370
<v Speaker 1>he'll come on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of get there with him.</v>

2858
01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Literally I was on air and all he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

2859
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:27.210
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my video on rape culture.</v>

2860
01:56:27.211 --> 01:56:31.110
<v Speaker 1>You saw it with the lena dunham thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's one in four women are raped.</v>

2861
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:36.500
<v Speaker 1>And in the video I literally say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying rape is a horrible crime </v>

2862
01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:36.500
<v Speaker 1>and those people should be buried </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneath the train tracks.</v>

2863
01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2864
01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm also not apologizing for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally say that in the video.</v>

2865
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

2866
01:56:40.231 --> 01:56:45.231
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I get into the stats as to why </v>

2867
01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:45.231
<v Speaker 1>rape culture doesn't exist in United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States and it doesn't the middle east.</v>

2868
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:49.650
<v Speaker 1>So all michael ian black tweets out is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>portion of that video,</v>

2869
01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 1>a snippet that is not the statistics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I present a snippet that's a sketch</v>

2870
01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 1>cutaway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just tweets out,</v>

2871
01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:56.860
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the thing that a lot,</v>

2872
01:56:56.870 --> 01:57:00.380
<v Speaker 1>if someone sent that to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he got a clip clear,</v>

2873
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:01.790
<v Speaker 1>it goes further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just tweets out,</v>

2874
01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.220
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

2875
01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:03.150
<v Speaker 1>And this is a constant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2876
01:57:03.151 --> 01:57:08.151
<v Speaker 1>That often people who dIsagree with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically who identify as a left go </v>

2877
01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.230
<v Speaker 1>creditor doesn't think there's a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

2878
01:57:10.410 --> 01:57:12.180
<v Speaker 1>And so if they say it as though it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd enough,</v>

2879
01:57:12.210 --> 01:57:13.320
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2880
01:57:13.321 --> 01:57:14.730
<v Speaker 1>that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I say,</v>

2881
01:57:14.731 --> 01:57:16.260
<v Speaker 1>well hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me why I'm wrong.</v>

2882
01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2883
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:18.720
<v Speaker 1>come on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me why I'm wrong.</v>

2884
01:57:19.110 --> 01:57:19.680
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2885
01:57:19.681 --> 01:57:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to straight white guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>debating rape culture.</v>

2886
01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:27.291
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather you talk with someone who's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>victim of rape or a woman would have a </v>

2887
01:57:27.291 --> 01:57:27.291
<v Speaker 1>better handle on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

2888
01:57:27.291 --> 01:57:30.831
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about you talk with one of my two </v>

2889
01:57:30.831 --> 01:57:30.831
<v Speaker 1>head writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>casey or courtney?</v>

2890
01:57:30.831 --> 01:57:31.230
<v Speaker 1>They disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll be glad to debate it.</v>

2891
01:57:31.590 --> 01:57:32.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's going to go.</v>

2892
01:57:32.731 --> 01:57:37.731
<v Speaker 1>and then I had to call them out on air </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where he's agreed to come </v>

2893
01:57:37.731 --> 01:57:37.731
<v Speaker 1>on next thursday.</v>

2894
01:57:37.731 --> 01:57:38.850
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is,</v>

2895
01:57:39.150 --> 01:57:40.560
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is absurd.</v>

2896
01:57:40.561 --> 01:57:45.561
<v Speaker 1>Why is it absurd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me why it's I don't want to show </v>

2897
01:57:45.561 --> 01:57:45.561
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to ask,</v>

2898
01:57:45.561 --> 01:57:47.820
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>position today that we see on cable news</v>

2899
01:57:47.821 --> 01:57:52.821
<v Speaker 1>that we see from in this election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you particularly see from people </v>

2900
01:57:52.821 --> 01:57:54.840
<v Speaker 1>trying to silence dissent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the idea of as a white man,</v>

2901
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:57.360
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be able to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain thing.</v>

2902
01:57:57.540 --> 01:57:59.940
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to talk about bugs on</v>
<v Speaker 1>jupiter.</v>

2903
01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't fucking matter what your </v>

2904
01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:07.230
<v Speaker 1>sexual orientation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your gender is,</v>

2905
01:58:07.231 --> 01:58:10.500
<v Speaker 1>what your race is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to talk about things.</v>

2906
01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Just because you talk to somebody about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something doesn't mean you the premier </v>

2907
01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:18.120
<v Speaker 1>expert of it to the premier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your the premier expert of it.</v>

2908
01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:19.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to talk about things.</v>

2909
01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right and that's a silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a silly way whether do you plead </v>

2910
01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.620
<v Speaker 1>to the left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2911
01:58:26.670 --> 01:58:30.030
<v Speaker 1>it that that really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is,</v>

2912
01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:35.150
<v Speaker 1>is you're saying things that you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>people could possibly criticize you </v>

2913
01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:39.351
<v Speaker 1>about and you're cutting it off at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass before they're preposterous ideas </v>

2914
01:58:39.351 --> 01:58:41.060
<v Speaker 1>get to you and your twitter feed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2915
01:58:41.650 --> 01:58:42.310
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2916
01:58:42.311 --> 01:58:47.311
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you disagree with people on certain </v>

2917
01:58:47.311 --> 01:58:47.311
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not a coward ideologically.</v>

2918
01:58:47.311 --> 01:58:50.821
<v Speaker 1>I'm not about physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll allow people on who you </v>

2919
01:58:50.821 --> 01:58:50.890
<v Speaker 1>disagree with and you'll change your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and I definitely changed my mind.</v>

2920
01:58:50.891 --> 01:58:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not married to my ideas as much as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>get criticized for that.</v>

2921
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:54.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're.</v>

2922
01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I think you're pretty consistent in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think on the flip side,</v>

2923
01:58:57.670 --> 01:58:58.720
<v Speaker 1>what we try and do that I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2924
01:58:58.750 --> 01:58:59.560
<v Speaker 1>this is my bias.</v>

2925
01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.870
<v Speaker 1>This is what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your bIas on my body?</v>

2926
01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right wing.</v>

2927
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:04.270
<v Speaker 1>What do you sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to,</v>

2928
01:59:04.271 --> 01:59:05.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go god damn minute,</v>

2929
01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:10.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe I went too far down this road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I could just relax one aspect of my,</v>

2930
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:12.520
<v Speaker 1>my dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

2931
01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be my pipe smoking your pipe </v>

2932
01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:18.480
<v Speaker 1>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2933
01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2934
01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:23.221
<v Speaker 1>I probably wouldn't talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana issue that I wouldn't care </v>

2935
01:59:23.221 --> 01:59:26.970
<v Speaker 1>because here's the thIng,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about it one way or the </v>

2936
01:59:26.970 --> 01:59:27.800
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my issue with it is when he saw some</v>

2937
01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:28.870
<v Speaker 1>montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about it.</v>

2938
01:59:28.871 --> 01:59:33.871
<v Speaker 1>When people lie about it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonest with their voting </v>

2939
01:59:33.871 --> 01:59:33.871
<v Speaker 1>constituency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how so?</v>

2940
01:59:33.871 --> 01:59:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Well saying you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's medicine for abc or d and maybe </v>

2941
01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:38.760
<v Speaker 1>medicine for a but not for b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c or d.</v>

2942
01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the bs,</v>

2943
01:59:39.121 --> 01:59:40.090
<v Speaker 1>cs and ds.</v>

2944
01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:41.830
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's not medicine </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

2945
01:59:41.831 --> 01:59:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Well you're asking me what I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about and asking me to defend it.</v>

2946
01:59:44.590 --> 01:59:46.090
<v Speaker 1>The point is I don't really care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2947
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:47.750
<v Speaker 1>but what are the bcs and d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you,</v>

2948
01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:52.820
<v Speaker 1>you said the answer is has been shown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps with cancer,</v>

2949
01:59:52.871 --> 01:59:56.220
<v Speaker 1>about as much as tumeric and ginger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things helps anti inflammatories,</v>

2950
01:59:56.530 --> 02:00:00.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a prescriptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cbd has been shown to see tremendous,</v>

2951
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:03.790
<v Speaker 1>tremendous benefits for cancer and non </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive.</v>

2952
02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certainly with seizures,</v>

2953
02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I have zero problem with cbd cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but much of those little cannabis to.</v>

2954
02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel the need to call people out and </v>

2955
02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>bullshit when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2956
02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the reason it's not because of big </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies.</v>

2957
02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

2958
02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>There's seven patents on chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds from marijuana right now.</v>

2959
02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>The people who stand to make the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of marijuana legalization or </v>

2960
02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they make not true.</v>

2961
02:00:24.370 --> 02:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2962
02:00:24.761 --> 02:00:25.780
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the biggest supplement </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2963
02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:28.660
<v Speaker 1>but at the same pharmaceutical companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't pan the one.</v>

2964
02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've patented seven,</v>

2965
02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You leave terrains that gmos.</v>

2966
02:00:34.210 --> 02:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2967
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Seven active chemical compounds and pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been patented as drugs.</v>

2968
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>They've gone through the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one that's really effIcient.</v>

2969
02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>The point where you can't grow pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you stop someone if it's </v>

2970
02:00:46.110 --> 02:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if pot's legal,</v>

2971
02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>how would anyone and if they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the truth,</v>

2972
02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pot is recognized as a medicine,</v>

2973
02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If potus recognize there's no one who </v>

2974
02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>would stand to gain more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies by providing it</v>

2975
02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>as not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people allowed to fail.</v>

2976
02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarIly true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you that,</v>

2977
02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it's not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>true that the reason people can't smoke </v>

2978
02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>up is because big pharma is sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

2979
02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:07.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>martin correctly going,</v>

2980
02:01:07.670 --> 02:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make potty illegal.</v>

2981
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that's my only point,</v>

2982
02:01:10.751 --> 02:01:15.751
<v Speaker 1>but there are absolutely people who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobbied as we talked about how the </v>

2983
02:01:15.751 --> 02:01:18.610
<v Speaker 1>prison guard union has lobbied to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana illegal.</v>

2984
02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pharmaceutical companies have done the </v>

2985
02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was revealed in the wiki leaks.</v>

2986
02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Memo's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2987
02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.840
<v Speaker 1>this is what I was saying was told her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done interrupting you.</v>

2988
02:01:25.841 --> 02:01:30.841
<v Speaker 1>fuck where hillary clinton said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's against marijuana in every sense </v>

2989
02:01:30.841 --> 02:01:30.841
<v Speaker 1>of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2990
02:01:30.841 --> 02:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>You remember those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were pretty against it.</v>

2991
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>That came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2992
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Is he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he would leave it up to the </v>

2993
02:01:39.070 --> 02:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2994
02:01:39.070 --> 02:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach,</v>

2995
02:01:39.070 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but he's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to beef up the war</v>

2996
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.060
<v Speaker 2>on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

2997
02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:46.240
<v Speaker 2>I bet someone slipped him a pot cookie </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants and he looked at his hair in the </v>

2998
02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.960
<v Speaker 2>mirror and know he's a teetotaler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even drink vodka.</v>

2999
02:01:47.961 --> 02:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't drink Donald Trump ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he says he,</v>

3000
02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Colorado topped 1 billion in legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana sales in 2016.</v>

3001
02:01:56.630 --> 02:01:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Good holla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holla.</v>

3002
02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3003
02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:02.630
<v Speaker 2>but another thing that we just wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

3004
02:02:02.631 --> 02:02:04.310
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get mad with the weed issue.</v>

3005
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3006
02:02:04.941 --> 02:02:07.370
<v Speaker 2>A traffic fatalities regarding marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 2>have skyrocketed.</v>

3007
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Google that because that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No drunk driving arrest have dropped.</v>

3008
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:15.170
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you've what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

3009
02:02:15.171 --> 02:02:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I read about what the sources are </v>
<v Speaker 2>original.</v>

3010
02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Just because someone gets in an accident</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're high.</v>

3011
02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:22.370
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

3012
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3013
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.730
<v Speaker 2>no way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you stopped.</v>

3014
02:02:26.290 --> 02:02:27.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3015
02:02:27.130 --> 02:02:27.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3016
02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:28.760
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't talk about the graphs.</v>

3017
02:02:28.761 --> 02:02:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I make full points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people are high a lot,</v>

3018
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:36.440
<v Speaker 2>then the same amount of fatalities </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist,</v>

3019
02:02:36.710 --> 02:02:41.710
<v Speaker 2>but the people that get checked once </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get into these accidents happened </v>

3020
02:02:42.201 --> 02:02:42.950
<v Speaker 2>to be high.</v>

3021
02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:46.850
<v Speaker 2>It does not necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana causes fatalities.</v>

3022
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:52.030
<v Speaker 2>It could be that you have an increased </v>
<v Speaker 2>incidence of people doing marijuana and </v>

3023
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:53.690
<v Speaker 2>altercations that could not have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoided.</v>

3024
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be the statistical changes,</v>

3025
02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:59.990
<v Speaker 2>measurable will what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about In Colorado,</v>

3026
02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:05.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in states where it's been </v>

3027
02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:05.100
<v Speaker 2>decriminalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>

3028
02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.001
<v Speaker 2>It's Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up jamie and all the sudden you </v>

3029
02:03:07.001 --> 02:03:07.001
<v Speaker 2>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me make my point again.</v>

3030
02:03:07.001 --> 02:03:07.520
<v Speaker 2>My point is I don't care about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3031
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:08.090
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3032
02:03:08.091 --> 02:03:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't care about you sign up.</v>

3033
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:12.350
<v Speaker 2>You get so touchy about it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone says,</v>

3034
02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:13.460
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people want to smoke,</v>

3035
02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't really buy the arguments </v>

3036
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 2>that everyone is in some big conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try and sniff it out.</v>

3037
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:18.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't.</v>

3038
02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:22.010
<v Speaker 2>And the Idea that the drug war will end </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that it's,</v>

3039
02:03:22.011 --> 02:03:22.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cures cancer.</v>

3040
02:03:22.970 --> 02:03:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I just don't buy that and done so upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3041
02:03:25.311 --> 02:03:26.250
<v Speaker 2>we'll listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silence.</v>

3042
02:03:26.730 --> 02:03:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't studies have proven that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrinks tumors that it helps people with</v>

3043
02:03:30.291 --> 02:03:32.090
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much like tumeric law,</v>

3044
02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>much like any things that reduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and community tart cherry.</v>

3045
02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not necessarily a shit.</v>

3046
02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:42.110
<v Speaker 2>They're all legal and there's no issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not psychoactive,</v>

3047
02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are beneficial,</v>

3048
02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>so all these things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is one of the things that are </v>

3049
02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:49.040
<v Speaker 2>good and don't sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3050
02:03:49.041 --> 02:03:51.800
<v Speaker 2>just like you don't sure to merrick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't sure.</v>

3051
02:03:51.801 --> 02:03:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't sure a reduced sugar diet,</v>

3052
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:58.820
<v Speaker 2>all those things that reduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation or I don't buy that smoking</v>

3053
02:03:58.821 --> 02:04:03.821
<v Speaker 2>marijuana would be as beneficial as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced sugar diet and my point is that </v>

3054
02:04:03.821 --> 02:04:04.820
<v Speaker 2>people might so offended that and sing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to smoke,</v>

3055
02:04:04.821 --> 02:04:06.350
<v Speaker 2>go head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be correct and be offended.</v>

3056
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:11.350
<v Speaker 2>IT doesn't matter because it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking contest to see what's the most </v>

3057
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.350
<v Speaker 2>beneficial it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

3058
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:12.950
<v Speaker 2>is it beneficial and is it damaging?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3059
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:15.170
<v Speaker 2>It does matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that.</v>

3060
02:04:15.330 --> 02:04:15.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

3061
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:17.050
<v Speaker 2>let me finish my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does matter.</v>

3062
02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:18.410
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you not talk about?</v>

3063
02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I said probably pot because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>

3064
02:04:20.290 --> 02:04:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

3065
02:04:20.931 --> 02:04:25.931
<v Speaker 2>You would definitely think about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your eyes light up and all of a sudden </v>

3066
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:28.930
<v Speaker 2>krg and worldviews shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>

3067
02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:34.160
<v Speaker 2>You're going like a tractor beam on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most important issue of the day that I </v>

3068
02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:36.260
<v Speaker 2>said I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the guy that thinks people should</v>

3069
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>be able to do whatever your</v>

3070
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>market guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a free market guy,</v>

3071
02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>why wouLdn't you be in support of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

3072
02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:48.210
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the most beneficial or </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally beneficial,</v>

3073
02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but you're not necessarily because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're denying chemical compound.</v>

3074
02:04:53.290 --> 02:04:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Face your friends.</v>

3075
02:04:57.660 --> 02:05:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since marijuana legalization highway </v>

3076
02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:05.361
<v Speaker 1>fatalities in Colorado or at rehab and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing up the source that you want to </v>

3077
02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:07.440
<v Speaker 1>bring up the study right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3078
02:05:07.441 --> 02:05:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Washington post's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring up the study that we wrote.</v>

3079
02:05:08.941 --> 02:05:10.230
<v Speaker 1>We wrote about it on our website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3080
02:05:10.231 --> 02:05:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about your website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>

3081
02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Since marijuana legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Highway fatalities in Colorado since you</v>

3082
02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:23.300
<v Speaker 1>called me a fucking pussy and you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this with the crazy lady to comedy club.</v>

3083
02:05:23.630 --> 02:05:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You think if you scream enough that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it,</v>

3084
02:05:25.371 --> 02:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>but my point is I don't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just said it was interrupting.</v>

3085
02:05:28.951 --> 02:05:32.040
<v Speaker 1>You're interrupting screaming because </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't care about to put up a post,</v>

3086
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:33.770
<v Speaker 1>but I don't buy that.</v>

3087
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It's as valuable as a low sugar diet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that doesn't have to as value </v>

3088
02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:40.050
<v Speaker 1>can't have a conversation about this as </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilly as he did.</v>

3089
02:05:40.051 --> 02:05:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Every other issue tells me that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem.</v>

3090
02:05:43.370 --> 02:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>This is tnt powder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I get very defensive when people </v>

3091
02:05:48.631 --> 02:05:50.400
<v Speaker 1>start talking over me and you started at</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

3092
02:05:50.610 --> 02:05:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is that it's a low sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet is fine.</v>

3093
02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:57.570
<v Speaker 1>It's good too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is there a competition between a</v>

3094
02:05:57.571 --> 02:06:01.860
<v Speaker 1>low sugar diet and tumeric and marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cbd oil?</v>

3095
02:06:01.861 --> 02:06:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3096
02:06:02.730 --> 02:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Why does making the claim regarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>legality that it cures cancer.</v>

3097
02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>My only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My only point is the other ones are </v>

3098
02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:13.890
<v Speaker 1>already legally don't have to fight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones prescribing.</v>

3099
02:06:13.891 --> 02:06:16.080
<v Speaker 1>No ones dishing out a dispensary for </v>
<v Speaker 1>tumeric.</v>

3100
02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Ginger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They certainly are.</v>

3101
02:06:17.461 --> 02:06:20.520
<v Speaker 1>If you go to these local juice shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to these jews shops.</v>

3102
02:06:20.521 --> 02:06:25.200
<v Speaker 1>People are promoted with ginger tumeric </v>
<v Speaker 1>like crazy people couldn't care less.</v>

3103
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:27.150
<v Speaker 1>People want to smoke joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're An ideologue buddy.</v>

3104
02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an ideologue position by saying,</v>

3105
02:06:29.851 --> 02:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>leave it to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3106
02:06:30.831 --> 02:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3107
02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you're locked in man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3108
02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:36.360
<v Speaker 1>You locked deep into this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3109
02:06:36.630 --> 02:06:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I was raised in a socialist province </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bread is buttered buddy,</v>

3110
02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>a socialist province hand mirror over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in America.</v>

3111
02:06:45.130 --> 02:06:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Just as much of an immigrant is some </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude who sneaks over the wall.</v>

3112
02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Trump just built a porn in detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that remains to be seen.</v>

3113
02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It could be annexed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so horrible.</v>

3114
02:06:56.340 --> 02:07:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that thing where there is </v>

3115
02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:03.030
<v Speaker 1>a guy who is making a an urban farm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detroit?</v>

3116
02:07:03.150 --> 02:07:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very common in detroit now.</v>

3117
02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of the largest urban farm.</v>

3118
02:07:06.721 --> 02:07:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's bought up all this land and as he's</v>

3119
02:07:09.481 --> 02:07:13.830
<v Speaker 1>bought up all this land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taking these dilapidated houses.</v>

3120
02:07:13.831 --> 02:07:18.831
<v Speaker 1>They tear them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is building this farm really cheap land </v>

3121
02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:18.831
<v Speaker 1>and people are getting pissed off at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3122
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:21.750
<v Speaker 1>They're getting pissed off because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy now buys all this land.</v>

3123
02:07:21.751 --> 02:07:22.170
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3124
02:07:22.171 --> 02:07:27.171
<v Speaker 1>what about us and this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is weird thing that's going on </v>

3125
02:07:27.171 --> 02:07:30.531
<v Speaker 1>where people somehow or another mad at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was trying to do something </v>

3126
02:07:30.531 --> 02:07:31.020
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken on that story,</v>

3127
02:07:31.021 --> 02:07:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but urban farming was a real.</v>

3128
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>We wrote about that when we did this </v>
<v Speaker 1>report in detroit.</v>

3129
02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:40.381
<v Speaker 1>I was telling jamie about it beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a realtime right along because </v>

3130
02:07:40.381 --> 02:07:40.990
<v Speaker 1>people said we selectively edited the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst parts of detroit,</v>

3131
02:07:41.470 --> 02:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>so went back with my producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not gay yard.</v>

3132
02:07:43.031 --> 02:07:43.540
<v Speaker 1>We said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3133
02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:48.720
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start dead center </v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown detroit where all the hipsters </v>

3134
02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:48.720
<v Speaker 1>drink their coffee and talk about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being revived.</v>

3135
02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:50.890
<v Speaker 1>We will drive out in three different </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions.</v>

3136
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:53.920
<v Speaker 1>We put a gopro on top of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go pro in the car,</v>

3137
02:07:54.190 --> 02:07:57.880
<v Speaker 1>a mileage tab and a timer clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it never took more than about,</v>

3138
02:07:58.260 --> 02:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point nine miles out of the city to </v>

3139
02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>certain death and unbelievable urban </v>
<v Speaker 1>plight.</v>

3140
02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:08.070
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing about detroit is you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>see downtown detroit and then you look </v>

3141
02:08:08.070 --> 02:08:08.260
<v Speaker 1>to the left and it looks like the upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>peninsula.</v>

3142
02:08:08.261 --> 02:08:11.770
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so desolate and if I'm not mistaken</v>

3143
02:08:11.771 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 1>with that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was doing urban farming,</v>

3144
02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:19.680
<v Speaker 1>but there were some problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soil and so it was a guy who probably </v>

3145
02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:22.291
<v Speaker 1>found out he could make money if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>improved the soil and he got it down to </v>

3146
02:08:22.291 --> 02:08:24.871
<v Speaker 1>a system that was more efficient and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people didn't like that aspect of it </v>

3147
02:08:24.871 --> 02:08:25.750
<v Speaker 1>because now it's the big urban farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3148
02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:28.690
<v Speaker 1>They're always so wealthy guy who bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a lot of land.</v>

3149
02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a white guy and he bought it up</v>

3150
02:08:30.911 --> 02:08:31.780
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3151
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:36.840
<v Speaker 1>really urban area and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the buildings were all fucked up and </v>

3152
02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:40.741
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another people felt like </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody was encroaching in their </v>

3153
02:08:40.741 --> 02:08:40.741
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood that they had watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate.</v>

3154
02:08:41.330 --> 02:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>I know in there there's no one there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those names.</v>

3155
02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Some people were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is they felt like that </v>

3156
02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>should have been somehow or another part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their world,</v>

3157
02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:54.660
<v Speaker 1>which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird to think that you deserve </v>

3158
02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:57.511
<v Speaker 1>somethIng because that's where you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like we were talking earlier </v>

3159
02:08:57.511 --> 02:09:01.111
<v Speaker 1>about uber and all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change is a real part of being an </v>

3160
02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:05.100
<v Speaker 1>organism that lives on a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3161
02:09:05.110 --> 02:09:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And whether it's changed because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

3162
02:09:07.241 --> 02:09:09.940
<v Speaker 1>like the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoreline changes,</v>

3163
02:09:09.941 --> 02:09:13.240
<v Speaker 1>the ocean rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tsunamis hit the coast,</v>

3164
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:16.240
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes changed the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What volcanoes,</v>

3165
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>whether it's that kind of change or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's economic change or whether </v>

3166
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:24.781
<v Speaker 1>it's technological change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be changed and if you </v>

3167
02:09:24.781 --> 02:09:25.360
<v Speaker 1>try to stop change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the wrong side of history.</v>

3168
02:09:25.361 --> 02:09:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotta try it.</v>

3169
02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:30.040
<v Speaker 1>It's eventually gonna overcome you.</v>

3170
02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3171
02:09:30.990 --> 02:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3172
02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:35.260
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my view is you should allow people to be</v>

3173
02:09:35.261 --> 02:09:38.650
<v Speaker 1>the change they seek as barack obama put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it shouldn't try to force change.</v>

3174
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:40.030
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live in a shitty neighborhood,</v>

3175
02:09:40.031 --> 02:09:44.140
<v Speaker 1>some dude wants a break down the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible houses and build a farm.</v>

3176
02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:46.570
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3177
02:09:46.571 --> 02:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3178
02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we did our video in detroit,</v>

3179
02:09:49.271 --> 02:09:52.000
<v Speaker 1>packs of wild dogs roaming the streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's real.</v>

3180
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

3181
02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:55.120
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've got fact checked on it because</v>

3182
02:09:55.121 --> 02:09:56.650
<v Speaker 1>we did a video on this where we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3183
02:09:56.651 --> 02:10:01.651
<v Speaker 1>packs of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I made a joke where I said </v>

3184
02:10:01.651 --> 02:10:01.651
<v Speaker 1>apparently there've been grizzly bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>sightings,</v>

3185
02:10:01.651 --> 02:10:03.610
<v Speaker 1>so hopefully this will be our next </v>
<v Speaker 1>national geographic specials.</v>

3186
02:10:03.611 --> 02:10:05.620
<v Speaker 1>So That doesn't bear sightings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3187
02:10:05.650 --> 02:10:07.970
<v Speaker 1>But I got fact checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was back then.</v>

3188
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if it was snopes or </v>

3189
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's saying.</v>

3190
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Steven crowder made the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears were in detroit.</v>

3191
02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Facts check reveals that only black </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears have been sitting there like,</v>

3192
02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:22.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should fact check them because blue </v>

3193
02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:23.650
<v Speaker 1>black bears are more lIkely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory on human beings.</v>

3194
02:10:23.651 --> 02:10:28.651
<v Speaker 1>Then grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is because of more common </v>

3195
02:10:28.651 --> 02:10:28.651
<v Speaker 1>interactions though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Statistically,</v>

3196
02:10:28.651 --> 02:10:28.651
<v Speaker 1>you're very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

3197
02:10:28.651 --> 02:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like sharks that occurs in three </v>

3198
02:10:33.150 --> 02:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>to four feet of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where people are swimming.</v>

3199
02:10:33.150 --> 02:10:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3200
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:37.100
<v Speaker 1>but that is the case with grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly bears are way more aggressive,</v>

3201
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.600
<v Speaker 1>but they don't necessarily associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings with food.</v>

3202
02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Are you supposed to play dead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are run wIth a grizzly bear?</v>

3203
02:10:43.791 --> 02:10:44.710
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

3204
02:10:44.730 --> 02:10:47.570
<v Speaker 1>It depends entirely on why the grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears attacking you.</v>

3205
02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:53.440
<v Speaker 1>The reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a grizzly bear is attacking you </v>

3206
02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:54.800
<v Speaker 1>because she's with her cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're better off playing dead.</v>

3207
02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:57.740
<v Speaker 1>You're better off covering up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>texting your vitals,</v>

3208
02:10:57.741 --> 02:11:02.741
<v Speaker 1>getting the turtle position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and taking your beatings and she's your </v>

3209
02:11:02.741 --> 02:11:02.741
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye.</v>

3210
02:11:02.741 --> 02:11:06.070
<v Speaker 1>She's gonna fuck you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she might leave you alone if you </v>

3211
02:11:06.070 --> 02:11:06.070
<v Speaker 1>just lay still and then she feels like </v>
<v Speaker 1>she can run away.</v>

3212
02:11:06.070 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>She's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you up.</v>

3213
02:11:06.771 --> 02:11:09.050
<v Speaker 1>No matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to incapacitate you,</v>

3214
02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:14.230
<v Speaker 1>but if an old male or a predatory male </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has killed another human being and </v>

3215
02:11:15.981 --> 02:11:20.981
<v Speaker 1>recognize as human beings is food that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has happened before where hikers have </v>

3216
02:11:20.981 --> 02:11:25.751
<v Speaker 1>disappeared and hikers disappear all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to the tune of hundreds of people </v>

3217
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:32.410
<v Speaker 1>every year just vanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that actually polar bears will </v>

3218
02:11:32.410 --> 02:11:32.750
<v Speaker 1>stalk people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3219
02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:36.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polar bears or completely predatory,</v>

3220
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:38.870
<v Speaker 1>which means they don't eat any </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetation.</v>

3221
02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:41.620
<v Speaker 1>You can get lucky with grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3222
02:11:41.621 --> 02:11:46.621
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly bears can have a fucking field </v>
<v Speaker 1>of blueberries and they don't want to </v>

3223
02:11:46.621 --> 02:11:48.020
<v Speaker 1>have anything to do with you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>blueberries are delicious.</v>

3224
02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>They don't run and they Could just sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and eat and they don't have any </v>

3225
02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>hunger pangs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3226
02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many blueberries would it take?</v>

3227
02:11:54.081 --> 02:11:54.940
<v Speaker 1>The feet of grizzlies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3228
02:11:54.941 --> 02:11:56.570
<v Speaker 1>does she know you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>

3229
02:11:56.571 --> 02:12:00.050
<v Speaker 1>like a mountain side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the spring or in the fall,</v>

3230
02:12:00.051 --> 02:12:02.990
<v Speaker 1>rather like before they go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>hibernation.</v>

3231
02:12:02.991 --> 02:12:07.991
<v Speaker 1>That'S what they primarily eat because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that sugar just gets like straight </v>

3232
02:12:07.991 --> 02:12:10.100
<v Speaker 1>into the fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their bodies and they store it up big,</v>

3233
02:12:10.101 --> 02:12:11.360
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat layers,</v>

3234
02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:17.080
<v Speaker 1>but an animal that has already killed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is where it becomes a real </v>

3235
02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:20.231
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that animals are evil or </v>

3236
02:12:20.231 --> 02:12:23.021
<v Speaker 1>animals like target people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's they recognize food sources that </v>

3237
02:12:23.181 --> 02:12:28.181
<v Speaker 1>they've already eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see those people who were </v>

3238
02:12:28.181 --> 02:12:28.181
<v Speaker 1>protesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were really mad.</v>

3239
02:12:28.181 --> 02:12:32.741
<v Speaker 1>The rangers that yellowstone park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're very strict that you cannot </v>

3240
02:12:32.741 --> 02:12:33.770
<v Speaker 1>feed the bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can then interact with them and what</v>

3241
02:12:33.771 --> 02:12:36.380
<v Speaker 1>they do is they had a bear that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily aggressive,</v>

3242
02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:41.720
<v Speaker 1>but they do this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was some specific instance </v>

3243
02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:41.720
<v Speaker 1>that piss people off.</v>

3244
02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't necessarily being aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but learn that people would throw food </v>

3245
02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're going,</v>

3246
02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:46.190
<v Speaker 1>well not only can we not have that bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

3247
02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but we can't have other bears seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bear as an example.</v>

3248
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:53.530
<v Speaker 1>So what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their first ep has taken the bear far </v>

3249
02:12:53.530 --> 02:12:53.530
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3250
02:12:53.530 --> 02:12:53.530
<v Speaker 1>somehow transporting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sedating them,</v>

3251
02:12:53.530 --> 02:12:56.880
<v Speaker 1>and if it comes back either a second or </v>
<v Speaker 1>third time they euthanized.</v>

3252
02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:58.940
<v Speaker 1>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of these people were furious.</v>

3253
02:12:58.941 --> 02:12:59.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3254
02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:04.200
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing this that the bears don't </v>

3255
02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:05.801
<v Speaker 1>become dependent on humans for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If euthanize one barrier that prevents </v>

3256
02:13:05.801 --> 02:13:07.790
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the they no longer can forage,</v>

3257
02:13:07.791 --> 02:13:12.791
<v Speaker 1>can hunt for themselves because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize these people are gonna throw us </v>

3258
02:13:12.791 --> 02:13:15.221
<v Speaker 1>a sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a great example of just </v>

3259
02:13:15.221 --> 02:13:17.800
<v Speaker 1>people not knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not being informed enough on an on an </v>

3260
02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:17.800
<v Speaker 1>issue and instead deciding to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>outraged.</v>

3261
02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about grizzly bears.</v>

3262
02:13:18.981 --> 02:13:22.550
<v Speaker 1>They assume the yellowstone rangers kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of have their crap together on it.</v>

3263
02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also like peta,</v>

3264
02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>people that don't want to admit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>peta kills thousands of cats and dogs </v>

3265
02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:30.590
<v Speaker 1>every year and their heads a diabetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>who uses insulin,</v>

3266
02:13:30.591 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>which came to courtesy of animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing,</v>

3267
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:35.970
<v Speaker 1>but she feels like that's okay because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a vegan,</v>

3268
02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:42.260
<v Speaker 1>she's skinny fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a great podcast that's </v>

3269
02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:45.321
<v Speaker 1>available right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most recent meat eater podcast with </v>

3270
02:13:45.321 --> 02:13:48.801
<v Speaker 1>steve rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he talks to a bear biologist who </v>

3271
02:13:48.801 --> 02:13:50.670
<v Speaker 1>discusses the history of yellowstone at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one point in time,</v>

3272
02:13:51.090 --> 02:13:56.090
<v Speaker 1>the dumps where people in restaurants </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to dump all their food was places </v>

3273
02:13:56.090 --> 02:13:58.380
<v Speaker 1>where people would go to watch to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

3274
02:13:58.381 --> 02:14:00.530
<v Speaker 1>We Did it at a campground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like,</v>

3275
02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:01.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what year was this?</v>

3276
02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

3277
02:14:03.370 --> 02:14:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Where were you not in yellowstone?</v>

3278
02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:06.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't Canada.</v>

3279
02:14:06.150 --> 02:14:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd already made it illegal in </v>

3280
02:14:11.150 --> 02:14:11.150
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone I barriers when we went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just drove by.</v>

3281
02:14:11.150 --> 02:14:11.150
<v Speaker 1>There was no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

3282
02:14:11.150 --> 02:14:12.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go down under this area,</v>

3283
02:14:12.211 --> 02:14:15.220
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to see the bears foraging thing.</v>

3284
02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:20.280
<v Speaker 1>In yelloWstone it was one of the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mortality,</v>

3285
02:14:21.271 --> 02:14:26.271
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at mortality events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge mortality event because </v>

3286
02:14:26.271 --> 02:14:28.890
<v Speaker 1>they went cold Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stopped dumping all the trash there</v>

3287
02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:34.070
<v Speaker 1>and these bands had become acclimated so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much so that they had stopped learning </v>

3288
02:14:34.070 --> 02:14:37.310
<v Speaker 1>how to forage for food and bears died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like unmask.</v>

3289
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of crazy.</v>

3290
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:44.030
<v Speaker 1>That's also the flip side with a rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog where I tell people like we have a </v>

3291
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.250
<v Speaker 1>rescue dog and people get so offended </v>
<v Speaker 1>really say,</v>

3292
02:14:44.251 --> 02:14:47.340
<v Speaker 1>but if you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably better to go from a breeder,</v>

3293
02:14:47.341 --> 02:14:49.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for example,</v>

3294
02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:51.470
<v Speaker 1>hopper on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know,</v>

3295
02:14:51.471 --> 02:14:52.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what happened to me.</v>

3296
02:14:52.530 --> 02:14:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Happens to me the most affectIonate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loving dog that we've known,</v>

3297
02:14:55.650 --> 02:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>but a dog like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that starving can learn to become much </v>

3298
02:15:00.650 --> 02:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>more of a wild dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3299
02:15:00.650 --> 02:15:02.340
<v Speaker 1>that can be trained in them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're scared.</v>

3300
02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>They're scared and you bring them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

3301
02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:09.240
<v Speaker 1>he gets recall any gun ever since we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had him any handgun,</v>

3302
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:10.350
<v Speaker 1>rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull it out,</v>

3303
02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:12.870
<v Speaker 1>goes nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's seen guns.</v>

3304
02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:15.390
<v Speaker 1>He seen something in a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>connotation with guns.</v>

3305
02:15:15.690 --> 02:15:18.300
<v Speaker 1>You can't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you have some kid and he pulls out</v>

3306
02:15:18.301 --> 02:15:19.710
<v Speaker 1>a squirt gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's not aggressive.</v>

3307
02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:24.711
<v Speaker 1>He's just a bark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't like something and people </v>

3308
02:15:24.711 --> 02:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was to some animal </v>

3309
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>person got really mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3310
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>well there are so many dogs that need </v>
<v Speaker 1>homes going.</v>

3311
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've rescued a dog.</v>

3312
02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I think if you know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>handling,</v>

3313
02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:36.140
<v Speaker 1>you should if you're able,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have kids who don't have a </v>

3314
02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:36.480
<v Speaker 1>lot of dog training and you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>where this dogs come from,</v>

3315
02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I placed kids higher on the totem pole </v>
<v Speaker 1>than dog.</v>

3316
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A species.</v>

3317
02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:44.010
<v Speaker 1>A species is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a new thing.</v>

3318
02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:45.810
<v Speaker 1>It isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speciesism,</v>

3319
02:15:45.811 --> 02:15:47.250
<v Speaker 1>when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jamie,</v>

3320
02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.600
<v Speaker 1>you're younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a fiLm species where that </v>

3321
02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:52.600
<v Speaker 1>blonde chick that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which he go,</v>

3322
02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:53.700

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3323
02:15:53.701 --> 02:15:55.260
<v Speaker 1>She's probably doing softcore </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography.</v>

3324
02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:57.930
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's writing books.</v>

3325
02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the grid,</v>

3326
02:16:00.570 --> 02:16:05.570
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never thought of black bears as </v>

3327
02:16:05.570 --> 02:16:05.570
<v Speaker 1>being aggressive toward people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3328
02:16:05.570 --> 02:16:06.220
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rinella.</v>

3329
02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:11.240
<v Speaker 1>The same guy who has the podcast I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about told me a story of a guy </v>

3330
02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:13.470
<v Speaker 1>who went on his very first hunt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>while he was in his tent,</v>

3331
02:16:13.770 --> 02:16:17.130
<v Speaker 1>a 500 pound predatory grizzly bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked him.</v>

3332
02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:20.490
<v Speaker 1>His friend shot the bear and hit him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrist.</v>

3333
02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:22.560
<v Speaker 1>The bear takes off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the tent,</v>

3334
02:16:22.561 --> 02:16:26.400
<v Speaker 1>goes to another dude's 10 and they shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in that tent to kill it.</v>

3335
02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:29.620
<v Speaker 1>So everyone's covered in blood and hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't kill it.</v>

3336
02:16:29.650 --> 02:16:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed it,</v>

3337
02:16:30.401 --> 02:16:33.430
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the guy had a bullet wound in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wrist.</v>

3338
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:38.680
<v Speaker 1>He had been mauled by this bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is first hunting trip ever.</v>

3339
02:16:39.430 --> 02:16:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Could you see the reverend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3340
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Remember that there was a rumor before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that film came out that leonardo </v>

3341
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.910
<v Speaker 1>dicaprio gets raped by the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you read that?</v>

3342
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:50.830
<v Speaker 1>That was front page and are on the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

3343
02:16:50.890 --> 02:16:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It was frontpage at exactly the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>side and I remember thinking about that </v>

3344
02:16:56.201 --> 02:16:57.310
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it going.</v>

3345
02:16:57.670 --> 02:17:02.670
<v Speaker 1>This is an example of fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the right or the left is </v>

3346
02:17:02.670 --> 02:17:02.670
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is clearly not a bear rape scene,</v>

3347
02:17:02.670 --> 02:17:04.650
<v Speaker 1>but it was a huge rumor that was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>around because it don't.</v>

3348
02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:10.180

<v Speaker 1>The rep was in huge enough to reach mY </v>

3349
02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:10.180
<v Speaker 1>twitter page.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I told this story to chris leaving at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reverend reverend revenue revenue,</v>

3353
02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.650

<v Speaker 1>I swear this is true.</v>

3355
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And crystal even thought it was fake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake it.</v>

3356
02:17:24.611 --> 02:17:29.611
<v Speaker 1>So we're watching the revenant and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>right at that scene where he cauterizes </v>

<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>

02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:32.220
<v Speaker 1>So we're sitting there and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it and,</v>

3359
02:17:32.370 --> 02:17:34.900

<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

3371
02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:06.960
<v Speaker 1>The guy has vomit all over him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think someone who's sitting in front </v>

3372
02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:07.210
<v Speaker 1>of the bottom on the back of his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought for sure he had a seizure.</v>

3373
02:18:07.211 --> 02:18:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Turns out he'd fallen asleep and inhaled</v>
<v Speaker 1>a popcorn kernel [inaudible],</v>

3374
02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:16.680
<v Speaker 1>and he was just choking and then free </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and then aspirating on his own </v>

3375
02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:17.080
<v Speaker 1>vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're watching this film,</v>

3376
02:18:17.081 --> 02:18:22.081
<v Speaker 1>the revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most graphic scenes in </v>

3377
02:18:22.081 --> 02:18:23.650
<v Speaker 1>cinematic modern history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts and evidence.</v>

3378
02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:25.870
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3379

3381
02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.640
<v Speaker 1>He just fell asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cool story.</v>

3382
02:18:30.641 --> 02:18:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I've amassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a scene like a.</v>

3383

<v Speaker 1>They started projectile vomiting.</v>

3391
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:58.270

<v Speaker 1>It'd be way worse.</v>

02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:54.380
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like a flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pressurized.</v>

3412
02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because he was also holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mouth.</v>

3413
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:58.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's coming on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3414
02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:03.520
<v Speaker 1>like this where it's going to squirt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so was it when he fell asleep with a </v>

3415
02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:06.401
<v Speaker 1>popcorn kernel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mouth at the revenue in the middle </v>

3416
02:20:06.401 --> 02:20:07.400
<v Speaker 1>of that fucking really exciting movie in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of that scene.</v>

3417
02:20:07.401 --> 02:20:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Right where he's cauterizes the wound in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his neck.</v>

3418
02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad for them and I imagine that </v>

3419
02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:14.880
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that wasn't his wife that was,</v>

3420
02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:18.880
<v Speaker 1>wasn't as fiance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good chance theY're not </v>

3421
02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:20.741
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you think that movie was based on </v>

3422
02:20:20.741 --> 02:20:20.741
<v Speaker 1>real life events?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have no idea.</v>

3423
02:20:20.741 --> 02:20:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Was it supposedly but incorrectly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

3424
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much a sound check.</v>

3425
02:20:25.980 --> 02:20:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I think they already have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really didn't happen in an </v>

3426
02:20:30.980 --> 02:20:32.270
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything like the environment.</v>

3427
02:20:32.271 --> 02:20:37.271
<v Speaker 1>They filmed it in and they filmed it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this like tropical rain forest in </v>

3428
02:20:37.271 --> 02:20:38.990
<v Speaker 1>british columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy never had a son.</v>

3429
02:20:38.991 --> 02:20:41.480
<v Speaker 1>When leonardo dicaprio son is killed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>

3430
02:20:41.690 --> 02:20:44.030
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that was true it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy got mauled by a bear,</v>

3431
02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:44.840
<v Speaker 1>made it back to camp.</v>

3432
02:20:49.450 --> 02:20:52.040
<v Speaker 1>They left him for dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually survived.</v>

3433
02:20:52.041 --> 02:20:53.090
<v Speaker 1>You made it back to camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

3434
02:20:53.091 --> 02:20:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

3435
02:20:53.901 --> 02:20:54.530
<v Speaker 1>bro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was like,</v>

3436
02:20:54.531 --> 02:20:55.400
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were dead.</v>

3437
02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:57.140
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the movie.</v>

3438
02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:02.540
<v Speaker 1>But in the entire cast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caesar was the lead up to the bear </v>

3439
02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:03.530
<v Speaker 1>attack and it was him going back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing the guy left him behind.</v>

3440
02:21:03.531 --> 02:21:06.080
<v Speaker 1>You also killed his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No son,</v>

3441
02:21:06.081 --> 02:21:09.710
<v Speaker 1>nobody killed anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got fucked up by a bear and they left</v>

3442
02:21:09.711 --> 02:21:11.090
<v Speaker 1>him alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3443
02:21:11.091 --> 02:21:12.050
<v Speaker 1>When you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3444
02:21:12.051 --> 02:21:15.430
<v Speaker 1>you go back and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weston price,</v>

3445
02:21:15.470 --> 02:21:20.470
<v Speaker 1>not western price foundation for they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fermented cod liver oil and </v>

3446
02:21:20.470 --> 02:21:23.531
<v Speaker 1>stuff and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a big catalyst for like eating </v>

3447
02:21:23.531 --> 02:21:23.570
<v Speaker 1>real fats and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy claimed were this,</v>

3448
02:21:23.571 --> 02:21:28.010
<v Speaker 1>what does the weston a price foundation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're advert advocates,</v>

3449
02:21:28.011 --> 02:21:30.320
<v Speaker 1>traditional order along around for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

3450
02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy.</v>

3451
02:21:31.070 --> 02:21:32.820
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is weston price and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3452
02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:34.550
<v Speaker 1>because I always watched those movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the revenant and I go,</v>

3453
02:21:34.551 --> 02:21:37.100
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine how much it smelled or</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine what their teeth were like.</v>

3454
02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:40.950
<v Speaker 1>But this guy claimed he went down to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3455
02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:41.560
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3456
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:44.660
<v Speaker 1>third world sort of african nations </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they didn't brush their teeth,</v>

3457
02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:49.840
<v Speaker 1>but they had perfect smiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any claims it was because I don't know </v>

3458
02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:49.840
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's true at all,</v>

3459
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:55.090
<v Speaker 1>but he says it was because they ate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of organ meats that are gettIng a </v>

3460
02:21:55.090 --> 02:21:57.791
<v Speaker 1>lot of vitamin k natural vitamin d as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to kind of the sugary lifestyle </v>

3461
02:21:57.951 --> 02:22:00.770
<v Speaker 1>with refined carbohydrates in the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3462
02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a big part of this whole kind</v>

3463
02:22:03.201 --> 02:22:07.820
<v Speaker 1>of high saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon's a bone broths.</v>

3464
02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It's called the weston price foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember there were these pictures</v>

3465
02:22:12.231 --> 02:22:17.231
<v Speaker 1>side by side of people in the new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in largely grain fed diets and </v>

3466
02:22:17.231 --> 02:22:17.960
<v Speaker 1>these people who were basically third </v>
<v Speaker 1>world sort of tribesmen,</v>

3467
02:22:17.961 --> 02:22:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but that these beautiful white teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3468
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:24.830
<v Speaker 1>make sense in some ways that people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>live natural lives with natural foods </v>

3469
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:25.970
<v Speaker 1>without anything</v>

3470
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:28.320
<v Speaker 2>processed would be healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3471
02:22:28.321 --> 02:22:31.800
<v Speaker 2>but the teeth and they were a nice white</v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth look better for sure,</v>

3472
02:22:31.801 --> 02:22:34.500
<v Speaker 2>is definitely deteriorates your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>

3473
02:22:34.530 --> 02:22:39.530
<v Speaker 2>We know that should keep kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a lot of sugar and don't brush </v>

3474
02:22:39.530 --> 02:22:41.961
<v Speaker 2>their teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of that is also that </v>

3475
02:22:41.961 --> 02:22:43.731
<v Speaker 2>stuff getting caught in your gums and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your teeth and just not good causes </v>

3476
02:22:43.731 --> 02:22:45.180
<v Speaker 2>causes tooth decay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>

3477
02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the worst thing is a sugar free </v>

<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe 19 where companies are allowed </v>

3493
02:23:35.511 --> 02:23:38.070

<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3496
02:23:42.030 --> 02:23:42.930
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3497
02:23:42.931 --> 02:23:47.931
<v Speaker 2>you know why we use terrible for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the same environmental </v>

3498
02:23:47.931 --> 02:23:51.140
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who back then mcdonald's used beef </v>

3499
02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:51.140
<v Speaker 2>tallow fries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3500
02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:51.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3501
02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:53.660
<v Speaker 2>you need to be using vegetable oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrogenated vegetable oils.</v>

3502
02:23:53.661 --> 02:23:55.780
<v Speaker 2>So that was a bunch of lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3503
02:23:55.890 --> 02:23:57.840
<v Speaker 2>that's why we started eating trans fats </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they're going,</v>

3504
02:23:57.900 --> 02:24:02.250
<v Speaker 2>actually margarine is not as good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you as butter and they've changed,</v>

3505
02:24:02.251 --> 02:24:05.190
<v Speaker 2>but that was a huge powerful lobbying </v>
<v Speaker 2>group for the vegetarians.</v>

3506
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:07.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the san francisco kind of hippie era.</v>

3507
02:24:07.410 --> 02:24:09.750
<v Speaker 2>That's why trans fats became ubiquitous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3508
02:24:09.751 --> 02:24:14.751
<v Speaker 2>it was also a byproduct of the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry driving scientists to lie about</v>

3509
02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:20.630
<v Speaker 2>the beneficial qualities of their sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just pretended that sugar's </v>

3510
02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:25.590
<v Speaker 2>fine when you born with it saturated </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

3511
02:24:25.591 --> 02:24:27.300
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue and everybody wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3512
02:24:27.301 --> 02:24:28.750
<v Speaker 2>We got to get some margarine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3513
02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:33.780
<v Speaker 2>These people went out and bought margin </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it terrified of saturated fat </v>

3514
02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:36.740
<v Speaker 2>because the sugar companies had bribed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some scientists were that when we were </v>

3515
02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:39.471
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>country crock margarine and we didn't </v>

3516
02:24:39.471 --> 02:24:41.000
<v Speaker 2>feel so bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting now that that's been </v>

3517
02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.180
<v Speaker 2>revealed and you find out that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people didn't even get that much money.</v>

3518
02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:47.480
<v Speaker 2>They got like the equivalent of $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

3519
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:52.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To literallY lie to everybody about the.</v>

3520
02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:57.740
<v Speaker 2>They just made up a bunch of shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat and they,</v>

3521
02:24:57.770 --> 02:25:01.530
<v Speaker 2>they just diminished all the negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects of sugar and people just started</v>

3522
02:25:01.531 --> 02:25:05.250
<v Speaker 2>drinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That milk from a captain crunch.</v>

3523

3609
02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:43.580
<v Speaker 1>it was the most awkward thing I'd ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>done in my life.</v>

3610
02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Why was it so awkward?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3611
02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Cause the booker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so was doing prager university.</v>

3612
02:28:47.001 --> 02:28:47.480
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh hey,</v>

02:28:47.481 --> 02:28:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I know I'll hook you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3614
02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:50.940
<v Speaker 1>first off he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adam carolla,</v>

3615
02:28:51.050 --> 02:28:52.210
<v Speaker 1>he's not like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3616
02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:54.200
<v Speaker 1>like come in and you talk off air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of like doesn't,</v>

3617
02:28:54.330 --> 02:28:56.270
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really talk to you until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on air,</v>

3618
02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:58.160
<v Speaker 1>which I can respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's professional,</v>

3619
02:28:58.161 --> 02:29:00.440
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't on the adam carolla </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

3620
02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It was adam carolla and dr drew had </v>
<v Speaker 1>reunited to do,</v>

3621
02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:05.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a love line,</v>

3622
02:29:05.151 --> 02:29:06.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's effectively the same thing.</v>

3623
02:29:06.410 --> 02:29:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they still do that or they </v>

3624
02:29:11.410 --> 02:29:11.660
<v Speaker 1>brought it back and it was there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the first week I was there for like</v>

3625
02:29:11.661 --> 02:29:16.661
<v Speaker 1>the first week they brought it back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's him and dr drew sitting there </v>

3626
02:29:16.661 --> 02:29:19.841
<v Speaker 1>doing their stick at a table and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally at the end of the table </v>

3627
02:29:19.841 --> 02:29:21.410
<v Speaker 1>with nothing to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3628
02:29:21.411 --> 02:29:26.411
<v Speaker 1>that sounds about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're taking calls from people didn't </v>

3629
02:29:26.411 --> 02:29:26.600
<v Speaker 1>even bring you in a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>

3630
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adam carolla does his podcasts,</v>

3631
02:29:28.581 --> 02:29:30.320
<v Speaker 1>like this was an interview and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3632
02:29:30.321 --> 02:29:35.321
<v Speaker 1>it was really weird and I think what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened was they didn't realize he </v>

3633
02:29:35.321 --> 02:29:35.321
<v Speaker 1>wasn't doing the show that day and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought me.</v>

3634
02:29:35.321 --> 02:29:37.760
<v Speaker 1>They were very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr drew and adam was gracious afterward,</v>

3635
02:29:37.761 --> 02:29:42.761
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was clear like it's a two guy show </v>

3636
02:29:42.761 --> 02:29:42.761
<v Speaker 1>taking phone calls and you were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3637
02:29:42.761 --> 02:29:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty much just.</v>

3638
02:29:43.650 --> 02:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>They say your name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3639
02:29:45.101 --> 02:29:45.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

3640
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:46.910
<v Speaker 1>They did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

3641
02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:49.610
<v Speaker 1>we want to take phone calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3642
02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:53.480
<v Speaker 1>adam does essentially doesn't internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio show.</v>

3643
02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:55.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what his show is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3644
02:29:55.311 --> 02:29:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had his radio show that was a big hit</v>

3645
02:29:58.401 --> 02:30:03.401
<v Speaker 1>radio show and then the station went </v>
<v Speaker 1>under an la and I think he just decided </v>

3646
02:30:03.401 --> 02:30:06.080
<v Speaker 1>to do the same format and just do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>same format online.</v>

3647
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes it.</v>

3648
02:30:07.271 --> 02:30:12.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we started our show it was </v>

3649
02:30:12.271 --> 02:30:12.271
<v Speaker 1>syndicated and so we had radio and so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had all these commercial breaks.</v>

3650
02:30:12.271 --> 02:30:15.980
<v Speaker 1>When you do at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM on friday mornings out of detroit and</v>

3651
02:30:16.050 --> 02:30:21.050
<v Speaker 1>what we do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one really cares about these </v>

3652
02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:22.721
<v Speaker 1>commercial breaks nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we just did a bunch of sketches and </v>

3653
02:30:22.721 --> 02:30:25.421
<v Speaker 1>fake commercials and that's what created</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these characters that people have </v>

3654
02:30:25.421 --> 02:30:25.640
<v Speaker 1>treated these twitter profiles for </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we just said,</v>

3655
02:30:25.641 --> 02:30:25.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3656
02:30:25.961 --> 02:30:28.340
<v Speaker 1>so we're not going to run an ad for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>local car dealership.</v>

3657
02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do a fake news break and we would </v>

3658
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:33.500
<v Speaker 1>do like fake tornado warnings and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

3659
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:36.230
<v Speaker 1>which is highly illegal by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learned that one later on,</v>

3660
02:30:36.850 --> 02:30:41.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we had to kind of work with the </v>

3661
02:30:41.850 --> 02:30:41.850
<v Speaker 1>format online and now we just took it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

3662
02:30:41.850 --> 02:30:42.640
<v Speaker 1>took it off radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck radio.</v>

3663
02:30:42.641 --> 02:30:46.430
<v Speaker 1>It was too much dying market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing is not going to last.</v>

3664
02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:51.431
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the last time you turned on your </v>

3665
02:30:51.431 --> 02:30:51.431
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't ever.</v>

3666
02:30:51.431 --> 02:30:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember as another person,</v>

3667
02:30:52.970 --> 02:30:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I think like all the cells in your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>except your neuron switch every seven </v>

3668
02:30:57.970 --> 02:31:01.751
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means every cell in my body has </v>

3669
02:31:01.751 --> 02:31:01.751
<v Speaker 1>never listened to the radio.</v>

3670
02:31:01.751 --> 02:31:04.130
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking real man.</v>

3671
02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:09.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like if someone said to me when was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time you watched a vhs </v>

3672
02:31:09.370 --> 02:31:09.470
<v Speaker 1>cassette?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it was another person?</v>

3673
02:31:09.810 --> 02:31:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't take responsibility for me of 14</v>

3674
02:31:12.771 --> 02:31:16.580
<v Speaker 1>years ago because if I did I would still</v>
<v Speaker 1>be pissed at shit in my pants when I was</v>

3675
02:31:16.581 --> 02:31:17.570
<v Speaker 1>a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3676
02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Because that would take it back to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was three and I even bit my sister or </v>

3677
02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:22.720
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck I did,</v>

3678
02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:24.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met,</v>

3679
02:31:24.421 --> 02:31:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I might've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3680
02:31:25.381 --> 02:31:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three is my point.</v>

3681
02:31:26.941 --> 02:31:31.941
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you go back to the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did when you were developing </v>

3682
02:31:31.941 --> 02:31:31.941
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3683
02:31:31.941 --> 02:31:33.260
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like every seven years I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3684
02:31:33.290 --> 02:31:36.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to know what I did.</v>

3685
02:31:36.181 --> 02:31:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen years at three.</v>

3686
02:31:37.290 --> 02:31:42.290
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty rough years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called my dad's pastor a little </v>

3687
02:31:42.290 --> 02:31:42.290
<v Speaker 1>bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>

3688
02:31:42.290 --> 02:31:45.870
<v Speaker 1>You should probably write well because </v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather called me a little </v>

3689
02:31:45.870 --> 02:31:48.321
<v Speaker 1>bastard and I thought it was a term of </v>
<v Speaker 1>endearment and somebody has like this </v>

3690
02:31:48.321 --> 02:31:48.321
<v Speaker 1>test or kevin butcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3691
02:31:48.321 --> 02:31:48.321
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you doing?</v>

3692
02:31:48.321 --> 02:31:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Little bastard weld that pastors should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have known,</v>

3693
02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:53.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid is getting fucked over at home.</v>

3694
02:31:54.060 --> 02:31:54.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened?</v>

3695
02:31:54.901 --> 02:31:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got outed.</v>

3696
02:31:56.140 --> 02:31:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually a point where,</v>

3697
02:31:57.900 --> 02:31:58.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3698
02:31:58.171 --> 02:32:03.171
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got it from the church because there </v>

3699
02:32:03.171 --> 02:32:03.171
<v Speaker 1>was his pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his pregnant wife bomb,</v>

3700
02:32:03.171 --> 02:32:06.741
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't a detroit lions game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a guy with a bull horn </v>

3701
02:32:06.741 --> 02:32:07.500
<v Speaker 1>behind her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right up against her ear.</v>

3702
02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was a pat,</v>

3703
02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:10.160
<v Speaker 1>but a really good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3704
02:32:10.470 --> 02:32:11.610
<v Speaker 1>regardless of someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3705
02:32:11.611 --> 02:32:12.930
<v Speaker 1>religious affiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a good guy.</v>

3706
02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:14.640
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3707
02:32:14.641 --> 02:32:15.600
<v Speaker 1>can you stop my wife's here?</v>

3708
02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:15.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3709
02:32:15.991 --> 02:32:20.991
<v Speaker 1>She was pregnant or something and I to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it and kept doing it right next </v>

3710
02:32:21.211 --> 02:32:21.760
<v Speaker 1>to his wife's here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3711
02:32:21.770 --> 02:32:23.750
<v Speaker 1>got right up on her ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

3712
02:32:23.751 --> 02:32:25.500
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ended up kicking the guY's ass,</v>

3713
02:32:25.650 --> 02:32:30.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into a fight with him because </v>

3714
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:32.061
<v Speaker 1>the guy was getting up on their space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't exactly turn the other </v>

3715
02:32:32.061 --> 02:32:32.061
<v Speaker 1>cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not.</v>

3716
02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:34.410
<v Speaker 1>He did when he asked them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a whole vote.</v>

3717
02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that was,</v>

3718
02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:36.900
<v Speaker 1>that was when I was pretty young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

3719
02:32:36.901 --> 02:32:38.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they outed him.</v>

3720
02:32:38.191 --> 02:32:40.260
<v Speaker 1>They got rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning I could be wrong.</v>

3721
02:32:40.290 --> 02:32:43.200
<v Speaker 1>There was a hole up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole controversy over it.</v>

3722
02:32:43.201 --> 02:32:44.940
<v Speaker 1>And I remember learning about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid thing.</v>

3723
02:32:44.941 --> 02:32:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems pretty reasonable.</v>

3724
02:32:46.231 --> 02:32:49.260
<v Speaker 1>The guy getting up and his wife's grill </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bothering a pregnant woman.</v>

3725
02:32:49.700 --> 02:32:50.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

3726
02:32:50.970 --> 02:32:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Because human nature is definitely the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the person.</v>

3727
02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:55.550
<v Speaker 1>But do you just leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3728
02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:56.380
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3729
02:32:56.460 --> 02:32:57.780
<v Speaker 1>your nIght is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3730
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3731
02:32:58.651 --> 02:32:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I say kick his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3732
02:32:59.641 --> 02:33:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3733
02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:01.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he kicked his ass,</v>

3734
02:33:01.651 --> 02:33:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got physical and he got physical</v>

3735
02:33:04.411 --> 02:33:07.290
<v Speaker 1>with a guy and got the better of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could have been a shoving match.</v>

3736
02:33:07.291 --> 02:33:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Could have been a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't beat him.</v>

3737
02:33:09.421 --> 02:33:10.500
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't american history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>X,</v>

3738
02:33:10.501 --> 02:33:13.380
<v Speaker 1>curb stomp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying no one expected a pastor</v>

3739
02:33:13.381 --> 02:33:15.420
<v Speaker 1>to do anything to protect his wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3740
02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3741
02:33:17.010 --> 02:33:19.320
<v Speaker 1>that was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called him little bastard.</v>

3742
02:33:20.070 --> 02:33:22.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of that rabbit trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you were right,</v>

3743
02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:24.750
<v Speaker 1>once you got kicked out that crowd or </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

3744
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:27.270
<v Speaker 1>he's got vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sees the future.</v>

3745
02:33:27.780 --> 02:33:30.840
<v Speaker 1>This kid's going places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew that guy was a brawler.</v>

3746
02:33:31.230 --> 02:33:34.440
<v Speaker 1>He's in fucking bleachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brawler tag.</v>

3747
02:33:34.490 --> 02:33:36.630
<v Speaker 1>It's look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucks his wife,</v>

3748
02:33:36.631 --> 02:33:38.700
<v Speaker 1>gets her pregnant texture to the game.</v>

3749
02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:42.420
<v Speaker 1>That crowd has gone places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls It.</v>

3750
02:33:42.570 --> 02:33:44.430
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go to fox news for four </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3751
02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:49.490

<v Speaker 1>this is like a thing that people do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of standup comedy with it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like he's a middle act.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3766
02:34:16.410 --> 02:34:16.410
<v Speaker 1>a thing and someone like if they're </v>

3770
02:34:19.930 --> 02:34:22.390
<v Speaker 1>he'd do a few open mics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you're a fucking comedian?</v>

3771
02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really.</v>

3772
02:34:24.190 --> 02:34:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

3773
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:26.400
<v Speaker 1>really disliked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3774
02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:31.440
<v Speaker 1>she did that right off and I knew it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she was asking me questions in </v>

3775
02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:31.440
<v Speaker 1>the green room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3776
02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:31.750
<v Speaker 1>where do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you do comedy?</v>

3777
02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:32.550
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>

3778
02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:33.730
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she asked me one point,</v>

3779
02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:35.350
<v Speaker 1>did you perform at churches?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3780
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:36.940
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3781
02:34:36.941 --> 02:34:37.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never have.</v>

3782
02:34:37.610 --> 02:34:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she was so inflexible and argument.</v>

3783
02:34:40.421 --> 02:34:44.010
<v Speaker 1>She was an old maybe 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23.</v>

3784
02:34:44.050 --> 02:34:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I would have shit on you too dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably what?</v>

3785
02:34:45.971 --> 02:34:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I would have been right next to it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

3786
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:51.950
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amy would have fucking dog tag deal.</v>

3787
02:34:53.340 --> 02:34:53.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3788
02:34:53.971 --> 02:34:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changed drowsing sound.</v>

3789
02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:57.340
<v Speaker 1>What do you think would have happened?</v>

3790
02:34:57.340 --> 02:35:01.420
<v Speaker 1>You would have won that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been there and done really well?</v>

3791
02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3792
02:35:02.730 --> 02:35:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you watched that thing,</v>

3793
02:35:03.971 --> 02:35:05.350
<v Speaker 1>her argument was you're not a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

3794
02:35:05.351 --> 02:35:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I think I would have never accessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and shimmers of 30 something</v>

3795
02:35:08.651 --> 02:35:13.651
<v Speaker 1>year old girl who bitches and people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter now and is unmarried and </v>

3796
02:35:13.651 --> 02:35:13.651
<v Speaker 1>miserable and I'm married to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3797
02:35:13.651 --> 02:35:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty happy With.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you comparing lives?</v>

3798
02:35:16.570 --> 02:35:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am and I think I was right.</v>

3799
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that whenever someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also that she's funny by the way.</v>

3800
02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

3801
02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I think whenever someone says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a comedian thing,</v>

3802
02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:28.840
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an issue.</v>

3803
02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I have an issue with that because we all</v>
<v Speaker 1>started out as an open micros and when </v>

3804
02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:37.490
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to someone who's 22 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old when I was 22 hours and open miker I</v>

3805
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:40.210
<v Speaker 1>was doing open mic nights just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughs at that point.</v>

3806
02:35:40.210 --> 02:35:41.320
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't an open mic or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3807
02:35:41.350 --> 02:35:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3808
02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I'd will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you be clunky.</v>

3809
02:35:43.690 --> 02:35:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting paid professional </v>

3810
02:35:48.690 --> 02:35:48.690
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making your living off of standup</v>

3811
02:35:48.690 --> 02:35:52.590
<v Speaker 1>comedy or reading only made my living </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever off of acting standup comedy or </v>

3812
02:35:52.590 --> 02:35:52.840
<v Speaker 1>writing since 18 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3813
02:35:52.841 --> 02:35:57.841
<v Speaker 1>So when you were 22 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your bills when you lived with your </v>

3814
02:35:57.841 --> 02:35:58.480
<v Speaker 1>mom or what's going on now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you paying your bills?</v>

3815
02:35:58.481 --> 02:35:59.880
<v Speaker 1>A standup comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're 22 years,</v>

3816
02:35:59.910 --> 02:36:01.060
<v Speaker 1>so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

3817
02:36:01.061 --> 02:36:06.061
<v Speaker 1>I would do stand up and they had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty relatively successful acting </v>

3818
02:36:06.061 --> 02:36:06.061
<v Speaker 1>gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did some films,</v>

3819
02:36:06.061 --> 02:36:08.860
<v Speaker 1>commercials on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at that point.</v>

3820
02:36:08.861 --> 02:36:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I was a fox news contributor which paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>me retainer.</v>

3821
02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did freelance writing where they would</v>

3822
02:36:12.761 --> 02:36:17.761
<v Speaker 1>pay by the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those you were doing standup on a </v>

3823
02:36:17.761 --> 02:36:17.970
<v Speaker 1>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See where a standup guy.</v>

3824
02:36:17.970 --> 02:36:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would readily admit now I don't </v>

3825
02:36:22.970 --> 02:36:25.681
<v Speaker 1>because the show and everything is a 14 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour day and I would never claim to be </v>

3826
02:36:25.681 --> 02:36:29.011
<v Speaker 1>as good of a standup as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you are nick depaulo or a builder by </v>

3827
02:36:29.011 --> 02:36:29.011
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nick depAulo asked me to plug.</v>

3828
02:36:29.011 --> 02:36:30.460
<v Speaker 1>He's doing a standup special in boston.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's tomorrow the best for my money,</v>

3831
02:36:36.671 --> 02:36:38.510
<v Speaker 1>one of the best living comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3832
02:36:38.610 --> 02:36:43.610
<v Speaker 1>he's certainly one of my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick depaulo was goddamn hilarious and </v>

3833
02:36:43.610 --> 02:36:44.380
<v Speaker 1>he was here yesterday and you fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed me.</v>

3834
02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:44.960
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3835
02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:46.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a very fun and a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

3836
02:36:46.991 --> 02:36:49.120
<v Speaker 1>very good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another weirdo,</v>

3837
02:36:49.121 --> 02:36:50.470
<v Speaker 1>right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

3838
02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:52.140
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3839
02:36:52.350 --> 02:36:53.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty common.</v>

3840
02:36:53.081 --> 02:36:54.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>christopher titus at the same thing.</v>

3841
02:36:54.431 --> 02:36:55.030
<v Speaker 1>That was the same thing.</v>

3842
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:56.130
<v Speaker 1>We staRted losing the gun issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3843
02:36:56.131 --> 02:36:57.550
<v Speaker 1>well on stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get paid for standing.</v>

3844
02:36:58.010 --> 02:36:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3845
02:36:59.110 --> 02:37:04.110
<v Speaker 1>that's he when he was doing was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to save whatever was going on in his </v>

3846
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:07.390
<v Speaker 1>mind when there's a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a competition,</v>

3847
02:37:07.690 --> 02:37:12.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little battle ground and his mind </v>

3848
02:37:12.690 --> 02:37:12.690
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to save his,</v>

3849
02:37:12.690 --> 02:37:13.470
<v Speaker 1>his patch of land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3850
02:37:13.570 --> 02:37:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it would work with most </v>

3851
02:37:18.570 --> 02:37:18.570
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would probably go with,</v>

3852
02:37:18.570 --> 02:37:18.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of standup comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3853
02:37:18.570 --> 02:37:21.080
<v Speaker 1>they have a void and they're filling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This becomes their identity.</v>

3854
02:37:21.470 --> 02:37:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And so for me it was never my whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity wrapped up in standup.</v>

3855
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been doing acting since I was 12 </v>

3856
02:37:29.530 --> 02:37:29.530
<v Speaker 1>years old and I was tutored on set with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things.</v>

3857
02:37:29.530 --> 02:37:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3858
02:37:29.530 --> 02:37:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I did kid's cartoons that show arthur's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how I started out,</v>

3859
02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:37.420
<v Speaker 1>so I did stand up and I'll be the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute I did it as a means to getting to</v>

3860
02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:39.950
<v Speaker 1>other avenues and then it turned out I </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell in love with it,</v>

3861
02:37:39.951 --> 02:37:41.570
<v Speaker 1>but I never planned on doing stand up my</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>

3862
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:43.610
<v Speaker 1>So if I were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a standup comedian,</v>

3863
02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm a road comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love being,</v>

3864
02:37:45.051 --> 02:37:50.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waking up for leftover drugs and being </v>

3865
02:37:50.051 --> 02:37:50.051
<v Speaker 1>unhappy and bitching about my manager </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftover drugs.</v>

3866
02:37:50.051 --> 02:37:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of such thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>YeAh,</v>

3867
02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:52.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3868
02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I've got leftover Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3869
02:37:56.961 --> 02:37:58.290
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

3870
02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:02.240
<v Speaker 1>This will have them write the pride in </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup of barely getting by,</v>

3871
02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:03.800
<v Speaker 1>kind of like New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3872
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:08.510
<v Speaker 1>You're in a shitty city in a two bedroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment with five roommates and you're</v>

3873
02:38:08.511 --> 02:38:10.850
<v Speaker 1>proud of it because you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone how miserable you are.</v>

3874
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:14.060
<v Speaker 1>So it just didn't work out real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3875
02:38:14.061 --> 02:38:14.810
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3876
02:38:14.811 --> 02:38:17.000
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you become successful,</v>

3877
02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:19.130
<v Speaker 1>it's never real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's struggling,</v>

3878
02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:20.990
<v Speaker 1>people try to act like it is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all man,</v>

3879
02:38:20.991 --> 02:38:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the energy of this city.</v>

3880
02:38:22.791 --> 02:38:26.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like you literally see you shit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a drain in the kitchen,</v>

3881
02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:28.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those in the lower east side,</v>

3882
02:38:28.090 --> 02:38:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you're the lower east side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so saturated.</v>

3883
02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I have not right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are always exaggerating.</v>

3884
02:38:36.410 --> 02:38:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it in the east village </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he'd have like 19 polish family </v>

3885
02:38:41.410 --> 02:38:45.371
<v Speaker 1>members per apartment and the toilet was</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the middle of the kitchen </v>

3886
02:38:45.371 --> 02:38:47.420
<v Speaker 1>because they weren't designed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to dig a shit bacon.</v>

3887
02:38:50.830 --> 02:38:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Same tIme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an extra toilet.</v>

3888
02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:55.730
<v Speaker 1>There's one for mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While she's making spaghetti,</v>

3889
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:57.560
<v Speaker 1>they're multitasking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could squat,</v>

3890
02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:03.160
<v Speaker 1>squat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those little squatty potty </v>

3891
02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:03.160
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ever seen that one sign.</v>

3892
02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to some places frequented</v>
<v Speaker 1>by too many people from asia,</v>

3893
02:39:05.690 --> 02:39:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you'll see signs that show like a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on the shitter squatting down.</v>

3894
02:39:11.751 --> 02:39:14.240
<v Speaker 1>It's got a red line through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't shit.</v>

3895
02:39:15.010 --> 02:39:16.120
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull.</v>

3896
02:39:16.450 --> 02:39:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Has it become that popular?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The squatty potty.</v>

3897
02:39:18.271 --> 02:39:21.080
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen here's the squatty potty.</v>

3898
02:39:21.081 --> 02:39:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And home I would assume.</v>

3899
02:39:22.491 --> 02:39:25.820
<v Speaker 1>So it helps the caveman thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bowel movement.</v>

3900
02:39:26.090 --> 02:39:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Well if I prefer to shit in a hole in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

3901
02:39:29.050 --> 02:39:32.780
<v Speaker 1>So the kitchen has the time to dig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look at the guy.</v>

3902
02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:33.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3903
02:39:33.890 --> 02:39:37.370
<v Speaker 1>no it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would just one.</v>

3904
02:39:37.490 --> 02:39:42.490
<v Speaker 1>This is a joke one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have literally seen that that's </v>

3905
02:39:42.490 --> 02:39:42.490
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

3906
02:39:42.490 --> 02:39:44.750
<v Speaker 1>That is an actual real for people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>asia.</v>

3907
02:39:45.330 --> 02:39:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Arusha fear went to China and he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking hilarious bit about it and </v>

3908
02:39:50.330 --> 02:39:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do his bit.</v>

3909
02:39:52.020 --> 02:39:53.180
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>

3910
02:39:53.390 --> 02:39:57.680
<v Speaker 1>But in China he went into a restroom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was literally a hole in the ground</v>

3911
02:39:57.830 --> 02:40:00.980
<v Speaker 1>and you were supposed to squat over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole and they had no toilet paper.</v>

3912
02:40:01.010 --> 02:40:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is real.</v>

3913
02:40:02.390 --> 02:40:06.890
<v Speaker 1>And he told me that when people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>asia who are used to that environment as</v>

3914
02:40:06.891 --> 02:40:11.891
<v Speaker 1>the norm come over to the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they actually stand on the </v>

3915
02:40:11.891 --> 02:40:13.860
<v Speaker 1>toilet seat and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit that way.</v>

3916
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:17.160
<v Speaker 2>So the toilet seat is not designed for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ame to be accurate.</v>

3917
02:40:17.161 --> 02:40:19.140
<v Speaker 2>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're sitting on the toilet seat,</v>

3918
02:40:19.141 --> 02:40:24.141
<v Speaker 2>you'd be crapping on the water tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know any better either from </v>

3919
02:40:24.141 --> 02:40:25.530
<v Speaker 2>another country without trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without trump leading them.</v>

3920
02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:27.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know anything man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

3921
02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Tossing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending trump,</v>

3922
02:40:29.550 --> 02:40:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3923
02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:31.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

3924
02:40:31.210 --> 02:40:34.680
<v Speaker 2>do you think he's a good leader?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you happy that he's an office?</v>

3925
02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it good because it's a shakeup.</v>

3926
02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:38.790
<v Speaker 2>I will say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3927
02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3928
02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left has behaved so poorly.</v>

3929
02:40:43.430 --> 02:40:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3930
02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:45.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump has been a lightning rod.</v>

3931
02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I would disagree with him on some policy</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues for sure,</v>

3932
02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:54.140
<v Speaker 2>but I think that because everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>called him a nazi and a racist and </v>

3933
02:40:54.140 --> 02:40:56.870
<v Speaker 2>sexist and a transfer job that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed those arguments from the table </v>

3934
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.870
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

3935
02:40:56.870 --> 02:41:01.670
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for at least several decades because </v>

3936
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.670
<v Speaker 2>people are going.</v>

3937
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you saId it about john mccain and </v>

3938
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.830
<v Speaker 2>mitt romney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone you disagree with is a racist.</v>

3939
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:08.031
<v Speaker 2>I think that card has been played too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much and because of Donald Trump has </v>

3940
02:41:08.031 --> 02:41:09.330
<v Speaker 2>been overplayed and I think now we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>with our channel,</v>

3941
02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:10.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted it's not as big as,</v>

3942
02:41:10.711 --> 02:41:12.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outreach you guys have,</v>

3943
02:41:12.061 --> 02:41:17.061
<v Speaker 2>but it's grown pretty substantially and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our audience are self </v>

3944
02:41:17.061 --> 02:41:17.061
<v Speaker 2>professed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberals going,</v>

3945
02:41:17.061 --> 02:41:18.300
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to hate you.</v>

3946
02:41:18.330 --> 02:41:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch the young turks and that</v>

3947
02:41:20.170 --> 02:41:25.170
<v Speaker 2>we used to watch some crap on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually some of these points make </v>

3948
02:41:25.170 --> 02:41:28.341
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I used to think everyone will </v>

3949
02:41:28.341 --> 02:41:28.341
<v Speaker 2>disagree with me with racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think because it's so overplaYed,</v>

3950
02:41:28.341 --> 02:41:29.280
<v Speaker 2>it's left such a bad taste in people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

3951
02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I do think that Donald Trump has served </v>
<v Speaker 2>a real purpose to shine a light on that.</v>

3952
02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:38.900
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that may be the most important point of </v>

3953
02:41:38.900 --> 02:41:39.300
<v Speaker 2>all at this point in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's political correctness?</v>

3954
02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:44.660
<v Speaker 2>I think when things go too far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way people get upset with that and </v>

3955
02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:46.650
<v Speaker 2>when people get too bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's towards the left or towards</v>

3956
02:41:46.651 --> 02:41:51.651
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tends to balance things out in the </v>

3957
02:41:51.651 --> 02:41:53.791
<v Speaker 2>other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like robert anton wilson called lyndon </v>

3958
02:41:53.791 --> 02:41:54.210
<v Speaker 2>johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pacifist president,</v>

3959
02:41:54.450 --> 02:41:59.450
<v Speaker 2>you know why he called them the pacifist</v>
<v Speaker 2>president because he was such a cunt </v>

3960
02:41:59.450 --> 02:42:04.280
<v Speaker 2>that he created so many pacifists </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if his atrocities that he </v>

3961
02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:08.301
<v Speaker 2>ordered in the Vietnam war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were so upset that more people </v>

3962
02:42:08.301 --> 02:42:10.380
<v Speaker 2>became pacifist during the lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or excuse me,</v>

3963
02:42:10.381 --> 02:42:13.710
<v Speaker 2>they're in during the lyndon johnson </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration than than ever before.</v>

3964
02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:16.740
<v Speaker 2>By the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called reagan,</v>

3965
02:42:16.890 --> 02:42:20.430
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual president because more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people just went,</v>

3966
02:42:20.431 --> 02:42:21.260
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta.</v>

3967
02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Fuck god dammit.</v>

3968
02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:24.540
<v Speaker 2>It's important to know things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3969
02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:26.280
<v Speaker 2>god damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important to be smart.</v>

3970
02:42:26.281 --> 02:42:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Like just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no bitch.</v>

3971
02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:30.600
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just saying no,</v>

3972

3974
02:42:40.771 --> 02:42:42.160

<v Speaker 2>This is reagan was selling coke.</v>

<v Speaker 2>didn't know how to read.</v>

3985
02:43:08.671 --> 02:43:13.671
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did not have any idea who was bringing </v>

02:43:13.671 --> 02:43:14.230
<v Speaker 2>him to coach kelly was getting at where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was coming from.</v>

3987
02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:19.500
<v Speaker 2>The profits that they were making was </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally paying north oliver north to </v>

<v Speaker 2>sandinistas.</v>

3989
02:43:23.351 --> 02:43:24.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was literally,</v>

3990
02:43:24.371 --> 02:43:26.200
<v Speaker 2>it was all proven in court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3991
02:43:26.201 --> 02:43:29.770
<v Speaker 2>this is what my current are contracted </v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of.</v>

3992
02:43:30.130 --> 02:43:31.360
<v Speaker 2>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3993
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the gathering was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on television,</v>

3994
02:43:36.071 --> 02:43:38.260
<v Speaker 2>on cspan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>michael rupert,</v>

3995
02:43:38.290 --> 02:43:43.290
<v Speaker 2>who was a narcotics officer for the los </v>
<v Speaker 2>angeles police department who has also </v>

3996
02:43:43.290 --> 02:43:44.890
<v Speaker 2>been on my podcast for committed </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide.</v>

3997
02:43:45.130 --> 02:43:48.100
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy that was the focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie collapse.</v>

3998
02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Remember that movie collapsed where he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

3999
02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just him smoking cigarettes.</v>

4000
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Sitting there talking about what he knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the economy,</v>

4001
02:43:56.861 --> 02:44:01.861
<v Speaker 2>what he knew about all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that were problematic in our </v>

4002
02:44:01.861 --> 02:44:02.820
<v Speaker 2>society and how there's only a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time for it,</v>

4003
02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:03.460
<v Speaker 2>it's going to collapse.</v>

4004
02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:06.010
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of crazy doom and gloom </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

4005
02:44:06.220 --> 02:44:10.180
<v Speaker 2>but the point is he had caught cia </v>
<v Speaker 2>agents,</v>

4006
02:44:10.181 --> 02:44:15.181
<v Speaker 2>rogue cowboy cia agents in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of selling drugs in south </v>

4007
02:44:17.501 --> 02:44:22.501
<v Speaker 2>central los angeles reported it and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in trouble because of that and decided </v>

4008
02:44:22.501 --> 02:44:24.790
<v Speaker 2>to go public with it and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling these drugs.</v>

4009
02:44:24.791 --> 02:44:29.791
<v Speaker 2>They were making shitloads of money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were transferring the money to arm </v>

4010
02:44:29.791 --> 02:44:29.980
<v Speaker 2>these rebels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4011
02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:35.040
<v Speaker 2>rick ross was in the middle of that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know he was in the middle of </v>

4012
02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:38.791
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was literally selling drugs and </v>

4013
02:44:38.791 --> 02:44:38.791
<v Speaker 2>funneling this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went to,</v>

4014
02:44:38.791 --> 02:44:41.110
<v Speaker 2>went to jail as an illiterate person who</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't literally couldn't read,</v>

4015
02:44:41.430 --> 02:44:43.840
<v Speaker 2>learn how to read in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Became a lawyer,</v>

4016
02:44:43.841 --> 02:44:45.370
<v Speaker 2>a jail like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like learned.</v>

4017
02:44:45.430 --> 02:44:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4018
02:44:46.151 --> 02:44:51.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured out that you can't charge him </v>

4019
02:44:51.151 --> 02:44:51.550
<v Speaker 2>for the three strikes rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's one thing,</v>

4020
02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:52.180
<v Speaker 2>if it's.</v>

4021
02:44:52.270 --> 02:44:55.180
<v Speaker 2>If you're charging him with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>counts under one incident,</v>

4022
02:44:55.360 --> 02:45:00.360
<v Speaker 2>it's the three strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Law doesn't apply and that's how they </v>

4023
02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:03.001
<v Speaker 2>got him in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now he's out like all of this came </v>

4024
02:45:03.001 --> 02:45:03.001
<v Speaker 2>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4025
02:45:03.001 --> 02:45:07.741
<v Speaker 2>I knew about all of the north and in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>contra thing I didn't know about rick </v>

4026
02:45:07.741 --> 02:45:07.741
<v Speaker 2>ross specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4027
02:45:07.741 --> 02:45:11.430
<v Speaker 2>this has been proved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some elements of our government have </v>

4028
02:45:11.430 --> 02:45:15.601
<v Speaker 2>sold drugs to improv which neighborhoods</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to fund black ops,</v>

4029
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:20.670
<v Speaker 2>like this is a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the things that </v>

4030
02:45:20.670 --> 02:45:23.611
<v Speaker 2>robert anton wilson was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was talking about the reagan </v>

4031
02:45:23.611 --> 02:45:26.371
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like it became the intellectual </v>

4032
02:45:26.371 --> 02:45:28.891
<v Speaker 2>president because people were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrated by how fucking crazy and </v>

4033
02:45:28.891 --> 02:45:30.820
<v Speaker 2>chaotic and movie like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4034
02:45:30.970 --> 02:45:34.840
<v Speaker 2>things can become that they had decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>to arm themselves with information.</v>

4035
02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:40.440
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if a big part of it too is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>backlash with ronald reagan because </v>

4036
02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:40.440
<v Speaker 2>everyone said again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had no chance.</v>

4037
02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:43.120
<v Speaker 2>He was a moron and he won in a landslide</v>
<v Speaker 2>or people go,</v>

4038
02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:44.800
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw you.</v>

4039
02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:46.390
<v Speaker 2>We're going to consider them an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual.</v>

4040
02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Like with Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

4041
02:45:47.471 --> 02:45:52.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't think donald trump's </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and no one was entering in </v>

4042
02:45:52.471 --> 02:45:55.370
<v Speaker 2>an intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were considering him a great </v>

4043
02:45:55.370 --> 02:45:55.370
<v Speaker 2>american.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4044
02:45:55.370 --> 02:45:58.580
<v Speaker 2>He had slicked back hair and his wife </v>
<v Speaker 2>stood still and everybody was happy in </v>

4045
02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:00.820
<v Speaker 2>between seances at the white house </v>
<v Speaker 2>called her astrologer,</v>

4046
02:46:00.821 --> 02:46:05.821
<v Speaker 2>making sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think people might've just been </v>

4047
02:46:05.821 --> 02:46:05.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

4048
02:46:05.921 --> 02:46:08.860
<v Speaker 2>You called him a moron for so long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone voted him a moron that.</v>

4049
02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't really call reagan a moron.</v>

4050
02:46:10.971 --> 02:46:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

4051
02:46:12.450 --> 02:46:14.590
<v Speaker 2>They called George Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4052
02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:15.260
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4053
02:46:15.261 --> 02:46:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the playbook with,</v>

4054
02:46:18.140 --> 02:46:23.140
<v Speaker 2>with anyone who's conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>republican is if they can make you a </v>

4055
02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:23.140
<v Speaker 2>more than they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>

4056
02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you're evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4057
02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:24.530
<v Speaker 2>dick cheney can't be a moron.</v>

4058
02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:27.320
<v Speaker 2>He's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're confusing the narrative a</v>

4059
02:46:27.321 --> 02:46:29.840
<v Speaker 2>little bit because reagan might have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been simplistic,</v>

4060
02:46:29.841 --> 02:46:34.841
<v Speaker 2>but he was a wonderful speaker like he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave really articulate well thought </v>

4061
02:46:35.391 --> 02:46:39.500
<v Speaker 2>out speeches that spoke to americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

4062
02:46:39.501 --> 02:46:44.501
<v Speaker 2>longing for this nostalgia of a time </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the norman rockwell painting made </v>

4063
02:46:44.811 --> 02:46:47.090
<v Speaker 2>sense and that's what ronald reagan </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents it to.</v>

4064
02:46:47.091 --> 02:46:47.820
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4065
02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:49.090
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

4066
02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:51.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were coming out of the chaos of the</v>

4067
02:46:51.111 --> 02:46:55.610
<v Speaker 2>carter administration and the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam and lines,</v>

4068
02:46:56.100 --> 02:47:01.100
<v Speaker 2>the gas lines and the iranians taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the american hostages and all that crazy</v>

4069
02:47:01.611 --> 02:47:03.510
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ronald reagan came along.</v>

4070
02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:04.520
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fix it.</v>

4071
02:47:04.521 --> 02:47:05.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never was like,</v>

4072
02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:10.540
<v Speaker 2>we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the media treated him like a real </v>

4073
02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:10.540
<v Speaker 2>moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go back and watch that,</v>

4074
02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:10.910
<v Speaker 2>and then right before his landslide </v>
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>

4075
02:47:10.911 --> 02:47:12.380
<v Speaker 2>when they may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the,</v>

4076
02:47:12.381 --> 02:47:13.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the electoral map,</v>

4077
02:47:13.371 --> 02:47:14.960
<v Speaker 2>sort of the poles and the predictive </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions,</v>

4078
02:47:14.961 --> 02:47:19.961
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave him no chance of winning and </v>

4079
02:47:19.961 --> 02:47:20.630
<v Speaker 2>that's full of shit about Colorado and </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic deaths.</v>

4080
02:47:21.470 --> 02:47:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Should we go and fuck you up with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>too?</v>

4081
02:47:23.790 --> 02:47:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Colorado thing at all.</v>

4082
02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:28.580
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never said Colorado.</v>

4083
02:47:28.581 --> 02:47:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I said states that legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other ones are there?</v>

4084
02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't bring up the source that I </v>

4085
02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:35.860

<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

4086
02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:35.860
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that you're still hung up </v>
<v Speaker 2>on police.</v>

4087
02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Hopeless.</v>

4088
02:47:36.340 --> 02:47:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>few minutes on your website.</v>

4090
02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:45.620

<v Speaker 3>really bad just off to just off the </v>

<v Speaker 3>you're a moron.</v>

4093
02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:46.070
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4094
02:47:46.590 --> 02:47:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Well it's getting high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a news article.</v>

4095
02:47:50.250 --> 02:47:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Hold on please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's commentary.</v>

4096
02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fine.</v>

4097
02:47:52.830 --> 02:47:55.200
<v Speaker 2>After all things like coachella wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

4098
02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Is this your article?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an article on my site.</v>

4099
02:47:58.410 --> 02:47:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

4100
02:47:58.891 --> 02:48:00.090
<v Speaker 2>If you could want to get high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will.</v>

4101
02:48:00.091 --> 02:48:03.180
<v Speaker 2>You're a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moron.</v>

4102
02:48:03.350 --> 02:48:03.840
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Courtney,</v>

4103
02:48:04.330 --> 02:48:06.930
<v Speaker 2>who is courtney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's working on one of the best writers</v>

4104
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I've ever encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dare you not read them,</v>

4105
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the article links.</v>

4106
02:48:10.690 --> 02:48:14.950
<v Speaker 3>So a couple like this for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when it says it has deadliest year of</v>

4107
02:48:14.951 --> 02:48:16.860
<v Speaker 3>traffic fatalities since 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4108
02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:19.120
<v Speaker 3>This article doesn't say anything about </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

4109
02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Not one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing doesn't mention me weed at </v>

4110
02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:26.701
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does say that it could be attributed </v>

4111
02:48:26.701 --> 02:48:28.120
<v Speaker 3>to crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people driving more people in the state.</v>

4112
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

4113
02:48:29.081 --> 02:48:29.530
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>

4114
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the only thing I'm going to </v>

4115
02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:37.900
<v Speaker 2>defend myself here because you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone here at the ready and what you </v>

4116
02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:37.900
<v Speaker 2>do is instead of bringing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

4117
02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:38.840
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens with christopher </v>
<v Speaker 2>titus,</v>

4118
02:48:38.841 --> 02:48:43.841
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have information that you </v>

4119
02:48:43.841 --> 02:48:43.841
<v Speaker 2>bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have another guy.</v>

4120
02:48:43.841 --> 02:48:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I look up a source that you specifically</v>
<v Speaker 2>want him to find.</v>

4121
02:48:44.570 --> 02:48:47.510
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ask him to bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought up Washington post and goes,</v>

4122
02:48:47.511 --> 02:48:49.600
<v Speaker 2>this is what's wrong with your article </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the job.</v>

4123
02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:55.600
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The joke in there about things like </v>

4124
02:48:55.600 --> 02:48:57.110
<v Speaker 2>coachella wouldn't exist if there </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't even that article.</v>

4125
02:48:57.140 --> 02:48:58.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4126
02:48:58.150 --> 02:49:03.150
<v Speaker 2>but the triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think people who smoke pot or </v>

4127
02:49:03.150 --> 02:49:03.150
<v Speaker 2>morton's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4128
02:49:03.150 --> 02:49:03.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4129
02:49:03.150 --> 02:49:03.290
<v Speaker 2>let's not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not do that.</v>

4130
02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:06.140
<v Speaker 2>And know pot's not comparable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>

4131
02:49:06.141 --> 02:49:09.480
<v Speaker 2>There are tests that how much alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>content is in your bloodstream.</v>

4132
02:49:09.690 --> 02:49:14.690
<v Speaker 2>We can't yet do that with weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's impossible to handle these </v>

4133
02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:14.690
<v Speaker 2>incidents in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're happy.</v>

4134
02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there have been tasks where they </v>

4135
02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:20.391
<v Speaker 2>showed people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that will go back to what he said </v>

4136
02:49:20.391 --> 02:49:22.551
<v Speaker 2>and what you said have been tasked with </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've shown people drunk versus on </v>

4137
02:49:22.551 --> 02:49:24.540
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and the people on marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove far better.</v>

4138
02:49:24.570 --> 02:49:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

4139
02:49:25.381 --> 02:49:27.400
<v Speaker 2>So this is also anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4140
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:29.180
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4141
02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's say someone has alcohol tests the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't,</v>

4142
02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read your test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4143
02:49:34.021 --> 02:49:39.021
<v Speaker 2>So what are you arguing against them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying I agree with your point </v>

4144
02:49:39.021 --> 02:49:39.021
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why are you saying that the.</v>

4145
02:49:39.021 --> 02:49:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Well it is anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're saying some people drive </v>

4146
02:49:44.010 --> 02:49:44.010
<v Speaker 2>better on marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

4147
02:49:44.010 --> 02:49:47.571
<v Speaker 2>I've said there have been tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would they have shown that people drive </v>

4148
02:49:47.571 --> 02:49:47.571
<v Speaker 2>better on marijuana than alcohol?</v>

4149
02:49:47.571 --> 02:49:52.290
<v Speaker 2>If you want anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is if we're going to be really </v>

4150
02:49:52.290 --> 02:49:52.740
<v Speaker 2>good at this argument and just settle </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

4151
02:49:52.741 --> 02:49:57.741
<v Speaker 2>you said you wouldn't pile on and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got two people talking to talk and when </v>

4152
02:49:58.830 --> 02:50:01.050
<v Speaker 2>someone brought on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone comes on the show,</v>

4153
02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:03.540
<v Speaker 2>jared cannot enter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations,</v>

4154
02:50:03.541 --> 02:50:08.541
<v Speaker 2>you're not on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all he did was pull up bringing up </v>

4155
02:50:08.541 --> 02:50:09.060
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me without a laptop.</v>

4156
02:50:09.090 --> 02:50:12.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brought it up about it.</v>

4157
02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:14.550
<v Speaker 2>You said what would be the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've changed your mind on?</v>

4158
02:50:14.551 --> 02:50:16.960
<v Speaker 2>A similar problem with two people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct and you're incorrect.</v>

4159
02:50:16.961 --> 02:50:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Does that bother you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree that you're correct.</v>

4160
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:23.750
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just pulled up some statistics that </v>

4161
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:25.450
<v Speaker 2>show the Colorado has less traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatalities in statistics.</v>

4162
02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:28.200
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just kill you.</v>

4163
02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:31.770
<v Speaker 2>I will give you the laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll turn my laptop and you can.</v>

4164
02:50:31.790 --> 02:50:36.790
<v Speaker 2>You can pull up the shows contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the issue that you would care </v>

4165
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.790
<v Speaker 2>about the least that you've changed your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind?</v>

4166
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I said probably wouldn't even talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

4167
02:50:37.850 --> 02:50:40.710
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a long version of what you said.</v>

4168
02:50:41.050 --> 02:50:46.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there have been more fatalities </v>

4169
02:50:46.050 --> 02:50:46.420
<v Speaker 2>since marijuana has been legal in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>days?</v>

4170
02:50:46.421 --> 02:50:47.550
<v Speaker 2>The things we've discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not true.</v>

4171
02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Why are you so obsessed with the body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're not right and it doesn't </v>

4172
02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:53.970
<v Speaker 2>matter if we've talked about it for four</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours in this instance,</v>

4173
02:50:53.971 --> 02:50:55.260
<v Speaker 2>you are incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4174
02:50:55.261 --> 02:51:00.261
<v Speaker 2>you're correct in that instance that </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic fatalities have increased in </v>

4175
02:51:00.261 --> 02:51:02.961
<v Speaker 2>areas where pod of increased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did the same study in Michigan where </v>

4176
02:51:02.961 --> 02:51:05.451
<v Speaker 2>pot was legalized and people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually selling more marijuana to </v>

4177
02:51:05.451 --> 02:51:08.560
<v Speaker 2>underage kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if that doesn't have </v>

4178
02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:08.560
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with traffic to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapped to do with it.</v>

4179
02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:12.111
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic fatalities unless you can prove </v>

4180
02:51:12.111 --> 02:51:12.111
<v Speaker 2>there's more traffic fatalities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>underage kids.</v>

4181
02:51:12.111 --> 02:51:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Since marijuana has been legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4182
02:51:13.410 --> 02:51:15.390
<v Speaker 2>There've been several articles that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>made that claim,</v>

4183
02:51:15.391 --> 02:51:17.250
<v Speaker 2>made that assertion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's been written about it?</v>

4184
02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all come from one article mostly,</v>

4185
02:51:20.221 --> 02:51:25.221
<v Speaker 2>and it's from the aaa stats and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stats that they said it was almost all </v>

4186
02:51:25.221 --> 02:51:27.150
<v Speaker 2>the articles you're talking about coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>from this one article.</v>

4187
02:51:27.460 --> 02:51:32.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the percentage of drivers </v>

4188
02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:34.551
<v Speaker 2>involved in fatal crashes who recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>used marijuana more than doubled from </v>

4189
02:51:34.551 --> 02:51:38.811
<v Speaker 2>eight to 17 percent from 2014 or 2013 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 2014.</v>

4190
02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:44.000
<v Speaker 2>One in six drivers involved in fatal </v>
<v Speaker 2>crashes from 2014 had recently used </v>

4191
02:51:44.401 --> 02:51:49.401
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the most recent data available </v>

4192
02:51:49.401 --> 02:51:49.740
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand the consequences?</v>

4193
02:51:49.850 --> 02:51:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Middles crashes involving marijuana is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>charming says who opinion.</v>

<v Speaker 2>marijuana because it's legal or it's a.</v>

4197
02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Is it a matter of the marijuana causing </v>
<v Speaker 2>these accidents?</v>

4198
02:52:06.701 --> 02:52:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Is this no one article put out but no </v>

02:52:26.090 --> 02:52:27.580
<v Speaker 2>you made a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out.</v>

4207
02:52:27.581 --> 02:52:32.581
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say anything in the article </v>
<v Speaker 2>about alcohol though and for sure they </v>

4208
02:52:32.581 --> 02:52:36.091
<v Speaker 2>should have tested that shoes for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't test for a cup of joy and </v>

4209
02:52:37.031 --> 02:52:39.130
<v Speaker 2>just google made him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>

4210
02:52:39.150 --> 02:52:44.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a point that you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an obvious position that would disagree </v>

4211
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.500
<v Speaker 2>with this one single article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I can finish a point,</v>

4212
02:52:44.501 --> 02:52:45.520
<v Speaker 2>you've talked about interruption.</v>

4213
02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Let me finish the one point that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>making.</v>

4214
02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:48.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you marijuana,</v>

4215
02:52:48.811 --> 02:52:51.070
<v Speaker 2>you've already test for marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>roadside,</v>

4216
02:52:51.071 --> 02:52:51.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can wE agree On that?</v>

4217
02:52:51.971 --> 02:52:56.971
<v Speaker 2>You absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just do tests because there's </v>

4218
02:52:56.971 --> 02:52:56.971
<v Speaker 2>new tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Test.</v>

4219
02:52:56.971 --> 02:52:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before you do that,</v>

4220
02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:00.940
<v Speaker 2>what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of the hour,</v>

4221
02:53:00.970 --> 02:53:05.620
<v Speaker 2>how many of the marijuana related </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatalities also involved alcohol because</v>

4222
02:53:05.621 --> 02:53:07.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a massively significant percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4223
02:53:08.290 --> 02:53:13.290
<v Speaker 2>so you can't necessarily say that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have these new tests for </v>

4224
02:53:13.290 --> 02:53:17.551
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially roadsides barrel problem is </v>

4225
02:53:17.551 --> 02:53:17.551
<v Speaker 2>he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4226
02:53:17.551 --> 02:53:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you that.</v>

4227
02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:20.410
<v Speaker 2>What do you give them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you'Re correct,</v>

4228
02:53:20.411 --> 02:53:21.760
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's test indirect.</v>

4229
02:53:21.761 --> 02:53:26.761
<v Speaker 2>Physiologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have an effect on motor </v>

4230
02:53:26.761 --> 02:53:27.850
<v Speaker 2>skills the way alcohol does or it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't slow down your response time.</v>

4231
02:53:27.910 --> 02:53:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that we've had several doctors in</v>

4232
02:53:30.131 --> 02:53:32.170
<v Speaker 2>the show with two of whom had differing </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions on that.</v>

4233
02:53:32.710 --> 02:53:36.010
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The iranians have it.</v>

4234
02:53:36.011 --> 02:53:41.011
<v Speaker 2>Do they smoke marijuana themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they knoW what it's like to get into </v>

4235
02:53:41.011 --> 02:53:44.941
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This whole study studies on cbs news </v>

4236
02:53:44.941 --> 02:53:48.541
<v Speaker 2>caught blatantly distorting cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 2>study says this doubles fatal because </v>

4237
02:53:48.541 --> 02:53:49.810
<v Speaker 2>comes from mini press news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minipress news.</v>

4238
02:53:50.290 --> 02:53:55.290
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can go into questioning sources all </v>

4239
02:53:55.290 --> 02:53:57.090
<v Speaker 2>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have someone else bringing up </v>

4240
02:53:57.090 --> 02:53:57.090
<v Speaker 2>something just as a good source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think maybe,</v>

4241
02:53:57.090 --> 02:53:57.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're right crowder,</v>

4242
02:53:57.161 --> 02:54:00.100
<v Speaker 2>but let's say what letter can we sourced</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to something else?</v>

4243
02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I know you guys went on one issue and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

4244
02:54:03.070 --> 02:54:03.820
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the issue?</v>

4245
02:54:03.821 --> 02:54:05.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't care about your sources right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

4246
02:54:05.501 --> 02:54:10.501
<v Speaker 2>I've looked them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people online also sourcing </v>

4247
02:54:10.501 --> 02:54:10.501
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are skewed.</v>

4248
02:54:10.501 --> 02:54:14.490
<v Speaker 2>You're skewing them to make ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Washington post study that you </v>

4249
02:54:14.490 --> 02:54:14.490
<v Speaker 2>skewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not the Washington post.</v>

4250
02:54:14.490 --> 02:54:15.990
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be the answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington post.</v>

4251
02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:18.160
<v Speaker 2>The Washington post.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't say that someone's evil,</v>

4252
02:54:18.161 --> 02:54:20.290
<v Speaker 2>so I'm evil to what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

4253
02:54:20.291 --> 02:54:22.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the argument that you just know I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't make that better.</v>

4254
02:54:22.690 --> 02:54:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

4255
02:54:24.401 --> 02:54:27.040
<v Speaker 2>It's made that argument and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden when someone mentions pot,</v>

4256
02:54:27.070 --> 02:54:32.070
<v Speaker 2>you put on the along your worldview with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lens of we know you get upset with </v>

4257
02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:36.310
<v Speaker 2>holy shit has nothing to do with eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you haven't made an argument.</v>

4258
02:54:36.490 --> 02:54:38.040
<v Speaker 2>I haven't made an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

4259
02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:41.720
<v Speaker 2>we showed you what he wrote about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>app.</v>

4260
02:54:41.830 --> 02:54:46.830
<v Speaker 2>What have you shown me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We showed you the statistics show that </v>

4261
02:54:46.830 --> 02:54:49.651
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and traffic violations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may not be causal accident.</v>

4262
02:54:50.301 --> 02:54:52.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4263
02:54:52.810 --> 02:54:57.730
<v Speaker 2>so what else is causing the drop number </v>
<v Speaker 2>and why keep increasing number?</v>

4264
02:54:57.850 --> 02:55:00.480
<v Speaker 2>What increased?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fake increase from failure?</v>

4265
02:55:00.490 --> 02:55:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Bringing fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>

4266
02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:05.060
<v Speaker 2>It's real cowboy shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>

4267
02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Is it real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was this?</v>

4268
02:55:06.501 --> 02:55:09.340
<v Speaker 2>It comes from is aaa study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was trip lands council.</v>

4269
02:55:09.470 --> 02:55:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Aaa is owned by the bilderberg group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know this and now we're </v>

4270
02:55:14.470 --> 02:55:17.660
<v Speaker 2>going to go to cures cancer and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>having meetings and rams has got one.</v>

4271
02:55:17.930 --> 02:55:22.930
<v Speaker 2>One article that says one thing and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>article from Colorado that says there's </v>

4272
02:55:22.930 --> 02:55:24.040
<v Speaker 2>been a decrease in traffic fatalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4273
02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:25.910
<v Speaker 2>You're not willing to recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said,</v>

4274
02:55:25.911 --> 02:55:30.911
<v Speaker 2>let's give that to you because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire conversation started with you </v>

4275
02:55:30.911 --> 02:55:32.630
<v Speaker 2>saying what issue would you change your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind on a pot?</v>

4276
02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Because this argument started with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that it causes more fatalities,</v>

4277
02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:38.590
<v Speaker 2>traffic violations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

4278
02:55:38.620 --> 02:55:40.040
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is you do not care about.</v>

4279
02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I say hot trend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

4280
02:55:43.250 --> 02:55:45.110
<v Speaker 2>What's your opinion on pot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

4281
02:55:45.170 --> 02:55:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I really don't care if people want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke pot.</v>

4282
02:55:46.580 --> 02:55:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a state issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't care.</v>

4283
02:55:48.741 --> 02:55:51.050
<v Speaker 2>I've changed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where as a kid I thought it was harmful.</v>

4284
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say that it causes more traffic </v>

4285
02:55:56.110 --> 02:55:56.110
<v Speaker 2>fatality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you said,</v>

4286
02:55:56.110 --> 02:55:58.790
<v Speaker 2>well let's expand on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What issue do you have with pot?</v>

4287
02:55:58.791 --> 02:56:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the dishonesty where people</v>

4288
02:56:00.681 --> 02:56:03.560
<v Speaker 2>just say it cures cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll end the war on drugs.</v>

4289
02:56:03.810 --> 02:56:06.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely harmless and I have some</v>

4290
02:56:06.471 --> 02:56:07.920
<v Speaker 2>arguments that are entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4291
02:56:07.940 --> 02:56:09.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not entirely harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4292
02:56:09.381 --> 02:56:14.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not without consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consequences are so much leeway there.</v>

4293
02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:16.140
<v Speaker 2>How have you have you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bay,</v>

4294
02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:21.180
<v Speaker 2>big consequences based started from me </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying I probably couldn't care less </v>

4295
02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:24.911
<v Speaker 2>about this out of all the other issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we discussed and you lasered in on </v>

4296
02:56:24.911 --> 02:56:25.650
<v Speaker 2>that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do we disagree on this?</v>

4297
02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:28.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a huge blind spot.</v>

4298
02:56:28.490 --> 02:56:33.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not huge blind spots out there that</v>

4299
02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:38.740
<v Speaker 2>if you say that marijuana is in some Way</v>
<v Speaker 2>or another a dangerous thing.</v>

4300
02:56:39.910 --> 02:56:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that it's not.</v>

4301
02:56:41.230 --> 02:56:42.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say in a dangerous thing.</v>

4302
02:56:44.030 --> 02:56:45.200
<v Speaker 2>What are the consequences?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4303
02:56:45.201 --> 02:56:46.730
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you believe marijuana does,</v>

4304
02:56:46.731 --> 02:56:47.420
<v Speaker 2>for example?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4305
02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:52.480
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get baited into this </v>

4306
02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:52.480
<v Speaker 2>because you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna.</v>

4307
02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:53.570
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to force me to say that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think pot cures cancer and there's</v>

4308
02:56:53.571 --> 02:56:54.890
<v Speaker 2>a big farm now listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke pot.</v>

4309
02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I will ask this.</v>

4310
02:56:56.661 --> 02:56:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the consequences of you come on</v>

4311
02:56:59.390 --> 02:57:02.100
<v Speaker 2>my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to have a discussion about it.</v>

4312
02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're in front of me.</v>

4313
02:57:06.691 --> 02:57:11.691
<v Speaker 2>Why now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you and I right now you're </v>

4314
02:57:11.691 --> 02:57:11.810
<v Speaker 2>having a conversation with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4315
02:57:11.811 --> 02:57:13.190
<v Speaker 2>that's not good to read.</v>

4316
02:57:13.190 --> 02:57:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Smart says it's not fair to have two </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4317
02:57:15.321 --> 02:57:18.770
<v Speaker 2>it's Just like before he take a Room </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no internet.</v>

4318
02:57:18.771 --> 02:57:23.771
<v Speaker 2>Think of amy and I ganged up on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you would have done well in </v>

4319
02:57:23.771 --> 02:57:23.771
<v Speaker 2>that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on man,</v>

4320
02:57:23.771 --> 02:57:26.890
<v Speaker 2>because I want to find out how you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think and want to see if you get </v>

4321
02:57:26.890 --> 02:57:29.710
<v Speaker 2>defensive for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said you think of her and I worked </v>

4322
02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:32.201
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you would have done well on </v>

4323
02:57:32.201 --> 02:57:32.201
<v Speaker 2>that because I want to see if you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive,</v>

4324
02:57:32.201 --> 02:57:35.510
<v Speaker 2>but when someone's coming into </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone that you do </v>

4325
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.510
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4326
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4327
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:36.440
<v Speaker 2>but you've made it the hall about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pod issue.</v>

4328
02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:38.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had nothing to do with pod.</v>

4329
02:57:38.151 --> 02:57:43.151
<v Speaker 2>The amy shouldn't have gotten into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>pot issue because of the issue was </v>

4330
02:57:43.151 --> 02:57:45.080
<v Speaker 2>brought up and it's the one area that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're super,</v>

4331
02:57:45.081 --> 02:57:48.140
<v Speaker 2>super adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're adorable,</v>

4332
02:57:48.170 --> 02:57:49.190
<v Speaker 2>and there's the same thing.</v>

4333
02:57:49.210 --> 02:57:51.580
<v Speaker 2>If you're not a real comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4334
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you're adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to date someone on an open </v>

4335
02:57:56.590 --> 02:57:56.590
<v Speaker 2>territory without someone else to back </v>
<v Speaker 2>up your argument.</v>

4336
02:57:56.590 --> 02:58:01.331
<v Speaker 2>It's never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it looks back up when someone pulls </v>

4337
02:58:01.331 --> 02:58:01.331
<v Speaker 2>up information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me check.</v>

4338
02:58:01.331 --> 02:58:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Really does is he pulls up evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the contrary.</v>

4339
02:58:04.170 --> 02:58:09.170
<v Speaker 2>If I was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would stick it right in my face and </v>

4340
02:58:09.170 --> 02:58:09.170
<v Speaker 2>we would laugh about it and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

4341
02:58:09.170 --> 02:58:10.570
<v Speaker 2>That's why he pulled up a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country,</v>

4342
02:58:10.571 --> 02:58:13.140
<v Speaker 2>and I've given it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What tense do you haven't given me?</v>

4343
02:58:13.141 --> 02:58:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I've given you the argument.</v>

4344
02:58:15.100 --> 02:58:16.560
<v Speaker 2>What are your command?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

4345
02:58:16.561 --> 02:58:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no causation.</v>

4346
02:58:18.031 --> 02:58:19.740
<v Speaker 2>let's say that wasn't backed up well </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

4347
02:58:19.741 --> 02:58:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Let's give you the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4348
02:58:21.030 --> 02:58:26.030
<v Speaker 2>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie was also some evidence that </v>

4349
02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:27.980
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana laws to decrease in </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>

4350
02:58:28.390 --> 02:58:30.720
<v Speaker 2>What of me doing this though?</v>

4351
02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:32.430
<v Speaker 2>If we don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we always do.</v>

4352
02:58:32.431 --> 02:58:34.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just talking about facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

4353
02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:36.740
<v Speaker 2>hold please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some.</v>

4354
02:58:37.350 --> 02:58:40.500
<v Speaker 2>There are also some evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical that doesn't make any sense.</v>

4355
02:58:40.501 --> 02:58:43.800
<v Speaker 2>There are also some evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also.</v>

4356
02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:49.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that medical marijuana laws may </v>

4357
02:58:49.600 --> 02:58:49.600
<v Speaker 2>contribute to decreasing traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatalities.</v>

4358
02:58:49.600 --> 02:58:53.130
<v Speaker 2>One study published in the journal of </v>
<v Speaker 2>law and economics in 2013,</v>

4359
02:58:53.131 --> 02:58:58.131
<v Speaker 2>reviewed traffic fatalities in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>states that have passed medical </v>

4360
02:58:58.131 --> 02:59:01.521
<v Speaker 2>marijuana laws by 2010 and found that </v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization is associated with an eight</v>

4361
02:59:02.701 --> 02:59:07.701
<v Speaker 2>to 11 percent decrease in traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatalities for the year after the laws </v>

4362
02:59:07.701 --> 02:59:12.291
<v Speaker 2>took effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The researchers from the university of </v>

4363
02:59:12.291 --> 02:59:14.271
<v Speaker 2>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denver and elsewhere also found the </v>

4364
02:59:14.271 --> 02:59:16.980
<v Speaker 2>decrease is more significant for alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 2>related fatalities.</v>

4365
02:59:16.981 --> 02:59:19.380
<v Speaker 2>At 13 point two percent ask a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4366
02:59:19.381 --> 02:59:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask a question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>

4367
02:59:20.970 --> 02:59:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Why is that study from 2010 considered </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely valid to you in the study </v>

4368
02:59:25.970 --> 02:59:27.980
<v Speaker 2>from aaa in 2014 considered completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>triple a's.</v>

4369
02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:30.990
<v Speaker 2>GoT a fucking biased in ago because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

4370
02:59:31.940 --> 02:59:34.460
<v Speaker 2>The gas company and have different </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions.</v>

4371
02:59:34.461 --> 02:59:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4372
02:59:35.311 --> 02:59:38.280
<v Speaker 2>what are they basing it on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What your argument is?</v>

4373
02:59:38.281 --> 02:59:40.950
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the only valid study because aaa</v>

4374
02:59:40.951 --> 02:59:42.300
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a study.</v>

4375
02:59:42.940 --> 02:59:44.490
<v Speaker 2>You ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's right?</v>

4376
02:59:44.491 --> 02:59:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I think they're lying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4377
02:59:45.960 --> 02:59:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it could be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they're right,</v>

4378
02:59:47.401 --> 02:59:48.840
<v Speaker 2>if that studies right then you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

4379
02:59:48.841 --> 02:59:49.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that.</v>

4380
02:59:49.741 --> 02:59:51.560
<v Speaker 2>What if that study's right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew right?</v>

4381
02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were wrong,</v>

4382
02:59:53.101 --> 02:59:54.540
<v Speaker 2>right when you were just shouting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

4383
02:59:54.630 --> 02:59:56.700
<v Speaker 2>So we proved that in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were wrong.</v>

4384
02:59:56.701 --> 02:59:58.110
<v Speaker 2>You didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that study is true,</v>

4385
02:59:58.310 --> 03:00:00.270
<v Speaker 2>well you didn't prep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said if that's what you do,</v>

4386
03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:06.090
<v Speaker 2>what can to ask one question and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a paragraph.</v>

4387
03:00:06.810 --> 03:00:08.410
<v Speaker 2>You're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you,</v>

4388
03:00:08.590 --> 03:00:13.590
<v Speaker 2>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give it to you win the argument and </v>

4389
03:00:13.590 --> 03:00:13.920
<v Speaker 2>you bring up another thing about pot.</v>

4390
03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because you don't.</v>

4391
03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:18.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't really give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You reluctantly give up.</v>

4392
03:00:18.450 --> 03:00:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Give it to your right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's assume you're definitely wrong.</v>

4393
03:00:21.301 --> 03:00:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Let's assume I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

4394
03:00:22.411 --> 03:00:24.960
<v Speaker 2>So what else would be the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana if it wasn't?</v>

4395
03:00:24.961 --> 03:00:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Traffic fatalities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero,</v>

4396
03:00:26.401 --> 03:00:27.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4397
03:00:27.241 --> 03:00:28.560
<v Speaker 2>not zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

4398
03:00:28.561 --> 03:00:30.310
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to spend the entire day</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

4399
03:00:30.730 --> 03:00:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's come on man.</v>

4400
03:00:31.561 --> 03:00:33.060
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about real issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would it be?</v>

4401
03:00:33.061 --> 03:00:35.430
<v Speaker 2>The other problems it wasn't for </v>
<v Speaker 2>different before you go,</v>

4402
03:00:35.431 --> 03:00:36.330
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just loosen up.</v>

4403
03:00:36.331 --> 03:00:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about life in jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you get into one thing.</v>

4404
03:00:39.110 --> 03:00:40.470
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk.</v>

4405
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I just want to get you away from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>left versus right talking points because</v>

4406
03:00:44.090 --> 03:00:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky because people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>convictions paradigm,</v>

4407
03:00:47.940 --> 03:00:52.900
<v Speaker 2>bertrand russell for central.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda am joe.</v>

4408
03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

4409
03:00:54.210 --> 03:00:57.480
<v Speaker 2>and I started off very and I still mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>the complementary things I said,</v>

4410
03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:01.800
<v Speaker 2>but you can't bring people on and called</v>
<v Speaker 2>them pussy and dumped box.</v>

4411
03:01:02.570 --> 03:01:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I cAn then continue going back to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue and with with someone who agrees </v>

4412
03:01:07.631 --> 03:01:10.020
<v Speaker 2>with you entirely and act as though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4413
03:01:10.030 --> 03:01:11.380
<v Speaker 2>someone will now you're defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4414
03:01:11.381 --> 03:01:12.550
<v Speaker 2>of course I'm defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4415
03:01:12.551 --> 03:01:17.551
<v Speaker 2>I think that you were spewing a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of anti marijuana propaganda about </v>

4416
03:01:17.551 --> 03:01:20.140
<v Speaker 2>traffic fatalities that I had an address</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a pair of propaganda.</v>

4417
03:01:20.170 --> 03:01:23.350
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unpaid bond payments paid by anybody,</v>

4418
03:01:23.351 --> 03:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>but I just think you had a point of view</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pushed the propaganda,</v>

4419
03:01:26.710 --> 03:01:31.710
<v Speaker 2>but propaganda by definition means I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be pushing for someone </v>

4420
03:01:31.710 --> 03:01:32.650
<v Speaker 2>necessarily that someone is telling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

4421
03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:37.680
<v Speaker 2>it's just that you had a point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's propaganda you had dug your heels </v>

4422
03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:38.400
<v Speaker 2>in and it's not propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong.</v>

4423
03:01:38.990 --> 03:01:42.760
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong if you have read it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are spouting it out,</v>

4424
03:01:42.761 --> 03:01:44.710
<v Speaker 2>but that statistics prove different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4425
03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:47.950
<v Speaker 2>and then I would say it's propaganda or </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone takes yours cancer.</v>

4426
03:01:48.070 --> 03:01:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you're promoting pump </v>
<v Speaker 2>again to like someone.</v>

4427
03:01:50.900 --> 03:01:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull that up.</v>

4428
03:01:52.391 --> 03:01:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Then we can find out what not saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>cures.</v>

4429
03:01:55.090 --> 03:01:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Does that matter why it has my </v>
<v Speaker 2>unofficial effect?</v>

4430
03:01:57.281 --> 03:01:57.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4431
03:01:57.701 --> 03:01:58.600
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't my claim.</v>

4432
03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Yours cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

4433
03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Treat cancer and that was what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

4434
03:02:02.951 --> 03:02:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I literally will get nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cures anything mean things.</v>

4435
03:02:06.090 --> 03:02:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Truth of your listeners will tweet me </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that cures anything.</v>

4436
03:02:10.211 --> 03:02:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Things treat things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your immune system kicks in.</v>

4437
03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:15.580
<v Speaker 2>System fails of drugs like heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

4438
03:02:15.581 --> 03:02:18.160
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What trulio cures things.</v>

4439
03:02:18.190 --> 03:02:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Polio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaccine.</v>

4440
03:02:19.350 --> 03:02:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Polio vaccine doesn't cure things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

4441
03:02:21.311 --> 03:02:26.311
<v Speaker 2>It prevents you from getting polio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disease is you understand what you just </v>

4442
03:02:26.311 --> 03:02:27.160
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just yourself.</v>

4443
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:32.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the disease is not </v>

4444
03:02:32.190 --> 03:02:32.190
<v Speaker 2>effectively cured in the person who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>polio.</v>

4445
03:02:32.190 --> 03:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about marijuana curing </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer on people that don't have cancer </v>

4446
03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what.</v>

4447
03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:40.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not a vaccine for cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're saying is marijuana cures </v>

4448
03:02:40.630 --> 03:02:41.380
<v Speaker 2>cancer with people that have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a fucking drug.</v>

4449
03:02:41.410 --> 03:02:46.410
<v Speaker 2>You proved yourself not only agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine that proves that you can't </v>

4450
03:02:46.631 --> 03:02:51.631
<v Speaker 2>fucking cure polio with a medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get so aggressive on your example </v>

4451
03:02:55.510 --> 03:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a blind spot.</v>

4452
03:02:56.950 --> 03:02:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure there's drugs out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cure some diseases.</v>

4453
03:02:59.770 --> 03:03:01.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of them.</v>

4454
03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

4455
03:03:03.371 --> 03:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>You know their name one not off hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had someone who could bring it up,</v>

4456
03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to bring it up,</v>

4457
03:03:08.591 --> 03:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to argue for it.</v>

4458
03:03:09.821 --> 03:03:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't argue for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

4459
03:03:14.010 --> 03:03:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that's incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in.</v>

4460
03:03:16.270 --> 03:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Your immune system has to be in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are a fuck,</v>

4461
03:03:19.151 --> 03:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>if you're dying and someone gives you </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a drug,</v>

4462
03:03:23.290 --> 03:03:28.290
<v Speaker 2>how many drugs are there that cure a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty disease that's killing you and how</v>

4463
03:03:28.571 --> 03:03:31.690
<v Speaker 2>many of them have to be also </v>
<v Speaker 2>compensated?</v>

4464
03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Your immune system has to kick in as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

4465
03:03:33.221 --> 03:03:35.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like how many.</v>

4466
03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's penicillin that kills </v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

4467
03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Some like venereal diseases and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of different.</v>

4468
03:03:41.441 --> 03:03:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Fucking horrible infections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot,</v>

4469
03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:47.990
<v Speaker 2>but it takes your immune system has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be an effect too.</v>

4470
03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:49.250
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of factors.</v>

4471
03:03:49.270 --> 03:03:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cure and saying,</v>

4472
03:03:51.210 --> 03:03:56.210
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're talking about fucking </v>

4473
03:03:56.210 --> 03:03:56.210
<v Speaker 2>polio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing curious.</v>

4474
03:03:56.210 --> 03:03:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Polio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch and marijuana.</v>

4475
03:03:56.210 --> 03:03:58.040
<v Speaker 2>No one's saying marijuana all the time.</v>

4476
03:03:58.220 --> 03:03:59.690
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you're assholes.</v>

4477
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Does people that say you're a nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those the same people that say you're a </v>

4478
03:04:04.990 --> 03:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>nazi?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4479
03:04:04.990 --> 03:04:05.190
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty funky.</v>

4480
03:04:05.191 --> 03:04:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Nazi punching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

4481
03:04:06.771 --> 03:04:09.800
<v Speaker 1>we had a woman on the show at a woman on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show psychiatrist who basically said</v>

4482
03:04:09.801 --> 03:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4483
03:04:10.610 --> 03:04:13.970
<v Speaker 1>people who are adult healthy smoke pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably not a problem.</v>

4484
03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:16.280
<v Speaker 1>So it is a problem for [inaudible] for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the developing brain.</v>

4485
03:04:16.281 --> 03:04:19.460
<v Speaker 1>People who are under the age of 25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She explained as to what the correct.</v>

4486
03:04:19.630 --> 03:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Then she explained as to why it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they,</v>

4487
03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:24.140
<v Speaker 1>they think that the human brain is even </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully developed.</v>

4488
03:04:24.180 --> 03:04:29.180
<v Speaker 1>You're not text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she talked about specifically also </v>

4489
03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>people who might have mental illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's schizophrenia,</v>

4490
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>bipolar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't realize that or </v>

4491
03:04:34.510 --> 03:04:36.221
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes unrecognized and she talked </v>

4492
03:04:36.221 --> 03:04:38.531
<v Speaker 1>about how for those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana can act as a trigger </v>

4493
03:04:38.531 --> 03:04:38.531
<v Speaker 1>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she said,</v>

4494
03:04:38.531 --> 03:04:38.600
<v Speaker 1>healthy people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of these conditions,</v>

4495
03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:43.960
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is probably relatively benign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some of these people and most </v>

4496
03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:44.300
<v Speaker 1>people who might have these conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>are afflicted by them.</v>

4497
03:04:44.570 --> 03:04:47.660
<v Speaker 1>It could be a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got some very good points,</v>

4498
03:04:47.661 --> 03:04:50.600
<v Speaker 1>but dna are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd cures cancer.</v>

4499
03:04:50.601 --> 03:04:52.640
<v Speaker 1>This dumb bitch should get off the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>

4500
03:04:52.670 --> 03:04:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells in laboratory testing.</v>

4501
03:04:55.761 --> 03:05:00.761
<v Speaker 1>question six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that doesn't cure cancer </v>

4502
03:05:00.761 --> 03:05:00.761
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>KiLl cancer cells.</v>

4503
03:05:00.761 --> 03:05:02.060
<v Speaker 1>No one's saying cure cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beneficial effects.</v>

4504
03:05:02.061 --> 03:05:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you exactly what people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you compared it to tumeric.</v>

4505
03:05:05.511 --> 03:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>You compare these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

4506
03:05:07.930 --> 03:05:12.930
<v Speaker 1>the the point being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you agree and I agree that as </v>

4507
03:05:12.930 --> 03:05:17.621
<v Speaker 1>long as it doesn't hurt other people any</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than anything else like sugar </v>

4508
03:05:17.621 --> 03:05:17.690
<v Speaker 1>hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

4509
03:05:17.691 --> 03:05:22.691
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make an argument for a </v>

4510
03:05:22.691 --> 03:05:24.740
<v Speaker 1>high insurance rates and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the overall causes of disease in</v>

4511
03:05:24.741 --> 03:05:27.770
<v Speaker 1>this country and why insurance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>health insurance costs so much,</v>

4512
03:05:27.960 --> 03:05:31.310
<v Speaker 1>you would almost immediately go towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple sugar.</v>

4513
03:05:31.700 --> 03:05:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Simple sugar is a huge problem wiTh </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are obese.</v>

4514
03:05:35.810 --> 03:05:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Obesity is a huge issue in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a major factor when it comes to</v>

4515
03:05:40.341 --> 03:05:41.780
<v Speaker 1>healthcare costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4516
03:05:42.620 --> 03:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's adorable that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me how to craft arguments and I </v>

4517
03:05:47.620 --> 03:05:51.061
<v Speaker 1>know that you're not saying that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an easier argument to say that ice </v>

4518
03:05:51.611 --> 03:05:54.530
<v Speaker 1>cream should be illegal and is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana should be illegal.</v>

4519
03:05:54.620 --> 03:05:55.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

4520
03:05:55.480 --> 03:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me why now I'm to.</v>

4521
03:05:57.261 --> 03:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say what I was about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

4522
03:05:58.520 --> 03:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>please stop beforehand because he keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>redirecting the conversation and your </v>

4523
03:06:03.520 --> 03:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>turn and for some reason you're turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into something hostile that it really</v>

4524
03:06:03.520 --> 03:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need to be hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be to you.</v>

4525
03:06:05.870 --> 03:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't feel weird about it.</v>

4526
03:06:07.071 --> 03:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

4527
03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone comes in and somebody where</v>

4528
03:06:09.291 --> 03:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>they know they disagree and someone out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to other people have the same opinion,</v>

4529
03:06:11.571 --> 03:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>are gonna do a team up?</v>

4530
03:06:12.560 --> 03:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even have to think that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing right now,</v>

4531
03:06:15.531 --> 03:06:20.531
<v Speaker 1>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like you talk about what people in </v>

4532
03:06:20.531 --> 03:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>jujitsu is what I think there are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 scientific studies that say that I </v>

4533
03:06:22.100 --> 03:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>think that you think these arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>where cannabis cures cancer.</v>

4534
03:06:23.421 --> 03:06:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that you think he's arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and I think it's like someone going</v>

4535
03:06:25.681 --> 03:06:27.470
<v Speaker 1>to jujitsu for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never done it.</v>

4536
03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you've ever actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten to a place without someone who </v>

4537
03:06:33.010 --> 03:06:35.171
<v Speaker 1>can bring up sources for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you've gotten into an </v>

4538
03:06:35.171 --> 03:06:37.811
<v Speaker 1>argument or done anything with a debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>team where people would actually hold </v>

4539
03:06:37.811 --> 03:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you accountable to the argument that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

4540
03:06:38.060 --> 03:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I think we're redirecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that I have.</v>

4541
03:06:40.341 --> 03:06:42.460
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have never seen,</v>

4542
03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>so what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody with me 24 slash seven slash </v>

4543
03:06:47.620 --> 03:06:49.900
<v Speaker 1>nine point is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll be very surprised right </v>

4544
03:06:49.900 --> 03:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the kung fu guy hitting the kung </v>

4545
03:06:53.020 --> 03:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>fu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with the spikes,</v>

4546
03:06:53.020 --> 03:06:57.190
<v Speaker 1>and you've convinced yourself that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an argument that would work if you </v>

4547
03:06:57.190 --> 03:06:57.190
<v Speaker 1>had other people more</v>

4548
03:06:57.190 --> 03:06:59.750
<v Speaker 2>qualified than myself to discuss it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided to zone in on an artist that</v>

4549
03:07:00.260 --> 03:07:04.260
<v Speaker 2>have you diffusing all these stats that </v>
<v Speaker 2>jamie keeps bringing up.</v>

4550
03:07:04.261 --> 03:07:09.261
<v Speaker 2>There's more than 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Studies exactly proves that cannabis </v>

4551
03:07:09.261 --> 03:07:09.261
<v Speaker 2>cures cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4552
03:07:09.261 --> 03:07:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Do deny the studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a jamie,</v>

4553
03:07:10.270 --> 03:07:11.720
<v Speaker 2>jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's pulling shit off the internet.</v>

4554
03:07:11.790 --> 03:07:15.660
<v Speaker 2>You hiding civically about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I changed my mind so clearly we're</v>

4555
03:07:15.661 --> 03:07:20.661
<v Speaker 2>ready or upset about the pot though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a nice thing about that </v>

4556
03:07:20.661 --> 03:07:24.681
<v Speaker 2>anymore because I don't really care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and I think states should be </v>

4557
03:07:24.681 --> 03:07:24.681
<v Speaker 2>able to legalize it or if she don't care</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

4558
03:07:24.681 --> 03:07:27.300
<v Speaker 2>she fucking touch three followup </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

4559
03:07:27.301 --> 03:07:29.970
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like me asking you why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>endorsed bernie sanders on thIs show.</v>

4560
03:07:29.971 --> 03:07:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Definitely send you info.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

4561
03:07:31.710 --> 03:07:35.340
<v Speaker 2>in the green room with the man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's insane with the socialist stuff.</v>

4562
03:07:35.341 --> 03:07:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's very genuine.</v>

4563
03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:37.380
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

4564
03:07:37.650 --> 03:07:40.050
<v Speaker 2>This is something that appeals to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4565
03:07:40.200 --> 03:07:45.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You started on with traffic fatalities </v>

4566
03:07:45.200 --> 03:07:45.270
<v Speaker 2>and start on I guess on with kevin </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells,</v>

4567
03:07:45.271 --> 03:07:50.271
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is she up and not talk about and </v>

4568
03:07:50.271 --> 03:07:50.271
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4569
03:07:50.271 --> 03:07:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Because we always occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things he used was </v>

4570
03:07:54.770 --> 03:07:59.680
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no active conversation that </v>

4571
03:07:59.680 --> 03:07:59.680
<v Speaker 2>comes from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

4572
03:07:59.680 --> 03:08:00.210
<v Speaker 2>There is no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For people who are listening to this,</v>

4573
03:08:00.211 --> 03:08:05.211
<v Speaker 2>this is extremely productive because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand how someone with </v>

4574
03:08:05.211 --> 03:08:05.770
<v Speaker 2>blinders could ignore the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4575
03:08:05.970 --> 03:08:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And figure out some way where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>being wronged intellectually.</v>

4576
03:08:10.470 --> 03:08:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Someone like someone will say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4577
03:08:12.931 --> 03:08:15.600
<v Speaker 2>you should be in some sort of a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've never been in a debate.</v>

4578
03:08:15.601 --> 03:08:17.340
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what fucking debates I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been in.</v>

4579
03:08:17.520 --> 03:08:19.950
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No televised.</v>

4580
03:08:19.951 --> 03:08:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you don't know what I'm calling</v>

4581
03:08:22.981 --> 03:08:23.490
<v Speaker 2>you on your bullshit.</v>

4582
03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:29.790
<v Speaker 2>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a conversation with you </v>

4583
03:08:29.790 --> 03:08:32.930
<v Speaker 2>and steven were having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this bullyiNg?</v>

4584
03:08:33.550 --> 03:08:35.970
<v Speaker 2>It's because there are two people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold one opinion,</v>

4585
03:08:35.971 --> 03:08:37.590
<v Speaker 2>asked me on something that I don't care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

4586
03:08:37.591 --> 03:08:42.591
<v Speaker 2>Followup three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four questIons to go into an area where </v>

4587
03:08:42.591 --> 03:08:43.290
<v Speaker 2>you two are so very specifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate and I said,</v>

4588
03:08:43.291 --> 03:08:48.291
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to talk about it because </v>

4589
03:08:48.291 --> 03:08:48.291
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4590
03:08:48.291 --> 03:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to tell because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>care because he keeps showing stage.</v>

4591
03:08:48.681 --> 03:08:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Want to legalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine,</v>

4592
03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:55.160
<v Speaker 2>but it is a valid issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people of Colorado are looking at </v>

4593
03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:58.071
<v Speaker 2>this now and there are people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado who might vote differently on </v>

4594
03:08:58.071 --> 03:09:01.101
<v Speaker 2>the marijuana issue because of how it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived or because of the information </v>

4595
03:09:01.101 --> 03:09:04.431
<v Speaker 2>at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe that people in Colorado </v>

4596
03:09:04.431 --> 03:09:04.431
<v Speaker 2>she be able to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They voted for pot,</v>

4597
03:09:04.431 --> 03:09:07.580
<v Speaker 2>but if they want to vote the other way </v>
<v Speaker 2>in states they have the right to do </v>

4598
03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:07.580
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4599
03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Who's arguing against that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4600
03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:09.150
<v Speaker 2>that was my point when we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about marijuana.</v>

4601
03:09:09.180 --> 03:09:14.180
<v Speaker 2>My point was when I worked at fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were thrust under panels where you </v>

4602
03:09:14.180 --> 03:09:16.470
<v Speaker 2>had to talk about this because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in Colorado.</v>

4603
03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you called me a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a left wing arc.</v>

4604
03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:20.850
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>

4605
03:09:21.090 --> 03:09:24.000
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare is how early you are,</v>

4606
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:25.490
<v Speaker 2>but you fax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4607
03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:30.620
<v Speaker 2>you use this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll use these absolutes and call on it </v>

4608
03:09:30.620 --> 03:09:30.620
<v Speaker 2>and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

4609
03:09:30.620 --> 03:09:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm just joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm joking.</v>

4610
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:32.250
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

4611
03:09:32.610 --> 03:09:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4612
03:09:33.181 --> 03:09:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you one that I can pull from</v>
<v Speaker 2>my memory to.</v>

4613
03:09:35.490 --> 03:09:38.070
<v Speaker 2>All of them are on alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that did.</v>

4614

<v Speaker 2>Fuck that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but we were supposed to be a productive </v>

4616
03:09:43.971 --> 03:09:43.971
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be doing that.</v>

4617
03:09:43.971 --> 03:09:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a large number.</v>

4618

<v Speaker 2>one of those company.</v>

4619

<v Speaker 1>Could be in Ethiopia right now.</v>

4629
03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Huddling in a fucking hut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4630
03:10:12.190 --> 03:10:14.800
<v Speaker 1>trying to protect yourself from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some rabid animal.</v>

4631
03:10:14.860 --> 03:10:16.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be scared.</v>

4632
03:10:17.020 --> 03:10:18.970
<v Speaker 1>We're going To be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a little defensive.</v>

4633
03:10:18.971 --> 03:10:23.971
<v Speaker 1>I thought were friends did listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were going to have some </v>

4634
03:10:24.971 --> 03:10:29.971
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were having fun and then toward the </v>

4635
03:10:29.971 --> 03:10:30.460
<v Speaker 1>end of the conversation you asked me </v>
<v Speaker 1>what does she do not care about.</v>

4636
03:10:30.590 --> 03:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care about the pod issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought I cared about when I was</v>

4637
03:10:32.861 --> 03:10:35.170
<v Speaker 1>21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you wouldn't defend issues when</v>

4638
03:10:35.171 --> 03:10:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you were from when you were seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago,</v>

4639
03:10:37.031 --> 03:10:37.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4640
03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:39.310
<v Speaker 1>All of your cells?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every was 21.</v>

4641
03:10:39.670 --> 03:10:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I was probably a lot harsher on pot than</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am today.</v>

4642
03:10:41.411 --> 03:10:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up around it.</v>

4643
03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I had negative experiences and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that was anecdotal.</v>

4644
03:10:46.420 --> 03:10:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care much anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think state should be able to do </v>

4645
03:10:51.420 --> 03:10:51.420
<v Speaker 1>what they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then three,</v>

4646
03:10:51.420 --> 03:10:52.960
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five follow up questions so we could get</v>

4647
03:10:52.961 --> 03:10:55.900
<v Speaker 1>to a point into this debate where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show is now going on two,</v>

4648
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:57.400
<v Speaker 1>three hours long and I've missed my </v>
<v Speaker 1>flight.</v>

4649
03:10:57.430 --> 03:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were trying to say was that people </v>

4650
03:11:02.430 --> 03:11:04.150
<v Speaker 1>that are pro marijuana ignore the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences of marijuana,</v>

4651
03:11:04.151 --> 03:11:07.510
<v Speaker 1>and I asked you what those were and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said traffic fatalities,</v>

4652
03:11:07.780 --> 03:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we tried to find out if that's </v>

4653
03:11:12.780 --> 03:11:13.420
<v Speaker 1>true and we found out it's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out that it's not true.</v>

4654
03:11:13.450 --> 03:11:15.460
<v Speaker 1>You made an argument that it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't.</v>

4655
03:11:15.490 --> 03:11:18.310
<v Speaker 1>We didn't definitively find out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not true statistics.</v>

4656
03:11:18.760 --> 03:11:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just.</v>

4657
03:11:19.570 --> 03:11:21.850
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you ignore opposing statistics.</v>

4658
03:11:21.940 --> 03:11:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's find the claims about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>

4659
03:11:24.250 --> 03:11:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's have jamie miss my flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have another hour to get plenty of </v>

4660
03:11:29.250 --> 03:11:29.740
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

4661
03:11:29.741 --> 03:11:32.200
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get your flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of time.</v>

4662
03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:36.610
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting argument,</v>

4663
03:11:36.670 --> 03:11:41.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting argument because it </v>

4664
03:11:41.670 --> 03:11:43.090
<v Speaker 1>shows what happens when people not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily disagree,</v>

4665
03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:48.300
<v Speaker 1>but getting new position where one </v>
<v Speaker 1>person wants to have the upper hand and </v>

4666
03:11:48.300 --> 03:11:51.331
<v Speaker 1>you keep jockeying back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure out who's going </v>

4667
03:11:51.331 --> 03:11:51.790
<v Speaker 1>to wind up on the top of the heap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4668
03:11:51.970 --> 03:11:56.970
<v Speaker 1>there's no jockeying back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're the one jockeying back and </v>

4669
03:11:56.970 --> 03:11:56.970
<v Speaker 1>fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweetie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>real problem in this country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I disagree with you,</v>

4698

<v Speaker 1>This is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is the difference between you </v>

4701
03:13:06.340 --> 03:13:06.340

03:13:06.340 --> 03:13:07.580
<v Speaker 1>would out jerry talks all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's fair.</v>

4703
03:13:07.880 --> 03:13:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would talk to him to two on one and an</v>

4704
03:13:11.001 --> 03:13:12.970
<v Speaker 1>argument is fair on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

4705
03:13:13.020 --> 03:13:18.020
<v Speaker 1>you know it's not and if he disagrees </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me and you disagree with me </v>

4706
03:13:18.020 --> 03:13:18.020
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can go back and forth all together.</v>

4707
03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I don'T care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind if there's three people.</v>

4708
03:13:20.541 --> 03:13:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Get another friend that hates pot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hate pot.</v>

4709
03:13:23.540 --> 03:13:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just what absolutes.</v>

4710
03:13:26.980 --> 03:13:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Another hates pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4711
03:13:30.681 --> 03:13:32.570
<v Speaker 1>ms dot characterizations and absolutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4712
03:13:32.571 --> 03:13:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't hate pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you do.</v>

4713
03:13:34.190 --> 03:13:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying get a friend who hates pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring get another friend who hates </v>

4714
03:13:39.190 --> 03:13:39.190
<v Speaker 1>pocket another friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

4715
03:13:39.370 --> 03:13:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Get another friend who also picked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

4716
03:13:42.300 --> 03:13:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Jamie looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have used the word also.</v>

4717
03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:46.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the implication there is another</v>

4718
03:13:46.581 --> 03:13:47.840
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hate pot.</v>

4719
03:13:47.870 --> 03:13:48.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

4720
03:13:48.610 --> 03:13:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe,</v>

4721
03:13:49.251 --> 03:13:54.251
<v Speaker 1>get another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't endorse bernie sanders and </v>

4722
03:13:54.251 --> 03:13:56.471
<v Speaker 1>then had a thing on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would imply that the </v>

4723
03:13:56.471 --> 03:13:56.660
<v Speaker 1>documents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he losing argue the argument and</v>

4724
03:13:56.661 --> 03:13:58.310
<v Speaker 1>you continued for another hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

4725
03:13:58.450 --> 03:14:03.450
<v Speaker 1>He didn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave it to me with a caveat and the </v>

4726
03:14:03.450 --> 03:14:05.770
<v Speaker 1>caveat is that I'm a bully and the jamie</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulls up statistics that only benefit on</v>

4727
03:14:05.780 --> 03:14:06.500
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On that argument,</v>

4728
03:14:06.501 --> 03:14:07.460
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

4729
03:14:08.330 --> 03:14:09.350
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How my.</v>

4730
03:14:09.380 --> 03:14:11.270
<v Speaker 1>How is it a bully when two people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

4731
03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:13.040
<v Speaker 1>how's it builds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not two people talking.</v>

4732
03:14:13.041 --> 03:14:18.041
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a conversation with two </v>

4733
03:14:18.041 --> 03:14:18.041
<v Speaker 1>people talking.</v>

4734
03:14:18.041 --> 03:14:20.050
<v Speaker 1>You have a fail safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have other people who agree with </v>

4735
03:14:20.050 --> 03:14:22.121
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an audience who agreeS with </v>

4736
03:14:22.121 --> 03:14:22.121
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on your program talking to homies,</v>

4737
03:14:22.121 --> 03:14:23.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just two people talking.</v>

4738
03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Let me be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hate ponte.</v>

4739
03:14:26.990 --> 03:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't care less if you want to </v>

4740
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If states want to legalize pot.</v>

4741
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't care less about that now.</v>

4742
03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pod is not a substance without </v>

4743
03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

4744
03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:42.170
<v Speaker 1>And some of those consequences can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged to developing brain when they're</v>

4745
03:14:42.171 --> 03:14:47.171
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a psychiatrist on talk about it </v>

4746
03:14:47.171 --> 03:14:47.570
<v Speaker 1>and people called her a dumb bitch who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't weed cures cancer.</v>

4747
03:14:48.130 --> 03:14:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been statistics and reports </v>

4748
03:14:53.130 --> 03:14:53.750
<v Speaker 1>on fatalities increasing regarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

4749
03:14:53.751 --> 03:14:57.050
<v Speaker 1>You may not accept them and maybe you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading those sources.</v>

4750
03:14:57.230 --> 03:14:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your sources are more valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sources.</v>

4751
03:14:59.630 --> 03:15:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll grant you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my issue is when people are dishonest</v>

4752
03:15:03.441 --> 03:15:08.360
<v Speaker 1>and only present one side of the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just presented several sides and on my</v>

4753
03:15:08.361 --> 03:15:10.430
<v Speaker 1>show in a regular basis that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

4754
03:15:10.431 --> 03:15:12.170
<v Speaker 1>if you want to smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't care less.</v>

4755
03:15:12.410 --> 03:15:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the people who have </v>

4756
03:15:17.410 --> 03:15:19.310
<v Speaker 1>tried to make you think reefer madness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wild and wacky tobacky,</v>

4757
03:15:19.311 --> 03:15:24.311
<v Speaker 1>I think that's overblown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also think there are some issues </v>

4758
03:15:24.311 --> 03:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>that people who simply want to justify </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4759
03:15:24.470 --> 03:15:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes a habit which could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative to some people,</v>

4760
03:15:26.990 --> 03:15:31.990
<v Speaker 1>not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm overlooked completely one side of </v>

4761
03:15:31.990 --> 03:15:33.110
<v Speaker 1>the issue and there is an entire side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medical community who disagrees with</v>

4762
03:15:33.111 --> 03:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>you and I don't know that I agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or disagree with them.</v>

4763
03:15:35.361 --> 03:15:40.361
<v Speaker 1>Yet when I'm in the medical community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is entire side to the medical </v>

4764
03:15:40.361 --> 03:15:44.471
<v Speaker 1>community who would disagree with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position and a position to know that I </v>

4765
03:15:44.471 --> 03:15:48.020
<v Speaker 1>that that you think marijuana is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>benign substance?</v>

4766
03:15:48.140 --> 03:15:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's benign to developing</v>

4767
03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:51.300
<v Speaker 2>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We already discussed that.</v>

4768
03:15:51.330 --> 03:15:52.140
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good example.</v>

4769
03:15:52.170 --> 03:15:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Developing brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't.</v>

4770
03:15:53.251 --> 03:15:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think alcohol is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of.</v>

4771
03:15:55.740 --> 03:16:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of kids listen to you.</v>

4772
03:16:00.060 --> 03:16:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you should be 18 years old,</v>

4773
03:16:02.640 --> 03:16:04.530
<v Speaker 2>18 and candidates should be 16 years old</v>
<v Speaker 2>to drive a car.</v>

4774
03:16:04.531 --> 03:16:06.060
<v Speaker 2>You're not telling kids to go and smoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

4775
03:16:06.390 --> 03:16:08.490
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

4776
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:11.580
<v Speaker 2>you have many young listeners who are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that developmental stage.</v>

4777
03:16:11.581 --> 03:16:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Certainly under the age of 25 who only </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear the positive virtues,</v>

4778
03:16:16.270 --> 03:16:19.140
<v Speaker 2>extolled the marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're not entirely honest.</v>

4779
03:16:19.350 --> 03:16:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes are not entirely accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

4780
03:16:22.620 --> 03:16:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's necessarily a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing necessarily.</v>

4781
03:16:24.811 --> 03:16:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so a positive thing.</v>

4782
03:16:28.590 --> 03:16:33.590
<v Speaker 2>You talked about how harmful marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be to the developing brain under </v>

4783
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:34.890
<v Speaker 2>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have many times.</v>

4784
03:16:34.920 --> 03:16:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Have you in a way that you've conceded </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's valid?</v>

4785
03:16:36.840 --> 03:16:41.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've said I don't tHink you should do </v>

4786
03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:43.281
<v Speaker 2>anything when I don't think like any 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old to do anything to their brand </v>

4787
03:16:43.281 --> 03:16:47.031
<v Speaker 2>because we don't know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to your brain when you give a </v>

4788
03:16:47.031 --> 03:16:47.031
<v Speaker 2>kid alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

4789
03:16:47.031 --> 03:16:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you probably did it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was the.</v>

4790
03:16:47.781 --> 03:16:49.730
<v Speaker 2>When did you drink first?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old were you?</v>

4791
03:16:50.090 --> 03:16:55.090
<v Speaker 2>probably like 51st beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was 14 the first time I got </v>

4792
03:16:55.090 --> 03:16:55.920
<v Speaker 2>drunk with my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's terrible.</v>

4793
03:16:55.921 --> 03:16:57.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not smart.</v>

4794
03:16:57.570 --> 03:16:59.670
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not smart and I know and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4795
03:16:59.671 --> 03:17:04.671
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure we all know someone who did</v>
<v Speaker 2>get completely overindulgent and </v>

4796
03:17:04.671 --> 03:17:09.311
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and became one of those wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bake people that ruined their lives </v>

4797
03:17:09.311 --> 03:17:11.160
<v Speaker 2>and I think people can do that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost any substance.</v>

4798
03:17:11.190 --> 03:17:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least I think people do that with </v>

4799
03:17:16.190 --> 03:17:18.921
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes where they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need that fucking cigarette more </v>

4800
03:17:18.921 --> 03:17:21.921
<v Speaker 2>than they need anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of aa people do that with </v>

4801
03:17:21.921 --> 03:17:24.891
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They replaced their weird addiction to </v>

4802
03:17:24.891 --> 03:17:26.730
<v Speaker 2>alcohol to something that's not as bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>

4803
03:17:26.790 --> 03:17:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of things for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing mind,</v>

4804
03:17:29.490 --> 03:17:34.490
<v Speaker 2>particularly for the developing mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have available to us all the </v>

4805
03:17:34.490 --> 03:17:35.800
<v Speaker 2>time that are really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4806
03:17:35.810 --> 03:17:38.910
<v Speaker 2>and Henry Rollins on here and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about when he was a little kid,</v>

4807
03:17:38.911 --> 03:17:43.911
<v Speaker 2>he was like five year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put him on ritalin at the time it </v>

4808
03:17:43.911 --> 03:17:44.100
<v Speaker 2>was five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fucking horrible.</v>

4809
03:17:44.101 --> 03:17:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I think psych meds for little kids that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't necessarily need them,</v>

4810
03:17:46.891 --> 03:17:48.390
<v Speaker 2>but maybe they're just a little too </v>
<v Speaker 2>energetic.</v>

4811
03:17:48.690 --> 03:17:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I think all that shit's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whether it's marijuana or alcohol or </v>

4812
03:17:53.690 --> 03:17:57.471
<v Speaker 2>quaaludes or whatever you want to give a</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 year old kid that's got a developing </v>

4813
03:17:57.471 --> 03:17:59.400
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's massive consequences and</v>

4814
03:17:59.401 --> 03:18:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can really calculate </v>
<v Speaker 2>those consequences.</v>

4815
03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:06.920
<v Speaker 2>That's my position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can calculate those </v>

4816
03:18:06.920 --> 03:18:10.071
<v Speaker 2>consequences and when I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you would have to fuck up a </v>

4817
03:18:10.071 --> 03:18:12.771
<v Speaker 2>lot of kids in order to really prove the</v>
<v Speaker 2>viability of what damage is being done </v>

4818
03:18:12.771 --> 03:18:17.541
<v Speaker 2>to kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much would cause the damage </v>

4819
03:18:17.541 --> 03:18:18.090
<v Speaker 2>about ritalin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking about quaaludes alcohol,</v>

4820
03:18:18.091 --> 03:18:19.620
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

4821
03:18:19.890 --> 03:18:21.630
<v Speaker 2>preludes in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4822
03:18:21.690 --> 03:18:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Quail eludes oxies go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go with oxycontin's.</v>

4823
03:18:24.181 --> 03:18:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about downer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm talking about anything where it's</v>

4824
03:18:26.521 --> 03:18:31.521
<v Speaker 2>a depressant or stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's significant amount of effects </v>

4825
03:18:31.521 --> 03:18:31.980
<v Speaker 2>across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitch quit by the way.</v>

4826
03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just classified as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcotic.</v>

4827
03:18:34.070 --> 03:18:35.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a downer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

4828
03:18:35.500 --> 03:18:39.510
<v Speaker 2>like a benzodiazepine or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aren't opiates considered a downer?</v>

4829
03:18:40.740 --> 03:18:42.460
<v Speaker 2>COnsidered barbiturates?</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there.</v>

4830
03:18:42.540 --> 03:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I think there's it a depressant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol is a depressant,</v>

4831
03:18:44.731 --> 03:18:49.731
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the central nervous system </v>

4832
03:18:49.731 --> 03:18:49.731
<v Speaker 2>depressant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know something like</v>

4833
03:18:49.731 --> 03:18:52.090
<v Speaker 1>food or I'm actually knew a power lifter</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the only drug he could.</v>

4834
03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:54.040
<v Speaker 1>It was a prescriptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember this to date rape drug.</v>

4835
03:18:54.340 --> 03:18:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Was it prescribed drug?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy named Chad,</v>

4836
03:18:57.120 --> 03:18:59.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the date rape drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4837
03:18:59.170 --> 03:19:00.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever the most common date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape drug,</v>

4838
03:19:00.731 --> 03:19:05.731
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's actually rueful in </v>

4839
03:19:05.731 --> 03:19:05.731
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4840
03:19:05.731 --> 03:19:06.760
<v Speaker 1>but most commonly used or the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective date rape drug.</v>

4841
03:19:06.780 --> 03:19:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4842
03:19:08.920 --> 03:19:10.540
<v Speaker 1>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not coming to me.</v>

4843
03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I know the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

4844
03:19:11.651 --> 03:19:14.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird one where it helps </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilders sleep.</v>

4845
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Power lifter and power lifters do it too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it actually infers more </v>

4846
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.460
<v Speaker 1>developed growth hormone growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4847
03:19:21.520 --> 03:19:26.520
<v Speaker 1>not just growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a recovery time because they have </v>

4848
03:19:26.520 --> 03:19:26.590
<v Speaker 1>like deep sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

4849
03:19:26.591 --> 03:19:28.840
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know wHat I'm talking about.</v>

4850
03:19:28.840 --> 03:19:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Is it used as a date rape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drug hypnosis is not ready to.</v>

4851
03:19:31.450 --> 03:19:31.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

4852
03:19:31.950 --> 03:19:33.080
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's released.</v>

4853
03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:34.600
<v Speaker 1>That's roofie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's another thing.</v>

4854
03:19:34.601 --> 03:19:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually the date rape drug.</v>

4855
03:19:36.340 --> 03:19:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a guy thing he could sleep</v>

4856
03:19:38.981 --> 03:19:42.250
<v Speaker 1>on and then It became so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribe it anymore.</v>

4857
03:19:42.880 --> 03:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>He had insomnia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had like a kid,</v>

4858
03:19:44.280 --> 03:19:49.280
<v Speaker 1>like an 1100 squat was not quite world </v>
<v Speaker 1>record but close to it and lived out in </v>

<v Speaker 1>Nevada.</v>

4860
03:19:50.320 --> 03:19:55.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the only way he could sleep </v>

4861
03:19:55.320 --> 03:19:55.320
<v Speaker 1>when he wasn't able to get it anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake hostile with me.</v>

4882
03:20:50.951 --> 03:20:52.210
<v Speaker 1>So if I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on bitch,</v>

4883
03:20:52.420 --> 03:20:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I talked to you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't Mean it in a negative.</v>

4884
03:20:54.401 --> 03:20:59.401
<v Speaker 1>I do it like I would do it if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>brian cowen and he would start laughing </v>

4885
03:20:59.401 --> 03:20:59.401
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

4886
03:20:59.401 --> 03:21:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you live in Michigan,</v>

4887
03:21:00.190 --> 03:21:03.760
<v Speaker 1>you get a little sensitive when you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's adorable.</v>

4888
03:21:03.770 --> 03:21:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's listen on a second when you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not meant to and we were joking </v>

4889
03:21:08.770 --> 03:21:10.150
<v Speaker 1>about their topics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on that you lasered in.</v>

4890
03:21:10.151 --> 03:21:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Got serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong.</v>

4891
03:21:12.010 --> 03:21:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's stay on this pounded in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4892
03:21:14.660 --> 03:21:15.520
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4893
03:21:15.540 --> 03:21:17.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just I don't understand the purpose</v>

4894
03:21:17.111 --> 03:21:18.670
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can have some fun.</v>

4895
03:21:19.060 --> 03:21:20.390
<v Speaker 1>So you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's fun.</v>

4896
03:21:21.090 --> 03:21:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you like doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like having,</v>

4897
03:21:22.900 --> 03:21:24.610
<v Speaker 1>you like having someone in disagreeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him?</v>

4898
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:26.660
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going into town?</v>

4899
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Get a little silly like I think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might've got a little silly.</v>

4900
03:21:29.320 --> 03:21:31.310
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a little fun guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little silly did I.</v>

4901
03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Did I bring up the punish you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it's the issue.</v>

4902
03:21:34.661 --> 03:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I care about the least come home and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get away from that.</v>

4903
03:21:37.001 --> 03:21:38.050
<v Speaker 1>We were were free.</v>

4904
03:21:38.080 --> 03:21:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Were out of the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're back on the road.</v>

4905
03:21:40.631 --> 03:21:44.400
<v Speaker 1>We're doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to grab the wheel back.</v>

4906
03:21:44.770 --> 03:21:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Turned towards the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>

4907
03:21:46.970 --> 03:21:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Resist nitrile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hibiscus cold brew tea.</v>

4908
03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:51.350
<v Speaker 1>It's tea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4909
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I had a hibiscus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beer recently.</v>

4910
03:21:53.880 --> 03:21:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Most disgusting they've ever had in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and I love hibiscus tea.</v>

4911
03:21:56.810 --> 03:21:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Just does not work for beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

4912
03:21:58.251 --> 03:22:01.990
<v Speaker 1>If you were in birkenstocks and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you had white dreadlocks,</v>

4913
03:22:02.610 --> 03:22:05.540
<v Speaker 1>you would have thought this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that kombucha beer,</v>

4914
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:07.570
<v Speaker 1>beer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've actually had kombucha?</v>

4915
03:22:07.620 --> 03:22:07.880
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4916
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Kombucha beeR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like a kombucha that's like </v>

4917
03:22:12.910 --> 03:22:15.160
<v Speaker 1>super strong or interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they do it because the </v>

4918
03:22:15.160 --> 03:22:17.450
<v Speaker 1>alcohol with the active culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kombucha should figuratively,</v>

4919
03:22:17.690 --> 03:22:18.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There shouldn't be.</v>

4920
03:22:18.651 --> 03:22:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't have fIgured it.</v>

4921
03:22:19.521 --> 03:22:21.770
<v Speaker 1>They eat it as sugar because of the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>kombucha ferments.</v>

4922
03:22:21.860 --> 03:22:24.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily because gts can boot you</v>

4923
03:22:24.471 --> 03:22:25.610
<v Speaker 1>that you buy at whole foods.</v>

4924
03:22:25.610 --> 03:22:30.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to actually have an id to buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it's more than one half of </v>

4925
03:22:30.610 --> 03:22:34.571
<v Speaker 1>one percent alcohol by volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to show your id and be over </v>

4926
03:22:34.571 --> 03:22:36.350
<v Speaker 1>21 in order to buy kombucha right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that you say that,</v>

4927
03:22:36.351 --> 03:22:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I think I might have tried kombucha beer</v>
<v Speaker 1>once called.</v>

4928
03:22:39.470 --> 03:22:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Can I say the name or is it on good </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibrations and there's one that's okay </v>

4929
03:22:44.470 --> 03:22:48.831
<v Speaker 1>in one that literally tastes like vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a ginger one and there's </v>

4930
03:22:48.831 --> 03:22:52.751
<v Speaker 1>like a bit and one of them I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is I don't remember which </v>

4931
03:22:52.751 --> 03:22:54.791
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's rolling the dice every time you </v>

4932
03:22:54.791 --> 03:22:56.771
<v Speaker 1>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See some people I just tell them about </v>

4933
03:22:56.771 --> 03:22:59.171
<v Speaker 1>kombucha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the positive benefits of </v>

4934
03:22:59.171 --> 03:22:59.750
<v Speaker 1>probiotics and like you should try it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should eat Kimchi and you should</v>

4935
03:22:59.751 --> 03:23:02.420
<v Speaker 1>eat kraut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiefer's great.</v>

4936
03:23:02.600 --> 03:23:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I had a my own culture.</v>

4937
03:23:04.370 --> 03:23:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had a.</v>

4938
03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done key for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did make kombucha myself.</v>

4939
03:23:08.110 --> 03:23:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I've done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiefer's easier.</v>

4940
03:23:10.020 --> 03:23:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Relatable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4941
03:23:10.671 --> 03:23:15.590
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it looks like a slimy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a c brain or cauliflower.</v>

4942
03:23:15.870 --> 03:23:18.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a grain originally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TecHnically it's a grain,</v>

4943
03:23:18.380 --> 03:23:20.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just an active culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bacteria and yeast,</v>

4944
03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:23.780
<v Speaker 1>so lIterally as opposed to yogurt with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>straining or kombucha,</v>

4945
03:23:23.781 --> 03:23:25.490
<v Speaker 1>which you literally just put it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>jar,</v>

4946
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:30.910
<v Speaker 1>put it in on a countertop for a day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strain it and after I think about four </v>

4947
03:23:30.910 --> 03:23:33.410
<v Speaker 1>or five batches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's doubled and then it quadruples it's</v>

4948
03:23:33.411 --> 03:23:38.411
<v Speaker 1>like an investment account and my wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed it when I was on the road </v>

4949
03:23:38.411 --> 03:23:41.111
<v Speaker 1>actually doing standup I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a few shows and I came back and </v>

4950
03:23:41.111 --> 03:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>you have to replace it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise there's no sugar to feed it </v>

4951
03:23:43.990 --> 03:23:46.720
<v Speaker 1>and came back and it looked like a snot </v>
<v Speaker 1>rag and it was something that was the </v>

4952
03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:46.720
<v Speaker 1>end of it and I just buy it at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

4953
03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Kombucha has not really a fungus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's somehow or another like a </v>

4954
03:23:50.720 --> 03:23:54.701
<v Speaker 1>cousin of a fungus and people think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fungus but it's a life form and when </v>

4955
03:23:54.701 --> 03:23:55.760
<v Speaker 1>you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had it at one point in time,</v>

4956
03:23:55.761 --> 03:24:00.761
<v Speaker 1>it was like the size of a laptop and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had this like big salad bowl and I was </v>

4957
03:24:00.761 --> 03:24:02.870
<v Speaker 1>growing kombucha in my refrigerator and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a salad bowl and the tea,</v>

4958
03:24:02.960 --> 03:24:07.960
<v Speaker 1>the whole top of the salad bowl was thIs</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbery sort of life form if that disc </v>

4959
03:24:09.380 --> 03:24:14.380
<v Speaker 1>pancake but it would get big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would get really big and then what I </v>

4960
03:24:14.380 --> 03:24:15.650
<v Speaker 1>would do is I would drain it into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitcher and I would put the picture into</v>

4961
03:24:15.651 --> 03:24:20.651
<v Speaker 1>the fridgerator and then I would put </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of the sugar water and I forget </v>

4962
03:24:20.651 --> 03:24:25.121
<v Speaker 1>what all the ingredients were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know sugar was a part of it </v>

4963
03:24:25.121 --> 03:24:27.851
<v Speaker 1>because the culture had to eat sugar in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to stay alive and then it would </v>

4964
03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:33.160
<v Speaker 1>ferment and the fermentation was a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it and then you would get like some </v>

4965
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:35.420
<v Speaker 1>sort of probiotic benefit from it.</v>

4966
03:24:35.840 --> 03:24:38.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot harder than keefer keefer </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just pour the milk in,</v>

4967
03:24:38.741 --> 03:24:41.000
<v Speaker 1>the lactose is the sugar and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's done.</v>

4968
03:24:41.180 --> 03:24:43.380
<v Speaker 1>What's actually good about it too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4969
03:24:43.530 --> 03:24:46.530
<v Speaker 1>if you read the studies on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two tablespoons of keifer,</v>

4970
03:24:46.531 --> 03:24:51.531
<v Speaker 1>like actual homemade kiefer is tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of microorganisms as opposed to</v>

4971
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.950
<v Speaker 1>yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super good for You.</v>

4972
03:24:53.340 --> 03:24:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And it's higher in protein because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the math,</v>

4973
03:24:56.311 --> 03:24:59.040
<v Speaker 1>so you can still basically at that point</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're left without the lactose.</v>

4974
03:24:59.100 --> 03:25:02.970
<v Speaker 1>So You're left with really just the fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the protein and all the b vitamins.</v>

4975
03:25:02.971 --> 03:25:04.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they,</v>

4976
03:25:04.560 --> 03:25:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I read an article once could not </v>
<v Speaker 1>corroborate this,</v>

4977
03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but they said that goat's milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole goat's milk keifer.</v>

4978
03:25:11.280 --> 03:25:14.640
<v Speaker 1>If you could only have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food would be the most complete food you</v>

4979
03:25:14.641 --> 03:25:15.360
<v Speaker 1>could have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4980
03:25:15.780 --> 03:25:18.880
<v Speaker 1>But what about all your vitamins that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get like fido nutrients?</v>

4981
03:25:19.310 --> 03:25:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not ideal to see if you'd only do </v>

4982
03:25:24.310 --> 03:25:24.310
<v Speaker 1>one because you get the b vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get vitamin d,</v>

4983
03:25:24.310 --> 03:25:25.890
<v Speaker 1>vitamin k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4984
03:25:26.550 --> 03:25:27.720
<v Speaker 1>and that's whatever they said.</v>

4985
03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:32.720
<v Speaker 1>If you could only have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was an article that if </v>

4986
03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you could only have two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like that.</v>

4987
03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:37.340
<v Speaker 1>And egg yolks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever fucked with like some of </v>

4988
03:25:37.340 --> 03:25:39.540
<v Speaker 1>those pharmaceutical grade probiotics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was rhonda?</v>

4989
03:25:39.541 --> 03:25:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Patrick was talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those ones on the podcast.</v>

4990
03:25:41.681 --> 03:25:43.740
<v Speaker 1>She was talking about some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to refrigerate it,</v>

4991
03:25:43.741 --> 03:25:45.270
<v Speaker 1>you buy it as like super.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

4992
03:25:45.271 --> 03:25:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4993
03:25:45.870 --> 03:25:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you.</v>

4994
03:25:46.770 --> 03:25:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4995
03:25:47.190 --> 03:25:52.190
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my producer not get shared had </v>

4996
03:25:52.190 --> 03:25:52.190
<v Speaker 1>ulcerative colitis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he has no.</v>

4997
03:25:52.190 --> 03:25:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to our office bathroom </v>

4998
03:25:56.360 --> 03:25:56.360
<v Speaker 1>four or five times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4999
03:25:56.360 --> 03:26:00.591
<v Speaker 1>the poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a problem one time where I </v>

5000
03:26:00.591 --> 03:26:00.591
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so stressed and know,</v>

5001
03:26:00.591 --> 03:26:02.230
<v Speaker 1>have all these nerve endings where my </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach just,</v>

5002
03:26:02.250 --> 03:26:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I thought oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sort of colitis was getting tested </v>

5003
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.250
<v Speaker 1>for it and just turned out it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>

5004
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:10.170
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put me on these probiotics and it,</v>

5005
03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:15.190
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I did the kiefer at that </v>

5006
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:19.761
<v Speaker 1>actually helped a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be ironic if marijuana was </v>

5007
03:26:19.761 --> 03:26:22.341
<v Speaker 1>really the cure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unity of the entire time that you </v>

5008
03:26:22.341 --> 03:26:22.341
<v Speaker 1>probably would have helped because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have eased the anxiety?</v>

5009
03:26:22.341 --> 03:26:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I bet you it would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might have played.</v>

5010
03:26:23.521 --> 03:26:26.030
<v Speaker 1>It also might've made you more anxious </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it makes people.</v>

5011
03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:27.580
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing you want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

5012
03:26:27.630 --> 03:26:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Here's the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one side of the negative </v>

5013
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:35.300
<v Speaker 1>that people ignore is the paranoia that </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana can do it 100 percent.</v>

5014
03:26:35.731 --> 03:26:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Gives yOu paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have had some friends that were deep,</v>

5015
03:26:38.431 --> 03:26:41.820
<v Speaker 1>deep potheads that one fucking cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey and don't want to go back.</v>

5016
03:26:41.821 --> 03:26:43.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like a monster that's in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>closet,</v>

5017
03:26:44.020 --> 03:26:45.420
<v Speaker 1>has written a waiting to get them.</v>

5018
03:26:45.420 --> 03:26:46.950
<v Speaker 1>When they go to pick out their socks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

5019
03:26:46.990 --> 03:26:51.990
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has this one effect on some people,</v>

5020
03:26:52.171 --> 03:26:57.171
<v Speaker 1>particularly if you take too much of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or if your life is getting away from </v>

5021
03:26:57.171 --> 03:26:57.171
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5022
03:26:57.171 --> 03:27:02.120
<v Speaker 1>if it's like slipping away from you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start wake and bacon and then </v>

5023
03:27:02.120 --> 03:27:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you just don't ever deal with all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

5024
03:27:02.731 --> 03:27:07.731
<v Speaker 1>so they compound and fucking whirlwind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was told daniel of bullshit by my </v>

5025
03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:08.460
<v Speaker 1>shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>SHe say,</v>

5026
03:27:08.470 --> 03:27:11.080
<v Speaker 1>you probably have you done this gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>site testing now.</v>

5027
03:27:11.081 --> 03:27:12.630
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really haven't done it.</v>

5028
03:27:12.690 --> 03:27:13.710
<v Speaker 1>No surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5029
03:27:13.711 --> 03:27:15.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mainly used in psychiatry now,</v>

5030
03:27:15.511 --> 03:27:20.511
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying it's gonna have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of future with determining cancer </v>

5031
03:27:20.511 --> 03:27:23.271
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they actually use it to look for </v>

5032
03:27:23.271 --> 03:27:23.271
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar,</v>

5033
03:27:23.271 --> 03:27:24.570
<v Speaker 1>adhd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can look at your genes.</v>

5034
03:27:24.750 --> 03:27:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor,</v>

5035
03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to butcher this.</v>

5036
03:27:26.220 --> 03:27:28.710
<v Speaker 1>But basically for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5037
03:27:28.770 --> 03:27:30.220
<v Speaker 1>they can look at your dopamine and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

5038
03:27:30.221 --> 03:27:32.650
<v Speaker 1>this is how your genetics work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically if you go,</v>

5039
03:27:33.150 --> 03:27:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they can tell if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>

5040
03:27:34.831 --> 03:27:39.831
<v Speaker 1>but they already have accepted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a video called you </v>

5041
03:27:39.831 --> 03:27:43.671
<v Speaker 1>choose to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my answer is definitively know what </v>

5042
03:27:43.671 --> 03:27:43.671
<v Speaker 1>if it was you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5043
03:27:44.020 --> 03:27:49.020
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't choose a pretty much </v>

5044
03:27:49.020 --> 03:27:49.270
<v Speaker 1>knew when I tuned into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid and I was looking at me</v>

5045
03:27:49.271 --> 03:27:52.090
<v Speaker 1>shit and rachel bilson and the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to screw adam brody,</v>

5046
03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's when you realize you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay.</v>

5047
03:27:55.030 --> 03:27:56.490
<v Speaker 1>If it were me than it'd be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5048
03:27:56.980 --> 03:27:58.360
<v Speaker 1>What does that matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just question.</v>

5049
03:27:58.540 --> 03:28:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Would you be uncomfortable if I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had myeloma in the show because </v>

5050
03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I've talked quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

5051
03:28:03.851 --> 03:28:05.080
<v Speaker 1>That you could look and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5052
03:28:05.081 --> 03:28:05.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's gay.</v>

5053
03:28:06.070 --> 03:28:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe an ulterior motives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would think,</v>

5054
03:28:09.070 --> 03:28:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but with dopamine for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me,</v>

5055
03:28:10.631 --> 03:28:12.920
<v Speaker 1>like we have a relative in the family </v>
<v Speaker 1>who actually um,</v>

5056
03:28:13.330 --> 03:28:18.330
<v Speaker 1>well I should say who has an issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they looked at genes that create </v>

5057
03:28:18.330 --> 03:28:18.330
<v Speaker 1>serotonin and then okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a long.</v>

5058
03:28:18.340 --> 03:28:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Most people have a long a short gene and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to short jeans.</v>

5059
03:28:21.250 --> 03:28:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case with dopamine.</v>

5060
03:28:22.630 --> 03:28:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So like a lot of people who would maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically be addicts or people with adhd</v>

5061
03:28:26.711 --> 03:28:27.970
<v Speaker 1>are people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5062
03:28:28.030 --> 03:28:29.680
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize this until it was a lot</v>

5063
03:28:29.681 --> 03:28:30.790
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

5064
03:28:30.850 --> 03:28:35.850
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to totally exposed myself as </v>

5065
03:28:35.850 --> 03:28:35.850
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to all the angry potheads </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the argument.</v>

5066
03:28:35.850 --> 03:28:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize until I was older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't actually feel the same feelings</v>

5067
03:28:39.461 --> 03:28:41.310
<v Speaker 1>of joy for like pleasure that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't.</v>

5068
03:28:41.950 --> 03:28:43.000
<v Speaker 1>So delving right.</v>

5069
03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:44.260
<v Speaker 1>You know how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your reward center,</v>

5070
03:28:44.261 --> 03:28:46.270
<v Speaker 1>like you do something good bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5071
03:28:46.271 --> 03:28:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I was a b student in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never opened a textbook a because if I</v>

5072
03:28:50.321 --> 03:28:53.050
<v Speaker 1>completed something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a project that was it bumpy.</v>

5073
03:28:53.070 --> 03:28:54.920
<v Speaker 1>LIke I did a project spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5074
03:28:55.050 --> 03:28:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I did a product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the next thing?</v>

5075
03:28:56.051 --> 03:28:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I never really felt that reward center </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the brain.</v>

5076
03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:02.320
<v Speaker 1>And they did this gene site testing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they found that basically have the worst</v>

5077
03:29:02.350 --> 03:29:04.450
<v Speaker 1>genetic pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not entirely accurate,</v>

5078
03:29:04.780 --> 03:29:08.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually increased the efficacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of antidepressants from like a one in a,</v>

5079
03:29:08.381 --> 03:29:12.640
<v Speaker 1>one in two to like a two and three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

5080
03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:17.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can look in and look at </v>

5081
03:29:17.840 --> 03:29:17.840
<v Speaker 1>your genetics more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

5082
03:29:17.840 --> 03:29:18.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to interrupt,</v>

5083
03:29:18.581 --> 03:29:22.480
<v Speaker 1>but are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you taken anti depressants?</v>

5084
03:29:22.860 --> 03:29:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken adhd medication that's on </v>

5085
03:29:27.860 --> 03:29:27.860
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>

5086
03:29:27.860 --> 03:29:28.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to.</v>

5087
03:29:28.220 --> 03:29:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Activity disorder is a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different situation,</v>

5088
03:29:31.150 --> 03:29:34.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's also basically a dopamine </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortage in adhd is.</v>

5089
03:29:35.310 --> 03:29:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why stimulants on people who </v>

5090
03:29:40.310 --> 03:29:41.080
<v Speaker 1>actually have adhd don't rev them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually the zone I'm in,</v>

5091
03:29:41.081 --> 03:29:46.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some studying and they feel like wired </v>

5092
03:29:46.081 --> 03:29:46.720
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before there's nick testing,</v>

5093
03:29:46.730 --> 03:29:48.520
<v Speaker 1>that's how they often tested for it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

5094
03:29:48.521 --> 03:29:51.460
<v Speaker 1>How do you react to this drug and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel wired,</v>

5095
03:29:51.730 --> 03:29:52.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5096
03:29:52.331 --> 03:29:54.820
<v Speaker 1>meet with all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had 600 milligrams of caffeine.</v>

5097
03:29:55.490 --> 03:29:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you probably don't have adhd.</v>

5098
03:29:57.370 --> 03:30:01.320
<v Speaker 1>What kind of shit that they put you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they put you on adhd medication and</v>

5099
03:30:01.321 --> 03:30:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the base of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adderall,</v>

5100
03:30:02.051 --> 03:30:02.820
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5101
03:30:02.821 --> 03:30:04.170
<v Speaker 1>so theY put you on adderall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

5102
03:30:04.230 --> 03:30:05.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken it and I don't,</v>

5103
03:30:05.231 --> 03:30:10.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't take it every day because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>never want to be dependent on how often </v>

5104
03:30:10.231 --> 03:30:10.231
<v Speaker 1>you take it.</v>

5105
03:30:10.231 --> 03:30:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5106
03:30:10.660 --> 03:30:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Couple of times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5107
03:30:11.890 --> 03:30:12.850
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5108
03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:15.790
<v Speaker 1>You just hIt it when you feel down like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I take it is amazing.</v>

5109
03:30:15.791 --> 03:30:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never realized until I took it,</v>

5110
03:30:18.551 --> 03:30:20.980
<v Speaker 1>and this is not an advocate because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's way over prescribed.</v>

5111
03:30:21.100 --> 03:30:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most kids who are,</v>

5112
03:30:23.200 --> 03:30:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should put kids on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

5113
03:30:25.750 --> 03:30:29.170
<v Speaker 1>and I think that most kids or most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who take it don't need it,</v>

5114
03:30:29.560 --> 03:30:34.560
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that there are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with real conditions out there like you </v>

5115
03:30:34.560 --> 03:30:34.560
<v Speaker 1>that can benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5116
03:30:34.560 --> 03:30:38.641
<v Speaker 1>you have a genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we can prove it well because for </v>

5117
03:30:38.641 --> 03:30:38.650
<v Speaker 1>the longest time my wife will hear this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she'll,</v>

5118
03:30:38.710 --> 03:30:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm denied it through and through.</v>

5119
03:30:41.541 --> 03:30:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5120
03:30:42.411 --> 03:30:42.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

5121
03:30:42.951 --> 03:30:44.510
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>

5122
03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:46.550
<v Speaker 1>The adhd is just to get kids whacked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>on ritalin.</v>

5123
03:30:47.000 --> 03:30:47.870
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5124
03:30:47.871 --> 03:30:49.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had people that I would deal with like</v>

5125
03:30:49.221 --> 03:30:54.221
<v Speaker 1>counseling or stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the kicker that would get </v>

5126
03:30:54.221 --> 03:30:55.721
<v Speaker 1>stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had stress management issues and a </v>

5127
03:30:55.721 --> 03:30:55.721
<v Speaker 1>thought about adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5128
03:30:55.721 --> 03:30:55.721
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5129
03:30:55.721 --> 03:30:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

5130
03:30:56.930 --> 03:31:01.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was given a book on adhd and I never,</v>

5131
03:31:01.700 --> 03:31:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I've never finished reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like three pages and moved onto </v>

5132
03:31:06.700 --> 03:31:06.700
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

5133
03:31:06.700 --> 03:31:07.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5134
03:31:07.310 --> 03:31:09.650
<v Speaker 1>let's do this test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole kind of questionnaire deal.</v>

5135
03:31:09.651 --> 03:31:11.270
<v Speaker 1>And it was pretty extensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5136
03:31:11.300 --> 03:31:13.280
<v Speaker 1>short of actually doing a cat scan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5137
03:31:13.281 --> 03:31:18.281
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you test like in the top 99th </v>

5138
03:31:18.281 --> 03:31:18.281
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we did the gene site testing,</v>

5139
03:31:18.281 --> 03:31:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called gene site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

5140
03:31:20.730 --> 03:31:23.270
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty remarkable and I will say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

5141
03:31:23.271 --> 03:31:25.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't get into exactly what it is that</v>

5142
03:31:25.131 --> 03:31:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I've done or what medications I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken,</v>

5143
03:31:26.991 --> 03:31:31.991
<v Speaker 1>but it was certainly life changing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I didn't know what normal people </v>

5144
03:31:31.991 --> 03:31:31.991
<v Speaker 1>felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

5145
03:31:31.991 --> 03:31:32.210
<v Speaker 1>that's really fast.</v>

5146
03:31:32.210 --> 03:31:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And adhd is a fascinating form of a sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a mild mental disorder that's </v>

5147
03:31:38.241 --> 03:31:43.241
<v Speaker 1>extremely frequent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's as frequent as a lot </v>

5148
03:31:43.241 --> 03:31:44.140
<v Speaker 1>of people think that I would give you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's overprescribed.</v>

5149
03:31:44.390 --> 03:31:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do because whenever I say it,</v>

5150
03:31:46.940 --> 03:31:47.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

5151
03:31:47.660 --> 03:31:48.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to,</v>

5152
03:31:48.291 --> 03:31:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I made your add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

5153
03:31:49.250 --> 03:31:49.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5154
03:31:50.080 --> 03:31:51.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5155
03:31:51.471 --> 03:31:52.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that people like to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

5156
03:31:52.951 --> 03:31:54.880
<v Speaker 1>does compensate for them being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>douchebag.</v>

5157
03:31:54.930 --> 03:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Asperger's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5158
03:31:56.050 --> 03:32:01.050
<v Speaker 1>so I'm on the spectrum spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

5159
03:32:02.221 --> 03:32:04.940
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came into it kicking and screaming and</v>

5160
03:32:04.950 --> 03:32:07.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I never did any in school.</v>

5161
03:32:07.731 --> 03:32:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I Just did the bare minimum was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring,</v>

5162
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:15.910
<v Speaker 1>so boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they sort of do an actual </v>

5163
03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:17.440
<v Speaker 1>test iq testing and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we found it like,</v>

5164
03:32:17.450 --> 03:32:19.940
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication doesn't make you smarter.</v>

5165
03:32:20.400 --> 03:32:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my own</v>

5166
03:32:21.700 --> 03:32:26.700
<v Speaker 2>theories about this whole thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do when they take kids and they </v>

5167
03:32:26.700 --> 03:32:30.640
<v Speaker 2>make them all sit in the same school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same class and listen to the same</v>

5168
03:32:30.641 --> 03:32:31.450
<v Speaker 2>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5169
03:32:31.600 --> 03:32:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything in life </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mirrors that and I think </v>

5170
03:32:36.600 --> 03:32:40.021
<v Speaker 2>experiences in life very radically and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that if you looked at nature and </v>

5171
03:32:40.021 --> 03:32:44.101
<v Speaker 2>the great spectrum of survivors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>winners and losers and how genes get </v>

5172
03:32:44.621 --> 03:32:48.280
<v Speaker 2>expressed and how evolution takes place </v>
<v Speaker 2>in nature.</v>

5173
03:32:48.350 --> 03:32:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of different kinds of </v>

5174
03:32:53.350 --> 03:32:53.530
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't we assume there's all sorts</v>

5175
03:32:53.531 --> 03:32:58.531
<v Speaker 2>of different kinds of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you force all people to sit </v>

5176
03:32:58.531 --> 03:32:59.510
<v Speaker 2>down and do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have aberrations.</v>

5177
03:32:59.511 --> 03:33:04.511
<v Speaker 2>You gonna have people that don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you've found something with </v>

5178
03:33:04.511 --> 03:33:06.570
<v Speaker 2>your show and with public speaking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you excel at,</v>

5179
03:33:06.670 --> 03:33:10.150
<v Speaker 2>like you've found this thing like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>renting thing that you could do.</v>

5180
03:33:10.151 --> 03:33:14.170
<v Speaker 2>We could just go on 100 words a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all these different things,</v>

5181
03:33:14.340 --> 03:33:19.340
<v Speaker 2>like you've found this thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever way your brain works,</v>

5182
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:24.750
<v Speaker 2>it works perfectly for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with a standup </v>

5183
03:33:24.750 --> 03:33:25.420
<v Speaker 2>comedian and same thing with a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an author.</v>

5184
03:33:25.450 --> 03:33:27.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that daydream </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time like,</v>

5185
03:33:27.281 --> 03:33:28.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking loser.</v>

5186
03:33:28.181 --> 03:33:30.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's writing books and his fucking</v>

5187
03:33:30.401 --> 03:33:32.230
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give me a god damn laptop,</v>

5188
03:33:32.231 --> 03:33:34.270
<v Speaker 2>but he's going to make a million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5189
03:33:34.271 --> 03:33:34.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5190
03:33:34.770 --> 03:33:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is people they want to </v>

5191
03:33:39.770 --> 03:33:41.890
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably talked about this with </v>

5192
03:33:41.890 --> 03:33:41.890
<v Speaker 1>christina hoff summers actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people who have a lot of those</v>

5193
03:33:41.890 --> 03:33:43.830
<v Speaker 1>kinds of interactions that you talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in the classroom on a daily basis.</v>

5194
03:33:43.860 --> 03:33:46.800
<v Speaker 1>They're called Women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sit down and talk.</v>

5195
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Think about women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get together with a book group,</v>

5196
03:33:48.691 --> 03:33:53.691
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally sit down and listen and </v>

5197
03:33:53.691 --> 03:33:56.580
<v Speaker 1>to listen to someone and that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll sit because they're very </v>

5198
03:33:56.580 --> 03:33:59.781
<v Speaker 1>auditory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way they learned the public </v>

5199
03:33:59.781 --> 03:34:01.311
<v Speaker 1>education system In the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>was designed for girls from the ground </v>

5200
03:34:01.311 --> 03:34:02.340
<v Speaker 1>up and you put boys into a world where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't do well.</v>

5201
03:34:02.490 --> 03:34:07.490
<v Speaker 1>They do not thrive in that atmosphere of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what girls do and that's why girls have </v>

5202
03:34:07.490 --> 03:34:08.430
<v Speaker 1>much higher grades in high school going </v>
<v Speaker 1>into college.</v>

5203
03:34:08.670 --> 03:34:10.110
<v Speaker 1>and then when boys can study at their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own pace,</v>

5204
03:34:10.111 --> 03:34:11.340
<v Speaker 1>they do better on the sats.</v>

5205
03:34:12.260 --> 03:34:13.860
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a great book called out</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild at heart,</v>

5206
03:34:13.861 --> 03:34:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I think by john eldridge that talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

5207
03:34:15.661 --> 03:34:20.661
<v Speaker 1>And this was a long time ago talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about then rather we know boys learn </v>

5208
03:34:20.661 --> 03:34:20.661
<v Speaker 1>better with their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it,</v>

5209
03:34:20.661 --> 03:34:25.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's considered a masculine jim shop or </v>

5210
03:34:25.161 --> 03:34:28.550
<v Speaker 1>not just masculine things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but physical science where you're </v>

5211
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:31.251
<v Speaker 1>working in a laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are subjects where boys actually </v>

5212
03:34:31.251 --> 03:34:34.221
<v Speaker 1>tend to do better than girls often in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school or they rated as something </v>

5213
03:34:34.221 --> 03:34:37.761
<v Speaker 1>they like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of changing the way we do male </v>

5214
03:34:37.761 --> 03:34:38.040
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we try and change little boys and that's</v>

5215
03:34:38.041 --> 03:34:39.420
<v Speaker 1>a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem.</v>

5216
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:40.980
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big reason,</v>

5217
03:34:40.981 --> 03:34:43.440
<v Speaker 1>not because someone was bullied because </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone used the word fag.</v>

5218
03:34:43.680 --> 03:34:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>incidents of depression in young boys in</v>

5219
03:34:46.621 --> 03:34:51.621
<v Speaker 1>particular because you're putting them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an atmosphere where they can't </v>

5220
03:34:51.621 --> 03:34:51.621
<v Speaker 1>possibly succeed.</v>

5221
03:34:51.621 --> 03:34:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think both are problematic,</v>

5222
03:34:52.921 --> 03:34:57.921
<v Speaker 1>but I think the square peg round hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue has been there for the beginning </v>

5223
03:34:57.921 --> 03:34:57.921
<v Speaker 1>of school in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5224
03:34:58.600 --> 03:35:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to be like a proponent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeschooling,</v>

5225
03:35:01.680 --> 03:35:03.760
<v Speaker 1>but really every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5226
03:35:03.780 --> 03:35:08.780
<v Speaker 1>once you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you kind of realized that god </v>

5227
03:35:08.780 --> 03:35:09.180
<v Speaker 1>damn every kid out of the box is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different thing.</v>

5228
03:35:09.360 --> 03:35:10.560
<v Speaker 1>They're just different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5229
03:35:10.561 --> 03:35:15.561
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna homeschool because my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she went to montessori school and she </v>

5230
03:35:15.561 --> 03:35:17.400
<v Speaker 1>went to a public high school or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>private high school.</v>

5231
03:35:17.850 --> 03:35:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's,</v>

5232
03:35:18.840 --> 03:35:19.620
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she basically,</v>

5233
03:35:19.621 --> 03:35:20.670
<v Speaker 1>she's a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's very,</v>

5234
03:35:20.671 --> 03:35:25.671
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she did not do well in a normal </v>

5235
03:35:25.671 --> 03:35:25.671
<v Speaker 1>school at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

5236
03:35:25.671 --> 03:35:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could find a school </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe is more flexible or because </v>

5237
03:35:30.080 --> 03:35:33.940
<v Speaker 1>of the montessori school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socializing is critical for kids and </v>

5238
03:35:33.940 --> 03:35:36.480
<v Speaker 1>socializing during the day where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn about each other,</v>

5239
03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:41.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they learned about interactions and you </v>

5240
03:35:41.720 --> 03:35:41.720
<v Speaker 1>can talk to them too.</v>

5241
03:35:41.720 --> 03:35:41.720
<v Speaker 1>They come home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5242
03:35:41.720 --> 03:35:42.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debbie said something mean to me,</v>

5243
03:35:42.511 --> 03:35:45.510
<v Speaker 1>what did she say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's important.</v>

5244
03:35:45.540 --> 03:35:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you kind of a tale of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeschooled kids.</v>

5245
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't give any names here because </v>

5246
03:35:53.070 --> 03:35:53.070
<v Speaker 1>they'll know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>

5247
03:35:53.070 --> 03:35:54.720
<v Speaker 1>they have a homeschool kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very weird.</v>

5248
03:35:55.560 --> 03:36:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just stare at their screen all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have another family,</v>

5249
03:36:00.031 --> 03:36:01.830
<v Speaker 1>friends who were homeschooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their kids,</v>

5250
03:36:01.890 --> 03:36:06.890
<v Speaker 1>they're the best kids you could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>have in an adult dinner table because </v>

5251
03:36:06.890 --> 03:36:08.400
<v Speaker 1>they put the kids in jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tHink one of them does tennis.</v>

5252
03:36:08.640 --> 03:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>They put kids in all kinds of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

5253
03:36:10.560 --> 03:36:15.560
<v Speaker 1>They travel with the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take them to europe and then </v>

5254
03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:16.590
<v Speaker 1>whenever they have adult get togethers </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's appropriate for kids to be,</v>

5255
03:36:16.591 --> 03:36:18.030
<v Speaker 1>they still have adult night and date </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

5256
03:36:18.750 --> 03:36:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Kids can be there and they'll speak when</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked to speak.</v>

5257
03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:24.120
<v Speaker 1>They don't interrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're able to interact with adults.</v>

5258
03:36:24.121 --> 03:36:28.230
<v Speaker 1>They're probably the most well adjusted </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids I've ever seen and then I have seen</v>

5259
03:36:28.231 --> 03:36:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy,</v>

5260
03:36:29.401 --> 03:36:34.401
<v Speaker 1>homeschooled kids where you do your </v>
<v Speaker 1>class on your ipad and then afterwards </v>

5261
03:36:34.401 --> 03:36:34.530
<v Speaker 1>you get to watch pewdie pie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5262
03:36:34.531 --> 03:36:36.840
<v Speaker 1>play video or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5263
03:36:37.090 --> 03:36:38.410
<v Speaker 1>so it really does come down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

5264
03:36:38.411 --> 03:36:40.900
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that a parent who knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to homeschool kid,</v>

5265
03:36:41.350 --> 03:36:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that's going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the mom is at home with </v>

5266
03:36:46.350 --> 03:36:46.350
<v Speaker 1>the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5267
03:36:46.350 --> 03:36:46.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a huge leg up for this.</v>

5268
03:36:46.691 --> 03:36:51.691
<v Speaker 1>Obviously so many variables as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellect of the parents and what </v>

5269
03:36:51.691 --> 03:36:56.071
<v Speaker 1>their thought processes behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeschooling their kid and what their </v>

5270
03:36:56.071 --> 03:37:00.271
<v Speaker 1>experience level is and how much thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put into it and where they're </v>

5271
03:37:00.271 --> 03:37:01.120
<v Speaker 1>coming from emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>

5272
03:37:01.121 --> 03:37:02.440
<v Speaker 1>intellectually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5273
03:37:02.440 --> 03:37:03.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5274
03:37:03.611 --> 03:37:05.890
<v Speaker 1>the idea of homeschooling is bad or </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeschooling is good.</v>

5275
03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a friends that have hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeschooled,</v>

5276
03:37:08.651 --> 03:37:10.060
<v Speaker 1>three of their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have four kids.</v>

5277
03:37:10.061 --> 03:37:11.800
<v Speaker 1>They homeschool three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids are fine,</v>

5278
03:37:12.370 --> 03:37:14.260
<v Speaker 1>they're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put a lot of work into it.</v>

5279
03:37:14.290 --> 03:37:15.610
<v Speaker 1>They spend a lot of time with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

5280
03:37:15.611 --> 03:37:20.611
<v Speaker 1>They took their kids all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took their kids traveling all </v>

5281
03:37:20.611 --> 03:37:20.611
<v Speaker 1>through europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5282
03:37:20.611 --> 03:37:22.510
<v Speaker 1>they just decided at some point in time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't always homeschool.</v>

5283
03:37:22.520 --> 03:37:27.520
<v Speaker 1>They had done some public school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had done some private school and </v>

5284
03:37:27.520 --> 03:37:28.780
<v Speaker 1>then they got to a point they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like what are we,</v>

5285
03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:30.860
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're tryIng to teach.</v>

5286
03:37:31.150 --> 03:37:36.150
<v Speaker 1>The kids got older into their like </v>
<v Speaker 1>preteens and then their teens and then </v>

5287
03:37:36.150 --> 03:37:40.171
<v Speaker 1>they came to this conclusion like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they are coming back from high </v>

5288
03:37:40.171 --> 03:37:44.181
<v Speaker 1>school with and from middle school with </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not what I want them to be exposed </v>

5289
03:37:45.080 --> 03:37:45.310
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

5290
03:37:45.530 --> 03:37:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Rather I want to be exposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classics.</v>

5291
03:37:48.461 --> 03:37:53.461
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be exposed to life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let just looking at human beings in a </v>

5292
03:37:53.461 --> 03:37:57.211
<v Speaker 1>way that's like open minded and </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling and seeing things and so </v>

5293
03:37:57.211 --> 03:37:58.780
<v Speaker 1>instead of like necessarily just having </v>
<v Speaker 1>them take spanish.</v>

5294
03:37:58.781 --> 03:38:01.570
<v Speaker 1>They lived in Spain for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to Spain and lived there.</v>

5295
03:38:01.890 --> 03:38:04.120
<v Speaker 1>So they think of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy age.</v>

5296
03:38:04.121 --> 03:38:05.310
<v Speaker 1>and you were talking about tucker </v>
<v Speaker 1>carlson.</v>

5297
03:38:05.340 --> 03:38:10.340
<v Speaker 1>She's a middle school teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THink of the enclaves of crazy places </v>

5298
03:38:10.340 --> 03:38:12.250
<v Speaker 1>for these social justice warriors go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>often they go into teaching because it's</v>

5299
03:38:12.251 --> 03:38:14.200
<v Speaker 1>their way to get power of these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

5300
03:38:14.370 --> 03:38:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing that was really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wrote about that on the website and </v>

5301
03:38:19.370 --> 03:38:19.370
<v Speaker 1>what I wrote about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that interview?</v>

5302
03:38:19.370 --> 03:38:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it about that was.</v>

5303
03:38:21.350 --> 03:38:23.860
<v Speaker 1>This is a horrible interview because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's okay with violence in berkeley,</v>

5304
03:38:24.640 --> 03:38:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but what really disturbs me is every </v>
<v Speaker 1>other professor out there who isn't a </v>

5305
03:38:29.640 --> 03:38:33.991
<v Speaker 1>national story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say she didn't get caught on </v>

5306
03:38:33.991 --> 03:38:33.991
<v Speaker 1>camera hitting a guy with a stick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5307
03:38:33.991 --> 03:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>But some kid stands up who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative in middle school,</v>

5308
03:38:36.400 --> 03:38:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I was that way where I would argue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the teacher,</v>

5309
03:38:38.440 --> 03:38:39.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just as well,</v>

5310
03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I think you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she kicks that kid out of class and </v>

5311
03:38:44.520 --> 03:38:44.870
<v Speaker 1>just says that kid's being disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5312
03:38:45.160 --> 03:38:47.560
<v Speaker 1>or a fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that teacher is the principal,</v>

5313
03:38:47.740 --> 03:38:52.740
<v Speaker 1>gets the kid expelled from school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people have these little enclaves </v>

5314
03:38:52.740 --> 03:38:53.560
<v Speaker 1>of poWer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these positions of authority and parents</v>

5315
03:38:53.561 --> 03:38:57.340
<v Speaker 1>kind of have to trust the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see that it's a national story.</v>

5316
03:38:57.341 --> 03:39:02.341
<v Speaker 1>She's exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about all the teachers who </v>

5317
03:39:02.341 --> 03:39:03.640
<v Speaker 1>aren't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a teacher complained to my parents</v>

5318
03:39:03.641 --> 03:39:08.641
<v Speaker 1>and talk about how disrespectful I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what a horrible person it was </v>

5319
03:39:08.641 --> 03:39:10.120
<v Speaker 1>because I think in the ninth grade I </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually argued,</v>

5320
03:39:10.121 --> 03:39:15.121
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't think we should give </v>

5321
03:39:15.121 --> 03:39:15.121
<v Speaker 1>the land back to the native americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was teaching with the teacher.</v>

5322
03:39:15.121 --> 03:39:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I made an argument and she argument.</v>

5323
03:39:20.921 --> 03:39:22.210
<v Speaker 1>What did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5324
03:39:22.260 --> 03:39:23.260
<v Speaker 1>well I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a smart ass.</v>

5325
03:39:23.261 --> 03:39:24.910
<v Speaker 1>So this was me as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a 14 year old.</v>

5326
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:28.310
<v Speaker 1>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I remember the shoe,</v>

5327
03:39:28.340 --> 03:39:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I won't use her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was say the fact that you're wearing </v>

5328
03:39:33.340 --> 03:39:33.340
<v Speaker 1>levi's and because you have a sore </v>
<v Speaker 1>throat,</v>

5329
03:39:33.340 --> 03:39:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you're speaking to an electronic speaker</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you dress,</v>

5330
03:39:35.571 --> 03:39:40.571
<v Speaker 1>drove here in a toyota yarus and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to like electric electrically </v>

5331
03:39:40.571 --> 03:39:41.180
<v Speaker 1>powered school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5332
03:39:41.181 --> 03:39:44.150
<v Speaker 1>in a union tells me you're glad that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>settled here.</v>

5333
03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And she just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't answer.</v>

5334
03:39:46.250 --> 03:39:51.250
<v Speaker 1>She didn't argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just sent me out of class and I </v>

5335
03:39:51.250 --> 03:39:51.250
<v Speaker 1>remember the next morning I thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

5336
03:39:51.250 --> 03:39:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really think my dad was furious</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he got a call from someone </v>

5337
03:39:56.050 --> 03:39:58.250
<v Speaker 1>saying I was disrupting class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or she asked students was you dealt with</v>

5338
03:39:58.251 --> 03:39:58.610
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

5339
03:39:58.610 --> 03:40:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And the teacher know he's mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why was he mad at you?</v>

5340
03:40:01.130 --> 03:40:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Because he didn't get the full story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

5341
03:40:02.540 --> 03:40:04.760
<v Speaker 1>he just hears steven's being immensely </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful.</v>

5342
03:40:05.180 --> 03:40:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Talking back in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't hear the.</v>

5343
03:40:07.820 --> 03:40:09.590
<v Speaker 1>She asked for an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was mrt.</v>

5344
03:40:09.591 --> 03:40:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Moral religious education was a class we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to take in my religious education.</v>

5345
03:40:14.271 --> 03:40:19.271
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's guilt for the first nation </v>

5346
03:40:19.271 --> 03:40:19.271
<v Speaker 1>people up in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

5347
03:40:19.271 --> 03:40:20.630
<v Speaker 1>This just specific professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a matter of fact,</v>

5348
03:40:20.631 --> 03:40:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I learned what right wing was because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember at one point,</v>

5349
03:40:23.721 --> 03:40:24.920
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so right wing.</v>

5350
03:40:24.921 --> 03:40:26.360
<v Speaker 1>That's so right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't know what it was.</v>

5351
03:40:26.361 --> 03:40:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had said something and I said,</v>

5352
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:31.000
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does right wing says?</v>

5353
03:40:31.010 --> 03:40:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of explain to me the </v>

5354
03:40:36.010 --> 03:40:36.010
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

5355
03:40:36.010 --> 03:40:36.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I am right wing in.</v>

5356
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I was in alberta and I was with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends who live up there and uh,</v>

5357
03:40:40.910 --> 03:40:44.300
<v Speaker 1>we were fishing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were fishing right next to these,</v>

5358
03:40:44.301 --> 03:40:46.910
<v Speaker 1>a first nation people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is their native americans,</v>

5359
03:40:46.911 --> 03:40:48.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5360
03:40:48.650 --> 03:40:51.740
<v Speaker 1>they have a limit of walleye that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take.</v>

5361
03:40:52.130 --> 03:40:54.560
<v Speaker 1>You can only take one walleye per day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5362
03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:57.530
<v Speaker 1>If you're a regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a first nations person,</v>

5363
03:40:57.560 --> 03:40:58.430
<v Speaker 1>you could just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5364
03:40:58.730 --> 03:41:01.370
<v Speaker 1>pull in as many as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5365
03:41:01.470 --> 03:41:02.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

5366
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:05.060
<v Speaker 1>how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

5367
03:41:05.090 --> 03:41:06.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way crazier than that.</v>

5368
03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:11.560
<v Speaker 1>They can go out at night with spotlights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shine them on moose and gunned them </v>

5369
03:41:12.111 --> 03:41:13.120
<v Speaker 1>down from trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5370
03:41:13.130 --> 03:41:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Because then it frees them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spotlight.</v>

5371
03:41:14.770 --> 03:41:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what it is.</v>

5372
03:41:15.940 --> 03:41:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Stand still and they try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

5373
03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>what's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moose don't see spotlights ever in the </v>

5374
03:41:22.750 --> 03:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>real world.</v>

5375
03:41:22.750 --> 03:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they see,</v>

5376
03:41:22.750 --> 03:41:25.760
<v Speaker 1>when they freeze and they shoot them </v>
<v Speaker 1>with guns from trucks and I was like,</v>

5377
03:41:25.870 --> 03:41:27.590
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're alloWed to poach.</v>

5378
03:41:27.620 --> 03:41:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not poaching.</v>

5379
03:41:28.371 --> 03:41:29.240
<v Speaker 1>They can do whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

5380
03:41:29.241 --> 03:41:34.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many are they allowed to kill as </v>

5381
03:41:34.241 --> 03:41:34.241
<v Speaker 1>many as they want so they can kill all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moose.</v>

5382
03:41:34.241 --> 03:41:34.820
<v Speaker 1>They can kill all the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

5383
03:41:35.140 --> 03:41:36.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

5384
03:41:36.141 --> 03:41:37.680
<v Speaker 1>that seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems odd.</v>

5385
03:41:37.681 --> 03:41:39.800
<v Speaker 1>What makes a great argument in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>native american case is actually,</v>

5386
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:41.630
<v Speaker 1>have you read [inaudible] book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5387
03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:44.080
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about this,</v>

5388
03:41:44.110 --> 03:41:45.950
<v Speaker 1>like michael medved and dennis prager </v>
<v Speaker 1>have talked about this,</v>

5389
03:41:45.951 --> 03:41:50.210
<v Speaker 1>but I was surprised as to how cogent </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments where he's a very smart guy.</v>

5390
03:41:50.930 --> 03:41:52.490
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5391
03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:57.760
<v Speaker 1>and then he always kind of play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays it down or plays it up when </v>

5392
03:41:57.760 --> 03:41:57.760
<v Speaker 1>it's convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you read his book he talks about,</v>

5393
03:41:57.760 --> 03:41:58.310
<v Speaker 1>he says it's just a numbers game.</v>

5394
03:41:58.640 --> 03:42:03.640
<v Speaker 1>The reason that we were able to colonize</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is entirely because of native </v>

5395
03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:04.770
<v Speaker 1>americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were being [inaudible].</v>

5396
03:42:04.780 --> 03:42:06.770
<v Speaker 1>He wrote about it in a way I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>butchering it,</v>

5397
03:42:06.771 --> 03:42:08.630
<v Speaker 1>but he said like when we came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

5398
03:42:08.631 --> 03:42:10.100
<v Speaker 1>like let's talk about the mayans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5399
03:42:10.160 --> 03:42:13.820
<v Speaker 1>they had literally a pyramids are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>tech,</v>

5400
03:42:13.821 --> 03:42:18.821
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had buildings entirely full of </v>

5401
03:42:18.821 --> 03:42:18.821
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5402
03:42:18.821 --> 03:42:21.251
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think they procured said </v>

5403
03:42:21.251 --> 03:42:23.201
<v Speaker 1>gold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they mayBe went to </v>

5404
03:42:23.201 --> 03:42:24.710
<v Speaker 1>other tribes or other members and said </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to bring us this coal gold</v>

5405
03:42:24.711 --> 03:42:29.711
<v Speaker 1>or be die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what happened was thousands upon </v>

5406
03:42:29.711 --> 03:42:30.560
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands,</v>

5407
03:42:30.561 --> 03:42:35.561
<v Speaker 1>maybe hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands said one of the keys to doors </v>

5408
03:42:35.561 --> 03:42:36.120
<v Speaker 1>came who would never have had enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take over that area of the world said,</v>

5409
03:42:36.420 --> 03:42:41.420
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take our chances with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>red guys with the beards and the metal </v>

5410
03:42:41.420 --> 03:42:43.320
<v Speaker 1>helmets because they'd been treated so </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly for so long and the same thing.</v>

5411
03:42:43.320 --> 03:42:45.330
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the algonquins in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>iroquois and come back,</v>

5412
03:42:45.331 --> 03:42:50.331
<v Speaker 1>those were the tribes that we had and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the packs that they would </v>

5413
03:42:50.331 --> 03:42:50.331
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and listen,</v>

5414
03:42:50.331 --> 03:42:50.700
<v Speaker 1>they screwed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

5415
03:42:50.701 --> 03:42:55.701
<v Speaker 1>They really screwed them with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>firewater thing and they pulled the rug </v>

5416
03:42:55.701 --> 03:42:55.701
<v Speaker 1>out from under them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending it,</v>

5417
03:42:55.701 --> 03:42:58.110
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that we came in and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquered these people know there were a</v>

5418
03:42:58.111 --> 03:43:03.111
<v Speaker 1>lot of people who were mistreated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's horse culture that they </v>

5419
03:43:03.111 --> 03:43:03.111
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

5420
03:43:03.111 --> 03:43:05.530
<v Speaker 1>they hadn't domesticated horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even use the wheel and uh,</v>

5421
03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:10.560
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of the things that we're taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not true and we're taught that they </v>

5422
03:43:10.560 --> 03:43:10.560
<v Speaker 1>were peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5423
03:43:10.560 --> 03:43:14.570
<v Speaker 1>they weren't peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why all of a sudden these new </v>

5424
03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:15.510
<v Speaker 1>people who came in with sticks that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

5425
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:20.750
<v Speaker 1>had thousands of native americans at </v>
<v Speaker 1>their disposal who were willing to die </v>

5426
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:21.900
<v Speaker 1>with them because they were tired of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being treated that way,</v>

5427
03:43:22.680 --> 03:43:23.610
<v Speaker 1>and I made some arguments.</v>

5428
03:43:23.610 --> 03:43:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that affect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got in trouble,</v>

5429
03:43:25.231 --> 03:43:26.550
<v Speaker 1>got sent home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5430
03:43:26.551 --> 03:43:29.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated issue that spans </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years,</v>

5431
03:43:29.131 --> 03:43:33.030
<v Speaker 1>but there was certainly inter tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare and the word that the use,</v>

5432
03:43:33.060 --> 03:43:35.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't use the word sue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use the word lakota.</v>

5433
03:43:35.371 --> 03:43:38.550
<v Speaker 1>They call themselves the lakota people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sue's award for enemy.</v>

5434
03:43:38.730 --> 03:43:43.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that's what other native </v>

5435
03:43:43.730 --> 03:43:44.010
<v Speaker 1>american cultures would call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call them the enemy because they're</v>

5436
03:43:44.011 --> 03:43:46.620
<v Speaker 1>killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nez perce and the apaches,</v>

5437
03:43:46.830 --> 03:43:48.870
<v Speaker 1>they would go to war with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neighboring tribes.</v>

5438
03:43:48.871 --> 03:43:51.810
<v Speaker 1>It was constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just when the europeans came,</v>

5439
03:43:51.811 --> 03:43:54.750
<v Speaker 1>they were so overwhelming that we feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for what they did.</v>

5440
03:43:54.840 --> 03:43:55.290
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

5441
03:43:55.291 --> 03:43:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Killed more native americans than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

5442
03:43:57.540 --> 03:44:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Our diseases are dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty bugs.</v>

5443
03:44:00.510 --> 03:44:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We came over here and coughed on them </v>

5444
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.510
<v Speaker 1>and they all fucking died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5445
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.510
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5446
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:06.810
<v Speaker 1>That we killed them deliberately with </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox blankets.</v>

5447
03:44:07.150 --> 03:44:08.640
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

5448
03:44:08.641 --> 03:44:09.660
<v Speaker 1>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even understand.</v>

5449
03:44:09.661 --> 03:44:11.520
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have germ theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't understand.</v>

5450
03:44:11.580 --> 03:44:13.740
<v Speaker 1>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't understand that scabs.</v>

5451
03:44:13.741 --> 03:44:18.741
<v Speaker 1>If you'd like to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea was you take scabs from people </v>

5452
03:44:18.741 --> 03:44:21.111
<v Speaker 1>with fucking diseases and you put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>on blankets and he gave them native </v>

5453
03:44:21.111 --> 03:44:22.870
<v Speaker 1>americans out rubbing your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5454
03:44:22.890 --> 03:44:27.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a big thing with horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hadn't domesticated horses and a </v>

5455
03:44:27.890 --> 03:44:28.590
<v Speaker 1>lot of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about that.</v>

5456
03:44:28.860 --> 03:44:33.860
<v Speaker 1>You've never come in contact with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals there in the wild and all of a </v>

5457
03:44:33.860 --> 03:44:36.471
<v Speaker 1>sudden these people are coming off </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively with a boat that's a giant </v>

5458
03:44:36.471 --> 03:44:39.171
<v Speaker 1>farm and they're bringing these animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you've never had contact with </v>

5459
03:44:39.171 --> 03:44:39.171
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of disease.</v>

5460
03:44:39.180 --> 03:44:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing that people.</v>

5461
03:44:41.460 --> 03:44:43.680
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people who don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>where diseases come from,</v>

5462
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:46.500
<v Speaker 1>a giant percentage of them come from our</v>
<v Speaker 1>livestock,</v>

5463
03:44:46.610 --> 03:44:46.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5464
03:44:46.840 --> 03:44:51.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have swine flu and avian </v>
<v Speaker 1>viruses and all those different things.</v>

5465
03:44:51.220 --> 03:44:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Sars in the toronto airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only Canada.</v>

5466
03:44:54.280 --> 03:44:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It was brought back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sars.</v>

5467
03:44:55.880 --> 03:44:58.520
<v Speaker 1>You were the only ones who had sars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

5468
03:44:58.710 --> 03:45:00.390
<v Speaker 1>What was what it stands for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

5469
03:45:00.391 --> 03:45:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I jusT knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew all the asians were wearing those</v>

5470
03:45:02.731 --> 03:45:06.710
<v Speaker 1>masks at the toronto airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that one.</v>

5471
03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about a bowl?</v>

5472
03:45:07.901 --> 03:45:09.370
<v Speaker 1>It was just a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking.</v>

5473
03:45:09.390 --> 03:45:13.020
<v Speaker 1>We're going to die a bola.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking chick from New Jersey.</v>

5474
03:45:13.021 --> 03:45:13.650
<v Speaker 1>That bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>

5475
03:45:13.850 --> 03:45:15.840
<v Speaker 1>She left the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5476
03:45:16.150 --> 03:45:21.150
<v Speaker 1>There is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much flack from conservatives to </v>

5477
03:45:21.150 --> 03:45:21.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5478
03:45:21.150 --> 03:45:24.800
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like barack obama as a </v>

5479
03:45:24.800 --> 03:45:26.631
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't blame a bowl on the guy </v>

5480
03:45:26.631 --> 03:45:26.631
<v Speaker 1>and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck you.</v>

5481
03:45:26.631 --> 03:45:28.730
<v Speaker 1>African africa from Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

5482
03:45:28.731 --> 03:45:33.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of those things where I </v>

5483
03:45:33.731 --> 03:45:33.731
<v Speaker 1>know I'm seen as an ideologue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sending.</v>

5484
03:45:33.731 --> 03:45:34.450
<v Speaker 1>We get so much flack for criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>

5485
03:45:34.451 --> 03:45:35.120
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

5486
03:45:35.440 --> 03:45:37.030
<v Speaker 1>on some trade policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

5487
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I just think this is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big thing that you've been </v>

5488
03:45:42.110 --> 03:45:44.971
<v Speaker 1>criticized about trump for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been criticized for theater show </v>

5489
03:45:44.971 --> 03:45:47.200
<v Speaker 1>just for criticizing him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything and toe the line.</v>

5490
03:45:47.380 --> 03:45:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get real versus them bro.</v>

5491
03:45:49.480 --> 03:45:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know they're used to lIke </v>

5492
03:45:54.480 --> 03:45:54.480
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've had people on the show.</v>

5493
03:45:54.480 --> 03:45:54.480
<v Speaker 1>You've even mentioned in this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are.</v>

5494
03:45:54.480 --> 03:45:55.830
<v Speaker 1>They're only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're only his on data,</v>

5495
03:45:55.950 --> 03:46:00.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is being a concern is being a </v>

5496
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.950
<v Speaker 1>provocateur to offender and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a purpose to that.</v>

5497
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:02.950
<v Speaker 1>But if just offending people as the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

5498
03:46:03.460 --> 03:46:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And I really don't think that's what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

5499
03:46:04.751 --> 03:46:09.751
<v Speaker 1>If people actually watched the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people actually watch the show </v>

5500
03:46:09.751 --> 03:46:09.751
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour of content.</v>

5501
03:46:09.751 --> 03:46:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Most of it is really pretty reasonable.</v>

5502
03:46:11.320 --> 03:46:13.600
<v Speaker 1>They see the highlight reel of me </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressing as a trainee interviewing wendy</v>

5503
03:46:13.601 --> 03:46:14.280
<v Speaker 1>davis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5504
03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:17.680
<v Speaker 1>That's from thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of the program.</v>

5505
03:46:19.120 --> 03:46:20.950
<v Speaker 1>So we criticize them all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

5506
03:46:20.951 --> 03:46:23.380
<v Speaker 1>less and less because every time he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>something stupid,</v>

5507
03:46:23.381 --> 03:46:28.381
<v Speaker 1>the left as something so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where it's like calling them </v>

5508
03:46:28.381 --> 03:46:29.700
<v Speaker 1>literally hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that woman who was a school teacher</v>

5509
03:46:29.720 --> 03:46:34.680
<v Speaker 1>was talking about the origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey's really bothered with the woman</v>

5510
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:37.480
<v Speaker 1>who was a school teacher was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was talking about that,</v>

5511
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:42.510
<v Speaker 1>just just labeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all fascists and you have to </v>

5512
03:46:42.510 --> 03:46:44.710
<v Speaker 1>stop fascist and then when he described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he asked her what is a fascist,</v>

5513
03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:49.920
<v Speaker 1>she gave like this shitbag definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a fascist is and only suited her </v>

5514
03:46:49.920 --> 03:46:53.341
<v Speaker 1>knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pull up the actual literal </v>

5515
03:46:53.341 --> 03:46:55.951
<v Speaker 1>definition of fascist young jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the literal definition of </v>

5516
03:46:55.951 --> 03:47:00.541
<v Speaker 1>fascist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I interpreted it is I did a video on </v>

5517
03:47:00.541 --> 03:47:01.180
<v Speaker 1>this and here's what's so funny.</v>

5518
03:47:01.210 --> 03:47:06.210
<v Speaker 1>If I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>google's definition brings up fascism </v>

5519
03:47:06.210 --> 03:47:09.180
<v Speaker 1>and mentions right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you bring up communism or </v>

5520
03:47:09.180 --> 03:47:10.180
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's authoritarianism.</v>

5521
03:47:10.181 --> 03:47:15.181
<v Speaker 1>Something that's very clearly left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't actually mention the left </v>

5522
03:47:15.181 --> 03:47:15.181
<v Speaker 1>wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5523
03:47:15.181 --> 03:47:19.140
<v Speaker 1>and advocate or follower of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political philosophy or system of </v>

5524
03:47:19.140 --> 03:47:23.671
<v Speaker 1>fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to Spain to fight against the </v>

5525
03:47:23.671 --> 03:47:24.920
<v Speaker 1>fascist to extreme right wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme right winger,</v>

5526
03:47:24.930 --> 03:47:29.930
<v Speaker 1>rightest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a military coup throughout the old </v>

5527
03:47:29.930 --> 03:47:30.850
<v Speaker 1>fascist regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>synonymous authoritarian,</v>

5528
03:47:31.090 --> 03:47:33.880
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorial.</v>

5529
03:47:33.930 --> 03:47:38.930
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets weird because </v>

5530
03:47:38.930 --> 03:47:39.520
<v Speaker 1>undemocratic illiberal now type and </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism,</v>

5531
03:47:39.550 --> 03:47:41.170
<v Speaker 1>but authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second.</v>

5532
03:47:41.171 --> 03:47:45.250
<v Speaker 1>The authoritarian and totalitarian like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

5533
03:47:45.310 --> 03:47:49.150
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about extreme left wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologues,</v>

5534
03:47:49.420 --> 03:47:53.140
<v Speaker 1>you are talking about authoritarians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about totalitarian.</v>

5535
03:47:53.141 --> 03:47:58.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're also talking about people </v>

5536
03:47:58.141 --> 03:47:59.881
<v Speaker 1>that would advocate violence against </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who does not fit their mold of </v>

5537
03:48:02.141 --> 03:48:07.141
<v Speaker 1>how a person think or behave and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do is they call them a fascist or </v>

5538
03:48:07.141 --> 03:48:10.150
<v Speaker 1>they called him a nazi and that lets </v>
<v Speaker 1>them alleviate themselves,</v>

5539
03:48:10.151 --> 03:48:15.151
<v Speaker 1>have any guilt of being a violent person</v>
<v Speaker 1>against these people and that's what </v>

5540
03:48:15.151 --> 03:48:19.141
<v Speaker 1>happened at berkeley and that's why this</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman felt no irony about being on </v>

5541
03:48:19.141 --> 03:48:22.330
<v Speaker 1>television saying that milo is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobe when he's a gay guy.</v>

5542
03:48:22.380 --> 03:48:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Once she was also talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifying beating up people who weren't</v>

5543
03:48:24.671 --> 03:48:25.270
<v Speaker 1>milo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>

5544
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:29.000
<v Speaker 1>could you hit authoritarian real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5545
03:48:29.690 --> 03:48:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Favoring or enforcing strict obedience </v>

5546
03:48:34.690 --> 03:48:38.231
<v Speaker 1>or authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially especially that of the </v>

5547
03:48:38.231 --> 03:48:40.271
<v Speaker 1>government of the expensive personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now do me a favor type in communism and </v>

5548
03:48:40.271 --> 03:48:44.231
<v Speaker 1>I want you to see the google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it just said right wing extremism </v>

5549
03:48:44.231 --> 03:48:46.901
<v Speaker 1>right with fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not a right wing ideology and </v>

5550
03:48:46.901 --> 03:48:49.391
<v Speaker 1>own communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we all agree is an inherently left </v>

5551
03:48:49.391 --> 03:48:49.391
<v Speaker 1>wing ideology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5552
03:48:49.391 --> 03:48:53.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political theory derived from karl </v>

5553
03:48:53.381 --> 03:48:53.381
<v Speaker 1>marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5554
03:48:53.381 --> 03:48:56.081
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had Jordan Peterson on the </v>

5555
03:48:56.081 --> 03:48:58.121
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about how was like </v>

5556
03:48:58.121 --> 03:49:01.570
<v Speaker 1>progressives who are sensitive and kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>people gradually gravitate towards </v>

5557
03:49:03.021 --> 03:49:07.250
<v Speaker 1>marxism and a lot of ways because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>initial draw seems appealing,</v>

5558
03:49:07.251 --> 03:49:12.251
<v Speaker 1>advocating class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war and leading to a society in which </v>

5559
03:49:12.251 --> 03:49:15.011
<v Speaker 1>all property is publicly owned and each </v>
<v Speaker 1>person works and is paid for according </v>

5560
03:49:15.381 --> 03:49:16.550
<v Speaker 1>to their abilities and needs.</v>

5561
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:19.160
<v Speaker 1>So here's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote about this.</v>

5562
03:49:19.161 --> 03:49:24.161
<v Speaker 1>I think we did a video on this fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not inherently right wing at </v>

5563
03:49:24.161 --> 03:49:24.780
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5564
03:49:24.781 --> 03:49:25.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

5565
03:49:25.941 --> 03:49:27.050
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing,</v>

5566
03:49:27.140 --> 03:49:29.630
<v Speaker 1>extreme right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illiberal communism,</v>

5567
03:49:29.930 --> 03:49:34.930
<v Speaker 1>which inherently has to be left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the definition of the political </v>

5568
03:49:34.930 --> 03:49:37.820
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of left wing would be communism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and capitalism,</v>

5569
03:49:38.180 --> 03:49:39.860
<v Speaker 1>and then in between can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism.</v>

5570
03:49:40.010 --> 03:49:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the regime,</v>

5571
03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:46.190
<v Speaker 1>no mention of left wing with communism </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know there's google,</v>

5572
03:49:46.220 --> 03:49:47.450
<v Speaker 1>they know there's a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>connotation.</v>

5573
03:49:47.451 --> 03:49:49.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the first one that comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fascism,</v>

5574
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:52.940
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they immediately try to attribute to the</v>

5575
03:49:52.941 --> 03:49:57.941
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people are fighting back </v>

5576
03:49:57.941 --> 03:49:57.941
<v Speaker 1>again when they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they talk about media and fake news</v>

5577
03:49:57.941 --> 03:49:59.000
<v Speaker 1>and the constant bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it,</v>

5578
03:49:59.001 --> 03:50:00.470
<v Speaker 1>there was google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not fair.</v>

5579
03:50:00.600 --> 03:50:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's a problem with also</v>

5580
03:50:02.181 --> 03:50:06.200
<v Speaker 1>defining things in terms of a word like </v>
<v Speaker 1>marxism or like communism,</v>

5581
03:50:06.201 --> 03:50:08.500
<v Speaker 1>like let's just talk about like what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trying to do?</v>

5582
03:50:08.540 --> 03:50:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Like what are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you actually trying to appeal </v>

5583
03:50:13.540 --> 03:50:15.560
<v Speaker 1>to when you're saying that you can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone speak at your university if they</v>

5584
03:50:15.561 --> 03:50:18.620
<v Speaker 1>say things that you don't agree with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you remember the story about the</v>

5585
03:50:18.621 --> 03:50:23.621
<v Speaker 1>university of toronto?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really famous story guy who is an </v>

5586
03:50:23.621 --> 03:50:26.621
<v Speaker 1>author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They completely misrepresented what his </v>

5587
03:50:26.621 --> 03:50:29.081
<v Speaker 1>book was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were saying he's pro rape culture </v>

5588
03:50:29.081 --> 03:50:29.081
<v Speaker 1>and these feminist shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pulled fire alarms.</v>

5589
03:50:29.210 --> 03:50:32.360
<v Speaker 1>The famous red haired lady who's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming at people.</v>

5590
03:50:33.390 --> 03:50:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I remember her name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>melissa click click.</v>

5591
03:50:36.310 --> 03:50:36.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5592
03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:41.680
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one from the university of </v>

5593
03:50:41.680 --> 03:50:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5594
03:50:41.680 --> 03:50:44.011
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the one from toronto </v>

5595
03:50:44.011 --> 03:50:46.090
<v Speaker 1>who is like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's kind of funny in a way </v>

5596
03:50:46.090 --> 03:50:46.090
<v Speaker 1>because she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up fuck face.</v>

5597
03:50:46.090 --> 03:50:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the rambler.</v>

5598
03:50:48.560 --> 03:50:52.370
<v Speaker 1>That red hair glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5599
03:50:52.870 --> 03:50:57.870
<v Speaker 1>that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was this crazy moment in time where</v>

5600
03:50:58.071 --> 03:51:03.071
<v Speaker 1>this guy had scheduled an appearance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak about his book and someone had </v>

5601
03:51:03.411 --> 03:51:04.700
<v Speaker 1>misrepresented his book.</v>

5602
03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:09.750
<v Speaker 1>He decided what his book was actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about and decided that they were </v>

5603
03:51:09.750 --> 03:51:13.241
<v Speaker 1>going to have a campaign to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this guy couldn't talk so people </v>

5604
03:51:13.241 --> 03:51:16.661
<v Speaker 1>would show up and they would try to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to listen to this guy talk and women </v>

5605
03:51:16.661 --> 03:51:19.160
<v Speaker 1>were screaming in their face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking rapist you piece of shit.</v>

5606
03:51:19.280 --> 03:51:21.020
<v Speaker 1>And The guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear the guy talk.</v>

5607
03:51:21.080 --> 03:51:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Can I hear the guy talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5608
03:51:22.610 --> 03:51:24.140
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5609
03:51:24.141 --> 03:51:26.230
<v Speaker 1>that is fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

5610
03:51:26.430 --> 03:51:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened to with ann coulter in </v>

5611
03:51:31.430 --> 03:51:31.430
<v Speaker 1>toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

5612
03:51:31.430 --> 03:51:31.430
<v Speaker 1>and whether you agree with her and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves it.</v>

5613
03:51:31.430 --> 03:51:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was a.</v>

5614
03:51:34.230 --> 03:51:35.160
<v Speaker 1>She was asking me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

5615
03:51:35.290 --> 03:51:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5616
03:51:35.671 --> 03:51:40.671
<v Speaker 1>you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech doesn't really exist </v>

5617
03:51:40.671 --> 03:51:40.671
<v Speaker 1>in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

5618
03:51:40.671 --> 03:51:40.671
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist outside of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

5619
03:51:40.671 --> 03:51:42.300
<v Speaker 1>It really doesn't exist in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have some weird rule,</v>

5620
03:51:42.301 --> 03:51:47.301
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist in europe and when I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>her that she couldn't and then actually </v>

5621
03:51:47.301 --> 03:51:48.340
<v Speaker 1>someone went on news on the news and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

5622
03:51:48.780 --> 03:51:53.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ann coulter needs to understand is </v>

5623
03:51:53.780 --> 03:51:55.551
<v Speaker 1>that America has this idea of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and rugged individualism and all </v>

5624
03:51:55.551 --> 03:51:59.031
<v Speaker 1>speech is protected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the case in Canada and </v>

5625
03:51:59.031 --> 03:52:02.061
<v Speaker 1>this was the representative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They trotted out where she basically </v>

5626
03:52:02.061 --> 03:52:02.061
<v Speaker 1>said freedom of speech does not exist in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

5627
03:52:02.061 --> 03:52:04.710
<v Speaker 1>and so you can read the youtube comments</v>
<v Speaker 1>where every time I say freedom of speech</v>

5628
03:52:04.711 --> 03:52:06.690
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people.</v>

5629
03:52:06.691 --> 03:52:11.691
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit because they thinK they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to type in an internet message </v>

5630
03:52:11.691 --> 03:52:14.181
<v Speaker 1>board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can be jailed in Canada for st </v>

5631
03:52:14.181 --> 03:52:14.181
<v Speaker 1>louis where you can lose your business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a human rights council.</v>

5632
03:52:14.320 --> 03:52:15.960
<v Speaker 1>We talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually my story.</v>

5633
03:52:16.090 --> 03:52:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Did you have him that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we talked about.</v>

5634
03:52:18.510 --> 03:52:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a different case that's from </v>

5635
03:52:23.510 --> 03:52:24.851
<v Speaker 1>montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about the comedian from </v>

5636
03:52:24.851 --> 03:52:24.990
<v Speaker 1>vancouver that had the altercation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lesbians and the crowd.</v>

5637
03:52:24.991 --> 03:52:29.991
<v Speaker 1>They were heckling him and the comedians</v>
<v Speaker 1>before and he called them some fucking </v>

5638
03:52:29.991 --> 03:52:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you pussy dykes or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saId something crazy and they sent </v>

5639
03:52:33.190 --> 03:52:33.190
<v Speaker 1>him and won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won.</v>

5640
03:52:33.190 --> 03:52:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

5641
03:52:33.960 --> 03:52:35.790
<v Speaker 1>he had pe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if He's paid,</v>

5642
03:52:35.791 --> 03:52:37.650
<v Speaker 1>but hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was tens of thousands of dollars.</v>

5643
03:52:37.651 --> 03:52:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it was something like $15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking guy had to pay to.</v>

5644
03:52:41.911 --> 03:52:43.360
<v Speaker 1>These people were hecklers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5645
03:52:43.650 --> 03:52:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I know that people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get more people to the left versus.</v>

5646
03:52:47.281 --> 03:52:52.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why it does matter because I </v>

5647
03:52:52.281 --> 03:52:52.281
<v Speaker 1>lived through it in quebec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In quebec,</v>

5648
03:52:52.281 --> 03:52:56.541
<v Speaker 1>we only have the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have liberals and then liberal </v>

5649
03:52:56.541 --> 03:52:56.541
<v Speaker 1>separatists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5650
03:52:56.541 --> 03:52:56.541
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

5651
03:52:56.541 --> 03:53:01.060
<v Speaker 1>There's liberals and those liberals who </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to only speak french and separate </v>

5652
03:53:01.060 --> 03:53:01.060
<v Speaker 1>from the rest of Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5653
03:53:01.060 --> 03:53:01.650
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird place,</v>

5654
03:53:01.651 --> 03:53:03.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird place.</v>

5655
03:53:03.331 --> 03:53:05.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the rest of Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's multiculturalism gone awry.</v>

5656
03:53:05.851 --> 03:53:07.800
<v Speaker 1>The french were a conquered people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should have been shut up.</v>

5657
03:53:07.801 --> 03:53:09.810
<v Speaker 1>You're speaking english instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said it's cute.</v>

5658
03:53:09.811 --> 03:53:14.811
<v Speaker 1>Let's let them have the little enclave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's just a nightmare for the </v>

5659
03:53:14.811 --> 03:53:17.271
<v Speaker 1>rest of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where white golfers are afraid </v>

5660
03:53:17.271 --> 03:53:18.861
<v Speaker 1>about with California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're just going to </v>

5661
03:53:18.861 --> 03:53:19.230
<v Speaker 1>dominate and turn this whole thing into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mexican speaking joint?</v>

5662
03:53:19.770 --> 03:53:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

5663
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

5664
03:53:22.140 --> 03:53:24.900
<v Speaker 1>because I do think you do one at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain point.</v>

5665
03:53:24.960 --> 03:53:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people are readily </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledging now that those stories </v>

5666
03:53:29.960 --> 03:53:30.060
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red haired girl,</v>

5667
03:53:30.210 --> 03:53:32.580
<v Speaker 1>the melissa click is asian lady.</v>

5668
03:53:32.970 --> 03:53:35.310
<v Speaker 1>You really can't find that today on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5669
03:53:35.350 --> 03:53:40.350

<v Speaker 1>stood up and he was like asking this </v>

5685
03:54:13.040 --> 03:54:13.040
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

5687
03:54:14.491 --> 03:54:15.240
<v Speaker 1>And he actually said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

03:54:15.241 --> 03:54:15.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

03:54:15.631 --> 03:54:20.631
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've actually never had an issue </v>

5690
03:54:20.631 --> 03:54:22.910
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said they don't want it on a prime </v>

5691
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.910
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want it on in prime time.</v>

5692
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:23.470
<v Speaker 1>We've seen them as an ally is and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

5693
03:54:23.471 --> 03:54:24.100
<v Speaker 1>contrast</v>

5694
03:54:24.100 --> 03:54:29.100
<v Speaker 2>that to the comedy central reaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they decided to cut an episode </v>

5695
03:54:29.100 --> 03:54:32.431
<v Speaker 2>because we put muhammad in it and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you who's really empowered </v>

5696
03:54:32.431 --> 03:54:34.660
<v Speaker 2>something to that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the kid who was at ut in austin,</v>

5697
03:54:34.661 --> 03:54:39.661
<v Speaker 2>my brother went to ut so he would get </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to all of these speeches or </v>

5698
03:54:39.661 --> 03:54:40.510
<v Speaker 2>presentations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kid was dumbfounded.</v>

5699
03:54:40.511 --> 03:54:40.890
<v Speaker 2>He thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5700
03:54:40.900 --> 03:54:42.220
<v Speaker 2>matt stones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not one of me,</v>

5701
03:54:42.221 --> 03:54:43.930
<v Speaker 2>and matt stone is not a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a republican.</v>

5702
03:54:43.931 --> 03:54:47.320
<v Speaker 2>He's not a trump supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he Just recognizes the intolerance.</v>

5703
03:54:47.321 --> 03:54:52.321
<v Speaker 2>Today of the progressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's definitely an issue when </v>

03:54:52.321 --> 03:54:55.891
<v Speaker 2>you have that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>melissa glick lady who was yelling at </v>

<v Speaker 2>that kid who was just a for tog grapher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a journalist.</v>

5706
03:54:57.800 --> 03:55:02.800

<v Speaker 2>and I think he was hired to be there in </v>

5707
03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:04.060
<v Speaker 2>a public space who was asian and he's </v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just gonna say get some here.</v>

5716
03:55:23.410 --> 03:55:28.410
<v Speaker 2>She was intolerant in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was very adamant about getting her </v>

5717
03:55:28.410 --> 03:55:29.860
<v Speaker 2>way and she did not consider whether or </v>
