1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>So we live in strange times.</v>

3
00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:03.804
<v Speaker 1>Greg Proops.</v>

4
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.531
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing,</v>

5
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:04.870
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

6
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Exciting part is like I'm ready for a lot of the old stuff to go away.</v>

7
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

9
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have tradition,</v>

11
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>obviously I write with a piece of paper and a pen.</v>

12
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.471
<v Speaker 1>Do you really?</v>

13
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I can't write as fast that way,</v>

15
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>so the ideas slip away from me,</v>

16
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>but I do write it down before I go on stage because when,</v>

17
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>especially new stuff,</v>

18
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if I don't physically write it down with a pen and a paper,</v>

19
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it the same way.</v>

20
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

21
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I was going to say,</v>

22
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

23
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I've done a survey of every comic of talked to him the last two or three years.</v>

24
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Every club I played,</v>

25
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I make everybody get their book out and show me how I go.</v>

26
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Where do you keep your ideas and everybody?</v>

27
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Book a little book with your lists on it.</v>

29
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Mine minor on hotel rooms,</v>

30
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>stationary.</v>

31
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.003
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of them,</v>

32
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>thousands of pieces of paper I write and I say,</v>

33
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>why do you do it that way?</v>

34
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever write it on your phone?</v>

35
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.511
<v Speaker 1>if I think of a one line,</v>

38
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>then I ride it,</v>

39
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:00:58.361 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>did it today.</v>

41
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>But do you write your Heloc to the phone?</v>

42
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:01.074
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

43
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>In the end I have to put it on a piece of paper in red and I just think it's a</v>

44
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:06.084
<v Speaker 1>mental,</v>

45
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

46
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>that's the really old fashioned part of performing.</v>

47
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I have a note lists of set lists on my phone,</v>

48
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'll go to like right before I go on stage sometimes if I want to make sure</v>

49
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>that I remember some new shit that I'm working on.</v>

50
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>But when I write I go,</v>

51
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>when are you going to that luck trance?</v>

52
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I can do that so much better when I'm typing because I can,</v>

53
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.141
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

54
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>the words just appear like I can type a word in a second,</v>

55
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>whereas it takes,</v>

56
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>but can you remember if you type no,</v>

57
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>but I can write better so I get the trance out and I can get more information</v>

58
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:36.481
<v Speaker 1>out as I'm writing.</v>

59
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>But then I go back and I'm like,</v>

60
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.591
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

61
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:38.821
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

62
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>That I remember writing that.</v>

63
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll,</v>

64
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll laugh at some of my own shit and then I'll go,</v>

65
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:42.931
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

66
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:43.211
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

67
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>That I've got to keep that part.</v>

68
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Cause I don't even remember writing because that'll have five hours of writing.</v>

69
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>How much do you actually remember?</v>

70
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>But the act of actually scribing it into a paper,</v>

71
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.881
<v Speaker 1>a piece of paper.</v>

72
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that's like,</v>

73
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>it just really like,</v>

74
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>it just stores in your memory that's like,</v>

75
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

76
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>we humans have been doing it that way for so long.</v>

77
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.743
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

78
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>it's been five,</v>

79
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:06.901
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

80
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years since people started writing.</v>

81
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

83
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a real profound connection with the paper.</v>

84
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought about releasing those?</v>

86
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Like with your,</v>

87
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>like with a special,</v>

89
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>like when you release a special release your notes as well.</v>

90
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

91
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

92
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

93
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>One time I did a fun article for Filter magazine.</v>

94
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>The guy came over to me and he said,</v>

95
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:26.484
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

96
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>he saw me fumbling with my notes and I said,</v>

97
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>it's all different pieces of hotel stationary.</v>

98
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>So I asked my wife to pick it and he goes,</v>

99
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>well that will be the article.</v>

100
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Just I want a picture of these,</v>

101
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>notes atlas.</v>

103
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

104
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.681
<v Speaker 1>I said to my wife,</v>

105
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:41.131
<v Speaker 1>you pick it out.</v>

106
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I give her the folder full of shit.</v>

107
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>So she picked out four random ones.</v>

108
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:45.181
<v Speaker 1>It was one from like,</v>

109
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Paris went from Minnesota,</v>

110
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>one from one place.</v>

111
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't remember being terrible and somewhere,</v>

112
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>and then there was another one and then it just sad like Clinton,</v>

114
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:56.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:57.421
<v Speaker 1>corn,</v>

118
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck was on the list,</v>

119
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>the Olsen twins and I kind of went through the list as the article.</v>

120
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I just went like,</v>

121
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

122
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I was doing Clinton jokes in Paris,</v>

123
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.851
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

125
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:06.710
<v Speaker 1>well I think I slept.</v>

126
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

127
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it's always 92 when I rock the Mike Rock,</v>

128
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.791
<v Speaker 1>dumb luck or whatever,</v>

129
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:10.894
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

131
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>that there is a weird insight into kind of like what's going on.</v>

133
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:15.911
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

134
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Then with all your setlist cause the different notes you make on them and stuff.</v>

135
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that there's a that much to be garnered from,</v>

136
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

137
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I could probably remember some of the debts and stuff like that.</v>

138
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>So just something that might be cool.</v>

139
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was a fan and I got it.</v>

140
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

141
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

142
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.091
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

143
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

144
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.523
<v Speaker 1>Just see my old song,</v>

145
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I put it up on design or something.</v>

146
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>If you just put the photos online.</v>

147
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.713
<v Speaker 1>Well you ever see that?</v>

148
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>A website called letters of note?</v>

149
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

150
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.021
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

151
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>and there's another one,</v>

152
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>something of note.</v>

153
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but letters of notice letters people wrote to each other or even,</v>

155
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

156
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I think there's one called lists of note.</v>

157
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

158
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>the list of note is just different lists that famous people wrote or anybody you</v>

159
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:54.041
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

160
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.390
<v Speaker 1>notable.</v>

161
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Like the one I remember is Thelonious monk,</v>

162
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>cause I read it on my show at the monk,</v>

163
00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

165
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>he had different mental problems and stuff.</v>

166
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:02.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

167
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever seen him play like he played and then he started to get up and</v>

168
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>walk around the stage,</v>

169
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

170
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.861
<v Speaker 1>And he's extraordinary.</v>

172
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>And then he was given drugs and they didn't quite work out.</v>

173
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.090
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

174
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>he's a genius.</v>

175
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:16.230
<v Speaker 1>And he could both compose and arrange and extemporize and his band was,</v>

176
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:16.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.363
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

178
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>putting the position of having to deal with his,</v>

179
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>his personality,</v>

180
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:21.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

181
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:21.881
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

182
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>cause he wasn't like a regular guy who,</v>

183
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

184
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.371
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

185
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

186
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:25.774
<v Speaker 1>I'll be there at five,</v>

188
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>he had to kind of be pushed around to places,</v>

190
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>but then when he could play was so he wrote a note and on the net it's just how</v>

191
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.451
<v Speaker 1>do we address tonight,</v>

192
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 1>sharp as possible.</v>

193
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Underlined.</v>

194
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

195
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

196
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.631
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

198
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 1>the drummer I think is something,</v>

199
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>like there's all this like really broken down,</v>

201
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>like the thoughts you have before you go on stage.</v>

202
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Like about the band and how he wanted the band to play and look.</v>

203
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>

204
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I would read that out sometimes.</v>

205
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.860
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say on the show,</v>

206
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.920
<v Speaker 1>how do we adjust tonight?</v>

207
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Sharp is possible.</v>

208
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

209
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

210
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>So there's lists of note and there's letters of note.</v>

211
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And then at the last letter of note,</v>

212
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>someone sent it to me,</v>

213
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.821

215
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

217
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

218
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And Jackie was an executive.</v>

219
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Jackie Robinson was an executive at chock full of nuts.</v>

223
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Like he got a job in the corporate world because he was an intelligent,</v>

224
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>capable and famous person.</v>

225
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>He became an executive,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a chocolate nuts in New York and show he went to this like banquet and</v>

227
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:28.990

228
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:29.591
<v Speaker 1>Eisenhower said,</v>

229
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be patient,</v>

230
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.853
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is the city's.</v>

233
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

234
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So Jackie wrote him a very respectful letter,</v>

235
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>but also very pointed about your patients.</v>

236
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:44.614
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

237
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not doing it any justice.</v>

238
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.271
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

239
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:46.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:46.651
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>

241
00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:47.484
<v Speaker 1>Mr President,</v>

242
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>having recently attended the lunch,</v>

243
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 1>or I have to say that on behalf of myself and my race,</v>

244
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>the time for patients is long pass.</v>

245
00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You'll find that over the past several hundred years we've endured,</v>

246
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>but countless indignant,</v>

247
00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

248
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.301
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

249
00:05:59.301 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

250
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

251
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 1>And then the repository is the next letter.</v>

252
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Eisenhower wrote him back,</v>

253
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>do you Mr. Robinson,</v>

254
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>thank you for your letter as I take on board what you said and I profoundly,</v>

255
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:11.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

257
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

258
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

259
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>this exchange in a very civil and high faluting language,</v>

260
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>not the language that we use now,</v>

261
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>but like formal letter writing language,</v>

262
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:22.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

263
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of very explicitly expressed that he no longer had the patients to</v>

264
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

265
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>that he felt that why shitty weight.</v>

266
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

267
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 1>And why should you have to go to a dinner with the president,</v>

268
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>told him to wait when even the first fucking black guy in the big leagues and</v>

269
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>they get a job and fucking business and you know,</v>

270
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>trying to run his life and shit.</v>

271
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

272
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>And Eisenhower like,</v>

274
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:41.331
<v Speaker 1>he will,</v>

275
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:42.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>one day schools will be integrated and you want to have to drink it another</v>

277
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>faucet and you know,</v>

278
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to hear that.</v>

279
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 1>And so those kinds of letters I think to me are like fascinating.</v>

280
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:52.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

281
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>So letters you've known enlisted node are quite good.</v>

282
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>If you want to just,</v>

283
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you mean you don't have to read everything on it,</v>

284
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

285
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 1>it's different letters to people and to that's fucking bad ass.</v>

286
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I will check that nobody writes letters anymore.</v>

288
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>

289
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>in future it will be your setlist of note and your emails of note and your blog</v>

290
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>of note the probably be a letter.</v>

291
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

292
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:10.754
<v Speaker 1>it's going away.</v>

293
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>The physical act of writing is going away.</v>

294
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't have to write my set lists down or occasional like fill out a form,</v>

295
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>like when I go to Canada or something like that,</v>

296
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

297
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't really write anything.</v>

298
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.283
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

299
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

300
00:07:21.511 --> 00:07:22.344
<v Speaker 1>I read it,</v>

301
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.623
<v Speaker 1>I write on my computer,</v>

302
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but I write in a book too because it's fun.</v>

303
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking human being.</v>
