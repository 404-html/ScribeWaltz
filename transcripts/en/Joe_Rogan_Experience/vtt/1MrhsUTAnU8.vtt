<v Speaker 1>I couldn't work out until I got it fixed.</v>

31
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>My friend Jon Tobin,</v>

32
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>who was a standup comic from New York,</v>

<v Speaker 1>comics and I just started playing an obsessive.</v>

38
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

39
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I got hooked on playing in tournaments and I went through a nutty time where I</v>

40
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stop playing pool.</v>

41
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I had all these delusions of grand jury.</v>

42
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I was never to have to work again because yeah,</v>

43
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.701
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

44
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>like Jackie Gleason and the hustler,</v>

45
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>the chubby fingers going h on the corner and so class go to when Paul Newman</v>

46
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

47
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>look at that little Chubby guy walking around like a Chubby Ballerina.</v>

48
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>What did the way he moves?</v>

49
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:25.794
<v Speaker 1>I go eight answer.</v>

50
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>That's playing the violin and stick stuck between this chubby little finger.</v>

51
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

52
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>that is amazing movie.</v>

53
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my all time favorite movies.</v>

54
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.641
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

55
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:35.761
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

56
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Jackie Gleason is a hell of an actor man.</v>

57
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And we were saying Jackie Gleason,</v>

58
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>he might've been like the best celebrity pool player ever.</v>

59
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Like Jackie Gleason could run a hundred balls.</v>

60
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find somebody.</v>

61
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

62
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>he almost beat Moscone once,</v>

63
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I think in straight pool didn't,</v>

64
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>but almost it didn't.</v>

65
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>But almost all of them about that.</v>

66
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like some bullshit for the Italian say over the fire.</v>

67
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>you got him on the fucking ropes.</v>

71
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.173
<v Speaker 1>Ropes.</v>

72
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Moscone didn't,</v>

73
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>he was shitting himself and believe that this guy is going to be better than me</v>

74
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>at everything.</v>

75
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.330

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I'd literally have no idea who won this year.</v>

148
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

149
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>who's the world series champion this year?</v>

150
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who won last year.</v>

151
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

152
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know.</v>

153
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.773
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds,</v>

154
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.640
<v Speaker 1>it sounds ridiculous.</v>

155
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

156
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.131
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

157
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you don't like baseball DWG like football,</v>

158
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't even watch football.</v>

160
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Would he just likes that MMA shit.</v>

161
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I was kickboxing.</v>

162
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I watch MMA.</v>

163
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I watched those things.</v>

164
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:50.411
<v Speaker 1>Same Shit.</v>

165
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I watch boxing and that's all I pay attention to boxing.</v>

166
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I love Mayweather and a,</v>

167
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

168
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.443
<v Speaker 1>What he's thing.</v>

169
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I think Mayweather is a very clever man.</v>

170
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Very clever man.</v>

171
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>And setting the fight now is a good time.</v>

172
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good time.</v>

173
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I think so financially though time,</v>

174
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:06.971
<v Speaker 1>financially,</v>

175
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a good time for him as far as like success wise come manic Pacbio</v>

176
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>was extremely dangerous just a few years ago,</v>

177
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>like maybe even more so than he is now.</v>

178
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Some straps though,</v>

179
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a thought and it may not be correct because his last fight against</v>

180
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:22.661
<v Speaker 1>Brenda Reos,</v>

181
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 1>he looked really fucking good and then Chris Algieri,</v>

182
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>he looked really fucking good.</v>

183
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean he looks good dude.</v>

184
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:27.431
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

185
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.264
<v Speaker 1>he's a beast.</v>

186
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Manny Pacquiao was a beast.</v>

188
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:30.131
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

189
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

190
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the mark has knocked out when men will.</v>

191
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Mark has knocked him out,</v>

192
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:35.141
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out.</v>

193
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Dead cold one right hand,</v>

194
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:37.331
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

195
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And the thought is when a guy gets turned off like that,</v>

196
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>like maybe there's a little something that he lost.</v>

197
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a little step it Mike.</v>

198
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not always correct.</v>

199
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes guys bounce back from a knockout and they're fine.</v>

200
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It totally varies on the individual,</v>

201
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.943
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

202
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 1>he always says they have to.</v>

203
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Frazier hit him with that first left and the first fight,</v>

204
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 1>he was more apprehensive than ever,</v>

205
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.441
<v Speaker 1>wasn't his life.</v>

206
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>You said it cost him the fight against Spinks and form him because all he saw</v>

207
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>was that fucking,</v>

208
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.563
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna fucking</v>

209
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but man.</v>

210
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>And it affected the rest of his life.</v>

211
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>It was a launching left towards guys throw himself feet were off the ground.</v>

212
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

213
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever watch the fight but change George Foreman and Joe Frazier?</v>

214
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.933
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

215
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I like Frazier too,</v>

216
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's classic Howard Koh.</v>

217
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Sally Fallon was just something different back then,</v>

218
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:23.961
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

219
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>He was just something different.</v>

220
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 1>He was hitting guys like 20% 30% harder than anybody ever seen.</v>

221
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Fight night back in the 70s was fun,</v>

222
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

223
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

224
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I remember being a kid really getting like,</v>

225
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

226
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you know there's going to be fun.</v>

227
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

228
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching those ABC wide world of sports.</v>

229
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Alexis Arguayo would fight Arguayo prior.</v>

230
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Remember the two are glial prior fights.</v>

231
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.043
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

232
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.770
<v Speaker 1>The one they thought a,</v>

233
00:06:46.771 --> 00:06:47.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

234
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.960
<v Speaker 1>priors fucking manager put us put schnapps and as to got them going,</v>

235
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 1>well they thought it was coke.</v>

236
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

237
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

238
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was,</v>

239
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but then he said it was liquor.</v>

240
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that doesn't make any sense.</v>

241
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>More likely it was COPD.</v>

242
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>If someone gave me a bunch of peppermint Schnapps,</v>

243
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to fight.</v>

244
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

245
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

246
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.551
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

247
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could just tell me if I'm wrong.</v>

248
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could just drink coke.</v>

249
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Like if somebody puts cocaine in a glass and mixes it with waters,</v>

250
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>the liquid cook that you shoot in your nose,</v>

251
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>can you just rank it could pick up Stevie Ray Vaughan Warren's book about</v>

252
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>drinking coke for about,</v>

253
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

254
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.951
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

255
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>You woke up every morning and dissolve cocaine into a glass of Jack Daniels and</v>

256
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 1>drank it like rocky drank Diego</v>

257
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.170
<v Speaker 1>dummies.</v>

258
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>When you're done with doing the line,</v>

259
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you always put the number on your tongue or on your,</v>

260
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 1>makes your whole mouth numb.</v>

261
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:36.771
<v Speaker 1>Said drinking.</v>

262
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>It must make your whole body and specially in whiskey.</v>

263
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

264
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.990
<v Speaker 1>it's an upper and a downer,</v>

265
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

266
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

267
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>That's basically basically a living hell.</v>

268
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.881
<v Speaker 1>We'll the,</v>

269
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>he was just apparently,</v>

270
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean Richard,</v>

271
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:49.801
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

273
00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Aaron Pryor rather later in his career he had a real problem with trucks and</v>

275
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>every problem with cocaine and so it was very likely that he might've had that</v>

276
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.440
<v Speaker 1>problem even while he was like an elite athlete.</v>

277
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And if you gave them just a little bit in the corner like there was no drug,</v>

278
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you another fight as a,</v>

279
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>as a boxing fan.</v>

280
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I ran Barkley and Duran.</v>

281
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

282
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

283
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Roberto Duran showed that even though he was like,</v>

284
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 1>he was in his thirties at the time I ran a bar who's bigger?</v>

285
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Stronger.</v>

286
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I ran back to the,</v>

287
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:16.851
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>

288
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Hearns did knock out turns before that or after that.</v>

289
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

290
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

291
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.230
<v Speaker 1>before I ran bark.</v>

292
00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:23.064
<v Speaker 1>It was terrifying.</v>

293
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>And Roberta around boxes face off the same way.</v>

294
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.693
<v Speaker 1>Did a Davey Moore,</v>

295
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

296
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.801
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

297
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I just wish you would've done it to Leonard.</v>

298
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:29.641
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

299
00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe he couldn't find them,</v>

300
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:31.491
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

301
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Go grab them and just beat him up.</v>

302
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what happened.</v>

303
00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:34.251
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

304
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:35.084
<v Speaker 1>that second fight,</v>

305
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Frank Sinatra got paid.</v>

306
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:37.394
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

307
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.000
<v Speaker 1>It could it be that a lot of people thought that he was paid to take a dive.</v>

308
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>The DRN took a dive.</v>

309
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people thought that they didn't train and just partied like a fucking</v>

310
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:47.410
<v Speaker 1>wild animal.</v>

311
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Actually beat Leonard the first time.</v>

312
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 1>He was one of those guys are one,</v>

313
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>$4 million in a fight and then two months later after a bunch of booze and</v>

314
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

315
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.921
<v Speaker 1>a new shoes,</v>

316
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>he needs to fight again.</v>

317
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 1>He gets like these big white gold shoes and he gets heavy and then it needs to</v>

318
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>box again.</v>

319
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>He's a classic story man.</v>

320
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 1>He's a classic style over Berto around.</v>

321
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:06.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

322
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>he's one of my all time favorites.</v>

323
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Joey Dee has gotten his book many,</v>

324
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>many years ago because we would always sit around and talk about Roberto Duran.</v>

325
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

326
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 1>She always a huge Roberto Duran fan,</v>

327
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:16.494
<v Speaker 1>so it gave me his book.</v>

328
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.170
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

329
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Guy had an incredible life.</v>

330
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he did a lot of boxes.</v>

331
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:21.151
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

332
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 1>probably have,</v>

333
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

334
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>because they're brought up knots.</v>

335
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.343
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

336
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:25.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

337
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to be at the highest level without being a little nuts.</v>

338
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>You got to nurture the physicality and then the anger and then before you know</v>

339
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>you've got a pit bull at attack your neighbor.</v>

340
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want.</v>

341
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a video of Mike Tyson from 87 training with Kevin Rooney and they</v>

342
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>were hitting mitts and you see young Mike Tyson who was like,</v>

343
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:45.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

344
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was like 20 or something at the time.</v>

345
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how old he was,</v>

346
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:51.530
<v Speaker 1>but he was just fucking these myths up.</v>

347
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Just just move so fast for heavyweight and all that Bob and weave and shit that</v>

348
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:56.821
<v Speaker 1>he used to do,</v>

349
00:09:56.821 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 1>like he bumped and weaved after every combination,</v>

350
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.390
<v Speaker 1>every combination she would throw in the past and going down.</v>

351
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.260
<v Speaker 1>It was short and he would,</v>

352
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:02.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

353
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.481
<v Speaker 1>they'd mentioned him.</v>

354
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

355
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

356
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.540
<v Speaker 1>but even in the pants,</v>

357
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 1>like that's how he did it when he was working in the past.</v>

358
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.561
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

359
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:07.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

360
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 1>it's constantly in motion.</v>

361
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Something else.</v>

362
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

363
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.911
<v Speaker 1>I met a mental,</v>

364
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>a mental thing that happened.</v>

365
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think emotionally,</v>

366
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>you got to stay tough a long time,</v>

367
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:19.074
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

368
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

369
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.261
<v Speaker 1>even Ali,</v>

370
00:10:20.261 --> 00:10:20.820
<v Speaker 1>he went,</v>

371
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 1>but he lasted long enough.</v>

372
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 1>But Tyson,</v>

373
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:24.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years and then he went crazy.</v>

375
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.023
<v Speaker 1>And I don't blame him for,</v>

376
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I don't blame a guy for going crazy.</v>

377
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

378
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

379
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:30.230
<v Speaker 1>look at the,</v>

380
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>look at the men who live in that car dash in house.</v>

381
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>They all eventually go nudge that.</v>

382
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>That's atmosphere.</v>

383
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Like Lamar Odom starts smoking crack.</v>

384
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And of course we're a,</v>

385
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Jenner has a pushy,</v>

386
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 1>he's getting one.</v>

388
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

389
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's really difficult to believe,</v>

390
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.840
<v Speaker 1>well to be at the level that a Mike Tyson was at his point in life at a really</v>

391
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 1>young age,</v>

392
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 1>20 year old champion of the world.</v>

393
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

394
00:10:57.421 --> 00:10:57.691
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

395
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Speaker 1>he's out there doing whatever he wants to do.</v>

396
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Basically buying Bentleys crashed them,</v>

397
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.090
<v Speaker 1>giving them the cops.</v>

398
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

399
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:05.190
<v Speaker 1>he was just off the chain,</v>

400
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>crazy owned the lion.</v>

401
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:06.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

402
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:07.824
<v Speaker 1>he was just crazy.</v>

403
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't get any crazier and you can't keep that up.</v>

404
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like this and that's not a sustainable life.</v>

405
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 1>And now I listen.</v>

406
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't live a sustainable life so much less that I,</v>

407
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:18.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

408
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I have decided that something's got to change.</v>

409
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:21.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

410
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm pushing 50.</v>

411
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.010
<v Speaker 1>What's got to change career?</v>

412
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not the careers.</v>

413
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Y'All gonna make me money.</v>

414
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to shoot pool with sweat.</v>

415
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that good.</v>

416
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.890
<v Speaker 1>It's making it happen.</v>

417

490
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Live performance by an intoxicated man who you love.</v>

494
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 1>How dare he,</v>

495
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>he lived across the street.</v>

496
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:38.710
<v Speaker 1>He looked like David Beckham.</v>

497
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 1>It was a beautiful,</v>

498
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 1>do you think is gay that I feel Chad Ochocinco is David Beckham dipped and</v>

499
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:46.804
<v Speaker 1>fudge?</v>

500
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.123
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

501
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.121
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

502
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a huge insult.</v>

503
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>The Chat Osho Sinco cause he's far more beautiful.</v>

504
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.220
<v Speaker 1>You like him while he's just looks wise.</v>

505
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.303
<v Speaker 1>I mean his,</v>

506
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at both of them naked,</v>

507
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 1>you would definitely be able to tell if it was in black and white.</v>

508
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:03.874
<v Speaker 1>Who's who?</v>

509
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.290
<v Speaker 1>They're both the same color shadow just and goes a different kind of athlete I</v>

510
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 1>guess.</v>

511
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 1>So that guy's a fucking freak athlete,</v>

512
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>but he's fucking up.</v>

513
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.731
<v Speaker 1>He's not around.</v>

514
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 1>He's not throwing her son.</v>

515
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to keep that going.</v>

516
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Like we talked about earlier,</v>

517
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.960
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about him so we know who he is,</v>

518
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:19.691
<v Speaker 1>we know who he has.</v>

519
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:20.830
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people know who he is,</v>

520
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>which means he probably,</v>

521
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:23.230
<v Speaker 1>at least for a short period of time,</v>

522
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>he got fucked a lot of money and before that probably didn't have any money.</v>

523
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.801
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

524
00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>

525
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're giving,</v>

526
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

527
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 1>his problems and merit.</v>

528
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

529
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I agree with everything,</v>

530
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:36.850
<v Speaker 1>but the man did change his name to Otros Cinco it's 85 in Spanish.</v>

531
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.830
<v Speaker 1>If you're normal,</v>

532
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that.</v>

533
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.350
<v Speaker 1>But we are talking about them.</v>

534
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.391
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

535
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

536
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can talk about Hitler to what,</v>

537
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:44.531
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

538
00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

539
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.161
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

540
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:46.270
<v Speaker 1>what's the criteria?</v>

541
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:46.901
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to talk about?</v>

542
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:47.291
<v Speaker 1>I think for,</v>

543
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:47.471
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

544
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:50.050
<v Speaker 1>but I think for those guys is what I'm saying to those guys.</v>

545
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Like it's important to get your movies,</v>

546
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.731
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>

547
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:53.241
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

548
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:53.810
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

549
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good move to call yourself.</v>

550
00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Otros Sinco we're,</v>

551
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.033
<v Speaker 1>I mean otherwise,</v>

552
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.651
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

553
00:14:57.651 --> 00:14:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't follow sports so we really wouldn't know.</v>

554
00:14:59.630 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

555
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a Jersey number,</v>

556
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:01.180

557
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:01.420

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to change my last,</v>

559

<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

566
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 1>What else are you been up to?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Most of those I don't do,</v>

582
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>some of them I do do,</v>

583
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

584
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 1>what we do,</v>

585
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 1>what we do in recently is we have a bunch of guys in here and we watched the</v>

586
00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 1>fights and do a podcast podcast while we're watching the fights.</v>

587
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:51.081
<v Speaker 1>That's really fun.</v>

588
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

589
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I did that with the super bowl because I have a $30,000 bet on it and it was</v>

590
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 1>kind of weird to see what happened.</v>

591
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I won five grand.</v>

592
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ son,</v>

593
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.001
<v Speaker 1>I want to fly,</v>

594
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:00.260
<v Speaker 1>washed on the fucking coin,</v>

595
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 1>toss to a grand.</v>

596
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Did you really immediately,</v>

597
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 1>pissed off a few thousand dollar coin toss.</v>

599
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I was down two grand before the game started.</v>

600
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>

601
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>But I ended up up five g's.</v>

602
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I had to patch and had the patriots in the over.</v>

603
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Did you like gambling?</v>

604
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.010
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing I could tell.</v>

605
00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 1>As soon as we moved to gambling tonight,</v>

606
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Brian Regan wanted to hustle us.</v>

607
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 1>We had to play a $20 game at nine bucks.</v>

608
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I ended up walking away with a double Savak.</v>

609
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

610
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.971
<v Speaker 1>he won't.</v>

611
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Fives and mine and he got out like four or five balls in a row,</v>

612
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 1>like not,</v>

613
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.913
<v Speaker 1>not an easy out.</v>

614
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.753
<v Speaker 1>You got out.</v>

615
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

616
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate your one game and already cleaned it up and know you won the first</v>

617
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:37.070
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

618
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.900
<v Speaker 1>You're in bed on the first til you one,</v>

619
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.090
<v Speaker 1>but we're just playing and then Reagan wanted to hustle us.</v>

620
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was going to pull out the real game.</v>

621
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

622
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:43.341
<v Speaker 1>Ree and lipstick.</v>

623
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he grew up in my list,</v>

624
00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 1>you know Irish name,</v>

626
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he's a fucking pirate.</v>

627
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.623
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

628
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to do Charles Dickens.</v>

629
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

630
00:16:55.491 --> 00:16:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I got confused.</v>

631
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I never know what that guy sounded like.</v>

632
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:58.484
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

633
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 1>That was a fun time.</v>

634
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Are you enjoying doing podcasting now?</v>

635
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.953
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

636
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you like it?</v>

637
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:05.651
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't an I,</v>

638
00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:06.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

639
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an ambitious guy.</v>

640
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:08.061
<v Speaker 1>My point is like,</v>

641
00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:08.930
<v Speaker 1>you know the rob Lowe,</v>

642
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:09.890
<v Speaker 1>like the audio line.</v>

643
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm more like the Stop Caring Rob Lowe.</v>

644
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:13.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

645
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm that guy like in the contract.</v>

646
00:17:14.961 --> 00:17:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

647
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:15.471
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

648
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:17.040
<v Speaker 1>That commercial with the caveman level.</v>

649
00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:17.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

650
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:17.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

651
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:17.711
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

652
00:17:17.711 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm the other guy.</v>

653
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:19.521
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

654
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:20.354
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

655
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you know the podcast,</v>

656
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

657
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I do it in my kitchen.</v>

658
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I've been late eight times.</v>

659
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

660
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 1>what don't you like about it?</v>

661
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>You were so good on the radio.</v>

662
00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:31.340
<v Speaker 1>What would you like on the radio?</v>

663
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:31.641
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

664
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:32.121
<v Speaker 1>I like to,</v>

665
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I like talking like this and saying stuff on the radio.</v>

666
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't like organizing it.</v>

667
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:36.464
<v Speaker 1>And doing anything.</v>

668
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I just let everybody else do it,</v>

669
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:41.990
<v Speaker 1>but then eventually I need something done properly and it's a mess.</v>

670
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

671
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>That just seems like a logistics thing that seems like that could be handled,</v>

672
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 1>but you're a really fucking funny guy and you did not have a podcast and be</v>

673
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.610
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

674
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

675
00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>you've been a couple,</v>

676
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple problems that you've had over the last few months about tweets</v>

677
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:54.541
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

678
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Like we read those tweets off.</v>

679
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:57.470
<v Speaker 1>We were fucking howling.</v>

680
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.333
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

681
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I think there was anything wrong with it.</v>

682
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:00.391
<v Speaker 1>I get on Twitter,</v>

683
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:00.691
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

684
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:00.901
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

685
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 1>this is hilarious.</v>

686
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:02.461
<v Speaker 1>Like you think.</v>

687
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he really means what he's saying?</v>

688
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:04.681
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

689
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're so stupid.</v>

690
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:07.044
<v Speaker 1>So stupid.</v>

691
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.380
<v Speaker 1>He took Joe not,</v>

692
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:08.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

693
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 1>it really is a,</v>

694
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>it really is growth in either one of those things you said was mean spirited.</v>

695
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It was funny shit.</v>

696
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

697
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.871
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

698
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Self deprecating and in the one where I'm Thomas Jefferson and the black guys</v>

699
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 1>all carry champions of Shah,</v>

700
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.170
<v Speaker 1>the slave where Carrie champion is my slave and I'm,</v>

701
00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm her master.</v>

702
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I point out that I,</v>

703
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I do not a Jack Hewlett until she escaped.</v>

704
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that you would have her beat you and you'd come all of these and</v>

705
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say,</v>

706
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:40.321
<v Speaker 1>I'll go one further.</v>

707
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying when I be seeing,</v>

708
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 1>when I see an African American woman get her freedom and break free from the</v>

709
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:47.094
<v Speaker 1>chains,</v>

710
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I just blow a load over the Blair.</v>

711
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:49.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

712
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>so you have to see the freedom happen in order for you to come.</v>

713
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.120
<v Speaker 1>You're a freedom of justice warrior led Jizzum ring.</v>

714
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 1>How dare you see,</v>

715
00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong with you being incredibly excited and</v>

716
00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:04.470
<v Speaker 1>sexually aroused at a woman achieving freedom.</v>

717
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that we should all be another owner.</v>

718
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Can you think,</v>

719
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 1>do you think you are capable of coming equally from a man achieving freedom or</v>

720
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:12.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe a game and though</v>

721
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you got to come across the board and everybody will be happy.</v>

722
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

723
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll come when people get free.</v>

724
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't think I could come for a man.</v>

725
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

726
00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's possible and that then I'm going against the man getting</v>

727
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:25.194
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

728
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh a man getting through,</v>

729
00:19:27.151 --> 00:19:27.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

730
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.751
<v Speaker 1>Getting free,</v>

731
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.920
<v Speaker 1>like the same way for of us slave mail.</v>

732
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.620
<v Speaker 1>I'd be more happy about it,</v>

733
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.880
<v Speaker 1>but I just moved clapping.</v>

734
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's just your outlook.</v>

735
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

736
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 1>as a controversial of course.</v>

737
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what comedy is about.</v>

738
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:37.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

739
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:37.860
<v Speaker 1>and I look,</v>

740
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I know you're trying to be funny.</v>

741
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

742
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.371
<v Speaker 1>It's what it is.</v>

743
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're some fucking politician.</v>

744
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It says some nutty shit that nobody expected out of nowhere off camera.</v>

745
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 1>And you catch them like this is his real beliefs,</v>

746
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:50.641
<v Speaker 1>but whoa,</v>

747
00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:52.530
<v Speaker 1>we just found out that already loves slaves.</v>

748
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.251
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

749
00:19:53.251 --> 00:19:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking comic.</v>

750
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

751
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:55.951
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

752
00:19:55.951 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd really hire,</v>

753
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.940
<v Speaker 1>they get a slave in my house.</v>

754
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.920
<v Speaker 1>It made me angry and I made me angry.</v>

755
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.691
<v Speaker 1>Very angry.</v>

756
00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:03.524
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>

757
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just so silly and it cost me something.</v>

758
00:20:05.641 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Of course we an appearance on a talk show was trying to care about,</v>

759
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 1>but still they,</v>

760
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 1>they took something from me and that's when her happy we got in front of me,</v>

761
00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:12.301
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

762
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Now go fuck off.</v>

763
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:13.830
<v Speaker 1>We win.</v>

764
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.640
<v Speaker 1>But they don't,</v>

765
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.790
<v Speaker 1>they don't see what happened.</v>

766
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Got a lot of people on your side with that.</v>

767
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.270
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lot of people who enjoy that kind of comedy.</v>

768
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I always talk about Brian Holtzman like hell he has,</v>

769
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>he says ridiculous,</v>

770
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 1>cruel shit,</v>

771
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's hilarious cause I know him.</v>

772
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.810
<v Speaker 1>He's a sweetheart of a guy.</v>

773
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.700
<v Speaker 1>He used to do this joke about Susan Smith or the chicken drowned her kids.</v>

774
00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:34.901
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

775
00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:35.370
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

776
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.120
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

777
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I heard those kids were bad.</v>

778
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I sat back,</v>

779
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.423
<v Speaker 1>close it,</v>

780
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.591
<v Speaker 1>put away their blocks.</v>

781
00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Those tests will not be missed.</v>

782
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.540
<v Speaker 1>You got to see him doing it to understand that you can't take it out of context.</v>

783
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 1>You got to see his whole act.</v>

784
00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

785
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 1>He says</v>

786
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of really and then he laughs at himself.</v>

787
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.990
<v Speaker 2>He's being funny and it's,</v>

788
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 2>it's an art form.</v>

789
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Just like a violent movies and art forum.</v>

790
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't really killing people.</v>

791
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Whoa mate.</v>

792
00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:57.881
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

793
00:20:57.881 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

794
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.960
<v Speaker 2>just to prove your point where I went to match.com after I broke up and they</v>

795
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Speaker 2>give you a form thing you have to fill out and have to be honest in the</v>

796
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 2>questions is I could,</v>

797
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I could never be honest in those questions.</v>

798
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I've got a girl who looks like she's an isis.</v>

799
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.473
<v Speaker 2>So I did that.</v>

800
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:09.951
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

801
00:21:09.951 --> 00:21:10.784
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

802
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I got to the part where it said what's the worst thing we've ever done?</v>

803
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:14.470
<v Speaker 2>And I put,</v>

804
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I actually put that down to see what kind of reaction I get.</v>

805
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.050
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

806
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 2>the worst I,</v>

807
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.210
<v Speaker 2>one time I had sex with a retarded girl and to get rid of her,</v>

808
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I put her on a bus.</v>

809
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.703
<v Speaker 2>How did that work?</v>

810
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

811
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:27.461
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

812
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen her since,</v>

813
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 2>but do you know what I mean?</v>

814
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 2>It's for mass.com.</v>

815
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.303
<v Speaker 2>Did you put that on?</v>

816
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get the date.</v>

817
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.120
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

818
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

819
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even gonna get into that either.</v>

820
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:40.931
<v Speaker 2>That's shocking.</v>

821
00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:41.241
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

822
00:21:41.241 --> 00:21:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Just people didn't think it was really you.</v>

823
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 2>I bet they didn't want to get catfished.</v>

824
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Who would these take it is someone pretended to be you writing retarded shit.</v>

825
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 2>They probably didn't think it was here.</v>

826
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:51.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason why it didn't work.</v>

827
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Now that people know to check that page later,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not a ton of people listening to it.</v>

849
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:26.170

906
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.640
<v Speaker 2>doing comedy or podcasting.</v>

907
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I could do black hair thing,</v>

908
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.351
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

909
00:23:43.351 --> 00:23:44.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

910
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.853
<v Speaker 2>You could do,</v>

911
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

912
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

913
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 1>But You keep going.</v>

914
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

915
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 1>If someone like sets it up for you.</v>

916
00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:50.564
<v Speaker 1>It makes it nice.</v>

917
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I haven't shut up,</v>

918
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a studio.</v>

919
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I think the were a lot of people were doing wrong is they're trying to get paid</v>

920
00:23:57.891 --> 00:23:59.510
<v Speaker 1>from podcasts right off the bat.</v>

921
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's,</v>

922
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

923
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hard to do that.</v>

924
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I know Anthony has been pretty successful.</v>

925
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:04.574
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Kumiai,</v>

926
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

927
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:05.901
<v Speaker 1>he's got a very,</v>

928
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 1>very devoted following already on his,</v>

929
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>like he had that video podcast set up right before we ever did it.</v>

930
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this.</v>

931
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Anthony has a fucking full studio in his base with a green screen.</v>

932
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

933
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.830
<v Speaker 1>He's had that since like 2006 or something fucking crazy like that.</v>

934
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:25.020
<v Speaker 1>He's always experimented online and he's just kind of a tech genius.</v>

935
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

936
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

937
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.563
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

938
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So he built up this following and then he started hiring,</v>

939
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

940
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 1>having people do subscriptions when he left Opie and Anthony.</v>

941
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 1>But I think that if you start off,</v>

942
00:24:34.851 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

943

00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I think they took that from,</v>

1018
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.001
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1019
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win the Mulatto.</v>

1020
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.233
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1021
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.800
<v Speaker 1>describe why you should do a podcast.</v>

1022
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.823
<v Speaker 1>How could you not do it?</v>

1023
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Now you know what I,</v>

1024
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:24.091
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1025
00:26:24.091 --> 00:26:24.901
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get your number.</v>

1026
00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to text you about this.</v>

1027
00:26:25.921 --> 00:26:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I need some advice.</v>

1028
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.061
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

1030
00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I need some advice.</v>

1031
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I think we could,</v>

1032
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.810
<v Speaker 1>we could get you a 10 times increase in how many people are listening to it.</v>

1033
00:26:33.811 --> 00:26:34.644
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1034
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not about my health at all.</v>

1035
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>All your health to you and I.</v>

1036
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people listen to that.</v>

1037
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.271
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

1038
00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:40.104
<v Speaker 1>I need more,</v>

1039
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but my health is what I'm talking about.</v>

1040
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1041
00:26:42.151 --> 00:26:42.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1042
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.283
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

1043
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 1>It's real simple.</v>

1044
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.043
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1045
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1046
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not simple psychologically and it's not simple emotionally.</v>

1047
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the hard part,</v>

1048
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's real simple.</v>

1049
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Eat really healthy foods.</v>

1050
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Your body will get leaner,</v>

1051
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose weight.</v>

1052
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>

1053
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:57.661
<v Speaker 1>You just got it.</v>

1054
00:26:57.661 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 1>That should be all.</v>

1055
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck am I going to hard to do?</v>

1056
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:00.774
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>

1057
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.943
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to avoid.</v>

1058
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1059
00:27:02.201 --> 00:27:03.410
<v Speaker 1>he came in with a cheeseburger.</v>

1060
00:27:03.411 --> 00:27:04.244
<v Speaker 1>I do know.</v>

1061
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.303
<v Speaker 1>Did I?</v>

1062
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1063
00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 1>he came in with a cheeseburger.</v>

1064
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:09.150
<v Speaker 1>You were joking about it being gluten free.</v>

1065
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Can I really?</v>

1066
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:11.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I was very with that.</v>

1068
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I eat them all the time,</v>

1069
00:27:14.071 --> 00:27:14.401
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1070
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I eat cheeseburgers all the time.</v>

1071
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.771
<v Speaker 1>I eat two of them.</v>

1072
00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:19.560
<v Speaker 1>The other day I was at a fucking food truck in Portland.</v>

1073
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:20.370
<v Speaker 1>It was so good.</v>

1074
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.151
<v Speaker 1>I had a tie.</v>

1075
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Bacon cheeseburger.</v>

1076
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.341
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

1077
00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:23.971
<v Speaker 1>it was good.</v>

1078
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 1>That sounds unbelievable.</v>

1079
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:25.921
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>

1080
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 1>He'd had grilled Jalapenos in it and that peanut Thai sauce,</v>

1081
00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:31.350
<v Speaker 1>like saute sauce or whatever it is.</v>

1082
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1083
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1084
00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:33.811
<v Speaker 1>It was so good.</v>

1085
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I had to go back and have another one.</v>

1086
00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:35.071
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1087
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a place called the brunch box and Portland was a little food.</v>

1088
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Trucks get it and they give it to us for free.</v>

1089
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.100
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't even talk about money,</v>

1090
00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:43.030
<v Speaker 1>so it gives them good for you.</v>

1091
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Good street food,</v>

1092
00:27:45.151 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>cod,</v>

1093
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.801
<v Speaker 1>Tam.</v>

1094
00:27:45.801 --> 00:27:46.634
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

1095
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.840
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with a little bit of that every now and then,</v>

1096
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 1>but what you need to do is just figure out a way to discipline yourself,</v>

1097
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see that happening unless you're like a long shot,</v>

1098
00:27:56.431 --> 00:27:57.780
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like your support.</v>

1099
00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.011
<v Speaker 1>It's a long arch,</v>

1100
00:27:59.011 --> 00:27:59.731
<v Speaker 1>a long shot,</v>

1101
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 1>and I would just accept you just putting one down like,</v>

1102
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:02.221
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1103
00:28:02.221 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I think are just going to do it.</v>

1104
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely do it well before you were being sarcastic.</v>

1105
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:06.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1106
00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:07.351
<v Speaker 1>you could do it,</v>

1107
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:08.670
<v Speaker 1>but you keep saying like,</v>

1108
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.391
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1109
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:09.931
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

1110
00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:10.890
<v Speaker 1>How's that going to happen?</v>

1111
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta like the side that you're going to make some sort of a gigantic</v>

1112
00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:14.800
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

1113
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking very difficult to do.</v>

1114
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 1>You know they won't take,</v>

1115
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 1>they say one day at a time.</v>

1116
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.730
<v Speaker 1>That's really bullshit cause it's every 10 seconds at a time.</v>

1117
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:22.683
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1118
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.950
<v Speaker 1>The timing 12 I have had the stop in the last six months.</v>

1119
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:26.371
<v Speaker 1>It's literally,</v>

1120
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not a short list.</v>

1121
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:28.051
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

1122
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:28.741
<v Speaker 1>it's booze,</v>

1123
00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:29.371
<v Speaker 1>it's heroin,</v>

1124
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:29.941
<v Speaker 1>it's coke,</v>

1125
00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:30.774
<v Speaker 1>it's pills,</v>

1127
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:33.031
<v Speaker 1>gluten.</v>

1128
00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:33.864
<v Speaker 1>It shakes.</v>

1129
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Don't have a cherry.</v>

1130
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.120
<v Speaker 1>If you have an orange,</v>

1131
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 1>peel it this way and if you drink water,</v>

1132
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:39.120

1133
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:39.954

1137
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:50.940
<v Speaker 1>How much of the life pleasure that you get out of life revolves around food?</v>

1138
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just below the heroin pleasure.</v>

1139
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Not Food is a sensuous thing,</v>

00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:34.110
<v Speaker 1>six days of eating good.</v>

1161
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.440
<v Speaker 1>One day you're allowed to go off like a rocket one day where it's just fucking</v>

1162
00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:44.901
<v Speaker 1>linguine with sauce and fucking Lasagna and steaks and milkshakes and whatever</v>

1163
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you want one day.</v>

1164
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 1>But all the other days really healthy.</v>

1165
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:50.201
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1166
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Lyrics like real foods,</v>

1167
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.920
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

1168
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 1>not six days.</v>

1169
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:56.014
<v Speaker 1>One healthy one night.</v>

1170
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:56.950
<v Speaker 1>If you just did that,</v>

1171
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.530
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a radical change and cut out soda.</v>

1172
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have to drink soda,</v>

1173
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:02.320
<v Speaker 1>if you really have to.</v>

1174
00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It sounds gross because Diet soda has aspartame,</v>

1175
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 1>which probably gets brain cancer,</v>

1176
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 1>but it will definitely be better.</v>

1177
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Story gets better and better.</v>

1178
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.003
<v Speaker 1>It'll definitely be bad,</v>

1179
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.350
<v Speaker 1>allegedly gives you as,</v>

1180

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.460
<v Speaker 1>like she specialized in like green vegetable shakes and she had this crazy diet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Kevin hired her and this woman would cook for him every day.</v>

1204
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.480
<v Speaker 1>She would cook all these like really lean vegetable based diets.</v>

1205
00:30:50.481 --> 00:30:52.240
<v Speaker 1>This fucking dude lost 70 pounds.</v>

1242
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 1>based on the results that they think they can get you,</v>

00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:13.730
<v Speaker 1>the interviewers said the Sinatra Frank.</v>

1304
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.210
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel when you hear that the criminals,</v>

1305
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.280
<v Speaker 1>like Charles Manson say if they ever break out of prison,</v>

1306
00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>they're going to kill people like you Shirley Maclaine,</v>

1307
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.091
<v Speaker 1>Dean Martin,</v>

1308
00:33:23.091 --> 00:33:23.871
<v Speaker 1>what do you say to that?</v>

1309
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:25.700
<v Speaker 1>And without missing a beat and actual look to the,</v>

1310
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 1>what did the guy and said let him out.</v>

1311
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.580
<v Speaker 1>He just said let them out into nothing.</v>

1312
00:33:33.581 --> 00:33:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy got scared when?</v>

1313
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1314
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.060
<v Speaker 1>basically let them out.</v>

1315
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:38.894
<v Speaker 1>I'll kill.</v>

1316
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.313
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1317
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't bullshitting either.</v>

1318
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1319
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

1320
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.970
<v Speaker 1>if I would find that out,</v>

1321
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.700
<v Speaker 1>you know how many people's in Nacho must've known.</v>

1322
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:53.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was the god of the Italian world.</v>

1323
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I live around a block from where I grew up.</v>

1324
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.903
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1325
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:56.751
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

1326
00:33:56.751 --> 00:33:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Who's got his house?</v>

1327
00:33:57.711 --> 00:33:58.071
<v Speaker 1>Who owns?</v>

1328
00:33:58.071 --> 00:33:58.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1329
00:33:58.221 --> 00:33:59.120
<v Speaker 1>it's an empty lot.</v>

1330
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Of course out of respect.</v>

1331
00:34:00.711 --> 00:34:03.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a social club right next to it that they play a poker at.</v>

1332
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Why I was $38,000 or one night,</v>

1333
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1334
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 1>allowed to talk about this on the air.</v>

1335
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Like where are they play as years ago.</v>

1336
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.291
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1337
00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 1>they're not there anymore,</v>

1338
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.843
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1339
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Ben Doesn't,</v>

1340
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 1>no cop is going to tell him to stop.</v>

1341
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.710
<v Speaker 1>That's just that spot and that spot.</v>

1342
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1343
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1344
00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.600
<v Speaker 1>You like Hoboken.</v>

1345
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.673
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

1346
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:22.760
<v Speaker 1>You got a beautiful view,</v>

1347
00:34:22.761 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 1>right view.</v>

1348
00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I look at the whole city and the view of the city from outside the city is</v>

1349
00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:28.770
<v Speaker 1>actually better than the view inside.</v>

1350
00:34:28.771 --> 00:34:29.241
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1351
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:29.751
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1352
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:31.520
<v Speaker 1>It's good to look at the city but not be in it.</v>

1353
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who lives in Brooklyn and he,</v>

1354
00:34:34.131 --> 00:34:35.150
<v Speaker 1>he's got a um,</v>

1355
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.230
<v Speaker 1>a high floor,</v>

1356
00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 1>like he's a like on the 10th or 11th floor and it's above the river.</v>

1357
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Like just looking out across and you see the bridge to the right.</v>

1358
00:34:42.681 --> 00:34:43.670
<v Speaker 1>It looks like framed.</v>

1359
00:34:43.671 --> 00:34:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look real really.</v>

1360
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:45.771
<v Speaker 1>You look out his window,</v>

1361
00:34:45.771 --> 00:34:47.300
<v Speaker 1>you're like dude your view isn't even real.</v>

1362
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of view I have.</v>

1363
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>

1364
00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I have these single best view of Manhattan from the Hudson River side.</v>

1365
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like a painting to me there's like three great views in the world.</v>

1366
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot but there's three,</v>

1367
00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:00.020
<v Speaker 1>three of like three archetypes.</v>

1368
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.330
<v Speaker 1>One of them is the nature of you like mountains to me a number one with that</v>

1369
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.570
<v Speaker 1>like mountains in a lake cause he,</v>

1370
00:35:05.571 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 1>those two of them together.</v>

1371
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 1>That to me is like the most spectacular thing to look at.</v>

1372
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 1>But the other two are two different types of city views.</v>

1373
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.940
<v Speaker 1>There's The New York one from across the river.</v>

1374
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.620
<v Speaker 1>We had it and you realize like,</v>

1375
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:15.921
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1376
00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 1>this is an amazing place.</v>

1377
00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got the size of this,</v>

1378
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 1>this hub of life and humanity.</v>

1379
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 1>But with the weirdest one is above doe.</v>

1380
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Heeney a lot of people don't even know about this one.</v>

1381
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:26.210
<v Speaker 1>You go into Hollywood,</v>

1382
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:30.100
<v Speaker 1>you go into the hills above doe Heaney and you're looking down over the city and</v>

1383
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking down over the city it looks like blade.</v>

1384
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about it,</v>

1385
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:34.450
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look real.</v>

1386
00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.241
<v Speaker 1>I do those though.</v>

1387
00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:35.661
<v Speaker 1>He anyone.</v>

1388
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1389
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:36.321
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1390
00:35:36.321 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not my friend Larry used to have a house up there and it didn't look real.</v>

1391
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you would look out as Yardi go Pauler you're such a ball.</v>

1392
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah and it's scary.</v>

1393
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1394
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.793
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

1395
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Alien like you're looking down at a space ship.</v>

1396
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't look like any other view I've ever seen.</v>

1397
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I've taken photos of it.</v>

1398
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:55.590
<v Speaker 1>When you're flying in you kind of sort of get it,</v>

1399
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:56.551
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get it.</v>

1400
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you get it when you're looking at someone's back porch.</v>

1401
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Cause he had like one of those infinity pools and like you would sit by the pool</v>

1402
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 1>and you'd look out off the balcony like,</v>

1403
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:04.891
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1404
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:06.240
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking view.</v>

1405
00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:07.260
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

1406
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 1>He's like living in a science fiction movie,</v>

1407
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 1>but that helps you get up in the morning.</v>

1408
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:11.851
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1409
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1410
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.560
<v Speaker 1>there's going to nature.</v>

1411
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 1>You can't be in a bad mood.</v>

1412
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:16.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like art,</v>

1414
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:16.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1415
00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:16.980
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1416
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're looking at natural art.</v>

1417
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.530
<v Speaker 1>That's how I was like me.</v>

1418
00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I look at Shawn,</v>

1419
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I have route three and she cook.</v>

1420
00:36:21.791 --> 00:36:22.624
<v Speaker 1>It switches.</v>

1421
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 1>There's usually no trouble.</v>

1422
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.321
<v Speaker 1>No trouble.</v>

1423
00:36:25.321 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 1>You look at the atmosphere,</v>

1424
00:36:26.911 --> 00:36:27.360
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>

1425
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't be in a bad mood.</v>

1426
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1427
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:29.701
<v Speaker 1>well you can,</v>

1428
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Speaker 1>but you're silly.</v>

1429
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1430
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I avoid it and that's saying a lot.</v>

1431
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.873
<v Speaker 1>You avoid nature.</v>

1432
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.013
<v Speaker 1>No bad mood.</v>

1433
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.883
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1434
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.470
<v Speaker 1>do you see yourself becoming a man of the woods someday?</v>

1435
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.160
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1436
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Packing up.</v>

1437
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I would just lay down just like that.</v>

1438
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I would lay down,</v>

1439
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:45.301
<v Speaker 1>I would go,</v>

1440
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:45.601
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1441
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to wait to a road.</v>

1442
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I see a theme here.</v>

1443
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.800
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing I offer.</v>

1444
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 1>You need to be motivated because you're obviously very,</v>

1445
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:52.824
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>

1446
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.530
<v Speaker 1>You get somebody to come along a little comedy.</v>

1447
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I drive like get up.</v>

1448
00:36:56.401 --> 00:36:56.941
<v Speaker 1>I got a check.</v>

1449
00:36:56.941 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I come back.</v>

1450
00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean what the fuck?</v>

1451
00:36:58.381 --> 00:36:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1452
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a bump on a log here.</v>

1453
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:00.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1454
00:37:00.821 --> 00:37:01.110
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1455
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you're in.</v>

1456
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.360
<v Speaker 1>You're in action,</v>

1457
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.360
<v Speaker 1>but you look like you're maybe not enjoying some of the action but you shit.</v>

1458
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Mitch called withdrawals is maybe a little,</v>

1459
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Speaker 1>how long does that last for?</v>

1460
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.240
<v Speaker 1>22 days.</v>

1461
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Now when you go to a doctor and you get like your blood work done,</v>

1462
00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:22.460
<v Speaker 1>they check out all your vitamin levels are the worst stuff.</v>

1463
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.861
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

1464
00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:23.190
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1465
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

1466
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.541
<v Speaker 1>Diabetes.</v>

1467
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm diabetic too.</v>

1468
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.970
<v Speaker 1>So what do you have to do for that?</v>

1469
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.900
<v Speaker 1>You got to take a pen.</v>

1470
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Boom right there.</v>

1471
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:30.900
<v Speaker 1>How often he takes two seconds.</v>

1472
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:31.734
<v Speaker 1>Once a day.</v>

1473
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that a recent thing and 25 units?</v>

1474
00:37:33.781 --> 00:37:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Two years.</v>

1475
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.423
<v Speaker 1>Last two years.</v>

1476
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Last two years I've had to take the insulin.</v>

1477
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Before that I just had to take the pills.</v>

1478
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.400
<v Speaker 1>And is that related to like diet?</v>

1479
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way to turn it on my show?</v>

1480
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.760
<v Speaker 1>It's very much related.</v>

1481
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.670
<v Speaker 1>It's much almost a hereditary and diet are the two things,</v>

1482
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:48.504
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1483
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.973
<v Speaker 1>Damn Dude.</v>

1484
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1485
00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.650
<v Speaker 1>well I could see how that would weigh you down.</v>

1486
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I can see where that would weigh down.</v>

1487
00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:55.830
<v Speaker 1>That would fuck with you and make you feel like,</v>

1488
00:37:55.831 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1489
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.420
<v Speaker 1>the pen thing isn't bad.</v>

1490
00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:58.231
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1491
00:37:58.231 --> 00:38:00.000
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that you've got diabetes.</v>

1492
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:00.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1493
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a mind fuck.</v>

1494
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:02.543
<v Speaker 1>I had finished,</v>

1495
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd forgotten about it for a couple of days,</v>

1496
00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:04.501
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1497
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:05.334
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1498
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll be all right man.</v>

1499
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I hope you'll be all right.</v>

1500
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll be good.</v>

1501
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going.</v>

1502
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:12.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1503
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>

1504
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:14.611
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1505
00:38:14.611 --> 00:38:15.444
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1506
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I want you to like podcasts.</v>

1507
00:38:17.521 --> 00:38:17.791

1508
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 1>because I got excited when you were doing it.</v>

1509
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.371
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1510
00:38:19.371 --> 00:38:20.204
<v Speaker 1>there's like a sky.</v>

1511
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I like it a lot.</v>

1512
00:38:21.811 --> 00:38:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I got about as much or like anything else.</v>

1513
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.930
<v Speaker 1>So everything's kind of,</v>

1514
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:25.783
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1515
00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.860
<v Speaker 1>well where's that coming from?</v>

1516
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.703
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>

1517
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I like it as much as get anything else because things like,</v>

1518
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:32.683
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1522
00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1523
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's like a defense mechanism?</v>

1524
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.461
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1525
00:38:40.461 --> 00:38:41.294
<v Speaker 2>Problem.</v>

1526
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at that.</v>

1527
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at spotting sparknotes.</v>

1528
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1529
00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:44.840
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1530
00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 2>if I've noticed nothing else in life.</v>

1531
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:47.380
<v Speaker 2>It's that.</v>

1532
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1533
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.200
<v Speaker 2>that Joe Rogan is very perceptive when it comes to</v>

1534
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 2>getting a laser and getting right to the heart of a comedian</v>

1535
00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.450
<v Speaker 1>and getting to your ability to play pool.</v>

1536
00:38:57.451 --> 00:38:58.650
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you start stroking the,</v>

1537
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.240
<v Speaker 1>as I look at this motherfucker,</v>

1538
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

1539
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1540
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.540
<v Speaker 1>you're a great shooter too,</v>

1541
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.690
<v Speaker 1>but I have a table here.</v>

1542
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.371
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1543
00:39:05.371 --> 00:39:05.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1544
00:39:05.521 --> 00:39:07.920
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one thing that is a little impression of about that.</v>

1545
00:39:07.921 --> 00:39:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I have not shot pool and eight months easy.</v>

1546
00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:11.460
<v Speaker 2>I haven't picked up stick.</v>

1547
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Well it makes sense because like it took you a couple shots to get loose.</v>

1548
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Well here comes in,</v>

1549
00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:16.890
<v Speaker 2>there comes a negative.</v>

1550
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:17.933
<v Speaker 2>A negative at all.</v>

1551
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Well you said it was great shooting.</v>

1552
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:20.551
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1553
00:39:20.551 --> 00:39:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I suck at first too.</v>

1554
00:39:21.391 --> 00:39:22.700
<v Speaker 2>When Regan and I first day.</v>

1555
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:23.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1556
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:23.650
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1557
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:24.680
<v Speaker 2>you just kept playing.</v>

1558
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.630
<v Speaker 2>You walked in after I'd already wow.</v>

1559
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.121
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1560
00:39:27.121 --> 00:39:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Well that's nice.</v>

1561
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.320
<v Speaker 2>You did a minute.</v>

1562
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:28.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1563
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.681
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1564
00:39:28.681 --> 00:39:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I was knocking bald in the rail.</v>

1565
00:39:30.211 --> 00:39:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure online it takes a while to loosen the arm up,</v>

1566
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1567
00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>

1568
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.730
<v Speaker 2>especially if you have a play date months,</v>

1569
00:39:35.731 --> 00:39:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I haven't played in two days.</v>

1570
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:37.830
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>

1571
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.410
<v Speaker 2>In one week I won 22 g's hustling line ball.</v>

1572
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.020

<v Speaker 2>We don't know each other.</v>

1589
00:40:02.221 --> 00:40:02.731
<v Speaker 2>We're not friends.</v>

1590
00:40:02.731 --> 00:40:03.461
<v Speaker 2>Let's play three way,</v>

1591
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:03.810
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1592
00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:04.643
<v Speaker 2>It's like a movie.</v>

1593
00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Speaker 2>20 bucks on a five $50 on a nine.</v>

1594
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.393
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1595
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I made sure I went before deach.</v>

1596
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1597
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.080
<v Speaker 2>no [inaudible] made sure he went before me.</v>

1598
00:40:13.081 --> 00:40:14.490
<v Speaker 2>So every time deeds would go,</v>

1599
00:40:14.491 --> 00:40:15.900
<v Speaker 2>he'd miss on purpose,</v>

1600
00:40:15.901 --> 00:40:18.900
<v Speaker 2>but set me up for a perfect shot first on the five,</v>

1601
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:19.763
<v Speaker 2>then on the ninth,</v>

1602
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 2>that's a little area.</v>

1603
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.130
<v Speaker 2>So you guys just kept robbing this one dude?</v>

1604
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1605
00:40:23.341 --> 00:40:23.651
<v Speaker 2>we want,</v>

1606
00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:24.900
<v Speaker 2>we want about 11 games in a row.</v>

1607
00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1608
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Poor bastard.</v>

1609
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:28.903
<v Speaker 2>I proud of it.</v>

1610
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Now the guy seemed like a bit of an Asshole,</v>

1611
00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:34.290
<v Speaker 2>but we've,</v>

1612
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:34.580
<v Speaker 2>we thought,</v>

1613
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:34.851
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

1614
00:40:34.851 --> 00:40:36.780
<v Speaker 2>we got the greatest fucking system of all time.</v>

1615
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.460
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a couple of times he would set me up,</v>

1616
00:40:38.461 --> 00:40:38.941
<v Speaker 2>but I'd miss,</v>

1617
00:40:38.941 --> 00:40:39.571
<v Speaker 2>and he'd look at me like,</v>

1618
00:40:39.571 --> 00:40:40.680
<v Speaker 2>what the fucking door.</v>

1619
00:40:40.681 --> 00:40:41.790
<v Speaker 2>And then one guy,</v>

1620
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Tommy,</v>

1621
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.021
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this.</v>

1622
00:40:43.021 --> 00:40:43.681
<v Speaker 2>We call them red hair,</v>

1623
00:40:43.681 --> 00:40:44.101
<v Speaker 2>Tommy,</v>

1624
00:40:44.101 --> 00:40:46.200
<v Speaker 2>because he had red hair and a,</v>

1625
00:40:46.201 --> 00:40:47.460
<v Speaker 2>and he had like a big,</v>

1626
00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:49.080
<v Speaker 2>big curly red hair and red hair.</v>

1627
00:40:49.081 --> 00:40:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Tom.</v>

1628
00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.400
<v Speaker 2>We found that what we were doing,</v>

1629
00:40:50.401 --> 00:40:51.031
<v Speaker 2>he just wants to make it like,</v>

1630
00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:51.560

00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>You've got his brother who's brother came back with a snowblower.</v>

1634
00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.950
<v Speaker 2>He tried to run us over fucking snowblower and,</v>

1635
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.031
<v Speaker 2>and pool cues.</v>

1636
00:41:00.031 --> 00:41:01.310
<v Speaker 2>He threw me over the table.</v>

1637
00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.533
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1638
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.211
<v Speaker 2>my one buddy,</v>

1639
00:41:03.211 --> 00:41:03.820
<v Speaker 2>his friend was,</v>

1640
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.670
<v Speaker 2>was a cop and he just flipped.</v>

1641
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.340
<v Speaker 2>He flashed the guy's base.</v>

1642
00:41:07.341 --> 00:41:10.790
<v Speaker 2>That guy got the really scared and those days were fun.</v>

1643
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.250
<v Speaker 1>When I first started making money,</v>

1644
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I got a development deal with Disney and a part of the money I use to back my</v>

1645
00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:20.500
<v Speaker 1>friend Johnny B.</v>

1646
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.560
<v Speaker 1>My friend Johnny B was like a professional level pool player.</v>

1647
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.990
<v Speaker 1>A hair off with a pro speed.</v>

1648
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.651
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

1649
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:26.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1650
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:27.490
<v Speaker 1>But he could,</v>

1651
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 1>he could win tournaments.</v>

1652
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It would win turn.</v>

1653
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 1>He could beat a lot of guys like to write the average person.</v>

1654
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:32.270
<v Speaker 1>They would play him.</v>

1655
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:33.103
<v Speaker 1>He'd beat the average,</v>

1656
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 1>who couldn't be like,</v>

1657
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that ever beat like,</v>

1658
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.060
<v Speaker 1>like a real top pro.</v>

1659
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.920
<v Speaker 1>But he beat some like lower level pros.</v>

1660
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:41.060
<v Speaker 1>He was a really good pool player,</v>

1661
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 1>but he was a slick motherfucker.</v>

1662
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1663
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 1>And I would take them on the road.</v>

1664
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:44.040
<v Speaker 1>We would,</v>

1665
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.290
<v Speaker 1>we would go all around,</v>

1666
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:46.880
<v Speaker 1>like we'd go to jersey,</v>

1667
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:48.010
<v Speaker 1>we'd go to western billiards,</v>

1668
00:41:48.011 --> 00:41:48.844
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the APP.</v>

1669
00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I put him in the tournament,</v>

1670
00:41:50.721 --> 00:41:52.070
<v Speaker 1>we'd see if we could get a game.</v>

1671
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And then we play at executive leaders in Chelsea,</v>

1672
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:54.651
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea,</v>

1673
00:41:54.651 --> 00:41:55.371
<v Speaker 1>which was downtown,</v>

1674
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:57.160
<v Speaker 1>which is to know exactly where you're talking about,</v>

1675
00:41:57.161 --> 00:41:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1676
00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.010

1680
00:41:59.641 --> 00:41:59.960

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1682
00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:02.180
<v Speaker 1>So that was my addiction phase.</v>

1683
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Like I was badly,</v>

1684
00:42:03.201 --> 00:42:05.800
<v Speaker 1>badly addicted as eight hours a day for like a bunch.</v>

1685
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I went through uh,</v>

1686

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a blast.</v>

1689
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:15.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a real short of hand eye coordination get slow.</v>

1690
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the best thing about the hustlers,</v>

1691
00:42:17.181 --> 00:42:21.440
<v Speaker 1>they can play for 18 hours in and misses a shot and he just looks over at the</v>

1692
00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:22.031
<v Speaker 1>shade and said,</v>

1693
00:42:22.031 --> 00:42:23.330
<v Speaker 1>well you cut out that white.</v>

1694
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda depressing,</v>

1695
00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but you're like a dark,</v>

1696
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.420
<v Speaker 1>easy Pang and then you leave,</v>

1697

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1698
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1699
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 1>They're guys who do play those kind of long,</v>

1700
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:34.550
<v Speaker 1>24 and 38 hour gambling session.</v>

1701
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.830
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] has happened.</v>

1702
00:42:35.831 --> 00:42:36.411
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

1703
00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:37.244
<v Speaker 1>I have that in me.</v>

1704
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1705
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I like a few hours to pool.</v>

1706
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Those are brutal.</v>

1707
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a young man's game and it's fucking super healthy.</v>

1708
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Like to stay up that late trying to concentrate and drink coffee at the pen,</v>

1709
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.240
<v Speaker 1>which see the great thing about the hustler is the whole premise was Gleason</v>

1710
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:50.841
<v Speaker 1>could shoot,</v>

1711
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much booze you had,</v>

1712
00:42:52.011 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 1>he handled his booze.</v>

1713
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 1>That was a skill.</v>

1714
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Paul Newman,</v>

1715
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:01.220
<v Speaker 1>that's George Scott to handle his booze.</v>

1716
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Picture those three guys in a movie.</v>

1717
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:03.680
<v Speaker 1>How could that be bad?</v>

1718
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:04.910
<v Speaker 1>That'd be bad.</v>

1719
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.760
<v Speaker 1>And Piper Laurie too.</v>

1720
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:08.061

1726
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

1727
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 1>those places just was so interesting.</v>

1728
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.430

1729
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 1>It's where all the people that didn't follow the rules went well.</v>

1730
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 1>That was aims billiard,</v>

1731
00:43:23.481 --> 00:43:28.100
<v Speaker 1>you know that that was a legendary place on 14th street that shot a closed in</v>

1732
00:43:28.101 --> 00:43:28.934
<v Speaker 1>the mid seventies.</v>

1733
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:30.051
<v Speaker 1>But aims was where,</v>

1734
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:30.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1735
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 1>name is played there.</v>

1736
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:32.510
<v Speaker 1>People had Gleason.</v>

1737
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I love to have seen that if it's stuck around,</v>

1738
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:35.504
<v Speaker 1>but they uh,</v>

1739
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:36.410
<v Speaker 1>but they knocked it down,</v>

1740
00:43:36.411 --> 00:43:39.710
<v Speaker 1>but aims was where they shot it and he dealt with the turn of the century in the</v>

1741
00:43:39.711 --> 00:43:43.070
<v Speaker 1>19 hundreds there was something like a thousand pool halls in New York City.</v>

1742
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1743
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1744
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.340
<v Speaker 1>That was a thing to do,</v>

1745
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.223
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1746
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Before video and all the shit you shot a in the pool.</v>

1747
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:50.531
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

1748
00:43:50.531 --> 00:43:51.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1749
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1750
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it's lost favor.</v>

1751
00:43:52.641 --> 00:43:56.150
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand what video games came along and other Games of leisure.</v>

1752
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And not the same thing because it's,</v>

1753
00:43:57.831 --> 00:43:58.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1754
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.160
<v Speaker 1>it's really not on a lot of levels.</v>

1755
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Human contact.</v>

1756
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not even indirectly.</v>

1757
00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 1>At least pool is indirectly.</v>

1758
00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:05.750
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1759
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not even close to human contact.</v>

1760
00:44:07.681 --> 00:44:08.091
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

1761
00:44:08.091 --> 00:44:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it's light years away from it.</v>

1762
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what the pool players blame it on a lot.</v>

1763
00:44:12.111 --> 00:44:13.330
<v Speaker 1>They blame it on casinos,</v>

1764
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 1>like card casinos opening up.</v>

1765
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1766
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.303
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1767
00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Because then people who were,</v>

1768
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 1>who loved to gamble on things,</v>

1769
00:44:19.971 --> 00:44:21.230
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have to execute.</v>

1770
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:21.501
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1771
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:22.520
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing cards,</v>

1772
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to pick the right cards.</v>

1773
00:44:24.051 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 1>You have to make the right choices,</v>

1774
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:27.860
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to physically execute like stroking the ball and missing a</v>

1775
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

1776
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.770
<v Speaker 1>All that pressure on nerves fucks with some people.</v>

1777
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 1>So I like it and they're like,</v>

1778
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 1>that's what killed the pool game or the pressure on nerves,</v>

1779
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.530
<v Speaker 1>pressure and nerves and it's a lot of face up to,</v>

1780
00:44:37.531 --> 00:44:38.630
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of them on.</v>

1781
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.391
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of them.</v>

1782
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:39.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1783
00:44:39.581 --> 00:44:43.350
<v Speaker 1>So like attendance and pool halls dropped down and attendance and his card</v>

1784
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:43.711
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

1785
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 1>These guys that didn't,</v>

1786
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.960
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have to gamble on pool anymore.</v>

1787
00:44:45.961 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Now they go play legal cards.</v>

1788
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1789
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.310
<v Speaker 1>and then of course that cuts into a pool,</v>

1790
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:51.820
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1791
00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.073
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1792
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Some of that.</v>

1793
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Watching a guy shoot a game of pool,</v>

1794
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 1>like just dancing around a table,</v>

1795
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 1>keeping the stick on there,</v>

1796
00:44:59.071 --> 00:44:59.550
<v Speaker 1>looking around,</v>

1797
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:00.331
<v Speaker 1>looking at the angle,</v>

1798
00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

1799
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:01.311
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

1800
00:45:01.311 --> 00:45:01.731
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

1801
00:45:01.731 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1802
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.210
<v Speaker 1>one of my good friends is this guy,</v>

1803
00:45:03.211 --> 00:45:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Max Eberly Max several.</v>

1804
00:45:04.731 --> 00:45:07.030
<v Speaker 1>He's like one of the best players in the world and I,</v>

1805
00:45:07.031 --> 00:45:08.250
<v Speaker 1>I played with him all the time.</v>

1806
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:09.001
<v Speaker 1>It's always frustrating,</v>

1807
00:45:09.001 --> 00:45:10.230
<v Speaker 1>but just watching them,</v>

1808
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I could just pick up like little slight things that he does.</v>

1809
00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Just watching them move.</v>

1810
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Like he always hits the ball the right speed.</v>

1811
00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It's always always dead on the next ball at the perfect angle.</v>

1812
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's artwork and what English you put on.</v>

1813
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1814
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.343
<v Speaker 1>it's an artwork.</v>

1815
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.750
<v Speaker 1>You watch a guy who's just so good at that game,</v>

1816
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.620
<v Speaker 1>then you appreciate it.</v>

1817
00:45:25.621 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's one of those art forms.</v>

1818
00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It's only appreciated by people practice it,</v>

1819
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.150
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

1820
00:45:30.151 --> 00:45:30.980
<v Speaker 1>it's like rap.</v>

1821
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think rap music was a talent until I heard someone who couldn't rap.</v>

1822
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:37.381
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1823
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:38.061
<v Speaker 1>okay man,</v>

1824
00:45:38.061 --> 00:45:38.431
<v Speaker 1>that's new.</v>

1825
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:39.264
<v Speaker 1>It must be good,</v>

1826
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's not on the level of pool.</v>

1827
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean pool is a true sort of,</v>

1828
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1829
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.010
<v Speaker 1>a less sophisticated version of chess.</v>

1830
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:47.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1831
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1832
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1833
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:48.601
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1834
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it's American Jess and a lot of ways and it's perfect for a barge burglary.</v>

1835
00:45:52.591 --> 00:45:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Young guys that get together and bond on it's,</v>

1836
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1837
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.480
<v Speaker 1>a setup perfectly game.</v>

1838
00:45:56.481 --> 00:45:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And you get to use your hand eye coordination.</v>

1839
00:45:58.591 --> 00:46:00.360
<v Speaker 1>It's my favorite in the world.</v>

1840
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1841
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.153
<v Speaker 1>I love it too.</v>

1842
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.851
<v Speaker 1>I wish it would.</v>

1843
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1844
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.991
<v Speaker 1>we need to make it,</v>

1845
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:05.920
<v Speaker 1>make it come back already and come back as shoes.</v>

1846
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:07.910
<v Speaker 1>And the next time I was shooting pool on TV or something,</v>

1847
00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:08.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying we need them.</v>

1848
00:46:08.551 --> 00:46:08.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1849
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:09.421
<v Speaker 1>we need to make it.</v>

1850
00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:10.254
<v Speaker 1>And you'd have a comeback.</v>

1851
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we have a tournament?</v>

1852
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.113
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

1853
00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

1854
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Get in.</v>

1855
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Don't even fuck with me.</v>

1856
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I will do.</v>

1857
00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.533
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1858
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.810
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1859
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:20.260
<v Speaker 1>You will love it and be fine with two I'm talking to.</v>

1860
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1861
00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:20.960
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1862
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.180
<v Speaker 1>well I'm in you.</v>

1863
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 1>You absolutely let me know when I would play in to pull.</v>

1864
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Joe wrote,</v>

1865
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.330
<v Speaker 1>you want to call it Rogan's?</v>

1866
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1867
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:28.930
<v Speaker 1>let's come home talking about how to do it,</v>

1868
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 1>how to do it and we can get some other comics.</v>

1869
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:32.820
<v Speaker 1>A polite Fitzsimmons plays down.</v>

1870
00:46:32.821 --> 00:46:33.654
<v Speaker 1>My Rep,</v>

1871
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:34.643
<v Speaker 1>I know the pilot.</v>

1872
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:36.480
<v Speaker 1>The pilot's was a pretty good game of pool.</v>

1873
00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:36.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1874
00:46:36.781 --> 00:46:37.171
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1875
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:37.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1876
00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:37.831
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know.</v>

1877
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 1>He didn't tell me he held the acquity he was here.</v>

1878
00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 1>He didn't talk Janeane Garofalo was great.</v>

1879
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I heard but I heard she is a true,</v>

1880
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.410
<v Speaker 1>how she gets rid of the ball.</v>

1881
00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:52.140
<v Speaker 1>She shoots it like one of those tie ladies.</v>

1882
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Those things that tug Stan Ho talks about</v>

1883
00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:57.250
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

1884
00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.051
<v Speaker 1>If that was the handicap,</v>

1885
00:46:58.051 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 1>you know people are always making crazy bets.</v>

1886
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Like you know you have to shoot every shot with the plastic bridge would.</v>

1887
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.040
<v Speaker 1>If it was like you can,</v>

1888
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.990
<v Speaker 1>you can play but you have to shoot with your poster stuffed up all over.</v>

1889
00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.830
<v Speaker 1>That's called America.</v>

1890
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.070
<v Speaker 1>There's a woman out there somewhere in the world that can knock,</v>

1891
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 1>pull balls in where her pussy for sure.</v>

1892
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1893
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1894
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Her name was Mrs. Lang.</v>

1895
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.513
<v Speaker 1>I'd like that.</v>

1896
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It must be right.</v>

1897
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>

1898
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean someone's figured that out.</v>

1899
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Some of this has to be a genre of porn thousand videos dedicated to like</v>

1900
00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 1>billiards coming to the girl's vagina so we can only help that happen.</v>

1901
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 1>But by the time you think of something like that,</v>

1902
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:36.130
<v Speaker 1>for sure that's already been done.</v>

1903
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've think of them own the most deprived shit in porn these days.</v>

1904
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there'll be playing pool with pool balls coming out of growth.</v>

1905
00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:44.770
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of rough.</v>

1906
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the smaller balls like maybe snuck her sneaker as my English friends would</v>

1907
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:49.810
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

1908
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting article that might not be of the dungeon.</v>

1909
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:53.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1910
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever watched a game of sneaker?</v>

1911
00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you know drive in him?</v>

1912
00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:57.920
<v Speaker 1>He played snare.</v>

1913
00:47:57.930 --> 00:47:58.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1914
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.520
<v Speaker 1>No note how I'm saying it correctly.</v>

1915
00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.020
<v Speaker 1>She knew very difficult.</v>

1916
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult.</v>

1917
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1918
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 1>those guys become a pool players and they always do really well and almost right</v>

1919
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

1920
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but no pool players go over to snooker and start winning big time tournaments.</v>

1921
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:17.890
<v Speaker 1>They've had some sneaker players from Europe come over and clean up.</v>

1922
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.580
<v Speaker 1>We had the world 10 ball championships Guy Tony Draco.</v>

1923
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1924
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Killer snooker player.</v>

1925
00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1926
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to watch a whole game,</v>

1927
00:48:25.571 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 1>but he gets a little boring without the,</v>

1928
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:27.920
<v Speaker 1>without the pockets.</v>

1929
00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I really am excited about a Pacquiao.</v>

1930
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather though.</v>

1931
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the first big boxing match.</v>

1932
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I just like boxing so much.</v>

1933
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:36.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating fight.</v>

1934
00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1935
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

1936
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1937
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I would wonder,</v>

1938
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1939
00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:39.421
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1940
00:48:39.421 --> 00:48:43.830
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting to see what strategy pack our employees like whether it</v>

1941
00:48:43.831 --> 00:48:47.440
<v Speaker 1>just goes at may weather the way it goes that everybody else just fast.</v>

1942
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:49.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of movement and a lot of rapid combinations.</v>

1943
00:48:49.911 --> 00:48:50.744
<v Speaker 1>A lot of angles.</v>

1944
00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:51.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1945
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 1>him and Freddie Roach been preparing for this guy forever.</v>

1946
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.230
<v Speaker 1>They're both going to be prepared.</v>

1947
00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:56.801
<v Speaker 1>I like Mayweather.</v>

1948
00:48:56.801 --> 00:48:59.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bigger and I think he watched it more than I think it's</v>

1949
00:48:59.321 --> 00:48:59.770
<v Speaker 1>quicker.</v>

1950
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.041
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1951
00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:01.530
<v Speaker 1>may words are quicker than back.</v>

1952
00:49:01.531 --> 00:49:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1953
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Well he's a very clever,</v>

1954
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:03.851
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1955
00:49:03.851 --> 00:49:05.590
<v Speaker 1>very hard to the play head games,</v>

1956
00:49:05.591 --> 00:49:06.580
<v Speaker 1>especially in this country.</v>

1957
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.533
<v Speaker 1>What are you showing me?</v>

1958
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 1>This woman shoots a pool ball out of her vagina and hits him eight ball into the</v>

1959
00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:14.900
<v Speaker 1>corner pocket so we can't show her movie play.</v>

1960
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It's real quick.</v>

1961
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.051
<v Speaker 1>Real quick.</v>

1962
00:49:17.051 --> 00:49:18.430
<v Speaker 1>You and we'll get upset at us.</v>

1963
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was going to happen.</v>

1964
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Here we go and it's coming.</v>

1965
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.390

2042
00:51:14.511 --> 00:51:16.220
<v Speaker 1>actually got like 200 people and say,</v>

2043
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:16.371

2045
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 1>deciding factor.</v>

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not a coincidence that they do it all the time.</v>

00:51:38.961 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is psychological.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we're going to do that.</v>

2108
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:55.700

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:00.643
<v Speaker 1>We do it right out here.</v>

2113
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.420
<v Speaker 1>You could even do shows at pool halls,</v>

2114
00:53:02.421 --> 00:53:03.201
<v Speaker 1>like I've been to pool halls.</v>

2115
00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Were there stages too loud?</v>

2116
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.331
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

2117
00:53:05.331 --> 00:53:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Like how many shows do a comedy show and then play pool?</v>

2118
00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2119
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.550
<v Speaker 1>because then you're doing a comedy show to a pool hall.</v>

2120
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Like don't you want to do a comedy show at a comedy club?</v>

2121
00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Like that's where you want to do comedy.</v>

2122
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do comedy at a pool hall with a bunch of people watching</v>

2123
00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:20.690
<v Speaker 1>various games at the bar and talking shit mad that they missed the eight.</v>

2124
00:53:20.691 --> 00:53:21.524
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2125
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:22.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2126
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.660

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:26.820
<v Speaker 1>middle of your set and then have to deal with that.</v>

2128
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:27.683
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

2129
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:27.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2130
00:53:27.961 --> 00:53:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I think like this place,</v>

2131
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 1>like where it's nice and quiet private,</v>

2132
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:31.404
<v Speaker 1>that's where you want to do it.</v>

2133
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to do without a pool.</v>

2134
00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>

2135
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.593
<v Speaker 1>You let me know.</v>

2136
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Rd Langley's Jen can play better than you're saying.</v>

2137
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 1>So he played good.</v>

2138
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I could tell.</v>

2139
00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ping Pong.</v>

2140
00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Ping Pong.</v>

2141
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2142
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno how to play that.</v>

2143
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It looks the same thing as pulls his hand eye coordination before,</v>

2144
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.000
<v Speaker 1>but you have to practice it.</v>

2145
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2146
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:48.780
<v Speaker 1>you'll be fine.</v>

2147
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I see what you practice here.</v>

2148
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 1>But I could see how much you love gambling.</v>

2149
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 1>When we started playing for money,</v>

2150
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I can tell the little fire and that's when I bring it on.</v>

2151
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2152
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I though life since an excitement.</v>

2153
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:03.900
<v Speaker 1>But the double your net worth on a Virginia Tech game on a Tuesday and you watch</v>

2154
00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:04.920
<v Speaker 1>the fireworks fly.</v>

2155
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:05.873
<v Speaker 1>Have you done that?</v>

2156
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2157
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.110

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2197
00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:18.601
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2198
00:55:18.601 --> 00:55:19.081
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2199
00:55:19.081 --> 00:55:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause the night I ended up down,</v>

2200
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.690
<v Speaker 1>well if you're betting that Haim and if you go bad,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it hooks you and then boom before you know it,</v>

2206
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:34.501
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

2207
00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:38.520
<v Speaker 1>It's just that is just playing that chemical brush game of like knowing you</v>

2208
00:55:38.521 --> 00:55:43.521
<v Speaker 1>could lose a hundred grand and not question the physical rush without question</v>

2209
00:55:43.621 --> 00:55:45.240
<v Speaker 1>is so does it get,</v>

2210
00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:46.620
<v Speaker 1>does it like pull you,</v>

2211
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 1>do you like you feel like if you haven't bet in a while and you feel like you</v>

2212

2213
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 1>is it like to start and know enough from me?</v>

2214
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like that.</v>

2215
00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:55.800
<v Speaker 1>But when I go somewhere and something reminds me of it,</v>

2216
00:55:55.801 --> 00:55:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I can put one down and then that could start like a binge going.</v>

2217
00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I never sit at home craving.</v>

2218
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I got a better sampling.</v>

2219
00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 1>So let's say she's aligned in the paper and I think saying to me what I'm</v>

2220
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:09.270
<v Speaker 1>getting out of Artie Lange cause cause I love you.</v>

2221
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.550
<v Speaker 1>You say you're a talented guy that loves pleasure,</v>

2222
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.273
<v Speaker 1>pleasure.</v>

2223
00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I like something.</v>

2224
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I feeling something.</v>

2225
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2226
00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:17.960
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

2227
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.310
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be pleasure and his gambling thing,</v>

2228
00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you got to,</v>

2229
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.170
<v Speaker 1>that's like cotton deco deep down to the nerves,</v>

2230
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 1>first</v>

2231
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.211
<v Speaker 2>thing in the world.</v>

2232
00:56:25.211 --> 00:56:27.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just like me and him,</v>

2233
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 2>me and uh,</v>

2234
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 2>me and Norm Mcdonald,</v>

2235
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:30.820
<v Speaker 2>he's do this thing called lightening bet,</v>

2236
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:33.100
<v Speaker 2>which is literally heroin for gamblers.</v>

2237
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:33.951
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2238
00:56:33.951 --> 00:56:36.110
<v Speaker 2>you know the under over is no,</v>

2239
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 2>you ever hear that?</v>

2240
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.270
<v Speaker 2>What is like,</v>

2241
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.421
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2242
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:37.781
<v Speaker 2>I know what the,</v>

2243
00:56:37.781 --> 00:56:39.130
<v Speaker 2>anybody here know what the under overs.</v>

2244
00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:40.863
<v Speaker 2>Like I say a,</v>

2245
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:45.930
<v Speaker 2>you've been a basketball game and the under over for the basketball game as 180</v>

2246
00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:46.661
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

2247
00:56:46.661 --> 00:56:51.661
<v Speaker 2>which that means is the total amount of points that each team scores has to come</v>

2248
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:56.500
<v Speaker 2>out a total over 180 then you win.</v>

2249
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:02.190
<v Speaker 2>If the total number that they score is below one 80 you lose hence over under,</v>

2250
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:07.840
<v Speaker 2>so a lightening bet is you assign a number,</v>

2251
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:12.640
<v Speaker 2>an amount of money to each point that the bet goes over or under.</v>

2252
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Which means if you lightening bet $1,000 on an over at one 80 once you hit the</v>

2253
00:57:20.141 --> 00:57:20.974
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

2254
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I get the chills saying,</v>

2255
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:29.070
<v Speaker 2>once you hit the over every single basket that gets hit in the game,</v>

2256
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.980
<v Speaker 2>you win $1,000 every from both teams,</v>

2257
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.090
<v Speaker 2>both teams.</v>

2258
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:39.830
<v Speaker 2>A basket from the field is to grant a 3.3 grams every single bed housing.</v>

2259
00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 2>So like the shakes you start to get while you're watching her literally like</v>

2260
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.270
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2261
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:50.110
<v Speaker 2>they're visible.</v>

2262
00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you know,</v>

2263
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.750
<v Speaker 2>you're having a connection,</v>

2264
00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:53.781
<v Speaker 2>have drinks.</v>

2265
00:57:53.781 --> 00:57:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe coax calm down and every time a shot goes up it's like Eh.</v>

2266
00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:04.850
<v Speaker 2>And to me it's the purest form of degenerate gambling I've ever seen,</v>

2267
00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:05.953
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>

2268
00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.390
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even aware that existed.</v>

2269
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.811
<v Speaker 2>Norman,</v>

2270
00:58:08.811 --> 00:58:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I was on the road once was six months I was opening for him.</v>

2271
00:58:10.971 --> 00:58:13.160
<v Speaker 2>We was the one of the basketball players.</v>

2272
00:58:13.161 --> 00:58:15.380
<v Speaker 2>We had a bout 40 g's on every game.</v>

2273
00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.593
<v Speaker 2>What's it gonna hot,</v>

2274
00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.340
<v Speaker 2>what's it normally when we just talked about the head,</v>

2275
00:58:19.341 --> 00:58:22.160
<v Speaker 2>that famous story where he threw the money in the ocean cause he knew he was</v>

2276
00:58:22.161 --> 00:58:23.210
<v Speaker 2>going to lose.</v>

2277
00:58:23.211 --> 00:58:26.660
<v Speaker 2>It was that norm either side of the throw it out because she thought it would</v>

2278
00:58:26.661 --> 00:58:31.661
<v Speaker 2>just make them lose more but might have very well been urban legend oil.</v>

2279
00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 2>You're a lot of this could be urban legend or no,</v>

2280
00:58:33.611 --> 00:58:33.821
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2281
00:58:33.821 --> 00:58:34.431
<v Speaker 2>not from you.</v>

2282
00:58:34.431 --> 00:58:35.264
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying from,</v>

2283
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hear it from norm.</v>

2284
00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I agree that that could be a no and I agree that could be urban legend.</v>

2285
00:58:40.521 --> 00:58:41.354
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2286
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Well everyone knows he's just a wild maniac.</v>

2287
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:45.920
<v Speaker 2>He's the one of the funniest,</v>

2288
00:58:45.921 --> 00:58:47.450
<v Speaker 2>smartest human beings I've ever met.</v>

2289
00:58:47.451 --> 00:58:48.530
<v Speaker 2>But he's got a true edge.</v>

2290
00:58:48.531 --> 00:58:49.520
<v Speaker 2>And a true danger.</v>

2291
00:58:49.521 --> 00:58:51.020
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens.</v>

2292
00:58:51.021 --> 00:58:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>

2293
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.060
<v Speaker 2>He's a rock star man.</v>

2294
00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.140
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2295
00:58:54.141 --> 00:58:54.860
<v Speaker 2>The Rock Star.</v>

2296
00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:55.970
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

2297
00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:56.990
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

2298
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And he's also like,</v>

2299
00:58:58.761 --> 00:58:59.594
<v Speaker 2>that's really him.</v>

2300
00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:01.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not putting on an act.</v>

2301
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:03.101
<v Speaker 2>You know when,</v>

2302
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:03.171
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2303
00:59:03.171 --> 00:59:05.630
<v Speaker 2>he hosted the espys in 2001,</v>

2304
00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Oj Simpson was just forced to give his Heisman trophy back to Fred Goldman</v>

2305
00:59:10.791 --> 00:59:12.560
<v Speaker 2>because Oj lost the civil suit.</v>

2306
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:16.280
<v Speaker 2>So he had to give money reparations back to Fred Goldman and Nicole.</v>

2307
00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:17.391
<v Speaker 2>So he didn't have any money,</v>

2308
00:59:17.391 --> 00:59:20.000
<v Speaker 2>so he should take my Heisman trophy for whatever that's worth.</v>

2309
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.670
<v Speaker 2>So Fred Golbin takes it and now he owns it.</v>

2310
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 2>So the next week or the SBS inform a host,</v>

2311
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 2>the Assamese Charles Woodson,</v>

2312
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:28.730
<v Speaker 2>the guy who won the Heisman trophy,</v>

2313
00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 2>the first offensive guy ever sitting in the front row.</v>

2314
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.091
<v Speaker 2>First joke,</v>

2315
00:59:32.091 --> 00:59:32.781
<v Speaker 2>norm tells,</v>

2316
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:34.130
<v Speaker 2>he looks in the front row and he says,</v>

2317
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:34.731
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2318
00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Charles Woodson,</v>

2319
00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.700
<v Speaker 2>the man you won the Heisman trophy.</v>

2320
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:39.290
<v Speaker 2>No one can ever take that away from you.</v>

2321
00:59:39.291 --> 00:59:42.290
<v Speaker 2>First Defensive Guy to win the Heisman trophy.</v>

2322
00:59:42.291 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 2>No one can ever take that away from it.</v>

2323
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.780
<v Speaker 2>And everybody applause.</v>

2324
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:48.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like a real nice thing and it settles down on the normal clothes.</v>

2325
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:52.010
<v Speaker 2>No one can ever take that Heisman trophy away and then he pauses and said,</v>

2326
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:54.470
<v Speaker 2>unless of course you kill your wife in a waiter.</v>

2327
00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.120

01:00:04.511 --> 01:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>It's norm fucking Mcdonald.</v>

2339
01:00:13.381 --> 01:00:14.214
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not that.</v>

2340
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>It makes me love him even more.</v>

2341
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Norm and I talked,</v>

2342
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:21.080
<v Speaker 1>we sat next to each other randomly on an airplane,</v>

2343
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>talked the whole way back,</v>

2344
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>just shot the shit,</v>

2345
01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>talk about all kinds of stuff.</v>

2346
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:25.071
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2347
01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:25.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2348
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I quit smoking while ago.</v>

2349
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Just done with it and for whatever reason the plane lands and he goes,</v>

2350
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:31.131
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2351
01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I just want a cigarette.</v>

2352
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>He just walks in this day that he hadn't smoked in like x amount of months,</v>

2353
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:38.630
<v Speaker 1>but just decided to talking about it on the airplane,</v>

2354
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>how he quit smoking,</v>

2355
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>that he just wanted another cigarette,</v>

2356
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>grabbed it,</v>

2357
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>went outside and he's just smoking it.</v>

2358
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:45.141
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2359
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:45.974
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

2360
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:46.281
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2361
01:00:46.281 --> 01:00:47.031
<v Speaker 1>I thought you quit smoking.</v>

2362
01:00:47.031 --> 01:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2363
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.043
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2364
01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I did until just now.</v>

2365
01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2366
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted a cigarette.</v>

2367
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.641
<v Speaker 2>The movie,</v>

2368
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>me and him die.</v>

2369
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I did a buddy comedy with him and it got bad reviews.</v>

2370
01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:58.310
<v Speaker 2>So the reviewer of my hometown paper said,</v>

2371
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Artie Lange has all the charm of a date,</v>

2372
01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:01.184
<v Speaker 2>rapists,</v>

2373
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:02.203
<v Speaker 2>true line.</v>

2374
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.400
<v Speaker 2>So norm looks at it and he calls me up and he goes,</v>

2375
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:05.541
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2376
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:07.100
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking great.</v>

2377
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:11.900
<v Speaker 2>A date rape is tasked to have way more charm than a regular rapist.</v>

2378
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.433
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2379
01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:19.813
<v Speaker 1>oh</v>

2380
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>God bless.</v>

2381
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>That made me feel better.</v>

2382
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Norm is the coolest motherfucker on the planet.</v>

2383
01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I love him and he's funny and I hope you know he doesn't die broke.</v>

2384
01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:29.281
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2385
01:01:29.281 --> 01:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2386
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>he's just a real special dude and he's a very unusual guy.</v>

2387
01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I got to get them on this podcast.</v>

2388
01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:35.094
<v Speaker 1>I just never seen him.</v>

2389
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>You'd have a blessed,</v>

2390
01:01:36.991 --> 01:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

2391
01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>when I was on a plane with him,</v>

2392
01:01:38.491 --> 01:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even have cell phone back then.</v>

2393
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I got an answering machine.</v>

2394
01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:42.901
<v Speaker 1>They can give me there,</v>

2395
01:01:42.901 --> 01:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2396
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>call him back when I want to.</v>

2397
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2398
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>that's how it should be.</v>

2399
01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:46.351
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

2400
01:01:46.351 --> 01:01:47.184
<v Speaker 1>Who Care?</v>

2401
01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>They can call you back if they want.</v>

2402
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:50.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is how it should be,</v>

2404
01:01:52.021 --> 01:01:52.641
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2405
01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Unless someone needs to get ahold of you right now and then,</v>

2406
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.980

2413
01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather not know for a while.</v>

2414
01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>You had genuine disdain for me in your eyes when I told you that I didn't watch</v>

2415
01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

2416
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I really saw it in your eyes.</v>

2417
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:10.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2418

01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>cause I thought you did what?</v>

2420
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.470
<v Speaker 1>You were disappointed when you play sports.</v>

2421
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2422
01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I just martial arts.</v>

2423
01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2424
01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Actual Sport,</v>

2425
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2426
01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:17.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2427
01:02:17.641 --> 01:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

2428
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean to use the I played sport.</v>

2429
01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>When me and you first met at mad TV a long time ago,</v>

2431
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I thought you told me that he played second base or you play baseball?</v>

2432
01:02:27.391 --> 01:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I did before I started martial arts,</v>

2433
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>but that was one.</v>

2434
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like 15 I have to stay and I'm like,</v>

2435
01:02:32.701 --> 01:02:32.911
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2436
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to put on when you and I had a conversation about boxing</v>

2437
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>because you played my boxing manager.</v>

2438
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I imagine is actually a very good sketch.</v>

2439
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It's shot in black and white,</v>

2440
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:44.550

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.840
<v Speaker 1>we'd always have to pitch puns and I would pitch them as a,</v>

2497
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:15.930
<v Speaker 1>as a joke,</v>

2498
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:17.310
<v Speaker 1>not thinking they never do it.</v>

2499
01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes they would do it.</v>

2500
01:04:18.481 --> 01:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2501

2511
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:32.663
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2512
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.163

01:04:40.411 --> 01:04:41.460
<v Speaker 1>just make it easier.</v>

2518
01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see yourself doing a sketch show again or was it just too much?</v>

2519
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young Man's game.</v>

2520
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:46.463
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2521
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I look back at those sketches are merit to be and I'm like,</v>

2522
01:04:48.811 --> 01:04:49.410
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2523
01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:50.490
<v Speaker 1>how did I do that?</v>

2524
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Did you like doing that sports show?</v>

2525
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like this show with you and nick was mostly sports comedy as well.</v>

2526
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Nick and I had a lot of fun.</v>

2527
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>We got to talking about sports be funny and everything and of course the</v>

2528
01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>corporate people tried to make it something it wasn't,</v>

2529
01:05:04.261 --> 01:05:07.920
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to a more conservative show and I can't blame him,</v>

2530
01:05:07.921 --> 01:05:10.650
<v Speaker 1>but you know that you don't hire me to do sports center.</v>

2531
01:05:10.651 --> 01:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

2532
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.140
<v Speaker 1>why did they hire you to do a conservative show?</v>

2533
01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>That's probably one of the long line of bad business decisions that they've guys</v>

2534
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>weren't that outrageous.</v>

2535
01:05:19.121 --> 01:05:21.420
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't so off the charts,</v>

2536
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:22.301
<v Speaker 1>we weren't,</v>

2537
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:22.991

2541
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:29.194

<v Speaker 1>I've been there for two weeks.</v>

2586
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Not longer than two weeks.</v>

2587
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.633
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't do it.</v>

2588
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:41.440
<v Speaker 1>It's better than a cash man.</v>

2589
01:06:41.441 --> 01:06:46.441
<v Speaker 1>That's how I'm seeing you and Jay gambling in Vegas and someone putting you up</v>

2605
01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:08.560
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't work at Vegas.</v>

2606
01:07:08.561 --> 01:07:09.394
<v Speaker 1>He works on the road.</v>

2607
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:10.263
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2608

01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:14.410
<v Speaker 1>lives but does technically live in Vegas.</v>

2610
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 1>He lives like just outside of Vegas,</v>

2611
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:17.361
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2612
01:07:17.361 --> 01:07:18.550
<v Speaker 1>And one of those suburban towns.</v>

2613
01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2614
01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.410
<v Speaker 1>But he doesn't perform in Vegas at all.</v>

2615
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.753
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2616
01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:22.220

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:24.250
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2620
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.050
<v Speaker 1>That's not what kids live there,</v>

2621
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.410
<v Speaker 1>so he doesn't want to perform near where his kids live at.</v>

2622
01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Brian Reagan,</v>

2623
01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.940
<v Speaker 1>one of the best comedians ever was just in there.</v>

2624
01:07:30.941 --> 01:07:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a pleasure to meet you,</v>

2625
01:07:31.811 --> 01:07:32.644
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

2626
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you'd never met him before.</v>

2627
01:07:34.331 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>That's never met Brian.</v>

2628
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:38.170
<v Speaker 1>He is one of my absolute fucking heroes.</v>

2629
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2630
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:39.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2631
01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:39.870
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

2632
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.810
<v Speaker 1>A real clean and good and original.</v>

2633
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Unreal.</v>

2634
01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2635
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:44.651
<v Speaker 1>He reminds me,</v>

2636
01:07:44.651 --> 01:07:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Gaffigan in that sense where they're completely squeaky clean,</v>

2637
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.820
<v Speaker 1>but undeniably two of the best comics in the world.</v>

2638
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:52.781
<v Speaker 1>Like it,</v>

2639
01:07:52.781 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Gaffigan doesn't lose anything for being squeaky clean.</v>

2640
01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.460
<v Speaker 1>His comedy is just,</v>

2641
01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

2642
01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.860
<v Speaker 1>he just smashes it every time.</v>

2643
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't have to be dirty.</v>

2644
01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:01.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2645
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>They're the same types of guys.</v>

2646
01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:03.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2647
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:03.790
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2648
01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:04.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what they do.</v>

2649
01:08:04.841 --> 01:08:05.021
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2650
01:08:05.021 --> 01:08:08.260
<v Speaker 1>That's why the beauty of comedy and with a lot of these guys,</v>

2651
01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:08.621
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2652
01:08:08.621 --> 01:08:09.161
<v Speaker 1>it just like,</v>

2653
01:08:09.161 --> 01:08:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you have to find out who the fuck they are and what,</v>

2654
01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.290
<v Speaker 1>what did Mitch Hedberg perfect example that guy like that.</v>

2655
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not like a model.</v>

2656
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't like say like,</v>

2657
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>oh a Hedberg type before he existed,</v>

2658
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't like nail that down.</v>

2659
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>The closest you would get like maybe Steven Wright kind of,</v>

2660
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>

2661
01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>My Bergh had his own thing.</v>

2662
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2663
01:08:26.650 --> 01:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch to look around,</v>

2664
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.843
<v Speaker 1>see what happened,</v>

2665
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:30.690

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2668
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was uh,</v>

2669
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:34.840
<v Speaker 1>it was that much of an accident with him,</v>

2670
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

2671
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.051
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2672
01:08:36.051 --> 01:08:36.884
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

2673
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.881
<v Speaker 1>Well after he,</v>

2674
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:38.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2675
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>he'd had one health scare from,</v>

2676
01:08:41.331 --> 01:08:41.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2677
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>from the heroin and then wipe proves couldn't gang green or something crazy from</v>

2678
01:08:46.011 --> 01:08:47.010
<v Speaker 1>shooting at the Samsung.</v>

2679
01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:47.601
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

2680
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 1>You could smell it to get on a plane.</v>

2681
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

2685
01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I've never smelled it.</v>

2686
01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine not good.</v>

2687
01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Like any sort of,</v>

2688
01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:00.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It gotta be like a dead mouse under the couch or something like that.</v>

2691
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.260

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

<v Speaker 1>was it pills?</v>

2745
01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:05.781
<v Speaker 1>Because I was,</v>

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.833
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

2750
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:11.300
<v Speaker 1>One leads to the other,</v>

2751

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2752
01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:12.441
<v Speaker 1>You might be right,</v>

2753
01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:12.880
<v Speaker 1>but I had heard of,</v>

2754

01:10:14.571 --> 01:10:16.370

2758
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.510
<v Speaker 1>you're taking opiates,</v>

2759
01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.790
<v Speaker 1>you're basically getting the same stuff.</v>

2760
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2761
01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:20.241
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2762
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:21.200
<v Speaker 1>it's hillbilly heroin.</v>

2763
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:22.070
<v Speaker 1>That's why they call it that.</v>

2764
01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.960
<v Speaker 1>The scary part of it is the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2766

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:26.950
<v Speaker 1>They put it in the flux where your liver,</v>

2768
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.010
<v Speaker 1>not everything does that.</v>

2769
01:10:28.011 --> 01:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Tylenol has it.</v>

2770
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Percocet has it.</v>

2771
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:31.371
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2772
01:10:31.371 --> 01:10:31.750

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2774
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.820
<v Speaker 1>stuff like Xanax and stuff don't have it for some reason.</v>

2775
01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea why.</v>

2776
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>But your liver goes away quicker if you take Percocet or something.</v>

2777
01:10:39.071 --> 01:10:39.904

2836
01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:17.641
<v Speaker 1>back on.</v>

2837
01:12:17.641 --> 01:12:17.971
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2838
01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I could never have done in my career what I did early on if I was on no way.</v>

2839
01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:23.761
<v Speaker 1>Didn't make sense.</v>

2840
01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:24.594
<v Speaker 1>You can't function.</v>

2841
01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2842
01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2843
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.653
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2844
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.760
<v Speaker 1>So when you see like this,</v>

2845
01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:30.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2846
01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.880
<v Speaker 1>this how many people get prescribed it today,</v>

2847
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.580
<v Speaker 1>and you know how much of a pullet has on people when you see me now,</v>

2848
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:39.100
<v Speaker 1>they prescribing it to people all the time when people have injuries.</v>

2849
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And let me up until the rubber bands on the injury,</v>

2850
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.500
<v Speaker 1>if you really broke your back,</v>

2851
01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:44.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2852
01:12:44.161 --> 01:12:45.270
<v Speaker 1>and your loved ones there yet,</v>

2853
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.510
<v Speaker 1>they don't want you to sit in there with a broken back if they really need it,</v>

2854
01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:49.141
<v Speaker 1>they really need it.</v>

2855
01:12:49.141 --> 01:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you got to go to a great doctor who knows how to Wean you off it,</v>

2856
01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:53.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2857
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Because if they don't do it,</v>

2858
01:12:54.841 --> 01:12:58.550
<v Speaker 1>you'll be in withdrawals when you get out and then you're physically addicted to</v>

2859
01:12:58.551 --> 01:12:58.770
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2860
01:12:58.770 --> 01:12:59.371
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

2867
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but they can't get it out of your brain.</v>

2868
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:07.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>My friend Brendan Chavs fights in the UFC and he,</v>

2872
01:13:14.401 --> 01:13:14.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2873
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.990
<v Speaker 1>was on the podcast recently talking about how he got his nose reconstructed,</v>

2874
01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.080
<v Speaker 1>broke his nose in a fight,</v>

2875
01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.990
<v Speaker 1>couldn't fight for awhile and got hooked on pain pills.</v>

2876
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like they prescribed to him.</v>

2877
01:13:23.611 --> 01:13:26.010
<v Speaker 1>He started taking them and he's taken before he knew what he was taking six a</v>

2878
01:13:26.011 --> 01:13:28.620
<v Speaker 1>day and he's taking them every day and after the reconstruction is done,</v>

2879
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:29.760
<v Speaker 1>he just can't stop taking them.</v>

2880
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:30.893
<v Speaker 1>It was from months.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got to mix it with the pills.</v>

2894
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:53.160

<v Speaker 1>thing ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3101
01:19:32.861 --> 01:19:34.840
<v Speaker 1>that's how people did it back in the old days.</v>

01:19:47.290 --> 01:19:47.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3109
01:19:47.531 --> 01:19:50.650
<v Speaker 1>They used to have those events where people would huddle over the radio and</v>

3110
01:19:50.651 --> 01:19:51.880
<v Speaker 1>listened to sporting events.</v>

3111
01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that with baseball.</v>

3112
01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:58.390
<v Speaker 1>They used to hover over the right field fence with their legs waiting her charge</v>

<v Speaker 1>sit in front of his fucking couch,</v>

3200
01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.800
<v Speaker 1>The guy becomes an action star deep into his fifties,</v>

3201
01:22:13.801 --> 01:22:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden he's kicking everybody's ass.</v>

3208
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Like all these taken movies.</v>

3209
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I have a very special set of skills.</v>

3210
01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Know where was all that before this,</v>

3211
01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:27.210

<v Speaker 1>a reasonable man in movies.</v>

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500
<v Speaker 1>It took about obnoxious people,</v>

3215
01:22:31.501 --> 01:22:32.221
<v Speaker 1>Rob Schneider.</v>

3216
01:22:32.221 --> 01:22:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So Rob Schneider was going to do a movie with Steven Seagal.</v>

3217
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.170
<v Speaker 1>He told this story on stern and he goes into the sick calls,</v>

3218
01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:41.550
<v Speaker 1>a dressing room.</v>

3219
01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:46.350
<v Speaker 1>So God comes out of the back and he says to Rob Schneider,</v>

3220
01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I just read the greatest script ever written and rob some.</v>

3224
01:22:56.641 --> 01:22:57.474
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3225
01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.033
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

3226
01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.980
<v Speaker 1>You never know who you're gonna run into.</v>

3227
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Those guys exist.</v>

3240
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:24.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of boards in the world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

3242
01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.313
<v Speaker 1>How do you stop that?</v>

3243
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:27.850
<v Speaker 1>How do we prevent that rd.</v>

3244

<v Speaker 1>You try to hang out with the right click of people,</v>

3245
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3246
01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And if someone gives you shit,</v>

01:23:32.891 --> 01:23:35.260
<v Speaker 1>My therapist told me in the late seventies,</v>

3249
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:40.120
<v Speaker 1>which is of course your verbal bullets are nothing against my arm or of shelf</v>
