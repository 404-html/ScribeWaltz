00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I saw Ghostbusters,</v>

4
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it and I like,</v>

5
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>which I feel awful about.</v>

6
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>There's some funny shit and Ghostbusters,</v>

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.210
<v Speaker 1>like overall it's not a good movie.</v>

8
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>This is not a good movie.</v>

9
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>But they did some funny shit.</v>

10
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

11
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 1>they came up with some fun and I almost want to know like,</v>

12
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.213
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

13
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>what could this have been if you let whoever came up with all that funny shit</v>

14
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.470
<v Speaker 1>just make,</v>

15
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>make a movie out of it where they scenes where they died with the dialogue</v>

16
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>scenes in dialogue.</v>

17
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 1>There were scenes and it was such a combination of things.</v>

18
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>That movie and it's so had the feeling of the hands of the producers and the</v>

19
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:39.610
<v Speaker 1>executives.</v>

20
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.780
<v Speaker 1>It's so handled that</v>

21
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

22
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.670
<v Speaker 2>you in some ways,</v>

23
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 2>the thing I liked about Deadpool was I was watching it going,</v>

24
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 2>the producers of this movie did a good job where they were like,</v>

25
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 2>this moment doesn't work.</v>

26
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Make it work everyday.</v>

27
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Like micromanage.</v>

28
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Like I worked on Chris rock movie top five,</v>

29
00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 2>a little bit like for a couple of,</v>

30
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I just consulted for a couple of weeks and the producers is guy named Scott</v>

31
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Rudin who's like a famous producer.</v>

32
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:08.441
<v Speaker 2>And what I couldn't believe was the level of detail that guy was worried about.</v>

33
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.171
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

34
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 2>he busted Chris's balls for a year about the script,</v>

35
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 2>literally made them rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and</v>

36
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 2>then onset.</v>

37
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 2>The guy was worried about shirts and buttons and that's what I realized like,</v>

38
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.441
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

39
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>these dead producers.</v>

40
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it feels like maybe on Ghostbusters that got,</v>

41
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 2>you got to get,</v>

42
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 2>you have to get lucky too with studio where they,</v>

43
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.481
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

44
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you all haven't agreed to set of,</v>

45
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 2>of what's good and then you build the movie.</v>

46
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>We from there was also this a problem that the movie had a very clear agenda to</v>

47
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>be a pro woman move.</v>

48
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Which it's gets mean.</v>

50
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with being pro woman,</v>

51
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>but if that's what,</v>

52
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

53
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.601
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

54
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a goofy,</v>

56
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not a theme for a movie,</v>

57
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 2>a comedy movie.</v>

58
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 2>It feels</v>

59
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>are buffoons.</v>

60
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>They're not just buffoons there.</v>

61
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>They're cartoonishly retarded.</v>

62
00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Like Chris,</v>

64
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck name's Thor is so retarded.</v>

65
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

66
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

68
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>he's so fucking stupid.</v>

69
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.461
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

70
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>But they keep them around because he's beautiful.</v>

71
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like the joke,</v>

72
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>well that's a funny,</v>

73
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>but I like it.</v>

74
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 2>These revenge jokes where it's like,</v>

75
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:17.350
<v Speaker 2>so you're just going to do what men did.</v>

76
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 2>How long is this going to last?</v>

77
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the next year?</v>

78
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Which is the easy for a man to say like,</v>

79
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

80
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 2>do something else honey.</v>

81
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

82
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 2>but it just feels like there's gotta be like a next,</v>

83
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

84
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:27.611
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>

85
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

86
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of like rep retribution right now.</v>

87
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.480
<v Speaker 2>What Twitter is,</v>

88
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 2>just wasn't believable.</v>

89
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:33.831
<v Speaker 2>A lot of what Twitter is,</v>

90
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:36.400
<v Speaker 2>how it's a lot of people.</v>

91
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like digital lynch mobs of people and that are rightly so.</v>

92
00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:43.210
<v Speaker 2>They'll go after people for saying something fucked up about race.</v>

93
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Like they went up to Justin Timberlake a few weeks ago cause he said something</v>

94
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 2>more all the same.</v>

95
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.971
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>

96
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:53.971
<v Speaker 2>but you can't say that and it just becomes this mob of people and it's purely</v>

97
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 2>about racial revenge</v>

98
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned.</v>

99
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.751
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

100
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:02.640
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely about people having the opportunity to shit on</v>

101
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.690
<v Speaker 2>and having people that didn't have the opportunity to before and now they have</v>

102
00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:07.670
<v Speaker 2>it via they,</v>

103
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like they have social cachet and they have social power and they use it for</v>

104
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.180
<v Speaker 2>the same bullshit of white people use it for,</v>

105
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.901
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

106
00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:17.700
<v Speaker 2>it's not even just black people doing it.</v>

107
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of white people are on women at any,</v>

108
00:03:19.651 --> 00:03:20.070
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

109
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

110
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.290
<v Speaker 2>any sort of marginalized group,</v>

111
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.980
<v Speaker 2>whether it's poor,</v>

112
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.360
<v Speaker 2>any like literally any group,</v>

113
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.030
<v Speaker 1>this movie like this is,</v>

114
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of problems with the movie,</v>

115
00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:30.774
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

116
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

117
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

118
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.800
<v Speaker 1>the fact that all the men in the movie were ridiculous.</v>

119
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.430
<v Speaker 1>All the men this movie were buffoons all the men in the movie.</v>

120
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Like they like Bill Murray gets fucking killed in it.</v>

121
00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:42.594
<v Speaker 1>Spoiler alert.</v>

122
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's weird.</v>

124
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.741
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

125
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:47.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

126
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

127
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>it's an agenda driven movie more than they'd wrote something.</v>

128
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:51.201
<v Speaker 1>They figured,</v>

129
00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:51.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

130
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

131
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.210
<v Speaker 1>it'll work if you do this or if it'll work if you do that.</v>

132
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't even have romantic interests in the movie because men were just</v>

133
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>so retarded.</v>

134
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Like the women didn't have boyfriends,</v>

135
00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:05.130
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have husbands.</v>

136
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:07.560
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have like they had Chris Hemsworth.</v>

137
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.760
<v Speaker 1>But that's it.</v>

139
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And he was just eye candy.</v>

140
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>the thing</v>

142
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 2>tell people is when you're writing about a specific gen,</v>

143
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>like for a long time,</v>

144
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>women in comedy,</v>

145
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.700
<v Speaker 2>women in comedy movies were a props or they were like,</v>

146
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Andie MacDowell always used to be like the love interest and in Dallas,</v>

147
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

148
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 2>and she was always just like this warm sort of like vaguely disapproving.</v>

149
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 2>It's either like you're disapproving of the guy or you're approving to a fault</v>

150
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.221
<v Speaker 2>because that's,</v>

151
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:36.701
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

152
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 2>if there's a movie about a certain,</v>

153
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.691
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>

155
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:40.981
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

156
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 2>it was usually men,</v>

157
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 2>the women in their lives for the plot to advance,</v>

158
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 2>they'd even have to be for the plot or against the plot.</v>

159
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

160
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 2>So then women started complaining like,</v>

161
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

162
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 2>you see us as these binary goofy things and obviously women in life are more</v>

163
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 2>complex than that.</v>

164
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 2>So to now that women are starting to get their own movies and it's about groups</v>

165
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:00.904
<v Speaker 2>of women,</v>

166
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 2>you see it,</v>

167
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a writing problem.</v>

168
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.331
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

169
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:09.331
<v Speaker 2>you're in a trap where the men and bridesmaids were goofy as fuck.</v>

170
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 2>It was an Irish cop in Milwaukee.</v>

171
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Tell me more.</v>

172
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Cause I've never seen that my fucking whole life.</v>

173
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 2>A guy who's just like,</v>

174
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 2>and bridesmaids is a fucking masterpiece for the most part.</v>

175
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.591
<v Speaker 2>Just that part.</v>

176
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:21.101
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of like,</v>

177
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:21.281
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

178
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 2>so he's a cop and he's got an endless,</v>

179
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

180
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>appetite for wig even though she's not interested in,</v>

181
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:29.880
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

182
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 2>and was Dicky to him.</v>

183
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:31.541
<v Speaker 2>But he's still,</v>

184
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:32.291
<v Speaker 2>he'll take her back,</v>

185
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.000
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

186
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

187
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes about,</v>

188
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>he's basically the only man in the movie and it's kind of a goofy part and it's,</v>

189
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.901
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

190
00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:43.901
<v Speaker 2>it's because it's about a group of women and that's just the purpose that men</v>

191
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 2>have in that plot.</v>

192
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.181
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

193
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

194
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 2>but they always date people take it as like this a sexism thing.</v>

195
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>And I just take it as like a screenwriting thing.</v>

196
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.761
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

197
00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 1>it is that definitely,</v>

198
00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>but one of the problems that people have found when they're talking this movie</v>

199
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>is that you can't criticize it because if you criticize it,</v>

200
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:01.754
<v Speaker 1>you're sexist.</v>

201
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.141
<v Speaker 1>And no,</v>

203
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

204
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good piece of art.</v>

205
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not really well done.</v>

207
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>But there's moments who did,</v>

208
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>who did bridesmaids that I'm talking about?</v>

209
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>The same guy,</v>

210
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>same guy who did it,</v>

211
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>he's dead.</v>

212
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

213
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:14.931
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

214
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:15.741
<v Speaker 1>He's done it twice now.</v>

215
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

216
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I think he knows he's a really good writer.</v>

217
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Like he knows you can you,</v>

218
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to write because it's never been,</v>

219
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:23.911
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

220
00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:24.591
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people,</v>

221
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:24.771
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

222
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I go show me a good example of a,</v>

223
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>a movie about a group of guys where the woman isn't just even in Deadpool,</v>

224
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 1>she's a prop to the,</v>

225
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but they made fun of it or she's in love with him unconditionally,</v>

226
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>even though his face turns into a monster and she still wants him to eat a pussy</v>

227
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>and they make fun of it.</v>

228
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>They make fun of it in a funny way.</v>

230
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Like their meetup there meet cute and then they think about how Gammage they</v>

231
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:48.961
<v Speaker 1>both are.</v>

232
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>That was like perfect to me cause it was brief and it uh,</v>

233
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like the thing they always complain about when you're developing movies,</v>

234
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.710
<v Speaker 1>like I don't buy this couple.</v>

235
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like yeah,</v>

236
00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking movie.</v>

237
00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

238
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

239
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Just not,</v>

240
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy a lot of real couples.</v>

241
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.241
<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>

242
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>they have to spell it all out in two hours.</v>

243
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 1>And they have to meet and fall in love with in five minutes.</v>

245
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a lot more to relationships in that.</v>

246
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:09.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:09.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 1>We can't show you all that other shit.</v>

249
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Cause that takes hours,</v>

251
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>days and weeks and months and you fuck,</v>

252
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.243
<v Speaker 1>that is correct.</v>

253
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>The sad thing about the movie,</v>

254
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>the Ghostbusters movie is there's some stuff in it that was really clever.</v>

255
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>There was funny stuff and I,</v>

256
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning I was enjoying it and I was like,</v>

257
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:26.121
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

258
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I bet people are not given this thing a fair shake.</v>

259
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>And then as it got on and I was like,</v>

260
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.641
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

261
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

262
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 1>this is just so clunky.</v>

263
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.040
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of it that were just so clumsy and just poorly,</v>

264
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>poorly got to see it because every single one of those women are fucking home</v>

265
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.004
<v Speaker 1>run hitters.</v>

266
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

267
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Melissa McCarthy is fucking funny,</v>

268
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

269
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.551
<v Speaker 1>The Dude,</v>

272
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

273
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 1>she was in bridesmaids.</v>

275
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

276
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what she's the Auburn haired woman.</v>

277
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

279
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

280
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>she's handicapped in it.</v>

281
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>They'd give her some clunky lines.</v>

282
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

283
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.693
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

284
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

285
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.650

286
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Kate Mckinnon is really,</v>

287
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:11.001
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

288
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:12.000
<v Speaker 1>she was really fun in it.</v>

289
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>She was very funny in it.</v>

290
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad.</v>

291
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

292
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.001
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hate it.</v>

293
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I went to see what my kids,</v>

294
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.093
<v Speaker 1>they enjoyed it.</v>

295
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

296
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

297
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.330
<v Speaker 1>there were some moments I laughed pretty hard.</v>

298
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

299
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>But most of it not.</v>

300
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

301
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to make funny movies,</v>

302
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

303
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.121
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

304
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like at the end,</v>

305
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:30.980
<v Speaker 1>they way they wrap it up,</v>

306
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

307
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>oh Christ,</v>

308
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't the fuck outta here.</v>

309
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:35.361
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

310
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>it's so clumsy.</v>

311
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

312
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it's just so awkward.</v>

313
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>If somebody told me there were no stakes in the movie,</v>

314
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.691
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>

315
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:41.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

316
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:43.280
<v Speaker 1>there's ghosts and we're going to find them.</v>

317
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.643
<v Speaker 1>We got them.</v>

318
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

319
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

320
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.523
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>

321
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 1>It's hot fucking mean.</v>

322
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

323
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:52.941
<v Speaker 1>Good movies.</v>

324
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:53.774
<v Speaker 1>Really hard.</v>

325
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

326
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Budget movie.</v>

327
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>A big budget with a legacy and a start and a end.</v>

328
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:00.474
<v Speaker 1>A release date.</v>

329
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:00.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

330
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:01.630
<v Speaker 1>And if they just see,</v>

331
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>if there was no Ghostbusters before it,</v>

332
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>there'd never been a ghostbuster movie.</v>

333
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>And this was the first ever ghostbuster movie.</v>

334
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>There would not,</v>

335
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be talking about price busters.</v>

336
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.493
<v Speaker 1>It would be different.</v>

337
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

339
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>it may be people would enjoy it more and maybe they wouldn't be so handicapped</v>

340
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>because they had to sort of connect with the legacy and tie all these loose ends</v>

341
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.763
<v Speaker 1>in and they can,</v>

342
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 1>they kind of do it any way,</v>

343
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.733
<v Speaker 1>any way they want.</v>

344
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
