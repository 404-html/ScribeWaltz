<v Speaker 1>this artificial world that we've created</v>

9
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>of hyperspace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have like a hyper space</v>

10
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:32.691
<v Speaker 1>cloud drive of humanity that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be just as fucking crowded as earth and</v>

11
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have enough hard drive space</v>

12
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 1>and the fucking cloud and these assholes</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep copying themselves cause they want</v>

13
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:43.050

00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>cloud serve reflect 200 trillion</v>
<v Speaker 1>terabytes and it would just be filled</v>

15
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>with copies of themselves and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just send out fucking like fake</v>

23
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 2>your cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your car has your brain in all your,</v>

24
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 2>your past and all your memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your cars talking to you and it's</v>

<v Speaker 2>due.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're my bro.</v>

26
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if they figure out a way to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just download your consciousness but</v>

27
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>take parts out you don't need.</v>

30
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>compliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We figured out a way to isolate the ego.</v>

31
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.970
<v Speaker 1>We're going to remove it and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put this brain in cars so he get in</v>

32
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>your car and you're talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have your own ego.</v>

33
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 1>We go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to have a say or where we drive.</v>

35
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that shit coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your car like your car has to be</v>

36
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>completely compliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

37
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>That's how I drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

38
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't take advice from my fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm driving bitch relaxed.</v>

39
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>But if you could download your</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

40
00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:00.310
<v Speaker 1>your own conscious in your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your car would be literally an extension</v>

41
00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the car thinks it's you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the card knows that you and it or one.</v>

45
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.840

<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

46
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 1>But his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his legs place in life is to be your</v>

47
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:14.610

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can start downloading you and</v>

49
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 2>everything so you could download you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toilet microwave.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bill burr and put all the bill birth</v>
<v Speaker 2>files out into the Internet.</v>

56
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.080

<v Speaker 2>don't want to a bunch of bill burrs</v>

62
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have to control the numbers.</v>

63
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>You know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that many of any of us,</v>

64
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.690
<v Speaker 1>imagine if there's 100 million Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 1>vernors you would go listen dude enough,</v>

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's possible to download</v>

67
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.760
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is possible to copy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's possible to copy it,</v>

68
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spam it.</v>

69
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>In that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your history is really kind of fucked up</v>

70
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>and weird when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you approach it with them through a</v>

71
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>moral lens because you see so many nasty</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing steck place and in the weird ones</v>

72
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>are the ones where there really is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>good solution where you don't know what</v>

73
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>the healthy thing would be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one that I was researching flora</v>

74
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>and he's three on fire maybe a year from</v>
<v Speaker 1>now or something.</v>

75
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I was he searching the story from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1980 [inaudible] in El Salvador.</v>

76
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.230
<v Speaker 1>At that time there was a right wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>government in El Salvador.</v>

77
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.280
<v Speaker 1>De was government was supporting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a leftist Galleria.</v>

78
00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>There was in the logic of the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are only two options.</v>

79
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>You're read pro communist story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our [inaudible].</v>

80
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.460
<v Speaker 1>So in the process of fighting is left is</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonorrhea.</v>

82
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>The government of El Salvador is doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty sayings,</v>

83
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody will criticize them,</v>

84
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter whether they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>communist or not.</v>

85
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Get tortured to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chop off their bodies.</v>

86
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave them in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

87
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.620
<v Speaker 1>American Congress at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I go,</v>

88
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it can't really keep sending</v>

89
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys were doing horrible human</v>

90
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>rights violations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they passed these low that in order</v>

91
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>for any more aid to be sent to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor of El Salvador,</v>

92
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>the president of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sign off on a document stating that</v>

93
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>these guys have made huge improvements</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their human rights record,</v>

94
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>that they're on the right path.</v>

95
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>You know it's getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is the deadline is coming up</v>

96
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.700
<v Speaker 1>that Reagan is each into be able to send</v>
<v Speaker 1>out all these millions of dollars to do</v>

97
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the government of El Salvador.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the moment a Salvadorian army</v>

98
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>cous on these offensive against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galleria.</v>

99
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>They find some villages that chest</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be left the fuck alone.</v>

100
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 1>They were not pro communist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are not anticommunist either.</v>

101
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>They were like bunch of Evangelical</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity peasants who just wanted to</v>

102
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>farm their fields and be left alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

103
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>they would lead the communist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through,</v>

104
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>they will add the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through a figure.</v>

105
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>If we stay neutral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything works out right.</v>

106
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 1>While not in the core door and the Cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>War,</v>

107
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 1>there is no neutrality are either on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>side or the other.</v>

108
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>So Salvadorian army come in and grab</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single villagers,</v>

<v Speaker 1>kill everybody in that village and New</v>

111
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times did an article on it</v>

112
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.520
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

113
00:05:19.521 --> 00:05:20.680

<v Speaker 1>crazy communists.</v>

116
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>None of these is through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a smear campaign against our</v>

117
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 1>allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government of El Salvador has made</v>

118
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>huge improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sending the millions of dollars of</v>

119
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years down the road or south of the</v>

120
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>original story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was through that the staff did that</v>

121
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:41.120
<v Speaker 1>pen and but other than bitching about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan,</v>

122
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>this is not even an anti Reagan thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a messy situation because you</v>

123
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:47.460
<v Speaker 1>do support the government of El</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvador.</v>

124
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>He are literally supporting death</v>
<v Speaker 1>squads,</v>

125
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>child rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't really get any worse</v>

126
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't support them.</v>

127
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a chance that so hard when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>recruiter turn into a communist state,</v>

128
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:04.080
<v Speaker 1>in which case he's not exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>communism around the world as a high</v>

129
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>reputation for human rights.</v>

130
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

131
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you choose?</v>

132
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you choose to support them or do you</v>

133
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>choose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how do you see where I'm</v>

134
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a situation where no matter</v>

135
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>what you choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

136
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
<v Speaker 1>You're doing bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But clearly the moment you're supporting</v>

137
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>that squads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cannot be the right solution.</v>

138
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

139
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 1>what is the right solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is there good thing you should do?</v>

140
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>You know Carter at the same exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper,</v>

141
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>you know right before Reagan Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guide yard,</v>

142
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>she'd be shipped off El Salvador.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

143
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Oscar Romero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Te maillet there,</v>

144
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>saints top fucking sandy money to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>government because they are doing</v>

145
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 1>horrible syncs with it cart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

146
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to look at this because</v>

147
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:51.641
<v Speaker 1>this is politically traveling for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two weeks later that's squats walking</v>

148
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>into the main church in El Salvador.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was celebrating mass.</v>

149
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>They gunned him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill them.</v>

150
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a Republican or democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

151
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>you know it's like both sides of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

152
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>They are did not know how to handle this</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a situation where it's like which</v>

153
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>mass murders do we support and which</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones do we oppose?</v>

154
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's the reality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like there are the stories or</v>

155
00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:14.560
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

156
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.210
<v Speaker 3>the fuck do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

157
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine and probably last a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass time too long time.</v>

158
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a long day at the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was probably a couple solid hours of</v>

159
00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.780
<v Speaker 3>visions then right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With that kind of dose.</v>

160
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On and off.</v>

161
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 3>There were some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

162
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.240
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept seeing initially I kept seeing a</v>

163
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.360
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a group of people like Kinda</v>

164
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.250

<v Speaker 3>I was thinking like,</v>

165

<v Speaker 3>Like are they going to try to steal or</v>

166

<v Speaker 3>Like this doesn't,</v>

167
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.030
<v Speaker 3>this is weird and this is a place not a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people go to.</v>

168
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.850
<v Speaker 3>And I kept seeing that and then I had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a deep breath,</v>

169
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.360
<v Speaker 3>like Tosca,</v>

<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

178
00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:03.304
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she's just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I put my head back down and I kept</v>

185
00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:15.220
<v Speaker 3>seeing it done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this young kid kind of comes</v>

186
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.800
<v Speaker 3>through the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's going to challenge me and he</v>

187
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:18.670
<v Speaker 3>walks down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

188
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to defend us.</v>

189
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:22.570
<v Speaker 3>I've got to fight and I know how fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up I am.</v>

190
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe we have to defend</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

191
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's playing out in my mind all the ways</v>

192
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:28.750
<v Speaker 3>that I'm going to have to fight this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

193
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 3>And I realized right then like I stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>up open.</v>

194
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.081
<v Speaker 3>My was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

195
00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:33.310
<v Speaker 3>it's just a vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

196
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Heart's racing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

197
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:38.890
<v Speaker 3>why would I think that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized every fucking day of</v>

198
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 3>my life since I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I play that out.</v>

199
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Anytime someone gives me a dirty look or</v>
<v Speaker 3>says like we're from whatever being</v>

200
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.750
<v Speaker 3>picked on as a kid bully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can a shit.</v>

201
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Like I always play that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how am I going?</v>

202
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to have to fight this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to have to fucking defend?</v>

203
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 3>How's it gonna play out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

204
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a long fucking neck.</v>

205
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:00.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take us back and choke him</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

206
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.191
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

207
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just showed me how silly this</v>

208
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 3>dumb ass mind game that I would play and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go down the rabbit hole on a</v>

209
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 3>fucking daily basis sometimes.</v>

210
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just playing into this thought of</v>

211
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 3>negativity that had no space for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't mean no good to play that</v>

212
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:16.630
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

213
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 3>well that's fine cause then I'll do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

214
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.121
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

215
00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:19.441
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

216
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 3>none of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wasting time and becoming</v>

217
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 3>emotionally attached to those thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just,</v>

218
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about this.</v>

219
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling like I'm going to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

220
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 3>That fucks you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That turns you into not your best</v>

221
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 3>version of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that vision from mushrooms was just a</v>

222
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 3>fucking game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't stop me from having those</v>

223
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 3>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it allows me to catch myself.</v>

224
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware of it.</v>

225
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.250
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
