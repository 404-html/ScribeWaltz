1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches and I did my first marathon in 2002 so I've been doing</v>

2
00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:08.110
<v Speaker 1>this for whatever,</v>

3
00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>14 years.</v>

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.253
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 1>multiple marathons every year back to back.</v>

6
00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes my body is not 100%,</v>

7
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>so I can push,</v>

8
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I have a high high pain tolerance,</v>

9
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 1>but eventually,</v>

10
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>it adds up.</v>

12
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.830
<v Speaker 1>And so it's pain for me.</v>

13
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>

14
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.140
<v Speaker 2>who was a joint pain?</v>

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.831
<v Speaker 2>Knees,</v>

16
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:31.251
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

17
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Is it just the whole body?</v>

18
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It's waste down,</v>

19
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.563
<v Speaker 1>hips,</v>

20
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.703
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>

21
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>ankles,</v>

22
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

23
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 2>And how long does it take you to recover?</v>

24
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Like you were telling me that your legs were swollen twice the size of normal.</v>

25
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.124
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>

27
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Last year was way worse.</v>

28
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>This year I had,</v>

29
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I've put in a bunch of miles leading up.</v>

30
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I was running about a half a marathon a day.</v>

31
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>So my body was pretty fit and pretty used to it.</v>

32
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>So my recovery was much shorter.</v>

33
00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.124
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

34
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>and again</v>

35
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>people aren't going to understand this,</v>

36
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>but the next,</v>

37
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>the day after I ran 102 I ran 13 miles and that was just because when I run the</v>

38
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>big foot 200 I'm going to have to be able to come back after,</v>

39
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 1>multiple days of being hurt and banged up and that's the name of the game,</v>

41
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>to cover 200 miles and a couple of days like I want to,</v>

43
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be 100% so I thought well I can't,</v>

44
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I can't know what it feels like to run after I run a hundred miles unless one I</v>

45
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>run a hundred miles and two I run the day after.</v>

46
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>So you can't simulate that.</v>

47
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to simulate that.</v>

48
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>So you ran 13 miles a day after you run 102 miles,</v>

49
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that like?</v>

50
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>it'd be using the running term loosely.</v>

52
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>It was painful.</v>

53
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:52.884
<v Speaker 1>Slow.</v>

54
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I was hiking the up hills running would be like,</v>

55
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.143
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

56
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I probably looked like a 90 year old man trying to run it frickin hurt.</v>

57
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>And what are you legs?</v>

58
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Totally swollen.</v>

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.683
<v Speaker 1>We doing this?</v>

60
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.091
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

63
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>my ankles are all swollen and calves that don't really have an ankle it so same</v>

65
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>size from my foot up and yeah,</v>

66
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not good for me.</v>

67
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not in anybody who talks about doing hundreds,</v>

68
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>hundreds aren't good for probably anybody.</v>

69
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.763
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

70
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.981
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

71
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:26.814
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

72
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I know that what I do isn't in the best interest of my body,</v>

73
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the name of the game.</v>

74
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>So what I do do this cock,</v>

75
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Jamie pulled up the fucking definition is this,</v>

76
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:41.080
<v Speaker 2>an urban dictionary says a better definition,</v>

77
00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I think than the one you gave.</v>

78
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

79
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:43.174
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>

80
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Demasculated millennial liberal male who often speaks of white privilege and</v>

81
00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:51.640
<v Speaker 2>modern feminism blames white men for all of the world's problems.</v>

82
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.770
<v Speaker 2>The new definition or</v>

83
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.133
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

84
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 2>I like this though.</v>

85
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>There goes chat again with the telling everyone that he's a Vegan.</v>

86
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.403
<v Speaker 2>What a cook.</v>

87
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

88
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

89
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I liked that a lot.</v>

90
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.280
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

91
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.051
<v Speaker 2>look up cock,</v>

92
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>hold on here.</v>

93
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>But cock hold is different.</v>

94
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a different,</v>

95
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

96
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.110
<v Speaker 2>short for cuckservative what they fucking till word cock is most commonly used</v>

97
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:25.201
<v Speaker 2>on Twitter to describe anti white males while it was originally formed with the</v>

98
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 2>original meaning of cock cock hold.</v>

99
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 2>The use of the word cock does not necessarily denote a sexual connotation.</v>

100
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:32.591
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

101
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:33.424
<v Speaker 2>It's morphing.</v>

102
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>The language is evolving before our eyes.</v>

103
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Cox do not care about Islamic countries throwing gays off buildings or hanging</v>

104
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>them as much as the cake Baker,</v>

105
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 2>who is Christian and warrant served gay wedding customers.</v>

106
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.751
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

107
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:47.584
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

108
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.071
<v Speaker 2>Coxe.</v>

109
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Give a free pass to anyone who criticized them for fear of looking racist or</v>

110
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:52.481
<v Speaker 2>homophobic.</v>

111
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 2>We'll still have that lady in Germany is a cook.</v>

112
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 2>The word originated from white nationalists vocabulary,</v>

113
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's still widely used by all.</v>

114
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

115
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:01.174
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

116
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.681
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

117
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 2>but they took caught hold and turned it into this new thing go to.</v>

118
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 2>But what is the definition for Koc hole?</v>

119
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 3>So this has nothing to do with guys' wives getting bang by Chris does me.</v>

120
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>It's still real to me,</v>

121
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 2>dammit.</v>

122
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>It's also like an official definition that an old dictionary from old English,</v>

123
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh means a man whose wife was unfaithful cut cold,</v>

124
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.680
<v Speaker 2>which is yeah.</v>

125
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

126
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 2>to make a cuckold of so if you,</v>

127
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:28.361
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

128
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.194
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>

129
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 2>that's how Norton I think described it to me like a man.</v>

130
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:33.161
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

131
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>if your wife is out banging other dudes and you know about it but you don't say</v>

132
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:37.331
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

133
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 2>you become a cock hold.</v>

134
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 2>But there's also like cock hold porn where it's like I said the guys there while</v>

135
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 2>like sobbing in the corner while his wife gets grilled.</v>

136
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:49.564
<v Speaker 2>Fucked.</v>

137
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.983
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

138
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 2>The world is evolving.</v>

139
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.603
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

140
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.930
<v Speaker 3>So it's still open,</v>

141
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 3>open season then for use cook anyway you want,</v>

142
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.540
<v Speaker 3>because we were really just hit like five definitions.</v>

143
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I still have a fucking clue what I mean.</v>

144
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.500

146
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I liked that one definition though.</v>

147
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>The the,</v>

148
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.980
<v Speaker 2>the Vegan,</v>

149
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.240
<v Speaker 2>it's gets on the megaphone.</v>

150
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.970
<v Speaker 2>It's usually a Vegan who's been a Vegan for like a month to,</v>

151
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.690
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

152
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Those are my favorite fucking Cox</v>

153
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.421
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>

154
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:22.670
<v Speaker 2>How do you pull out of this and have a normal conversation?</v>

155
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Where are we?</v>

156
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Do</v>

157
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.591
<v Speaker 3>we go from here,</v>

158
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>

159
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 3>We always say you're either a hunter,</v>

160
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 3>you're like Brendon mentioned a berry picker,</v>

161
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's in our DNA if you're a hunter.</v>

162
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 3>And to be able to test that against the toughest conditions against the hardest</v>

163
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 3>animals to hunt in the most remote places is to me the ultimate test of being a</v>

164
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 3>human being and ultimate test of being a hunter.</v>

165
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's what drives me and what we do and why they train year round.</v>

166
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Why I'm always thinking about gear,</v>

167
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:48.791
<v Speaker 3>about food,</v>

168
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:49.331
<v Speaker 3>about Wade,</v>

169
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 3>about uh,</v>

170
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.891
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

171
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

172
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

173
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 3>how I could improve from what I learned on last year to this coming seasons.</v>

174
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

175
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 3>and preparation of it is a,</v>

176
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

177
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

178
00:05:59.061 --> 00:05:59.894
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

179
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I live it and breathe it and uh,</v>

180
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.941
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

181
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:02.774
<v Speaker 2>it's challenging.</v>

182
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 2>It's really challenging.</v>

183
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

184
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 2>it unfolded for me,</v>

185
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

186
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 2>and it still continues to do so cause I've only been doing it for four years.</v>

187
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:09.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

188
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Rinella got me involved and he took me out to Montana in 2012.</v>

189
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

190
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:15.801
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

192
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh hey,</v>

193
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of be interesting.</v>

194
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what this is all about,</v>

195
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 2>because I had watched shows and I read some stuff about it,</v>

196
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that he said,</v>

197
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:22.731
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

198
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:22.971
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

199
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a steep learning curve to this.</v>

200
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a steep lines and it goes long.</v>

201
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.441
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

202
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:27.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

203
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.311
<v Speaker 2>how long can it go?</v>

204
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:29.440
<v Speaker 2>He fucking find an anime,</v>

205
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 2>shoot it and kill it and eat.</v>

206
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 2>It would seem so hard.</v>

207
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 2>But then as you get into it,</v>

208
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.544
<v Speaker 2>you realize,</v>

209
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 2>and then of course bow hunting,</v>

210
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 2>which is the most difficult of the most difficult pursuit.</v>

211
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>And as you get into it,</v>

212
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>you realize like,</v>

213
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

214
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 2>this is like some crazy puzzle.</v>

215
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like some crazy challenge that you have to figure that also involves a way</v>

216
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 2>to procure your food.</v>

217
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

218
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 2>And it's a skill set you never quit learning on.</v>

219
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.933
<v Speaker 4>Every time you go,</v>

220
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.780
<v Speaker 4>I learned something new.</v>

221
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.351
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

222
00:06:55.351 --> 00:06:55.980
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

223
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.900
<v Speaker 4>there's a natural progression you go through.</v>

224
00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:00.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like you're just excited to be there.</v>

225
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.630
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

226
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.710
<v Speaker 4>And then your,</v>

227
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.573
<v Speaker 4>and then you,</v>

228
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.950
<v Speaker 4>you see it with people you've take out for the first time.</v>

229
00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:05.430
<v Speaker 4>They're just like,</v>

230
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.641
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

231
00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:07.020
<v Speaker 4>kind of what's what's going on here.</v>

232
00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:07.291
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

233
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:09.870
<v Speaker 4>and then then all of a sudden they get a little click and it's like,</v>

234
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.243
<v Speaker 4>I want to get one,</v>

235
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

236
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.960
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

237
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

238
00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:14.850
<v Speaker 4>that's usually a couple of years and then,</v>

239
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

240
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

241
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.080
<v Speaker 4>I want to get an,</v>

242
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get a nicer one than one I got last time and I want,</v>

243
00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:20.010
<v Speaker 4>you want to do something a little more challenging.</v>

244
00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:22.080
<v Speaker 4>And it just keeps progressing until like,</v>

245
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:23.423
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

246
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.450
<v Speaker 4>till you get,</v>

247
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

248
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.471
<v Speaker 4>wherever it ends.</v>

249
00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:25.791
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

250
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 4>it's you,</v>

251
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.930
<v Speaker 4>you're hunting the,</v>

252
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.250
<v Speaker 4>the toughest animals,</v>

253
00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:30.150
<v Speaker 4>the biggest animals,</v>

254
00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:33.280
<v Speaker 4>the oldest animals in the toughest conditions and being successful and,</v>

255
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.920
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of people won't get there,</v>

256
00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:35.400
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

257
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:35.880
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

258
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.050
<v Speaker 4>it's always a challenge.</v>

259
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.250
<v Speaker 4>It's something that never gets old.</v>

260
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:38.851
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

261
00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:39.061
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

262
00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:39.510
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

263
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

264
00:07:39.731 --> 00:07:41.880
<v Speaker 4>it was comparable to any athletic event.</v>

265
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Only you can do it for your whole life,</v>

266
00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:44.190
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

267
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

268
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.620
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of stuff you do athletic and then in growing up or whatever,</v>

269
00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:50.041
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

270
00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:51.090
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't really translate,</v>

271
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:51.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

272
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 4>a college wrestler that doesn't translate that well to write the rest of your</v>

273
00:07:55.381 --> 00:07:56.210
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

274
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.620
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

275
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.980
<v Speaker 4>You're that dude down there at the intermural wrestling like,</v>

276
00:07:59.010 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

277
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.360

00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:00.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

279
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.590
<v Speaker 4>hunting is one thing that is just throughout your entire life.</v>

280
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.730
<v Speaker 4>Depending on where you're at.</v>

281
00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:05.941
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

282
00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:06.270
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

283
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.480
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

284
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.450
<v Speaker 4>you can always continue to learn and pursue it.</v>

285
00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:09.931
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

286

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

288
00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:13.230
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a ton of time you can do a short on sometimes,</v>

289
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

290
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.970
<v Speaker 4>things are going well,</v>

291
00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:15.990
<v Speaker 4>you can do something that's,</v>

292
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:16.261
