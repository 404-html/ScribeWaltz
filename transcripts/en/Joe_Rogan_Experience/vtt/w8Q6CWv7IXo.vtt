1
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.450
Okay.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 1>Hey D,
everybody,</v>

3
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.390
<v 0>this episode of the podcast is brought to you by Squarespace.</v>

4
00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:11.770
Squarespace is the all in one platform that makes it fast and easy to create

5
00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:15.910
your own professional website.
And I mean really professional,
excellent,

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.940
outstanding website as if it was designed by like some wizard html expert.

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.870
Squarespace has beautiful designs for you to start with all style options,
uh,

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.040
that you need to create a unique website for you and your business.

9
00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:33.970
A simple drag and drop interface and the offer 24 seven support,

10
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:36.310
which I doubt you'll need.
It really works excellent.

11
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:39.910
If you can attach pictures to an email or to a word document.

12
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.280
And if you know your way around a computer,
drag and drop,

13
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.050
super easy to do and it works on everything.
It'll work on iPhones,
androids,

14
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:51.840
windows,
Linux,
really,
uh,
like I can't,
I can't say enough about Squarespace.

15
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.310
I have a ton of friends that use it and I'm actually starting up a blog that

16
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.650
I'll be using Squarespace to design the website.
So I'm going to build it myself.

17
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.400
Uh,
Squarespace also has a logo creator where you can create a clean,

18
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.950
simple logo designed for yourself in minutes.

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.210
And every design automatically includes a unique mobile experience.

20
00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:12.210
It matches the overall style of your websites,

21
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.400
or your content will look great on every device,
every time.

Squarespace.
A better web starts with your website.
That's how every copy ends.

27
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.900
I would suggest they remove that,
but they make me say it.
Don't make me,

28
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.450
but I don't want to be rude.
Tell them that their idea sucks,

29
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.220
but they're fucking website's awesome.
squarespace.com use the code where Joe.
Uh,

30
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.520
we've also been sponsored by legal zoom and legal zoom has an a plus from the

31
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:53.410
better business bureau.
You can't get any better than that.
I love it.

32
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.090
I love that a legal zoom is a service that allows you to do things that you

33
00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:00.790
would normally have to go to an attorney's office and make an appointment and

34
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:03.240
wait in line to all that nonsense and you know,

35
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.870
go out of your way to drive across town.

36
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.880
You can do a lot of shit in your home easily.
Things like form an LLC,

37
00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:14.530
form an s corporation,
trademark real estate documents.
Uh,

38
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:17.380
you can,
uh,
you can make a will,
a personalized will,

39
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.660
power of attorney and living trusts,
all that kind of shit.

40
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.070
You can do all of that through legal zoom.com and it's very easy to do.

41
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.970
Legal Zoom was developed by some of the best legal minds in the country

42
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.610
according to them.
You know,
I'm sure there's like a debate.

43
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.510
The other legal minds weren't involved like bullshit.
I'm the best anyway.

44
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.540
Excellent legal minds.
Like I said,
a plus from the better business bureau.
Uh,

45
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.940
we've used it.
Um,
Brian used it to form death squad.
Dot TV.
Uh,

46
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:46.930
we use it originally to form on it.com,
uh,
the LLC for on it.

47
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:49.330
So very easy to do.

49
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:56.980

What does it a gun?
The fuck does that mean?

50
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.900
Is it a time machine?
What are you saying?

51
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.730
Legal Zoom was developed by top attorneys to provide self help services at your

52
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:08.050
specific direction.
But they are not a legal firm.
They're not a law firm.

53
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.270
But what they can do is they can contact you,
uh,

54
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.080
put you in contact with a third party independent attorney.

55
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.270
So if you're in the middle of filling out the documents and you're like,

56
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.600
oh my God,
I've done this wrong,
I'm probably going to get sued or go to jail,

57
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.040
they'll hook you up.
Don't worry about it.
Easy,
easy peasy.
Again,

58
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.030
go to legalzoom.com enter the code word again,

60
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.060
Legal Zoom.
Can't recommend them enough.

61
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.510
And we're also brought to you last but not least by on at.com.

62
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:42.070
That is o and n I t what is on it?
The idea of on it,

63
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.580
even the,
the name on it,
the idea is that get on it,

64
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.440
get your shit together on it is what we call a human optimization website.

65
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.810
We sell the very best in strength and conditioning equipment.

66
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.560
Things like kettlebells,
steel maces,
steel clubs,

67
00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.010
things that provide what they call functional fitness,

68
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.160
functional strength and what does that mean?
Functional strength?

69
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:07.030
Functional fitness means like things that when you,
when you work out,

70
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.650
it could directly translate to real world applications like simple stuff like

71
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:15.130
moving a couch,
do a lot of kettle bells,
lift a lot of weights,

72
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.620
get your body strong and you'll be able to pick shit up and move it around

73
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:21.970
better.
It sounds so simple,
but that's a good thing to have.
It's a good,

74
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.870
it's a good quality to have to have a strong body.

75
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.270
It's essentially like if life was a race and you were at,

76
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:33.190
you were in a car and you could just do things to your race car to make it

77
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:37.270
stronger and faster and handle better.
Wouldn't you do that?
Of course.
Will,

78
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:41.710
your body essentially is your vehicle for getting through this life and you can

79
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:43.690
improve it,
you can improve it with nutrition,

80
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.170
you can improve it with supplementation and you can certainly improve it with

81
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.760
strength and conditioning exercises.

82
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.590
And we sell the very best shit when it comes to things like weight vests and

83
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.740
medicine balls.
And,
um,
we even have videos.
Uh,

84
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.410
I keep recommending it but I can't recommend it enough cause it's really

85
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.610
excellent.
The Keith Webber,
extreme Kettlebell Cardio series.

86
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.430
What's great about those is Keith's a stud,

87
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.580
he's in awesome shape and he does the exercise while you do them.

88
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:11.920
So you just follow along with him and you know,

89
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.830
when someone's in really good shape and you're doing it along with them,
you,

90
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:19.690
you know,
you want to work on hard,
it,
it makes you motivated.
So,
uh,

91
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.530
go there.
We actually will actually also having a 72 hour sale right now.

105
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:16.790

All the stuff that we have,

106
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.460
whether it's a Alpha brain or shroom tech,

107
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.380
everything is described in the greatest detail.
We can't,
along with the research,

108
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.920
all the research papers with reference pertaining to the individual ingredients

109
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:34.700
in any of the supplements.
And uh,

Sam Harris.
Is here.
Why fuck around.
Cue The music.

111
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:39.944
Jamie,

112
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.930
<v 2>the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

113
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.560
Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

114
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.940
My friend Sam Harris,

115
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.240
<v 0>author,
awesome dude martial artist,</v>

116
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.260
and a author of waking up a guy to spirituality without religion.
I told you,

117
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:04.030
I first found out about you from a,
my friend Joe Silva,
who's the matchmaker,
uh,

118
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.430
for the UFC who gave me your book.
He gave me a letter to a Christian nation,
uh,

119
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.440
many,
many years ago.

120
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.020
<v 3>Like when did,
when did you post that post?
Eight,
2006.
Six.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

121
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:16.420
He gave it to me like around then he's like,
I gotta read this.

122
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.450
<v 0>It's awesome.
And I did.
And,
uh,
look,
we're pals.
Cool.
Here we go.
Yeah,
that's great.</v>

123
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.830
And your new book,
Waking Up,
a guide to spirituality without religion.
Well,

124
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:27.170
that's impossible.
So your book is nonsense,

125
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.180
<v 3>right?
Cause I need God in your life.
I'm running into that.
Well,
no,</v>

126
00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:33.810
actually I'm running to the other side of that where spirituality makes no sense

127
00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:36.440
unless you believe in religion.
That's it.
But what,
what is,

128
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.080
there's no such thing as a spirit.
So,
uh,
you know,
why,
why would you,

129
00:07:40.081 --> 00:07:43.560
why would you want to endorse something called spirituality?
That's a kind of,
uh,

130
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.400
that's uh,
that's fair,
isn't it?
Like what is a spirit,
I mean,
don't,

131
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.270
don't you have to have faith in something too,

132
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.130
to sort of just the idea of a spirit if you're gonna if you're going to talk

133
00:07:56.131 --> 00:08:00.630
about spirituality or a spirit.
Like what are you really talking about?
Like,
yeah,

134
00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:04.170
well I'm definitely not talking about a spirit or a soul or anything that can

135
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.580
float off the brain at death.

136
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.110
And I think spirituality is one of these words that we just have to reclaim

137
00:08:10.111 --> 00:08:13.380
because there's really not an English equivalent for,

138
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.400
for this area of inquiry.
Is that if you want to take seriously the,
um,

139
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.920
what one question can I pull these off?
Cause I'm Jack.
Um,
cool.

140
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.970
You have one item,
like it's kind of distorted sound.
Oh really?
Yeah,
it could be.

141
00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:29.420
My brain could be the,
but it's a lot better with these office.

142
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:32.220
So maybe God talking to you here.
Uh,
you're,

143
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.390
you're blocking them out as fast as they've gotten these.
If God needs these,

144
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.040
we know he's losing,
his powers are limited.

145
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.550
I'll take these off too and we'll leave it up to Jamie to find out whether or

146
00:08:41.551 --> 00:08:46.510
not,
there we go.
Cool.
Um,
so I nearly as loud.
So,
uh,

147
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.431
yeah.
So,

148
00:08:47.431 --> 00:08:51.990
so this is a big hangup for atheists and secularists and skeptics that this,

149
00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:56.991
this idea that spirituality is a word that magic and superstition by FY debt by

150
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:02.460
definition and by its etymology,
cause it's,
it goes back to the,
the uh,

151
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.050
the Latin spirit to which comes from the Greek pneuma meaning breath and it says

152
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:10.830
idea that the spirit is,
is you're asserting some kind of dualism.

153
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.430
This and sort of the spirit that's internal to the body that is not produced by

154
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:18.750
the body,
that can leave the body at death.
And it's true that most people,

155
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:23.730
most of the time to have some quasi mystical,

156
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.490
spooky association with,
with the concept of spirituality.

157
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:29.580
And it's obviously linked up with all the stuff that people believe about

158
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:33.300
crystals and angels and all the other stuff that I don't want to be entangled

159
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:36.120
with.
But,
uh,
I just think they're there.

160
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.770
There's no word for,
if you're going to take seriously the,

161
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.990
the project of,
of becoming like Jesus,
whoever he was becoming,
someone who could,

162
00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:49.460
they could actually love his neighbor as himself or,
um,
uh,

163
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.590
becoming like the Buddha or,
or,
or just a exploring the,
the,

164
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.620
the furthest reaches of positive human experience through meditation or

165
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:01.020
psychedelics or some other methodology that,
that,

166
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.640
that really perturbs consciousness,
there's no word for that endeavor and to,

167
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:10.470
and to call it Poe positive psychology or happiness or wellbeing.

168
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.310
Most people think they know what you mean when you use words like happiness and

169
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:15.660
wellbeing and love.
And,

170
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.160
and yet they have no idea how rarefied things can get if you,

171
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.290
if you take the right drug,

172
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.120
if you spend three months in silence doing nothing but meditate,
um,

173
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.600
it's just they're there.
It's a,
there are many layers to this thing.

174
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:34.830
And so I've tried to reclaim the term spirituality and um,
some guy,

175
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.270
some guy I was talking to recently on a podcast,
uh,

176
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.880
drew an analogy to the word evil,

177
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.610
which is another word that people are uncomfortable with because once we,

178
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.740
once we understand things like psychopathy and,
and other ways in which the,

179
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.570
the human mind can malfunction,

180
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.870
it seems that there's no rational basis to be talking about evil.

181
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:53.730
But I think we need the word evil.
I think we need to,

182
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:57.330
I think we need to reclaim the word evil for a secular,

183
00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:01.530
rational conversation because we need a big word for,
for the,

184
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:05.970
the really the worst of human impulses and as well evil and good.

185
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.020
They don't seem to be dependent upon a religious belief.

186
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.760
I think evil is just what,

187
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.740
what affects a gang of people in a negative way or one individual,
you know,

188
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:19.680
poison a water supply.
Obviously that's an evil deed.

189
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:20.940
You're going to kill a bunch of people.

190
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:24.670
You're going to cause a bunch of pain that seems to make a,

191
00:11:24.671 --> 00:11:28.650
at least some sense without religion and as does good,
like good and evil.

192
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.330
But actually not for evil.

193
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:35.130
The confidence in the use of the term evil has definitely a road at among

194
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.580
secular scientists types because it just,

195
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.590
just picture at once you understand what we're calling evil at the level of the

196
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:44.460
brain.
A,
once you,

197
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.380
once you find a gene for a dopamine receptor that correlates with psychopathy,

198
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.950
um,
uh,
or it's uh,
or a deficit of,
of uh,

199
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.890
central receptor,
then you,
then you begin to say,
well this is,

200
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.110
this is all just we're talking about biology,
we're talking about bad luck.

201
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:06.820
We're talking about a illness.
And then what,
what,

202
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.650
what does evil name in that case,

203
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.900
<v 0>right?
Like what is it?</v>

204
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:15.901
Psychopathy or like if you do something like say if,

205
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.770
uh,
someone,
I mean,
let,
let's,

206
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:22.570
let's talk about Israel and cause I don't like say if you are in Gaza and a,

207
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:26.380
a bomb is hit your apartment building and killed your family and you've made it

208
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:30.940
your,
your goal to kill as many Jews before they take you out.
Is that,

209
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:35.800
is that psychopathy,
is that evil?
What is that kind of retribution?
Is that,

210
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.843
I mean,

211
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.050
<v 3>no,
no negative.
That's definitely a gray area.
Well,
I think with evil,</v>

212
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.730
we want to reserve it for

213
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.910
those situations in which unprovoked,
yeah,

214
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.340
there's no story the person can tell that would seem to justify this to a

215
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:54.310
rational person.
You can't think,
well,
if I were in that person's shoes,

216
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:57.490
I would be doing the same thing you think this is,

217
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520
this is a twisted kind of say to us and this person's taking pleasure in causing

218
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:07.610
suffering to other human beings,
uh,
unnecessarily.
Um,

219
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.040
in a way that I can't,
that doesn't resonate with me.
And,
and that's so that,

220
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.400
so the far end of the extremity where you have somebody who's,
you know,

221
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.740
whether you,
it's,
it's,
you know,
Hitler or,

222
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.530
or as a kind of a lower scale version of evil.

223
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:24.070
I think my favorite example of late has been,
um,

224
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.480
I actually one who I've,
I spoke about a fair amount on the topic of freewill,

225
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:33.190
which I think we'll get into is,
um,
Uday Hussein,
Saddam Hussein's Elvis son.

226
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.311
I mean,

227
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:38.311
this guy was just as pure a psychopath as you're ever going to find.

228
00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:43.330
This is someone who when he would see a wedding and progress in Baghdad,

229
00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:47.350
he and his thugs would descend and rape the bride and sometimes torture and kill

230
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:51.600
the bride and the theater to dogs.
Yeah,
I actually hadn't heard that yet.

231
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.110
This is just so when you hear that that's not the same thing as hearing that

232
00:13:56.111 --> 00:14:00.040
somebodies house got bombed and their family died and then they become committed

233
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:04.870
to harming their aggressor is where people like their aggressors.
Right.
So,

234
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.480
um,
but yeah,
so I anyway,
did it just to back up and that point,
the,
um,

235
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.790
I feel like I'm embarrassed frankly by the term spirituality too.

236
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:20.710
I think it's,
it's,
it's just not,
um,
it's not a great word given its history.

237
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:23.530
And yet the only similar words that,
that,

238
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.740
that do a similar job or even spooky or something like mysticism,
um,
which is,

239
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.160
uh,
just even more
esoteric a term,

240
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:36.120
but I use the word contemplative to,
to name,
uh,

241
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.180
and in any practice that would be designed to,
uh,

242
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.070
discover what consciousness is like independent of just thinking about it.
Um,

243
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.170
so I think we need a new word right?

244
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.370
We need a new word for the thing is new equipment.

245
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.910
New Words is also a dead end to,
I hate Neil.
It just seems,

246
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:55.100
I hate it when some author comes forward with his,

247
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.520
his warrior that no one's ever heard of and he's hoping to foist it on the rest

248
00:14:58.521 --> 00:15:02.810
of humanity is here's a new now and that you all have to choke on.

249
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.390
And it just also works when you,

250
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.250
whenever someone comes up with their own jargon like that,

251
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.340
it's usually a red flag as well.
And it's like,
what are you doing?

252
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:12.260
You need to sort of redefining the world.

253
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:14.840
I started to call like you coming up with your own jargon,
you know,

254
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:18.080
when people come up with their own terms for thin and they're numbered lists.

255
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.950
Yeah,
yeah.
Um,
but what is,

256
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.220
what is the purpose of this book or what is the,
the theme of this book,

257
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:29.570
If you know,
get past the word spirituality without religion being a good person,

258
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:32.460
without religion,
ethics,
morals.
Actually,
that was the,
the,

259
00:15:32.461 --> 00:15:34.850
the thesis of my last book or the book before last,

260
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:39.530
the moral landscape where I talk about how we can understand strong claims of

261
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:41.930
right and wrong and good and evil in the context of science.

262
00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:46.250
That you can have a strong conception of moral truth without believing that you

263
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:50.330
get your morality from God or from a holy book.
Um,

264
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.200
and so that's something I've,
I've argued for now.
This is a,

265
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.490
um,
this is really in my view,
a completion of the project.

266
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:01.310
I started with the end of faith where I,
you know,

267
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.570
I s I started by just noticing how divisive and unnecessary and,

268
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.490
and ultimately dangerous are,

269
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.760
are incompatible religious ideas are and how we need to have a secular

270
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.600
conversation about the problem there.
Um,
and then I went into,

271
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.310
so first I started talking about just how there's a,
there's a,

272
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.870
by definition a zero,

273
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:27.930
some conflict between science and religion because there's a zero,

274
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.860
some conflict between believing things for good reasons and believing things for

275
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:32.450
bad reasons.
Um,

276
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.510
and the people who are satisfied with bad reasons and willing to defend their

277
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:37.750
bad reasons with violence or with even with,
you know,

278
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.350
policy are hostile to the project of,
of,
of science.

279
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.350
Um,
but then once you,
so once you've criticized that problem and,
uh,

280
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.740
notice that these books can't possibly be infallible given all that we know

281
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:54.160
through science and notice that they can't possibly be infallible,

282
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.720
given that they're all mutually contradictory,
uh,

283
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.850
Christians and Muslims can't both be right.
Uh,

284
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:04.040
then you have to grapple with the fact that there's all these good things that

285
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.500
people think they're getting out of religion and they want to find some other

286
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:11.030
way to get those things.
And the first on the list is ethics and morality.
And so,

287
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.660
so the moral landscape was my argument that we can have a strong conception of

288
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:16.730
ethics without believing any bullshit.

289
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.230
And this is my effort to,
uh,

290
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.020
open up a conversation on the topic of spirituality,

291
00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:28.340
which is the center of spirituality for me is the phenomenon of self

292
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:29.030
transcendence.

293
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.110
Just the fact that it's possible to lose your sense of self lose your sense of

294
00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:36.530
being an ego,
lose your sense that you are,
you are a,
you know,

295
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:40.580
a rider on the horse of consciousness riding around inside your head.
Uh,
not,

296
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.930
not exactly identical to your physical body.
Most people don't feel that.

297
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:46.340
They simply are their bodies.

298
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:49.290
They feel like they have bodies and that their bodies are kind of vehicle that

299
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:52.320
they're riding around in and they feel like they're behind their,

300
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.190
their eyes in a way that they're not behind their knees.
You know,
their,

301
00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:58.230
their needs are down there and,
and their,

302
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:02.580
their knees and the rest of their body or their kind of property in in a strange

303
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.930
way.
And

304
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.520
most people most of the time feel that they're in their heads and that they're,

305
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.290
they're a subject and they're a thinker of thoughts and that there's a thinker

306
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.180
in addition to the thoughts themselves.

307
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:17.910
They don't feel that there's thoughts arising and consciousness,

308
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:22.590
but most people feel that they are the thinker that is offering these thoughts.

309
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:27.180
And this actually goes right to the issue of free will as well because the

310
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:30.360
feeling of having free will is the feeling is there.

311
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:33.090
There's the other side of the coin of the feeling of being a self,

312
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.600
being a thinker,
being an author of actions and intentions.

313
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:41.601
And so I'm arguing that it's possible to cut through that illusion and that

314
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.060
there are good reasons to believe that it's an illusion based on just the

315
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:48.230
underlying neurology and,
and what we know about,
uh,

316
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.590
causality and what we know about the brain.
Um,
but uh,

317
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.010
you can actually penetrate this illusion subjectively and that the spirituality

318
00:18:56.011 --> 00:19:01.011
is the act of cutting through it subjectively and no longer feeling that you're

319
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:04.800
an eco riding around inside of a bag of skin.
Uh,

320
00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:08.230
and that that one's life gets,
uh,

321
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.530
improves in many obvious ways once one is able to cut through that,

322
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.110
that illusion.
And so that's so,
but it's,

323
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:21.130
it's kind of a sustained argument for a disciplined introspection in the form of

324
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:26.910
meditation and other techniques in the context of science and a discussion of

325
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.620
the brain and,
and why the concept,

326
00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:33.780
the conventional notion of self doesn't make much sense given what we know about

327
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:34.530
the brand.

328
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.770
<v 0>It's a very complex situation as well,
isn't it?
When you talk about the,
the,</v>

329
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:40.380
the concept of self and that the person is a,

330
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:45.330
the consciousness is inside the body because it's also dependent upon how the

331
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:49.770
body feels like the body feels bad,
the consciousness is affected.

332
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.050
Either your thought process affected when you're sick,

333
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.350
your thought processes affected.
If you're at you,
you're stressed out.

334
00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:57.760
If you're angry,
if you're,
if you're not getting exercise,

335
00:19:57.761 --> 00:20:00.180
if you're not getting good nutrition,
if you're,
you know,
any,

336
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:04.980
any sense of non wellness in the body is reflected on the way that person

337
00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:08.100
thinks.
It makes it more difficult to think with clarity.

338
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.280
So it's not as simple as like we're riding in this thing,

339
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.210
but this thing also affects the way you,
you know,
you,

340
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:17.430
when you think of you who you are.

341
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.680
I mean I'm vastly different pre and post workout.
I'm a different person.
Yeah.

342
00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.830
You know,
I mean my thought if you presented me with the same situations,

343
00:20:25.831 --> 00:20:29.040
the same dilemmas and problems pre and post workout,

344
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.070
I'd probably have a pretty different reaction to them.

345
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.480
<v 3>Yeah.
And it's not even just all the variables aren't even within your own body,</v>

346
00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:39.210
your different in different relationships and different situations.

347
00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.940
You walk into a restaurant and you're,
you're,

348
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.130
you're talking to the hostess and the,
and just the,

349
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.710
the frame around that interaction,

350
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.900
your expectation that you're in a restaurant talking to someone who wants to

351
00:20:49.901 --> 00:20:53.230
seat you,
that changes your,
um,

352
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.160
just the way you approach human interaction.
And,

353
00:20:56.161 --> 00:21:00.460
and if you had a different frame it would be a,
and,
and things will be different.

354
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:05.080
And it's,
it's almost true to say that different selves are called forth in those

355
00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:07.000
different situations where you are,

356
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.870
you're just can't be the same self with certain people.
You just can't,

357
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:11.710
you can't even access it.

358
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:16.711
There are certain people who I am just effortlessly funny with because they are

359
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:20.200
such an easy laugh and I don't even know what it is.

360
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.660
It's just like there's something there.
There's,
they're so ready.

361
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:26.290
They're so poised to laugh and out for whatever reason.

362
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:31.490
Somehow the dynamics of our conversation are such that I am my funniest self

363
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.960
with that person without ever trying to be funny.
And I'm not,

364
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.710
I'm not aware of being on,
but I just keep falling into this thing and,
and,

365
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.690
and there are other people where,
you know,

366
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:42.700
I'm profoundly awkward with these people.
You know,

367
00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:44.590
if you get put me in front of someone who is,

368
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.430
whose awkwardness is just tuned up a few notches beyond mine,
you know,

369
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:52.750
I become the aspergers guy,
you know,
with him.
And,
and it's,
it's,
um,

370
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.960
uh,
and,
and it's,
it's a,
it's odd,
but you're,

371
00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:00.730
this is kind of a resonance that get set up and you,
it's,
it's based on,

372
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.910
you know,
conscious and unconscious mechanisms obviously,
that we have.

373
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.560
We have certain um,
uh,
you know,
variables that we,
we,

374
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:10.240
it's not to say you can't influence these things.

375
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:12.850
You can go into a situation with a conscious thought that you're going to

376
00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:16.840
somehow transform it and that will have whatever effect it has.
But um,

377
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.650
and the mind is,
is complicated.
It's very complicated and it's,

378
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.350
a lot of that is dependent.
Our own consciousness is dependent on,

379
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.290
upon interacting with other consciousness,

380
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.760
which is one of the reasons why solitary confinement is such a horrible torture

381
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:31.510
to people.

382
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.520
Like when you separate a person's mind indefinitely from any other mind,

383
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.500
from any other interactions,
it freaks people out.

384
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.010
I was reading about this actually,
just,
just uh,

385
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.020
you're going to endanger forgetting this because it's interesting you raised the

386
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:49.021
point of solitary confinement because the experience that has got me to write

387
00:22:49.151 --> 00:22:51.580
this book is very much like solitary confinement.

388
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.340
I went on meditation retreats in my,

389
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.940
mostly my twenties for weeks and months at a time.

390
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.230
And you really are just on many of these retreats just locked in a room,

391
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.780
meditating for 18 hours a day in silence.
You're not,

392
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.430
you're not making eye contact with anyone else.

393
00:23:06.431 --> 00:23:10.760
You're not talking to anyone else.
And to some degrees,
it's not a,

394
00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:13.630
it's obviously not like being in a prison,
but,
and you're,

395
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:15.700
you're there on your own,
on your own volition.

396
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.160
But this is many people's worst nightmare.

397
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:20.050
And it would have been at one point in my life.

398
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:22.210
It would have been my worst nightmare.
I went on a,
um,

399
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.580
it's actually where I start the book.
I went on a,
uh,

400
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.530
on outward bound when I was 16,

401
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.580
which has a wilderness program and in the mountains of Colorado.

402
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:34.510
And it was this 23 day course,

403
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.040
which culminated in,
in this ritual.
They called a solo where they put us,

404
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:44.090
they parked us all next,
uh,
on the,
on the outskirts of a mountain lake,
uh,

405
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.090
for three days and three nights.
And there was no food.

406
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:50.480
So we fasted and they were just told to just contemplate the universe.

407
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:52.610
And we were given no,
there were no books.
You know,
you,

408
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:54.260
all you can do is write in your journal.

409
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:59.480
And this was the first time in my life where I was actually in solitude.

410
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.010
I had,
this was the first time my life,

411
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.160
I had no one to talk to or nothing to read or nothing to distract myself with.

412
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:06.530
And I was in a tent.

413
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:11.180
I've got a tent and a sleeping bag and a blank journal and the most beautiful

414
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.840
landscape possible.
You know,

415
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.380
we're at almost 11,000 feet in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains,
Lillian.

416
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.450
So you just got,
you know,
the perfect stars every night.
And,
uh,
this,

417
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:26.240
this pristine mountain lake.
And I was as miserable as I've ever been in my life.

418
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.890
I'm a just crushed by,
by loneliness and boredom.
I mean,
just,
just that,

419
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:33.920
my mind was completely out of control and all I did,

420
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:38.660
my journal reads like they just,
the,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

421
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:43.760
the Unabomber manifesto is a far more balanced,
you know,
expression of,

422
00:24:43.761 --> 00:24:48.300
of,
of man subjectivity.
Then what I was up to at 16 on this,
uh,
uh,

423
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.900
solo and I was just making lists of the foods I wanted to eat when I,
you know,

424
00:24:52.901 --> 00:24:56.160
it was just,
I was just craving every,
it doesn't make it list.
It just,

425
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:57.463
it was insanity.

426
00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.420
And then when I came off of this after three days and learn that some of the

427
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:03.254
other people on,

428
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.940
on the course loved it and just felt completely transformed by having three days

429
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:12.680
of a,
with nothing to do,
I just,
I had no idea what to make of this.

430
00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.270
I just like,
how could they have possibly,

431
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.090
how could that have not been anything but a torture for these people.

432
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.370
And so then I went from,

433
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:24.390
I was 16 there and it still took me a few more years to see a kind of path

434
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:29.840
forward and become interested in these things.
But I eventually went on to spend,

435
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.040
uh,
you know,
almost two years on silent retreats in my twenties,

436
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.850
in,
in circumstances of isolation and,

437
00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:40.850
and sensory deprivation far worse than,

438
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.570
than that mean a mountain solo.
Uh,

439
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.740
cause I wasn't in an especially beautiful place.
And,
and,
um,
uh,

440
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:52.520
so it was a,
it really is,
it's your,
your life is such,

441
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.500
you're life is entirely dependent upon your mind.
Now,

442
00:25:57.501 --> 00:26:01.700
it's not to say that external circumstances don't matter,
but the,

443
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.410
I mean,
there are people who can be genuinely happy and at peace in,

444
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.530
in terrible circumstances,
objectively terrible circumstances.

445
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.010
And there are people who have everything who are miserable.
And,

446
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.770
and so the fact that,
that,
that,
that the,

447
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:19.190
the delta is that big and can be that uncoupled from external circumstances,

448
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.480
um,
shows you that it's really,
I mean,
you know,
you're,

449
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:28.481
you are almost entirely dependent on the character of your thoughts,

450
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:32.230
really.
I mean,
the,
the,
the,
the mechanism which I go into a,

451
00:26:32.231 --> 00:26:35.900
at great length in the book is that the difference is really the difference

452
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:40.050
between being lost in thought and recognizing thoughts for what they are.

453
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.280
Most people are thinking every moment of their lives and aren't aware of it.

454
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.061
Are they in there?

455
00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:48.180
They may have an abstract idea that they're thinking every moment of their
lives,

456
00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:50.940
but they're not aware of the,
just the,

457
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:55.570
the automaticity and the relentlessness of this conversation.
Uh,

458
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.480
they're having with themselves and

459
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.270
to be identified with the next thought that arises in consciousness is,
is to be,

460
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:04.960
it's mirror prisoner.
I mean you are the,

461
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.330
you are then identical to whatever subjective,
state,

462
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:14.220
emotional state,
uh,
you know,
mood state.
It dictates.
So if it's,

463
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:17.910
if it's a self critical thought or a fearful thought or a hateful thought,

464
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.630
that's the,
that is the character of your consciousness in that moment.

465
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:26.631
And until you can break that spell until you can see thoughts as thoughts just

466
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:30.900
arising and passing away in consciousness,
you,
you see no alternative.

467
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.460
There's just no basis for an alternative.

468
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:34.650
And then you're as miserable as your thoughts.
Demand

469
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:38.840
<v 0>was part of what was really fucking with you when you were 16 years old.</v>

470
00:27:38.841 --> 00:27:40.670
The fact that you were 16,
you know,

471
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.770
that's how old you were when you were up there on the mountain.
Yeah,
yeah.

472
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.520
Cause you have so few experiences to reference and the,

473
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:54.080
the time alone with your mind is more painful perhaps because you're developing

474
00:27:54.081 --> 00:27:56.720
and you're not,
you're not quite a man yet.
You're not an adult.

475
00:27:56.721 --> 00:27:59.840
You don't have personal sovereignty.
So you don't have like this,

476
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.230
I think like today if like you took me and said,
oh,

477
00:28:03.231 --> 00:28:06.440
you have to spend a few days alone,
uh,
up in the mountain,

478
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.210
I'm so filled with things that I have to do on a regular basis.

479
00:28:11.211 --> 00:28:14.690
I'm so filled with responsibilities with,
if I knew that I was going to do that,

480
00:28:14.691 --> 00:28:17.930
I probably would find some pretty deep enjoyment in it because I have so many

481
00:28:17.931 --> 00:28:21.590
life experiences to draw on.
So many thoughts in my mind.
That would probably be,

482
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.150
that would probably benefit from having that time to sit with nothing coming in,

483
00:28:26.151 --> 00:28:26.984
but nature.

484
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:27.871
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

485
00:28:27.871 --> 00:28:32.110
Well it's being 16 might've had a little to do with it because almost everyone

486
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.400
else on the course was maybe a decade older.
So they,
yeah,

487
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.030
and they had a better time.
But no,
I think it was,

488
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.960
I think there are 16 year olds who would've had a fine time and there are

489
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:47.280
definitely 20 year olds and 30 year olds and 40 year olds who would be miserable

490
00:28:47.281 --> 00:28:51.210
in that circumstance.
Cause I see them on,
on meditation retreats and,
and uh,

491
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.770
on my own retreats I've experienced,
you know,

492
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.020
deep feelings of loneliness and sadness.
And because it's,

493
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.680
it's hard to leave everyone you love for three months.
You know,

494
00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:05.340
it's like you go on what at whatever age,
you know,
25 is a,
I mean,

495
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:10.080
I guess I was 30 the last time I sat a exactly 30 last time I sat a three month

496
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:13.860
retreat.
Uh,
but he's just got you,
you're unplugging from your life.

497
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.670
You're saying goodbye to everyone,
you know,
you know,
if you,
for all,
you know,

498
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:19.260
someone's going to die while you're on retreat.

499
00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:24.120
And so there's this real discontinuity with every project and every aspiration

500
00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:27.690
and everything you have going on.
Um,
and,

501
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.200
and also most of the people in your life can't believe you're doing this.

502
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.290
It does not much support people.
Just,
it's just totally inscrutable.
Yeah.

503
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:39.720
That you would decide to do this and then you'll essentially lock yourself in a

504
00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:40.201
closet.

505
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:42.880
I mean you like essentially you lock yourself in a room as big as you know,

506
00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:47.881
these two tables and then you're just left with your thoughts.

507
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.990
And th the,
the problem is,
is that just thinking itself,

508
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:57.010
even thinking happy thoughts is stressful at when you,
when you actually,

509
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:58.570
when you really started paying attention to it,
that,

510
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:02.620
that just the sheer automaticity of it to just,
just to be,

511
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:07.180
just to not be able to stop the conversation and he just can't stop talking to

512
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:08.590
yourself for a second.

513
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.990
And that now you eventually you can eventually you become concentrated on,

514
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.740
in this case,
the practice I was doing as it was called Vipassana,

515
00:30:17.741 --> 00:30:19.750
which is mindfulness meditation.

516
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:24.070
And the practice there is just to become very keenly aware of,

517
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.880
uh,
you start with the breath as an object of meditation,
but the,

518
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.610
but once you get a little concentration,
you opened it up to everything.

519
00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:35.611
So sounds and sensations and even thoughts themselves become objects of

520
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:39.670
meditation where you're just noticing whatever arises in consciousness and,

521
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.660
but the difference between noticing the thought arise and pass away and being

522
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:47.320
lost in thought is,
is huge.
And this is the all important difference.

523
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.370
And it takes some real concentration to act,

524
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:56.170
to see a thought arise and pass away it because without the concentration,

525
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.070
all of a sudden the thoughts just you,
it just,

526
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.860
it just comes up from behind in a way and you are just,
you're just,

527
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.100
you feel identical in a strange way.

528
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.000
You feel identical to this sentence in your head.
You Do,

529
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.360
you feel there's a miss thoughts are just sentences and images.
And it's,

530
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.970
when you actually look at what a thought is,
it's,

531
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:17.500
it's very hard to see how you could,

532
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.320
how could ever define your subjectivity in the first place.

533
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:25.350
It's just like mere thoughts are no more substantial than the sound of my voice.

534
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.240
And you're just hearing the sound of my voice as a kind of appearance and

535
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:32.470
consciousness right now.
And it's not,
it's not defining you.
It's not,

536
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:33.610
you don't feel identical to it.

537
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:38.440
It doesn't have a real implication so much for how you feel.
Uh,
you're,

538
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.790
you're not,
uh,
it's just,

539
00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:47.290
it's easy to see or to in this case here that it is a,

540
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.890
an just an appearance in consciousness.
It comes and it goes,

541
00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:54.040
it starts and it stops and it's all sort of in plain view.

542
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.110
But with your own thoughts with the w w with your own voice,
it,

543
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.990
it sneaks up on you in a way that is,

544
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.210
and even to use the word you in this case is a little misleading because it,

545
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:05.601
but it,

546
00:32:05.601 --> 00:32:10.601
it colors consciousness and trims it down in such a way that it just feels like

547
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:14.680
you.
It doesn't,
it doesn't feel it does it,
it's,
it's you,
you feel,

548
00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.940
I mean the feeling of being a self,
the feeling that we call I,

549
00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:23.941
the feeling of being an ego in the head is what it feels like to be thinking

550
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.170
without knowing that you're thinking.
It's the,

551
00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:30.760
it's the feeling of this next thought.
Capturing consciousness.

552
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.200
So when you say that thoughts,
you are identical to thoughts.

553
00:32:34.201 --> 00:32:38.650
So if you're thinking something really fucked up like a,
I'm fat,
I'm a loser,

554
00:32:38.651 --> 00:32:39.920
I'm always going to be a loser.

555
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.330
<v 0>Like that is identical to who you are because you are sort of framing yourself</v>

556
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.050
in this thought that these thoughts that you're carrying around in your mind,

557
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:50.720
they are what's occupying your consciousness.

558
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.330
And that if those thoughts are in the forefront of your consciousness,

559
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.820
if they identify you,
you are,

560
00:32:55.821 --> 00:32:59.120
that you are those thoughts and you are identical to that idea.

561
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.021
<v 3>Yeah.
And their,</v>

562
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:03.500
and their driving behavior and they're driving emotion and they're driving each

563
00:33:03.501 --> 00:33:06.410
subsequent train of thought.
So it's,
it's,

564
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.050
it's determining the,
the,

565
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.150
the future expressions of your consciousness and your body as well.
So you're,

566
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:17.150
you're,
and again,
I'm not,
I'm not separating the mind from the body here.
I mean,

567
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:21.140
all of this is,
we could talk about this in terms of events in the brain as well,

568
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:24.740
but it's much easier to talk about it in terms of our first person experience

569
00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:29.210
has thoughts and moods and emotions,
et cetera.
But,
um,

570
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.990
you know,
for the,
for the purpose of this argument,
you know,

571
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:37.050
there's no doubt that the brain is,
is doing this.
It's just,
we're not,
you know,

572
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.730
that side of the story that as much less to say about that side of the story at

573
00:33:40.731 --> 00:33:43.790
the moment and it's not raining,
but you're,

574
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:45.870
you're whatever it is your personality,

575
00:33:45.871 --> 00:33:49.120
your consciousness here at your center is sort of what

576
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.930
<v 0>guides the brain one way or another.
Like it is possible to,</v>

577
00:33:52.931 --> 00:33:55.330
while in the middle of having these thoughts and say,
you know what,

578
00:33:55.331 --> 00:33:58.870
I'm not going to entertain these anymore and I'm going to think about something

579
00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:02.410
positive.
But it's very difficult.
Yeah.
Surprisingly difficult.

580
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.180
Even as someone like myself who spent a lot of times,
a lot of time meditating,

581
00:34:07.181 --> 00:34:10.030
especially a lot of time in isolation tanks,
I,

582
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:14.230
it's still difficult every now and then if something's bothering you to just get

583
00:34:14.231 --> 00:34:17.580
it out of your head.
Like,
especially for me.
Um,

584
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:22.270
one of my main issues is my work.
Um,
like,
uh,

585
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.430
like standup comedy for instance.

586
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:29.200
Like if I have a show and a I fuck a bit up,
if it goes wrong,

587
00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:32.350
like if I have two shows in a night and I fuck a bit up on the first show,

588
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.320
I'm okay.
If I could redo it on the second show,
we're good.

589
00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.920
But if I fuck it up on the second show,
God dammit.

590
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:42.670
Now I have to think about that thing all night and I'll try to let it go.

591
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.200
I'll try to get it out of my head.

592
00:34:44.201 --> 00:34:49.201
But I rationalize it by saying the only reason why I've gotten so good is

593
00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:53.020
because of this crazy obsession that I have with getting it correct.

594
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.000
And that when things go awry or when I go down a bad path,

595
00:34:58.001 --> 00:34:59.770
it doesn't quite pan out.

596
00:34:59.771 --> 00:35:03.640
And then I have to sort of restart the whole conversation on stage that that

597
00:35:03.641 --> 00:35:04.720
uncomfortable moment.

598
00:35:04.721 --> 00:35:09.370
And then the subsequent uncomfortable recollection of that moment is the very

599
00:35:09.371 --> 00:35:13.480
motivation that's led me to be a good stand up in the first place.

600
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.450
So I kind of rationalize it,
but fuck man,

601
00:35:16.451 --> 00:35:20.320
when I'm eating dinner after a show and I just flub one word that fucks up a

602
00:35:20.321 --> 00:35:22.870
joke,
I'll be in the middle eating pancakes going,
shit,

603
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.910
I can't get it out of my head.

604
00:35:24.911 --> 00:35:29.590
It doesn't matter if a wonderful wife and a beautiful family and great friends

605
00:35:29.591 --> 00:35:34.330
and a fantastic job and a one to of just a fee,
a dream life.

606
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.220
It doesn't matter.
I flubbed the word you fucking idiot know like why I'm cutting

607
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.240
<v 3>into my food.
Ah,
yeah.
Well that,
that's an interesting moment because,</v>

608
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.190
um,
so there's a moment before the thought has arisen,
right,

609
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:50.160
where you have not yet remembered the flub lines.

610
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:54.000
So you're just cutting into your dinner and then it's an,

611
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.660
it's an image or part image,
part sentence,
something.

612
00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:02.661
There's some expression of thought that arise in consciousness and you are,

613
00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.470
you do not,
you do not witness it arise.

614
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.630
It's not like it's a difference between seeing it,

615
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.340
watching a movie and being totally lost in the movie.

616
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:17.100
Forgetting that you're sitting in a room with a bunch of other people looking at

617
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:19.770
light on a wall.
You're just,
you're totally captured by the movie.

618
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.400
It's difference between that and actually just seeing the screen,

619
00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:27.070
the light on the wall,
hearing the sound of the projector,
seeing,
seeing the,

620
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.330
seeing the artifice and uh,

621
00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:34.230
it's possible to see thoughts just as essentially like a play of light on the

622
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:35.160
wall.
He just use,

623
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:40.230
you see it before it captures you and the difference is total and it is kind of

624
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:41.844
like,

625
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:47.660
it's almost like playing a video game where you can now not get killed in the

626
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:50.190
same spot over and over again.
It's like,

627
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:54.300
it's like not losing in the same boss fight over and over again.
Yet we,

628
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.470
we lose in that same fight a thousand times a day.

629
00:36:58.471 --> 00:37:01.740
But when you can actually see thoughts for what they are,

630
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:06.090
so the next time you flub a line and the next and the next time you recall it,

631
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.730
it's,
it's possible with,
and again,

632
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:11.070
it takes a certain degree of concentration to be able to do this,

633
00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:15.120
but concentration becomes kind of a native capacity,
a certain point.

634
00:37:15.121 --> 00:37:16.730
It's like Jujitsu or anything else.
I'm,

635
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.390
you have certain skills and you don't really lose them.
Um,

636
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:22.890
then you can just see it.

637
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:28.260
And it just comes and it goes and it doesn't have an end and it's going,

638
00:37:28.261 --> 00:37:30.090
it's going.
It's really gone.
It's,
it's,

639
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:32.490
and it doesn't have the same emotional necessity.

640
00:37:32.491 --> 00:37:35.100
It doesn't trigger the same mental state.

641
00:37:35.101 --> 00:37:40.101
And now that's not to say that these negative mental states haven't had the,

642
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.960
the benefit that you ascribe to them.
So yeah,

643
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:49.740
it could be that you are as good as you are because you were motivated to not

644
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:52.920
embarrass yourself ever again because it felt so terrible.
Right?

645
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:57.270
So you hated this experience of flubbing align,
you hated the memory of,
of,
of,

646
00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.240
and,
and the reliving of it the next day.
You hated what it did to your,

647
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:04.740
your time with your family.
And so he thought,
the next tour,

648
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:06.930
I'm going to get this,
I'm going to,
I'm going to get up earlier.

649
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:10.190
I'm going to work harder,
et cetera.
So yeah,
that,
that,

650
00:38:10.191 --> 00:38:14.730
that's all part of the clockwork that's causing you to,
to hone your craft.

651
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:20.250
Um,
but I would argue that a little mental suffering those along way,

652
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:24.210
I think we know nine times out of 10 or 99 times out of a hundred,

653
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.830
we suffer unnecessarily and there's no good comes from it.
It's just,
it's,

654
00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:31.500
it's not actually making us better people.
It's making us more neurotic.

655
00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:34.790
People were more worried,
we're worse,
husband were worst.

656
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.270
And,
and it's time to,
to break that spell and [inaudible] and then you can,

657
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:42.190
you can selectively be as,

658
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.750
as uptight and neurotic as you want.
It can,

659
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.100
it gives you a kind of freedom to pick your,
your,
um,

660
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:55.390
your priorities in a way rather than be captured by just whatever the next

661
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.440
thought happens to be.

662
00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.870
<v 0>I've also found that for me personally,</v>

663
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:02.260
the discipline and diligence are the,
uh,

664
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.220
the best mitigating factors for dealing with neurotic thoughts.

665
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.540
Like if I have an issue,
um,
one of the big issues,

666
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.650
if I've ever had anything go wrong was that I didn't work hard enough.

667
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.640
So if I know for a fact that I worked as hard as I could,

668
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:22.460
like back when I was competing,
that was a huge issue.
And it also,
uh,

669
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.730
mitigated nervousness.
Cause Look,

670
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.260
whenever you're involved in a competition as terrifying as a full contact

671
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:33.670
martial arts tournament where concussions are not just likely,

672
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:37.510
but it's someone in,
there's a hundred people fighting in this tournament,

673
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:39.850
someone's going to sleep,
something's going to get knocked out.

674
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.980
Is it going to be you?
And someone's going to get their nose broken,

675
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:46.600
someone's going to get hit.
A lot of people are probably,
if I,

676
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:50.590
if I trained really hard,
it's like I know I did everything that I could.

677
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.040
I ate right,
I slept right.
I put in all the practice,

678
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:58.450
I worked on all my weaknesses.
I,
I,
you know,
I didn't neglect my strengths.

679
00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.890
I was much less nervous,

680
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.820
much less nervous and much better at dealing with losses.

681
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.630
Whereas losses,
uh,

682
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:10.420
I think losses for martial artists can be insanely devastating.

683
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.680
Like I was listening to this interview with Travis Brown.

684
00:40:13.681 --> 00:40:17.530
Do you know he has no UFC heavyweight?
One of the top,
top five guys in the world,

685
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:22.590
great fighter lost recently to Fabricio for doom in a title elimination fight.

686
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.970
So Fabrisio has gone on and he'll be fighting.

687
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:29.680
Cain Velasquez for the heavyweight title now in October in Mexico and a huge

688
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.320
October or November,
November,
believe it's November.
What are one of those?
Um,

689
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.810
he's fighting a Cain Velasquez for the title.
Huge fight.

690
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.010
It could have been Travis Browne,

691
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.210
Travis Browne lost the fight by decision and you know,
it was a,
it was,

692
00:40:43.211 --> 00:40:47.170
he lost without a doubt.
But you know,
wasn't embarrassing.

693
00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.750
It wasn't a,
he didn't get knocked out in the first round.

694
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:51.160
He didn't get submitted really quickly,

695
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.480
but he did lose the fight and it was apparently devastating to him.
I mean,

696
00:40:55.481 --> 00:41:00.040
he's talked in great depth about lying in bed in the fetal position crying.

697
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:00.641
I mean,

698
00:41:00.641 --> 00:41:05.641
he's just fucking 250 pound gladiator and he's curled up in a fetal position

699
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.960
crying.
I mean,
the truth is I have to,

700
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:12.610
the ego is always curled up in the fetal position crying.
We all have that

701
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:17.360
<v 3>a part of ourselves.
And it's,
um,
yeah,
I mean,</v>

702
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.990
and that's what is so excruciating about the self and the self really is the

703
00:41:21.991 --> 00:41:24.570
center of the center of our problem.
You know?

704
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.750
And when things are really going well,

705
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:32.850
we are consoled by how well they're going.
But we know it's,

706
00:41:32.851 --> 00:41:34.190
it's vulnerable to change me.

707
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.950
You're only as good as your last appearance in some sense.
I mean,

708
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:41.240
I could do something incredibly embarrassing in the middle of this podcast and

709
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:45.260
that will be the thing I'm thinking about tonight.
And I'll be,
I'm thinking,

710
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:49.030
you know,
God,
I can't believe I fucked that up so bad and Joe's podcast.
Uh,

711
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.860
and that it's,
you're always vulnerable to that for the revenue for it,

712
00:41:53.861 --> 00:41:56.990
as long as you are,
as long as you're in the center of this thing,

713
00:41:56.991 --> 00:42:01.120
vulnerable to what other other people think about you and,
um,

714
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:06.770
a captive of your really crazy rehearsal of experience.

715
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.270
And when you,
when something like this happens to you,

716
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.380
just think of how many times you repeat it to yourself.

717
00:42:12.381 --> 00:42:17.381
It's like you tell yourself the same story 15 times a minute for hours and it

718
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:24.050
doesn't strike you as insane,
but it actually is insane.
It's,
I,
if you're,

719
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.730
if you are thoughts,

720
00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:29.750
could be broadcast on a monitor for other people to hear and they could hear you

721
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:32.990
repeat yourself over and over and over again.

722
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:37.580
It would seem starkly crazy.
It just,
it and yet it seems normal.
It's,

723
00:42:37.581 --> 00:42:38.151
it's kind of like,

724
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:42.930
like the dream state where you go to sleep and you're in your bed and you,

725
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.800
you know,
you're,
everything's obeying the laws of physics.

726
00:42:45.801 --> 00:42:50.420
And then in the next conscious moment you are,
you know,

727
00:42:50.421 --> 00:42:54.290
at a party somewhere,
it's talking to someone who you know,
is dead and saying,
oh,

728
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:57.500
I can't believe you're,
you're alive now.
And,
and,
and then,
you know,

729
00:42:57.501 --> 00:42:59.450
there's a gorilla in the room and,
and,

730
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:03.630
and none of this strikes you as crazy as,
I mean,
the,
the,
the,

731
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.950
what the craziest things about dreams is that the,

732
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:11.510
the mind seems to just accept them except these changes one after the other

733
00:43:11.511 --> 00:43:15.550
without any sense.
That there should be continuity and this is due.

734
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.850
There's no question that this is due to the diminished activity of the frontal

735
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:21.870
lobes dirt during rem sleep.
And that we just,
our,

736
00:43:21.871 --> 00:43:26.690
our truth or reality testing hardware has come largely offline during dreams.

737
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:32.120
But there's something analogous happening when we're just thinking in the waking

738
00:43:32.121 --> 00:43:36.390
state,
because thoughts are,
thoughts don't make much sense because if the,

739
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.800
the repetition is,
we don't notice how crazy the repetition is.

740
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:42.500
And we would notice it if we were talking to each other.

741
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:46.370
If I was telling you the same thing 15 times in a row without a,

742
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.030
without honoring your expectation that I might move on to another topic,

743
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.920
you know,
you would,
you would notice and I would notice.
Right.
Um,
and,

744
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.900
uh,
yeah.
And,

745
00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:02.050
and the other thing that's crazy about thoughts is that much of our thinking and

746
00:44:02.051 --> 00:44:03.410
certainly our linguistic thoughts

747
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.350
or it's structured as though it were a conversation and we played both sides of

748
00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:14.350
the conversation.
So I,
you know,
I'll,
I'll sit down here and,
um,
you know,

749
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.770
I said,
I came in,
I sat down and,
and uh,

750
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.610
I brought you a book and I wanted to sign the book.

751
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.240
And I see this pen over here and,
and I think,
oh good,

752
00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:27.380
there's a pen over there right now.
I can see that there's a pen over there.

753
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.830
So who am I?
Why do I have to say there's a pen over there,
right?

754
00:44:30.831 --> 00:44:31.510
Who am I telling?

755
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.620
Is there someone in me who can't see that there's a pen over there?
Right?

756
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:37.350
So there's a conversation that started like,
and I'm both sides of it.

757
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:40.650
That doesn't make any sense.
Right?
And yet we are,

758
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:45.510
our subjectivity is continually,
uh,
just,

759
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:46.523
it is,

760
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:51.480
it is discursive in that way and they're just voices talking to each other.

761
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.980
And there's not only,
not only are there not to have us in there,

762
00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:58.830
there's not even one of us in there.
There's not,
the thinker isn't there.

763
00:44:58.831 --> 00:45:00.420
But we seem to have two of them.

764
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:05.430
It's like we're constantly talking to mommy and Daddy.
Uh,
and we,
in fact,

765
00:45:05.431 --> 00:45:09.210
I could be the way this conversation gets internalized,
cause you know,

766
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:13.000
I can see it in my kids now where they seem to all the Aleve.
Oh,

767
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:17.190
I'll listen to my daughter or playing by herself and she's talking to herself

768
00:45:17.191 --> 00:45:19.380
out loud in the way that,
that,
you know,

769
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:22.220
you'd have to be sort of crazy to do as an adult.
But as a kid you're just,

770
00:45:22.221 --> 00:45:24.300
you know,
you're just talking out loud.
Um,

771
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:29.130
and eventually we all learned to internalize that conversation.
But,

772
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.370
um,
and when you don't,
when people who can't internalize it will,

773
00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:33.510
they're the crazy ones.
You know,
the,

774
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:36.900
the person who's walking down the street just saying,
oh good,

775
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:40.740
there's a pen over there and what w God,
we're,
we're late.
And,
uh,
God,

776
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.200
I know Joe Joe is gonna really be pissed.
Um,

777
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.660
I can't believe I sh I should have checked the traffic before I left.

778
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.560
So these are the kinds of thoughts I could think silently in,
in,

779
00:45:49.561 --> 00:45:53.970
in the space of my mind.
But,
um,
and it wouldn't be starkly crazy,

780
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:56.460
but to verbalize them then you're a madman.
And that,

781
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:01.260
that difference between letting them out and just knowing to keep your mouth

782
00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:06.261
shut is it captures a large part of the difference between being a proper

783
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.340
lunatic,
uh,
and in normal person.

784
00:46:11.341 --> 00:46:16.090
But what I argue in this book is that it's a normal isn't good enough.
You know,

785
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.740
the normal,

786
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.740
the normal state of consciousness wherein you are just chased out of bed every

787
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:25.350
morning by your thoughts and you think,
think,
think,
think,

788
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:29.970
think every waking moment until you fall helplessly asleep at night.
Um,

789
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:34.770
that's not necessarily a happy place to be and it's not the only alternative.

790
00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:39.240
And,
and so,
um,
and again,
and thought it's not that you're,

791
00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.830
the goal is not to have a mind without thoughts,
but we need thoughts and,

792
00:46:42.831 --> 00:46:46.890
and you can't,
you know,
everything we do as human beings for the most part,

793
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.580
d requires thought to get off the ground.

794
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:55.230
So our relationships are based on thoughts and our every public institution and

795
00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:56.430
science.
But it's all,

796
00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:01.540
it's this conversation we have with ourselves and with others is based on,

797
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.540
on language,
uh,
almost,
uh,
and uh,

798
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.200
and concepts that are mediated by language.
And,
uh,

799
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.650
so you need thought,
but the differences,

800
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:19.160
the difference is between thinking and knowing that you're thinking in really

801
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:25.500
knowing that you're thinking in the moment of thoughts arising or being lost in

802
00:47:25.501 --> 00:47:28.980
thought.
And then when you're lost in thought,
it doesn't really matter.

803
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:34.420
The content is,
you're still confused about who and what you are.

804
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.540
I mean,
you gotta be thinking about the moment you can be thinking about the most

805
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:41.890
profound things in science or in,
in ethics or whatever it is.

806
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.640
But if you're just thinking without knowing that you're thinking there is a kind

807
00:47:45.641 --> 00:47:46.391
of delusion there,

808
00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:50.230
it is analogous to to the dream state in a way where you're just,
you're not,

809
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.160
it's not clear to you what's going on youth,
the youth,

810
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.260
you think you're the thinker of the thoughts.

811
00:47:56.261 --> 00:47:59.860
You think you're offering your thoughts in a way that's you're,
you're not,

812
00:47:59.861 --> 00:48:02.920
I mean,
cause thoughts just arise.
We don't,
we don't actually offer them.

813
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:07.750
<v 0>Isn't it fascinating that even in higher education there's very little emphasis</v>

814
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:10.840
whatsoever on controlling thoughts on,

815
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:15.900
on managing thoughts and managing your consciousness on figuring out how to best

816
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:20.350
analyze and a approach your own thinking process.

817
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:23.560
Because if you really think about it like what we were talking about earlier

818
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:26.950
about getting obsessed about something about something like getting into your

819
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:31.951
mind and and rolling over you like that kind of process and that kind of runaway

820
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:37.720
thought process can actually really negatively affect your life and it can start

821
00:48:37.721 --> 00:48:40.150
a pattern that can create other events or,

822
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:43.450
or other sort of neurotic type thinking and that,

823
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:45.070
that that can affect your future.

824
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:48.940
And if you can manage that and sort of nip that in the bud,

825
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:52.810
like literally nip it in the bud,
like that could benefit your future,

826
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:57.100
that could benefit who you become,
how you evolve,
how you,

827
00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.250
how you transform as a person,
a developing person.

828
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:05.470
And yet it's not really taught it is it because the people that are involved in

829
00:49:05.471 --> 00:49:08.080
higher education aren't aware of it.
They don't know it.

830
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.690
It's not a common thinking process.

831
00:49:10.691 --> 00:49:14.310
It's not a common thinking thought management process.
I mean,
what,

832
00:49:14.311 --> 00:49:16.600
what is it that leads,
I mean,

833
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.730
someone like you who's had a higher education goes on,
writes a book like this,

834
00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:26.260
then it becomes a part of whoever's reading it,
part of their mindset.

835
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.140
But if they don't have that,
if they don't have that book,
I mean,

836
00:49:29.141 --> 00:49:32.740
they literally have to be introduced into someone outside of the realm of high

837
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:35.980
school,
College,
even masters,
Phd.

838
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:40.720
Very few people that go through that entire process are involved in a

839
00:49:40.721 --> 00:49:42.910
comprehensive analysis of how to thank,

840
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.160
<v 3>yeah,
well there's,
um,</v>

841
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.790
mindfulness is actually in increasingly current now and it's,
um,

842
00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.120
it's a bit of a,
in some sense a fad,

843
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.090
but I think it's probably an enduring one because it's so useful.
Uh,

844
00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:00.420
so mindfulness is now more and more being taught in schools.

845
00:50:00.421 --> 00:50:03.590
And actually my wife has even taught it and it public school,
uh,

846
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:07.660
to kids as young as six.
So there's,
there's,
um,
really,
that's amazing.
Yeah,

847
00:50:07.661 --> 00:50:12.490
it was amazing to see two,
you have this just picture,
a group of it was in a,

848
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:15.890
in a,
in a kind of lower economic,
uh,
uh,

849
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:20.160
public school and could probably 30 kids in the class and see picture 36 year

850
00:50:20.161 --> 00:50:24.960
olds sitting in a circle.
And on the first day,

851
00:50:24.961 --> 00:50:27.290
it's just that the chaos of 36 year olds.

852
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.310
And by the fourth week she was teaching one class a week.

853
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.000
They were sitting for 15 minutes in silence,

854
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:40.600
no screwing around.
They'll price unbelievable.
Yeah.
Just,
just,
and,

855
00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:41.360
and they'll,

856
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.820
and that the stuff they were reporting back in terms of their experience was

857
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:47.120
amazing.
Uh,
but,
uh,

858
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:50.180
and the grip and the great thing about mindfulness is there's nothing spooky

859
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:50.541
about it.

860
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:55.541
You don't have to develop any kind of affection for Buddhism or beliefs in the

861
00:50:55.761 --> 00:50:59.720
supernatural or a notion of Karma or mean nothing is all it is.

862
00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:00.554
And there's nothing,

863
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.160
there's no thing that you're strategically adding to your experience by way of

864
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:08.400
meditating.
So you don't have a mantra and there's nothing,

865
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.320
there's nothing to explain.
All you have to do is pay

866
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.860
extremely close attention to whatever is arising of its own.

867
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:21.500
And you start with the breath because the breath is always there.

868
00:51:21.501 --> 00:51:25.270
And it's just an easy thing to pay attention to,
but very quickly,
it's just,
it's,

869
00:51:25.271 --> 00:51:25.881
it becomes,

870
00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:29.720
you're just noticing sights and sounds and sensations and moods and thoughts.

871
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:34.430
And it makes perfect sense because if you want to know what it's like to be you,

872
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.520
if you want to have a very clear look at the nature of your own consciousness,

873
00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:39.140
it just makes sense to pay attention.

874
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.270
And all you're doing is paying attention and there's no,

875
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.290
there's no conceptual overlay,
uh,
that you're,

876
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:49.850
you're applying that's monkeying with your experience to,
to try to change it.

877
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.220
So the goal in,
in that case isn't even,

878
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.710
you're not even trying to have a better experience,

879
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:58.490
although you can covertly hope to have a better experience and sort of corrupt

880
00:51:58.491 --> 00:51:59.360
the process that way.

881
00:51:59.361 --> 00:52:04.050
But you're really just trying to witness it.

882
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.190
Just the,
exactly what the character of your experience is in each moment.

883
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:10.550
So you're just noticing unpleasant experience without trying,

884
00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:11.570
without pushing it away.

885
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:14.150
And noticing pleasant experience without trying to grab at it.

886
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.600
And it just so happens that once you develop that kind of dispassionate

887
00:52:19.821 --> 00:52:21.320
attention to experience,

888
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:25.850
then certain very pleasant experiences start to come along because so much of

889
00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:27.470
what's unpleasant about our,

890
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:32.530
our mind is our resistance to pain and are grasping at pleasure and our struggle

891
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.630
with experience.
So just paying attention really just,

892
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:43.270
just openly and without any agenda that for,

893
00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:45.170
for the period of time you can do that,

894
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:49.730
you really have surrendered the struggle and that a tremendous relief just comes

895
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:51.950
with that process.
And so,
yeah,

896
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:55.400
so it's becoming something that they are teaching in schools,
uh,

897
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.230
at various ages and it's,
um,

898
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:04.030
I think the one downside to the way mindfulness is being marketed at this point

899
00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:09.950
is that it's,
it's really being thought of as a,
almost a,

900
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:14.370
an esoteric version of an executive stress ball where you use it.
It's a,

901
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:19.250
it's a tool to optimize performance and it's,
it's a,
um,

902
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:23.120
you know,
it's the kind of thing that a CEO wants to have in his toolkit and,

903
00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:27.300
and it's,
and all that's true.
It is,
it is a tool to optimize performance,

904
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:29.800
but it's much more a lie.

905
00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.550
And it's traditionally intended to be much more like the large Hadron collider,

906
00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.180
which is to say a real tool for discovering something fundamental in this case

907
00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:41.830
about the nature of the mind.
And the purpose of,

908
00:53:41.831 --> 00:53:46.831
of mindfulness is to discover that this self we think we have is an illusion.

909
00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:51.510
And,
and,
and that the,
Eh,
so the real,

910
00:53:51.511 --> 00:53:55.890
the real breakthrough is not just a little less stress or a little more

911
00:53:55.891 --> 00:54:00.010
concentration or,
uh,
an ability to,
uh,

912
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:05.280
direct your mind,
uh,
where you want it to go.
So if you're,

913
00:54:05.281 --> 00:54:09.300
you want to stay on a diet but you're tempted by the,
the chocolate chip cookie,

914
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.030
you can just get back on your diet without eating the cookie.
I mean,

915
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:14.430
that's one way in which you could use mindfulness,

916
00:54:14.431 --> 00:54:18.390
but that's not really the center of the bull's eye center of the Bullseye is to

917
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:19.350
cut through this,

918
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:24.150
this illusion that we're all riding around in our heads as the,

919
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.290
you know,
as a ghost in the machine.
So we're not riding around in our heads.
No.

920
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.800
What are we doing?
Well,
there's just,
I mean there's [inaudible] you have a head,

921
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:33.050
but,
um,

922
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.830
the sense that there is a,
well,
interestingly you,

923
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:42.690
it's another way to talk about this.
I don't know if you've ever heard of this.

924
00:54:42.691 --> 00:54:44.790
A writer Douglas Harden,
he was a,
um,

925
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:50.240
a British architect who wrote a book hold on having no head,
uh,

926
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:55.110
w which I'm so he's actually summarize the insight as a state of headlessness

927
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.030
and it actually does sort of capture the flavor of it in a way.

928
00:54:59.031 --> 00:55:03.630
And he kept advocating that people just look for their heads.

929
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:06.630
So you're,
you're walking around and you,
you know,
you have a head,

930
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:09.240
but you actually don't see your head.
I mean,
you and I are talking now,

931
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.240
the only head UC is my head,
right eye.

932
00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.820
So you see the world and my head is in the middle of it,

933
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.470
but you're hitting your head isn't showing up for you.
Right.
So you,
and you can,

934
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:24.490
you can notice that.
And if you look,
if you look for where I'm looking,
I mean,

935
00:55:24.491 --> 00:55:25.021
you know,
I'm,

936
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:28.860
I'm looking at this thing that you think you have behind your eyes and if you

937
00:55:28.861 --> 00:55:31.800
sort of incline your attention in that direction,

938
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:37.260
it's possible to have an experience where
that's,

939
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:39.330
that feeling drops away where you're just,

940
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:44.340
you actually no longer feel like you're behind your eyes looking across space at

941
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:46.680
me.
You just feel like there's just,

942
00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:51.690
there's just this space in which my head is appearing and [inaudible] so it's

943
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.610
almost like you've been decapitated and it's like,

944
00:55:53.611 --> 00:55:57.080
it's like a mad imagine being without a head,
you know?
Um,

945
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:02.130
and so anyway,
this is Douglas Hardin's metaphor for this,

946
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.710
this insight into selflessness,

947
00:56:04.711 --> 00:56:07.650
but it does sort of capture the flavor of it.

948
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:09.960
It gets when it gets your attention moving in the right direction.

949
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:14.960
Because if you look for the center of experience that this and this feeling of

950
00:56:15.211 --> 00:56:17.460
being a self behind the eyes is this feeling of,
of,

951
00:56:17.461 --> 00:56:20.430
of there being a center to experience it.
So it's not just that,

952
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:23.320
it's not that we feel identical to experience.

953
00:56:23.321 --> 00:56:25.960
We feel like we are having an experience.

954
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:29.920
We feel like we are a appropriating the experience and we're doing it from a

955
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:32.320
point behind our eyes.
We're doing it from this,
you know,

956
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:36.250
this sense of being a subject.
But if you look for the subject,

957
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.290
that sense of a center can drop out and then there's just experience.

958
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:44.320
Then there's a,
and,
and that's very much like the,

959
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:48.820
the kind of flow states or the or the,
the uh,

960
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.500
the unified kind of full immersion experiences that people have when you're
just,

961
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:53.890
when you're,

962
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:58.360
when you're paying attention to something so closely that you lose yourself in

963
00:56:58.361 --> 00:57:02.800
it,
whether it's surfing or martial arts or sex or whatever it is,

964
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:04.000
you're just for the,

965
00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:09.070
there can be these experiences where for a moment there is no distance between.

966
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.030
You're no longer looking over your own shoulder having the experience.

967
00:57:13.031 --> 00:57:14.350
You're no longer trying to serve.

968
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:18.490
You're no longer thinking about how good the wave is or whether you're really on

969
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:22.120
it.
There's just a moment where there's just pure flow and you are just,

970
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:26.320
there's a unified field of experience and people get really addicted to those.

971
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.050
Those are,
those are,
those are peak experiences for people and they,

972
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:33.280
and then the rest,
why,
what person would serve for or do any thing else,

973
00:57:33.281 --> 00:57:36.480
which is giving them access to this state of consciousness where they're just,

974
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:40.000
they're the self drops away and there's just experience.

975
00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:43.570
But the thing is you can have that all,
you can have that in any moment.

976
00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:46.870
You remember to look for it once you know how to meditate.
And that is just,

977
00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:50.620
that is the nature of consciousness.
You don't have to be on a wave in a wetsuit.

978
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:55.610
You can just notice it,
you know,
uh,
just in,

979
00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.790
in the middle of a conversation.
And that,
and that's,

980
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.990
that's a really the subject of this book

981
00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:05.910
<v 0>that flow states very different.
Um,
when you,</v>

982
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:08.340
when you get great at something,
when you,
um,

983
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:12.120
whether it's martial arts or you feel it in stand up comedy as well,

984
00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:16.650
it's a very similar state where I described it on stage as being a passenger.

985
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:19.350
You feel like you're a passenger on the ride?

986
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.890
Like I know the words are coming out of my mouth.
I know the timing.
I know,

987
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.270
but it's because I know the material so well and I'm so comfortable on stage and

988
00:58:27.271 --> 00:58:29.520
I've put in so much time that I could reach that flow state.

989
00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:34.320
And the same thing said,
uh,
can be said for Jujitsu or for kickboxing,

990
00:58:34.321 --> 00:58:37.860
sparring or anything like that.
When you're,
when you're,
when you're locked in,

991
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:41.520
when you know you,
you,
you've done it so many times,

992
00:58:41.521 --> 00:58:44.610
you're completely comfortable with the movements you a you under,

993
00:58:44.611 --> 00:58:46.350
you've done all the training,

994
00:58:46.351 --> 00:58:49.800
you put in all the work and the hours to get to that point.

995
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:53.910
It's not as simple as like you could be a white belt who meditates and reach a

996
00:58:53.911 --> 00:58:56.300
flow state.
You can't,
oh yeah,
no,
no,

997
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:58.380
it's not gonna this isn't gonna help you in Jujitsu.
I mean,

998
00:58:58.381 --> 00:58:59.790
you're still going to be a white belt on the mat.

999
00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.940
If you can drop your sense of self,
they'll,
there'll be no flow state.

1000
00:59:02.941 --> 00:59:03.900
You're going to get strangled.

1001
00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:08.520
There can be a flow state getting all getting strangled.
That's Masochism,

1002
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:13.350
but you're still gonna not know what to do.
Oh,
well it can't be a flow state.

1003
00:59:13.351 --> 00:59:17.670
You'll be acting and reacting instead of just in the zone.
Well,
no,

1004
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:22.190
you can be,
um,
no,
there's just the zone can be found anywhere.
It's just people

1005
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:27.100
<v 3>tend to only find it when there is this sort of mastery component.
And this,</v>

1006
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:29.780
the,
there's no,
there's no more error correction.
So,

1007
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:31.850
so the problem that we all have when we're,

1008
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.650
when we're tuning up a skill is that we're constantly making mistakes and

1009
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:40.510
becoming incrementally more aware of the kinds of mistakes we're making and

1010
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.530
correcting for them and getting better at correcting for them.

1011
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:46.880
And there's all the self talk of,
of um,
you know,
what we should have done,

1012
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:49.760
what we should do,
what we're hoping to do in the next moment.
Uh,

1013
00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:54.940
and flow states come when you get good enough for the most part.

1014
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:59.960
So that all of that goes away.
So that like when you're playing golf,
you know,

1015
00:59:59.961 --> 01:00:02.060
there is no,
there are no more thoughts in your backswing.

1016
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:06.290
You Take the club away and you're not thinking 15 different things.
As you know,

1017
01:00:06.291 --> 01:00:08.960
you're trying to hit the little white ball.
You're just,

1018
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.490
you're just hitting a little white ball because you've just grooved your swing

1019
01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:14.270
so much that you just have no issue hitting the little white ball.

1020
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.590
And so Jujitsu has its analogous component where you're not,

1021
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:24.470
you're not still trying to remember what you should be doing when somebody is in

1022
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:26.750
the middle of passenger guard away.
It's like you're just,

1023
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:30.620
you're just part of the whole motion that is a,

1024
01:00:30.621 --> 01:00:34.310
you're not having to make these conscious calculations.
You're just moving.
And,

1025
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.620
um,
so,
but you could,
you could be in,

1026
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:44.621
you could be just as surrender to the present moment and free of self talk free

1027
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:50.360
of neurotic expectations about what,

1028
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.690
what's going to happen in the next instant or what she wished didn't happen a

1029
01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.490
moment ago.
Um,

1030
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.200
and still be a total spazz on the mat.
I mean,
you could just,
you could just,

1031
01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.720
this would just be,
it wouldn't help your Jujitsu.

1032
01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:05.240
It just would help your state of consciousness.
You know,

1033
01:01:05.241 --> 01:01:09.230
you can just drop your problem while realizing that you don't know what to do

1034
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:13.350
when the guy's passenger guard.
Um,
but it's,
uh,

1035
01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.060
these,
um,
so the sip,

1036
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:21.690
but people find these experiences really addictive and not addictive in a,

1037
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.680
in a technical,
I'm not in a biological sense,

1038
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:28.370
but they're just really captivating and they orient their lives around having

1039
01:01:28.371 --> 01:01:29.121
these experiences.

1040
01:01:29.121 --> 01:01:34.121
And the really dangerous thing is that people traditionally have found these

1041
01:01:34.461 --> 01:01:39.461
experiences in the context of religion and in the context of incredibly divisive

1042
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.490
beliefs about paradise and,

1043
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.870
and the unique validity of certain revelations.
And,

1044
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:52.700
and so you have,
uh,
if people get tastes of,
of,
of,
uh,

1045
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:56.770
self transcendence in the context of really,
um,
uh,

1046
01:01:56.910 --> 01:02:00.530
frightening beliefs and then they become mildly attached to those beliefs

1047
01:02:00.531 --> 01:02:05.510
because those beliefs seem to,
they seem to be the only explanation for the,

1048
01:02:05.511 --> 01:02:08.100
the,
the meaning of these experiences.
So that's fast.
If you,

1049
01:02:08.101 --> 01:02:11.450
if you're a Christian and you feel,
you know,

1050
01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:15.820
absolute rapture and self transcendence while praying to Jesus,
well,

1051
01:02:15.821 --> 01:02:17.660
of course that's going to be a data point,

1052
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.820
if not the only a data point in favor of the story,

1053
01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:25.290
that Jesus is the son of God and he's,
he's taking an interest in your soul.

1054
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:29.520
And if you're a,
if you're a jihadist feeling that just,
Eh,

1055
01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:34.550
just as you get off the bus in Syria and you meet your recruiters at Isis,

1056
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:38.130
that's going to,
it's going to prove to you that this is,
of course,

1057
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.360
this is all laws will,
and this is,
you know,
you're fighting the one true,

1058
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.730
you know,
cosmic battle against the evil infidels.

1059
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.290
And you know that there's no question that these guys feel these very positive

1060
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:53.190
states of mind.
Not,
they're not all running around depressed,
uh,
out there.

1061
01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.760
They're having peak experiences.
Uh,

1062
01:02:55.761 --> 01:02:58.650
and then there are people have peak experiences at burning man,
you know,

1063
01:02:58.651 --> 01:03:02.670
and have a totally different interpretation of their significance.

1064
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.700
And what I'm arguing is that the only thing peak experiences prove is that if

1065
01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:14.460
they can't prove that all of these incompatible doctrines are true because they

1066
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.470
can't all be true,
you know,
the jihadists and the d,

1067
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.550
the fundamentalist Christian can't both be right.
And,
uh,

1068
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.620
and not only are they not,
not the only people who have these experiences.

1069
01:03:25.621 --> 01:03:29.310
There are Hindus who have experiences that are,
that are,
that are identical but,

1070
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.610
but,
uh,
are in the context of a totally different doctrine.

1071
01:03:32.611 --> 01:03:35.560
And atheists like myself have these experiences.
So it can,

1072
01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.990
these experiences can't prove that any of these doctrines,
these,

1073
01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.030
these provincial doctrines are,
are um,
true.

1074
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:46.830
What they prove is that the human mind to susceptible to altered states of

1075
01:03:46.831 --> 01:03:51.360
consciousness and some of which are,
are really compelling and,
and worth having.

1076
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:54.210
And yet we just have to understand them in a,
in a secular and,

1077
01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.690
and universal sense and a nonsectarian sense

1078
01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.490
<v 0>is that what's going on?
When Pentecostal speak in tongues,
when they hit that,</v>

1079
01:04:01.491 --> 01:04:04.270
what does that called Glossolalia when they start telling someone won a lot

1080
01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:07.240
[inaudible] like you reached this,
you know what I mean?

1081
01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:11.180
You use the state of mind where you're able to communicate this bizarre,

1082
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:15.050
nonsensical language free of ridicule.

1083
01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.250
You're not worrying about how goofy you're sounding.

1084
01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:22.310
<v 3>Well,
I think it's to some degree,
it is a kind of surrender of,</v>

1085
01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:27.210
<v 0>uh,
certainly one's dignity.
Uh,
um,
no,
I mean,</v>

1086
01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.090
clearly it's got to feel pretty good.
And your surrender,
you're getting it.

1087
01:04:31.091 --> 01:04:33.940
You're getting rid of certain hangups.
It's like,
you know,

1088
01:04:33.941 --> 01:04:37.060
dancing wildly at a rave.
You know,
it's like if you're,

1089
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.230
you're no longer uptight because you're real willing to ride around on the floor

1090
01:04:41.231 --> 01:04:44.650
with your aunts and uncles and you're on ecstasy.
All right.
No,
but in this case,

1091
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.860
your head hostile.
Oh,
um,
uh,
yeah.

1092
01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:53.710
The state that you achieve that allows you to some la when you see those people

1093
01:04:53.711 --> 01:04:58.270
do that.
Like I just saw a guy do it in real life.
Uh,
yeah,
I've never seen it.

1094
01:04:58.271 --> 01:05:02.860
So I don't know what fear factor guy was.
Um,
he,

1095
01:05:02.861 --> 01:05:06.430
uh,
he actually won the,
uh,
event,

1096
01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:10.060
but it's so hilarious.
Like the event was so ridiculous.

1097
01:05:10.061 --> 01:05:12.310
Like some of the fear factor events were completely ridiculous.

1098
01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:17.310
And this one particular event was uniquely ridiculous because it had absolutely

1099
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:22.140
nothing to do with your ability to overcome something or your ability to,
uh,

1100
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:26.500
to even figure your way out through something.
You had like a fort,

1101
01:05:26.501 --> 01:05:30.340
you were attached to a harness and the harness was attached to a cable that

1102
01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:34.600
attached to,
to,
uh,
like,
uh,
a wire so that you,

1103
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.910
you actually didn't fall off this cliff,

1104
01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:41.620
but you were on a four by four and you drove the four by four off the cliff.

1105
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.030
So you just drove,
he hit the gas and you,

1106
01:05:44.031 --> 01:05:47.980
you were yanked up and the four by four fell and whoever's four by four went the

1107
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:51.850
furthest commitment.
Yeah,
yeah,
let's full commitment.

1108
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.820
But there's no skill involved.

1109
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:59.200
You're just hitting the gas and going off a cliff at the same point on the cliff

1110
01:05:59.201 --> 01:06:01.360
as everyone else.
And this one guy,
one,

1111
01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:06.000
and he was convinced that this was the will of God and he was [inaudible].

1112
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:09.180
He started doing this thing and I was like standing next to him watching this.

1113
01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.150
I was like,
this is so strange.
You know,
it was a,

1114
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.920
it was weird to watch someone,
first of all,
if you are speaking in tongues,

1115
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.510
what a shitty language it is.

1116
01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:21.740
Cause you keep repeating the same noise over and over again.

1117
01:06:21.741 --> 01:06:24.340
It has none of the structure of a language where people have analyzed it and

1118
01:06:24.341 --> 01:06:28.840
it's clearly bullshit.
Yeah.
It sounds like bullshit.

1119
01:06:28.841 --> 01:06:31.600
It would be interested,
but it,
it,
it would be interesting if it weren't,
you know,

1120
01:06:31.601 --> 01:06:31.781
it,

1121
01:06:31.781 --> 01:06:36.781
it's possible that somebody could produce a performance like this where it

1122
01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:37.421
would,

1123
01:06:37.421 --> 01:06:41.440
it would have linguistic structure and then people would just be spinning out

1124
01:06:41.441 --> 01:06:45.730
trying to figure out how this is,
you know,
how it is possible.
But no,
it's just,

1125
01:06:45.731 --> 01:06:46.510
it's just gibberish.

1126
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:51.130
But it's a similar jibberish that's what made me wonder like how weird this is

1127
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.360
a,
because this,
this jibberish and I,
I,

1128
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.840
maybe it's repeating because he's pentacostals hanging out with each other and

1129
01:06:57.841 --> 01:06:59.860
maybe it's like an accent sort of a thing.

1130
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.500
Like one person develops a Boston accent,

1131
01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:05.480
although people around them have that Boston accent.
But,
um,

1132
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:09.130
when I watched this guy and then I watched,
um,
Robert Tilden,

1133
01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:11.980
he was one of my favorite bullshit artists that's on a late night,

1134
01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:16.290
religious television.
He's one of those guys that Jesus wants you to.

1135
01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.900
He actually said this one time,
he goes,
every time you write a check to me,

1136
01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:21.520
Satan gets a black eye.

1137
01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:28.630
I fucking love that quote.
Yeah.
But he does the same thing.
He goes,

1138
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:31.880
some of them it's the same summer law.

1139
01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:35.260
My law like that kind of what they're teaching it to each other.

1140
01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.770
It's a kind of performance and they have,

1141
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:43.570
they've all gone to school on each others performances,
but I'm not,

1142
01:07:43.571 --> 01:07:46.730
I'm not insinuating in any way that's actually divined but I,
um,

1143
01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:52.240
I was just weirded out by the similarities and their bullshit language and his

1144
01:07:52.241 --> 01:07:55.510
bullshit language.
Like,
I dunno if this guy's a Robert Tilden fan,

1145
01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:00.200
but he was doing that same summer,
like the,
it's a,

1146
01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:04.300
it's weird,
the Jibberish is similar.
Is it like,

1147
01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.410
just they're not that creative.
Like,
you know,
like,
you know,

1148
01:08:08.411 --> 01:08:12.970
there's not that many ways to make nonsense sounds quickly.
And so the,

1149
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.511
I mean there's probably,

1150
01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:16.040
there's probably some constraints and it would be interesting to see

1151
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.630
<v 3>if,
if you're native Chinese speakers would,</v>

1152
01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:22.700
would produce the same names.
They might,
they might have different,

1153
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.320
I would have expected what it would be different.

1154
01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:28.660
<v 0>That would be interesting like to teach because Christianity has um,</v>

1155
01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:31.710
spread to a lot of other countries,
Asian countries.

1156
01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:36.450
If he could get Pentecostals and Korea.
Yeah.
And see if they,

1157
01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:40.830
you know,
if they have some sort of a or functions to fund that study.
Yeah,

1158
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.800
let's write a check to do it is to,
you know,

1159
01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.860
it would be so unethical because you get these poor people believing that

1160
01:08:46.861 --> 01:08:50.020
they're really talking in tongues and just so you can listen to their,

1161
01:08:50.021 --> 01:08:50.854
their lingo.

1162
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:52.070
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1163
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:57.070
Well it's interesting to know where the line between self deception and

1164
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.840
conscious fraud is placed and I guess it's like the,

1165
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.830
those fake martial arts videos we watched last time I was here.
You know,

1166
01:09:03.831 --> 01:09:07.400
the guys who are taking those dives would there kito master.

1167
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.100
It's just hard to see.
It's hard to see that it's,

1168
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.010
I conscious fraud entirely.

1169
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:19.970
It cause people have too much time invested and obviously the guy who invites

1170
01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:21.950
someone from another school to come punch him in the face.

1171
01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:26.300
That guy w w w was believing his own bullshit.
I mean he thought his,

1172
01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:30.290
at a certain point he must have been convinced that he had this power because

1173
01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:33.860
his,
he,
you know,
for a decade or more he sees people flop around at the mirror,

1174
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:36.410
you know,
the hint of a,
of a touch.

1175
01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:41.210
<v 0>Oh kind of brings us back to what we were talking about earlier in that when</v>

1176
01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:43.370
you're around certain people,

1177
01:09:43.371 --> 01:09:47.660
you're a different person in that when these guys are around,

1178
01:09:47.661 --> 01:09:52.550
all these people that really believe that they have some divine ability to

1179
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:54.440
control that people's bodies with air.

1180
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:59.441
Just like there's something about doing that over and over again and reinforcing

1181
01:09:59.511 --> 01:10:04.511
that belief that it seems to be like they are a master when they're around those

1182
01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:05.630
people.

1183
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:10.630
But then when you put them around someone who knows nothing about them and treat

1184
01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:14.690
them just as a,
an opponent in the martial arts contest and head kicks them,

1185
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.530
like all of a sudden it's gone.
Like,
where's my power?

1186
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:22.730
Who am I?
I'm not,
I'm not a magician.
I'm not a wizard anymore.

1187
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:27.110
Now I'm just a guy getting the fuck beat out of me by some other martial
artists.

1188
01:10:27.111 --> 01:10:29.780
And this is a terrible,
terrible scenario.
I've found myself in

1189
01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:32.980
<v 3>so great about real martial arts.
It is,</v>

1190
01:10:32.981 --> 01:10:37.981
it's like science in that you're running an experiment that is as close to a,

1191
01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:43.260
a real experiment as you can run without anyone getting killed and you're seeing

1192
01:10:43.901 --> 01:10:46.490
what works.
And that's what the UFC was in the beginning.

1193
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:51.550
The UFC was just this absolutely enthralling science experiment because no one

1194
01:10:52.631 --> 01:10:54.350
knew what was gonna happen.
You throw you a,

1195
01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:57.340
what's going to happen when you throw a boxer in with,
uh,
with,
uh,

1196
01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:00.140
karate legend with a sumo wrestler with it and,

1197
01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:04.990
and just know rounds and just,
just let it,
let the clock run and see what it is.

1198
01:11:04.991 --> 01:11:06.730
Just so now,

1199
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:10.780
obviously now I'm now I'm telling you a your own business,

1200
01:11:10.781 --> 01:11:12.970
but I'm at now,

1201
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:16.830
everyone has gone to school on everyone else's style and everyone knows enough

1202
01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:20.310
Jujitsu on the ground to be able to nullify the advantage of Jujitsu.

1203
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.460
And so now everyone has kind of converged on the,

1204
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.630
the common universal toolkit combatively that you want.

1205
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.980
Um,
and so you're not getting these v the experiment isn't,

1206
01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.300
it has basically played out.

1207
01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:36.900
Now everyone's going in with the same expectation that when you're standing up,

1208
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:41.940
you want to be able to kick and punch like a kickboxer or like a Muay Thai

1209
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:44.220
fighter,
somebody who really knows how to kick and punch.

1210
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:48.840
And when you're vertically grappling and you really do want to be,
uh,

1211
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:53.140
like Randy couture or somebody who's got,
you know,
real,
uh,

1212
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.990
clinch and pummeling skills and Greco skills.
And then when you go to the ground,

1213
01:11:57.991 --> 01:12:02.850
you want Bjj or Samba or something that gives you those skills on the ground.

1214
01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:07.500
And,
uh,
so there's not that many surprises left in store.
But,
um,

1215
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:08.443
I mean maybe,
maybe the

1216
01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:10.330
<v 0>wrong,
maybe there's some totals,</v>

1217
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:16.300
which is interesting because martial arts in in many ways really is a scientific

1218
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:21.280
endeavor that because
so much of it,

1219
01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.780
it involves leverage and force and physics,

1220
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:27.230
but also the introduction of new variables that haven't been,

1221
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.920
they haven't been practiced.
And when you introduce new variables like Noo,

1222
01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.910
noo kicking techniques,
especially like when Andrew's character,

1223
01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.850
something that annoys you or even traditional kicking techniques that had been

1224
01:12:37.851 --> 01:12:38.391
discarded.

1225
01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:41.570
Like when Anderson Silva Front kick Vito Belfort and the face and knocked them

1226
01:12:41.571 --> 01:12:43.400
out,
everybody was like,
Holy Shit.

1227
01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.960
Like who the fuck said that coming to have the highest level guys ever,
you know.

1228
01:12:47.961 --> 01:12:50.630
And he introduces the original technique.

1229
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:53.990
That is the number one technique you teach.
When I used to teach white belts,

1230
01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:57.200
the first kick,
I would teach them as a front kick because it's easy to learn.

1231
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:59.540
You pick your knee up,
extend your foot forward.

1232
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.780
And I would teach them to do it at knee level and then,
you know,

1233
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:05.510
eventually you go to chest level.
Then you know,
the rare front kick to the face.

1234
01:13:05.690 --> 01:13:10.340
But nobody ever used it in a UFC belt.
But now it's incredibly common.

1235
01:13:10.341 --> 01:13:13.130
It's like one of the main,
you know,
a Travis Brown,

1236
01:13:13.131 --> 01:13:15.230
the guy we were talking about early knocked out Alistair Overeem,

1237
01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:19.190
front kick to the face and for years we had none.
Um,

1238
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:23.540
Terry Adam when he first knocked out or Edson Barboza when he first knocked out

1239
01:13:23.541 --> 01:13:26.840
Terry Adam with a wheel kick to the head.
That was in 2000,

1240
01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.730
I want to say 12 or 13.

1241
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.880
So there had been no wheel kick knockouts for the decade plus of the UFC.

1242
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.880
I mean it was.
Now do you think that two decades,
in fact,

1243
01:13:38.150 --> 01:13:41.270
do you think that's somewhat an artifact of

1244
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.200
<v 3>everyone's expectations being so trained now that you got me given all of the</v>

1245
01:13:47.331 --> 01:13:48.620
fights that have happened and,
and,

1246
01:13:48.621 --> 01:13:52.910
and how all these traditional techniques have been discarded that now no one is

1247
01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:56.630
expecting anything like a traditional kick.

1248
01:13:56.631 --> 01:14:01.090
So that it's almost like you threw a wheel kick in a boxing match where you've

1249
01:14:01.091 --> 01:14:02.600
got two boxers and,
and you know,

1250
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:06.260
w one has absolutely no expectation that kicks or even going to be involved.

1251
01:14:06.261 --> 01:14:09.130
And all of a sudden you will kick him.
Right.
Um,
is it,

1252
01:14:09.131 --> 01:14:12.010
is it just the sheer novelty?
Is there

1253
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.290
<v 0>something else going on that is just that it's you,
that,</v>

1254
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:20.260
that once you have all of the other skills that are the real foundation for

1255
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:24.100
being a good MMA fighter,
then you can experiment with Goofy,

1256
01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:29.020
traditional moves that wouldn't have worked if you were a pure traditional

1257
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:30.280
martial artists.
Mary,

1258
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:33.790
do you think if you brought in just a pure traditionalist who was like one of

1259
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:38.590
the guys who showed up at UFC one now who really could only do things like wheel

1260
01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:42.730
kicks and you know,
he just basically,
he was just a straight up,
uh,

1261
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:46.840
I dunno.
Tank pseudo guy,
right?
You bring him into the UFC.

1262
01:14:46.841 --> 01:14:51.190
Is he gonna get off of Lucky?
We'll kick and he exactly that circumstance or,

1263
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:55.630
or as he would have to have all the other techniques as well.
But um,

1264
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.580
I think it's,
it's pattern recognition and a,

1265
01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:04.590
not very many people who are martial artists in the sense of mixed martial

1266
01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:08.530
artists,
uh,
fighting in the UFC can actually do those techniques.

1267
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:13.270
I've worked out with high level guys like guys who are fighting for titles,

1268
01:15:13.271 --> 01:15:15.940
guys who are,
you know,
top 10 ranked.

1269
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:19.960
And I've worked out with them showing them martial arts techniques like

1270
01:15:19.961 --> 01:15:23.090
taekwondo techniques and they don't know how to do them.
And it's amazing.

1271
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.520
You see,
you're talking about high level MMA guys who don't have a background,

1272
01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:29.280
a kicking background,
don't have a taekwondo based background,
right?

1273
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:33.040
Or showed AECON.
There's a few uh,
kicking,
uh,

1274
01:15:33.041 --> 01:15:37.980
disciplines that incorporate wheel kicks and a lot of high kicks like acts,

1275
01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.730
kicks and things along those lines.

1276
01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:44.260
And they literally don't know the effectiveness of these techniques because they

1277
01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:45.970
don't,
they don't do them.
So they,
they,

1278
01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:48.820
what they do is a lot of Moitai leg kicks and knees,
the body,

1279
01:15:48.821 --> 01:15:51.820
elbows in close get the take down ground and pounds,
submissions,

1280
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.920
things that you see much more common.

1281
01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.280
And when I've tried to teach them these specific techniques,

1282
01:15:57.281 --> 01:16:01.510
it's amazing how incompetent they are at them.
They haven't even tried to learn,

1283
01:16:01.511 --> 01:16:04.060
we'll kicks,
right?
So what I'm teaching them wheel kicks,
you know,

1284
01:16:04.061 --> 01:16:07.560
they're like their bodies all awkward and thrown it where they don't have like a

1285
01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:10.810
fluidity that you need.
Like an Edson Barboza has where he,
you know,

1286
01:16:10.811 --> 01:16:12.670
he's standing there and then boom and he throws it.

1287
01:16:12.671 --> 01:16:15.580
So if you're not used to sparring with a guy like that,

1288
01:16:15.581 --> 01:16:17.530
you don't know that that can come at you like that.

1289
01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:21.790
You're used to a certain distance as well.
The distance between,
uh,

1290
01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:25.480
where a person could land a leg kick and a person could land a wheel kick is a

1291
01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:30.190
little bit different.
And if you don't know you're in range.
Yeah.
There's also,
um,

1292
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.820
some kicks like spinning backaches or a little bit easier than a wheel kick.

1293
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.620
The wheel kick requires a lot of flexibility.

1294
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:39.460
So you might anticipate a spinning back kick and then the kid comes up high and

1295
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.080
you only have a millisecond.

1296
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:44.830
You have the reaction time and action time are two very different things.

1297
01:16:44.831 --> 01:16:49.240
That's why sucker punches work.
The reason why I sucker punched works is a punch.

1298
01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.990
The action time is like a hundredth of a second,
but reaction time,

1299
01:16:52.991 --> 01:16:55.510
it's like a 10th of a second.
That's a big gap.

1300
01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:58.780
So the amount of time that it takes for someone to punch you in the face and the

1301
01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.220
amount of time it takes,
you go,
oh,

1302
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:02.920
this fucking guy's going to punch me in the face.
Oh Shit,
I've got to duck.

1303
01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:06.700
You don't have time crack.
You get hit.
And that's why soccer punches work.

1304
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.130
And that's why actually this opens a up to,
I don't know if we want to go

1305
01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:11.870
<v 3>recklessly in this direction,
but this,</v>

1306
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:16.440
this opens up into the ethics of uses of violence and use it.

1307
01:17:16.441 --> 01:17:19.460
You just kind of use of force philosophy and you have something like,
you know,

1308
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.990
what's been going on in Ferguson,
you know,
that were around this shooting.
Um,

1309
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.370
people have erroneous assumptions about how violence unfolds.

1310
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.390
And as you're saying,
like if you're,

1311
01:17:29.391 --> 01:17:33.230
if you're deciding to block or to defend yourself in the mirror,

1312
01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:37.820
once a guy has thrown his sucker punch,
you are nine times out of 10 too late.

1313
01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:41.600
I mean you're just,
you,
you,
you,
you need a distance.
Was WWE at that moment.
Yeah.

1314
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:45.460
You didn't need awareness and awareness of possibility and if,
but if,
you know,

1315
01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.440
if,
if,
uh,
and I'm,

1316
01:17:46.441 --> 01:17:50.300
I'm not making any claims about knowing what happened in Ferguson with the

1317
01:17:50.301 --> 01:17:52.000
shooting.
I mean he could be,
um,

1318
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:55.680
every inch of the homicide that many people seem to think it was.
But,
um,

1319
01:17:56.450 --> 01:18:01.400
the reality is that cops are walk having to work in a universe where,
you know,

1320
01:18:01.401 --> 01:18:04.820
they do a traffic stop and someone pulls out a gun and shoots him in the face.

1321
01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:08.180
Right?
And so,
so they have to assume,
uh,

1322
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:10.940
that that is a possibility no matter what you look like,

1323
01:18:10.941 --> 01:18:12.380
no matter what kind of car you're driving.

1324
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.800
And so you see the cops are incredibly on edge and you see them,
you know,

1325
01:18:15.801 --> 01:18:16.730
unbuckling their,

1326
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:21.770
the strap on their holster as they just walk up to give you a ticket.
Um,

1327
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:25.790
but it's because they don't have,
they don't have the luxury of time.

1328
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:28.850
They can't wait to see you produce a gun.
And then they say,
okay,

1329
01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:33.350
now my lethal force option is,
is,
is beyond reproach.
And so,
uh,

1330
01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:36.500
I mean the only mode to be in with a cop,

1331
01:18:36.501 --> 01:18:41.150
no matter how much of an asshole he might be is,
is to be compliant.

1332
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.620
And then you,
you,
me sue him later in the,

1333
01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:47.440
in the middle of negotiating a with a cop.

1334
01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.230
You the,
no matter how,
um,

1335
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:56.800
unjustified the arrest may seem or that's not the time to be telling him he's an

1336
01:18:57.411 --> 01:19:00.610
asshole or,
or talking about how you are such a good guy and,

1337
01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:05.090
and this is a violation of your civil rights.
You just,

1338
01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.670
you do what he says and then you know,
sue the cops later.
But it's just,
yeah,

1339
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:12.590
cause cause well the filter he is,
is seeing everything through is,

1340
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.060
is this cause it was what the,

1341
01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:19.250
the sheer fact that a cop has a gun on his belt makes any contact,

1342
01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:23.090
a potential lethal encounter for him.
Let me say you just,

1343
01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:25.430
you just go hands on a cop.
You know,
you push a cop,

1344
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:28.160
he doesn't know that you're not going for the gun on his belt.

1345
01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.440
He doesn't know that you're going to not push him into,

1346
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:34.140
into a car and he'll be knocked out and then then you're going to get his gun.

1347
01:19:34.141 --> 01:19:37.610
And He,
so it's just,
it's all deadly for a,
from a cop's point of view.

1348
01:19:37.611 --> 01:19:41.960
And so you very few people understand that if I had a friend who was,

1349
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:45.280
who was stopped by a cop,
um,
and this is,
you know,

1350
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:47.750
this is a middle aged Jewish guy who's like,

1351
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:52.130
in his mind the least dangerous person on earth and why on earth is a cop

1352
01:19:52.131 --> 01:19:54.070
stopping him.
And,
and uh,

1353
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:59.150
my friend said something to the cop and the cop on a latched as,
you know,

1354
01:19:59.151 --> 01:20:02.720
the,
the top restrain on his,
on his gun.
And my friend said,
what,

1355
01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:06.020
you're going to pull out your gun on me with the,
and,
and the cops that,

1356
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:06.950
what does a bad guy look

1357
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.760
<v 0>and that and that just sort of cut through it for my friend and my friend.
Just,</v>

1358
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:14.160
you know,
my friend,
my friend knew he was not a bad guy,

1359
01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:16.950
but there's no way for the cop to know he's not a bad guy.
Um,

1360
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:18.240
and people just don't,

1361
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:21.450
people are just not aware of that and they're interacting with cops and it's,

1362
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.270
it's a,
it's dangerous for everybody.
Yeah.

1363
01:20:24.271 --> 01:20:27.090
The naivete of someone who is a good guy,

1364
01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:30.400
who doesn't know bad people and doesn't know what people mean.

1365
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:34.710
You just go on Youtube and watch,
um,
assault on police officer,

1366
01:20:34.711 --> 01:20:36.780
just youtube assault on police officer.

1367
01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:41.280
There's a a hundred videos that you can watch where people sucker punch cops.

1368
01:20:41.281 --> 01:20:45.740
There's this horrific video of this guy getting pulled over and uh,

1369
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:50.120
he's with his son and a,
it's on a dash cam of the police car there.

1370
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:54.600
The lady pulls him over and uh,
she asks him for his license and registration.

1371
01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:57.310
The guy gets out of the car,
he's given her a stuff and he says,
well,

1372
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:01.880
and she's like,
sir,
I need you to turn,
turn around and put your,
uh,
you know,

1373
01:21:01.881 --> 01:21:04.470
lean your body up against some of the,
I'm going to handcuff you.
And he's like,

1374
01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:06.000
why are you going to do that?
Bang.

1375
01:21:06.001 --> 01:21:07.890
He punches her in the face and before you know what?

1376
01:21:07.891 --> 01:21:12.000
She's unconscious on the ground.
He's beating on her,
his,
his,

1377
01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:15.990
his son is screaming for him to stop.
Or his daughter was screaming at him.

1378
01:21:15.991 --> 01:21:19.080
I forget which one it was for him to stop beating this cop up.

1379
01:21:19.081 --> 01:21:21.690
But he's beating the fuck out of her and she's unconscious and he takes her
gone.

1380
01:21:21.691 --> 01:21:26.400
And you know,
I don't know how it ended.
I shut it off.
But there's a lot of those.

1381
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:30.420
You can't assume that someone's a good person.
You don't know who they are,

1382
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:32.280
you don't know anything about them.

1383
01:21:32.490 --> 01:21:35.750
And also the psychology of being a police officer.
The,

1384
01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:40.650
the PTSD involved in day to day interaction with criminals,

1385
01:21:40.651 --> 01:21:42.810
day to day,
interaction with people lying to you day to day,

1386
01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:45.510
interaction with danger,
violence,
car accidents,

1387
01:21:45.511 --> 01:21:47.850
death over and over and over and over again.

1388
01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:51.180
You've gotta be on edge all the time.
And then thinking,

1389
01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.240
is this the day where they get me?
Is this the day?

1390
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:56.220
Am I going to be the guy who gets his gun taken away?

1391
01:21:56.221 --> 01:21:57.660
Am I going to be the guy who gets shot?

1392
01:21:57.810 --> 01:22:00.750
Like this guy I saw on a video or you know,
it's,
there's,

1393
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:04.260
there's so many instances that a cop has to think about when you have that job.

1394
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:08.820
I started argued,
someone made this really irresponsible,
irresponsible,

1395
01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:10.350
ignorant,
um,

1396
01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:15.380
Twitter posts about how being a cop isn't dangerous because look how many cops

1397
01:22:15.811 --> 01:22:18.600
die as opposed to look how many,
um,
you know,

1398
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:20.940
x amount of a fireman or whatever,

1399
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.500
whatever job it was die that cops actually are less likely to die than many

1400
01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:29.340
industrial workers.
But that's because they have protocol.

1401
01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:31.980
That's because they think they think ahead.

1402
01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:34.950
That's because they have so many cops have been killed,

1403
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.940
that they have all these standards of practices in place to make sure that it

1404
01:22:38.941 --> 01:22:41.250
doesn't happen.
That's why I'm going to cop approaches a car.

1405
01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:42.870
He does have his hand on his gun.

1406
01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:45.120
That's why he does say keep your hand on the wheel.

1407
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.920
That's why he does say licenser edge place.

1408
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:50.070
You keep your hands where I could see them license and registration please.

1409
01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:54.260
Like they have to be aware because if cops just treated it like,
hey,

1410
01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.210
cops never die.
Like I saw this Twitter post,

1411
01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.720
it says like one 10th of 1% of cops die.

1412
01:23:00.721 --> 01:23:03.600
Like I don't have to worry about that shit.
Hey man,
where are you going?
Boom,

1413
01:23:03.601 --> 01:23:06.590
you're shot in the face.
You know that the,

1414
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:11.050
the statistics are often inaccurate when it comes to dealing with something

1415
01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.650
where someone is,
uh,

1416
01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:17.670
there's many practices that are in place to protect someone from inevitable in

1417
01:23:17.671 --> 01:23:21.970
variables are an inevitable variables that a cop is going to face.

1418
01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.580
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
They also have much less training than you would expect,</v>

1419
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:27.800
especially with like hand to hand skills.

1420
01:23:27.801 --> 01:23:32.110
I mean you have so much more training than even,
you know,

1421
01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:35.980
elite swat operators in terms of your hand to hand skills so big.

1422
01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.370
And so it's um,

1423
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.600
it's the public has an expectation that the only justification for producing a

1424
01:23:44.691 --> 01:23:49.691
gun if you're a cop or if you're anyone is if the other person has a gun or some

1425
01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.080
similarly lethal weapon.
I even,
I think so some people think that,
you know,

1426
01:23:54.081 --> 01:23:58.830
a knife isn't lethal enough to justify the use of a gun.
Right.
Uh,
but the truth,

1427
01:23:58.850 --> 01:24:03.460
but the fact is cops are not superheroes and they can't handle a,
uh,

1428
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:07.610
a person who is bigger than them,
stronger than them,
younger,
younger than them,

1429
01:24:07.611 --> 01:24:10.280
and more aggressive than them.
Who gets the jump on them.
I mean,
it's just,

1430
01:24:10.281 --> 01:24:13.940
you know,
that,
that's,
that's a tall order even for a black belt in Jujitsu,

1431
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:17.830
you know,
it's,
it's not,
um,
and so their,
their,

1432
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:21.680
their tool belt is,
is there for a reason and say they need to,

1433
01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:24.440
they need tasers and they need guns and they need,

1434
01:24:24.441 --> 01:24:28.880
they need force of numbers in order to even do the job against somebody who

1435
01:24:28.881 --> 01:24:32.690
doesn't have a gun themselves.
And,
and so it's,
um,

1436
01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.090
it's a very,
it's a,
it's a hard job.

1437
01:24:35.091 --> 01:24:40.070
And I've got a huge respect for a cops all the while knowing that there are

1438
01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:44.990
undoubtedly some bad cops who were just psychopaths and status and shouldn't be

1439
01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:47.540
in the job.
And there are a lot of cops who are,

1440
01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.820
who are frankly not as trained as they should be in any him,
even with guns.

1441
01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:53.930
And they're not as stressed of them.
Yeah.

1442
01:24:53.931 --> 01:24:56.080
They're not as trained with guns as they should be in there,

1443
01:24:56.090 --> 01:25:00.770
not as trained hand to hand as they should be.
Um,
and that's,
um,
you know,

1444
01:25:00.771 --> 01:25:03.740
that's just,
it's,
it's doing them a disservice and it's doing,

1445
01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.570
doing the public a disservice.
But,
um,
still even if you're well trained,

1446
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:12.410
uh,
you as a cop,

1447
01:25:12.411 --> 01:25:17.411
you were moving into situations which it's just untenable to give this stranger

1448
01:25:19.701 --> 01:25:24.120
the benefit of the doubt.
You know,
you just see,
so you,
you,
you have to,
you,

1449
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:27.280
you look like a,
uh,

1450
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:31.670
someone who's escalating force too early.
If you're a,

1451
01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.710
if you're a cop who's just taking,
um,

1452
01:25:35.150 --> 01:25:38.780
totally rational steps to stay safe in a situation where,

1453
01:25:38.781 --> 01:25:41.390
where there's just basic uncertainty as to what you're dealing with.

1454
01:25:41.810 --> 01:25:46.010
<v 0>I think we're requiring so much of someone who becomes a police officer that</v>

1455
01:25:46.011 --> 01:25:49.210
it's almost a job that no one can be qualified to do me.

1456
01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:54.230
Or you're acquiring psychology or acquiring the physical ability to defend

1457
01:25:54.321 --> 01:25:55.970
themselves against a,

1458
01:25:55.971 --> 01:26:00.110
a wide variety of people where you have zero idea of what their background is.

1459
01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.140
You know,
you see some young guy and he looks reasonably athletic,

1460
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:05.330
have no idea what he can do to you.
Yeah.

1461
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:08.930
He might be a cigarette smoker with no martial arts experience whatsoever,

1462
01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:12.290
or he might be a Moitai champion.
And if we're with,
you're within range of him,

1463
01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.350
all of a sudden,
boom,
you're unconscious.
You have no idea what happened.

1464
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:19.670
He punched you in the face so fast.
You have no idea.
And the,
the,

1465
01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:23.490
the other thing about when people start talking about cops and,

1466
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:24.770
and violence and danger,

1467
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:30.070
most people have never been involved in a physical altercation with a trained

1468
01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:33.380
martial artists.
They have no idea how vulnerable they really are.

1469
01:26:33.381 --> 01:26:34.340
They're walking around.

1470
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:38.870
I've seen people get in arguments before and get crazy with people and start

1471
01:26:38.871 --> 01:26:43.280
fights and then watched a fight take place.
And I,
and I,
it boggles my mind,

1472
01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:47.150
I'm like,
why was this guy so confident to get into a physical altercation?

1473
01:26:47.151 --> 01:26:50.390
But he's got no idea what you do with a guy with cauliflower ear.

1474
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.480
That's usually a typical for you guys.
You know,

1475
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:56.720
guys got tats like you and he's got cauliflower ear and you still got somebody

1476
01:26:56.721 --> 01:26:59.570
mouthing off to him.
If it happens.
It happens all the time.

1477
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:02.570
And I think some people think they're going to bluff their way out of it.

1478
01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:07.600
Or I think there's so much ignorance and ego involved in the average person when

1479
01:27:08.331 --> 01:27:09.860
it comes to physical altercations.

1480
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:14.660
I think it would do a lot of people good just to realize how vulnerable they
are.

1481
01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:19.300
And when I was a black belt in taekwondo,
when I had national,
uh,

1482
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:22.880
level comp competitor,
I'd won multiple tournaments.

1483
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:27.770
And then I started doing Jujitsu.
I got mall,
I mean mauled,

1484
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:31.490
not mall,
like,
um,
like,
well,
you know,

1485
01:27:31.491 --> 01:27:34.830
I kind of held them off for a little while but eventually got me,
no,
no,
like,

1486
01:27:34.831 --> 01:27:36.980
like instantaneously destroyed

1487
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:38.760
<v 3>saline with a five year old,
you know,</v>

1488
01:27:38.761 --> 01:27:42.540
it's like the five year from the five year old's point of view.
There just,

1489
01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:47.220
there is absolutely nothing to do.
It's just,
you know,
and,
and that's,

1490
01:27:47.221 --> 01:27:49.710
that's what I felt like the first time I got on the mat with a,

1491
01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.790
with a Jujitsu black belt.
I thought,
I,

1492
01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:56.791
I thought I would have some sense of just how to stop the problem from now,

1493
01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:59.880
from a golfing me.
And it was just,
it was,

1494
01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:02.280
it's totally hopeless and it's hopeless in a way that,

1495
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.940
and that's why I wrote that blog post originally.
The pleasures of drowning,

1496
01:28:06.690 --> 01:28:11.410
it's like drowning because when you're
drowning doesn't make much sense.
It's,

1497
01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:13.650
it's hard.
Like you're,
you're moving,
you know,

1498
01:28:13.651 --> 01:28:15.930
you get in the water and you're moving your arms and legs,

1499
01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:19.100
like you've seen people swim,
you know,
it's like,
Whoa,

1500
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:22.440
how could there be that much to it?
And in fact,
once you know how to tread water,

1501
01:28:22.441 --> 01:28:26.130
there isn't much to stay in a afloat.
But if you don't know how to tread water,

1502
01:28:26.131 --> 01:28:30.090
you don't know how to swim.
All that moving of are your arms and legs is just,

1503
01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.310
it's completely ineffectual.

1504
01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.370
And you could be making 100% effort and you're still going straight to the

1505
01:28:35.371 --> 01:28:39.960
bottom.
And it's,
um,
and with Jujitsu it was,
it's just so,

1506
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.823
uh,

1507
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:46.290
it's so surprising to him to feel like you have some skills cause you've done,

1508
01:28:46.291 --> 01:28:49.440
if you've trained for years and some standup art and you did a little,
you know,

1509
01:28:49.441 --> 01:28:52.590
he took some Krav Maga classes and you did some stuff on the ground and you,

1510
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:55.370
you have a basic feeling that,
you know,
you know,
hey,

1511
01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.660
I would poke him in the eyes if it really got bad on the ground.
Um,

1512
01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:02.070
and then you get on the mat with somebody who really has

1513
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.460
<v 0>a deep Jujitsu game and it's just,
it's like wrestling a Martian.
Well,</v>

1514
01:29:05.461 --> 01:29:08.790
there's also levels.
Like,
you know,
I'm a black belt,
but I,

1515
01:29:08.791 --> 01:29:11.370
there's guys who I roll with.
It could treat me like I'm a blue belt.

1516
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:15.390
That's the reality of the situation.
If I'm,
if I'm rolling with like Jock,
Hurray,

1517
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.400
I'm going to get strangled and I'm,

1518
01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:20.410
I've been doing it for 20 years and it doesn't matter.
So how,

1519
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:24.400
so how long do you think you could hold off?
Uh,

1520
01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.930
the tap with the best person?
If,

1521
01:29:26.931 --> 01:29:31.350
if you're down with Marcella Garcia or somebody who a couple minutes at the
most,

1522
01:29:31.351 --> 01:29:35.460
and that's all I have to be on full defense.
That's,
that's the difference.

1523
01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:38.520
Like if I'm rolling with a guy who was a purple belt,
I go on offense.

1524
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:42.840
Like if I'm rolling with someone who is below me or my level,
I'm going,

1525
01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:46.430
I'm always defensively aware but I'm going full offense.

1526
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:50.310
But if I'm rolling with a guy like a Marcella Garcia is all defense.
Yeah.

1527
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:53.120
It's all like just,

1528
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.780
it's all like trying to hold someone off and work.

1529
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.730
Like if you knew that you were going to be a working against a guy like Marcella

1530
01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:01.080
Garcia and you had like months to prepare,

1531
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:04.740
I would just bench press and do everything about pushing away.

1532
01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.440
Everything is pushing away reps and pushing away,

1533
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:09.790
but eventually you're gonna fuck up.
You know,
there's,

1534
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:15.260
it's like the good analogy also is debating because if you debate the average

1535
01:30:16.831 --> 01:30:19.440
person who has a neurological standpoint on something,

1536
01:30:19.441 --> 01:30:22.340
like I've watched you debate many people,
uh,

1537
01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:25.110
when it comes to religion and things along those lines.

1538
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:29.160
And when you have the tools in place,
those tools being logic,

1539
01:30:29.161 --> 01:30:33.210
reason and defined arguments about different variables.

1540
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:38.400
And then the other person doesn't and they have emotions and a religious

1541
01:30:38.401 --> 01:30:42.830
ideology on their side.
And it just,
uh,
overconfidence,
just,

1542
01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:47.190
it's just having this a ridiculous idea that they're right and they're,

1543
01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.020
they're gonna win and they go in there and they just get tied up like so quickly

1544
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:54.240
are arguments get destroyed and they,
they,

1545
01:30:54.241 --> 01:30:57.720
you see them get flustered and you see their words come out,

1546
01:30:57.721 --> 01:31:01.800
I'll conky and they get their heartbeat raises.
And I love of what,

1547
01:31:01.801 --> 01:31:05.460
there's one a debate that you did with,
uh,
I don't remember the gentleman's name,

1548
01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:09.610
but he was a rabbi and a,
you were like David Wolpe.
Yes.

1549
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:14.070
And he got so dramatic and the way he was talking,

1550
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:18.720
which made it more ridiculous because you have this very calm,

1551
01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:22.320
very flat way of expressing yourself,

1552
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:27.180
which makes anyone who's super emotional and super like dramatic,

1553
01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:31.020
seem preposterous.
It seems you seem more ridiculous cause you're all,

1554
01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:35.910
and what God has said to us and the word of God and all this like,

1555
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.890
and then you know,
you're like,
well that's not exactly the fact that,

1556
01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:40.530
what the reality is this and this and that.

1557
01:31:40.531 --> 01:31:41.820
And this is what we know about neuroscience.

1558
01:31:41.821 --> 01:31:45.090
This we know about life and this is it.
Just because of that doesn't mean this.

1559
01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:49.390
And you see the,
uh,
they're drowning,
drowning,

1560
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:53.070
except they don't necessarily know they're drowning.
And the crucial difference.

1561
01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.940
And the one reason why Jujitsu is so satisfying is that there's no,

1562
01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.070
there's no tap out in a debate.
I mean,
say that you're never,

1563
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.560
<v 3>they're never forced to acknowledge,
right.
They lost the point.
That's so true.</v>

1564
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:07.980
No matter how obvious it becomes to the audience or do you,
and,
and um,

1565
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:10.450
it actually,
there's one thing that's kind of insidious about debates,

1566
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:13.210
which I'm sorry,
actually terrible in politics.

1567
01:32:13.211 --> 01:32:18.211
I hate it when I see this and political debates where laughter is a surrogate

1568
01:32:19.691 --> 01:32:23.530
for tap out.
And so that if you can get a big laugh in a debate,

1569
01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:26.680
no matter how terrible your platform is as a politician,

1570
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:29.710
no matter how wrong you are on the,
on the facts,
if you,

1571
01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.840
if you can get a big laugh line,
you know,
you know,
you,

1572
01:32:31.841 --> 01:32:35.920
you know you or know Jack Kennedy,
right,
right.
That is,

1573
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:37.840
that's all that anyone cares about at the end.

1574
01:32:37.841 --> 01:32:42.080
And it's like the standup standup comic wins the debate.
Um,

1575
01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:46.780
certainly politically and it's even,
it's even true in,
in,
um,
in other contexts.

1576
01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:51.310
So it's a politically,
it's everything.
It's everything.
Jack Kennedy line was,

1577
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:55.450
what was that 88 or something like that?
When was that?
What year was that?

1578
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.950
That's Dan Quayle,
right.
Dan Quayle.
And for these,
these questions,

1579
01:33:00.190 --> 01:33:05.080
who is the senator?
Who's debating?
Lloyd Benson?
Yes.
Yeah.

1580
01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:09.640
I knew Jack and he set them up,
man.
It was like Jab,
Jab,
overhand.

1581
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:13.540
Right?
I knew Jackie Kennedy and Jack Kennedy was a friend.

1582
01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:17.110
You are no check Canada.
And the whole lot is like,
oh shit.

1583
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:21.850
You compared yourself to a dead guy who was like the greatest president ever who

1584
01:33:21.851 --> 01:33:25.870
was shot in this national scandal and the,
I mean,
the whole,

1585
01:33:25.871 --> 01:33:27.640
all the buildup to it.
I mean,

1586
01:33:27.641 --> 01:33:30.820
it wasn't even like he was comparing himself to Theodore Roosevelt or someone

1587
01:33:30.821 --> 01:33:34.120
else who was dead,
you know,
Jack Kennedy a fuck man.

1588
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.470
It was just checkmate.
Like he could never have come back from that.

1589
01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:43.180
But it's true.
I mean,
in that gate is right here.
In that case,
we were,
you know,

1590
01:33:43.181 --> 01:33:47.320
I was certainly on the side of,
uh,
you know,
certainly against coil there.

1591
01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:52.600
But,
um,
you see it happen in,
in cases where it's,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

1592
01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:55.360
the losing party,
the party who is on the,

1593
01:33:55.361 --> 01:33:59.620
on the wrong end at the laugh is really the one who was making the most sense in

1594
01:33:59.621 --> 01:34:01.600
the debate.
They just,
you know,
you,

1595
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:04.690
you just know that that debate was a disaster for the specialty.

1596
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:07.900
If the audience is stacked and you've got a bunch of religious people in the

1597
01:34:07.901 --> 01:34:09.640
audience say,
yeah,
why don't you just tell,

1598
01:34:09.641 --> 01:34:12.150
tell that to God when you see him at the Purlin.

1599
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:19.450
Yeah,
I think that that can definitely,
well it's also people are looking,

1600
01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:23.440
they're looking for a result and they can decide that that result is correct.

1601
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:26.890
You know,
he could through sheer force of will and through cognitive dissonance,

1602
01:34:26.891 --> 01:34:30.250
the all the people in the audience refusing to recognize the actual thing that's

1603
01:34:30.251 --> 01:34:34.440
being debated but rather not a point that they get to express themselves.
Well,

1604
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:38.950
this is,
I agree with him.
Jesus doesn't want us Molech queers marry each other,

1605
01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:39.970
you know,

1606
01:34:39.970 --> 01:34:44.970
and they just hoot and Holler and all that loud noise in that one room.

1607
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:48.880
Well that's what's crucial about laughter.
Um,

1608
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:52.600
it's a really only laughter and applause are the only moments where,

1609
01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:54.430
you know,

1610
01:34:55.210 --> 01:34:58.850
as a member of the audience that everyone's the same page because that's the

1611
01:34:58.851 --> 01:35:02.000
moment of when everyone helplessly breaks into a laugh.
I mean,

1612
01:35:02.010 --> 01:35:06.890
this is you as a comic.
This is,
this is the,
this is your career,

1613
01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:10.550
you know,
provoking these moments.
But that as it like as a public speaker.
I,

1614
01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:12.410
it's interesting,
you know,
I don't,
you know,

1615
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:14.420
put a lot of laugh lines in my lectures,

1616
01:35:14.421 --> 01:35:19.421
but what I recognize that if you go long enough without having a laugh line in a

1617
01:35:21.141 --> 01:35:26.120
lecture,
you sort of lose the sense of that everyone is with you.

1618
01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.760
Cause it's just silence.
Right.

1619
01:35:27.761 --> 01:35:31.560
So I'm talking for 20 minutes and I'm hoping people are with it.
I hope,

1620
01:35:31.561 --> 01:35:35.180
I'm hoping they're finding this interesting.
I'm hoping there's,
I'm making sense,

1621
01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:40.540
but it's only the next time they laugh that truly reassures me that for that

1622
01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:44.510
moment I have the entire room and that's,
and that's so it's,
it's a,
um,

1623
01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:45.730
it's interesting.

1624
01:35:45.730 --> 01:35:50.420
<v 0>Yeah.
Public speaking is a very unique art form.
Uh,</v>

1625
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:53.000
public speaking in terms of like lectures,

1626
01:35:53.001 --> 01:35:57.740
when you see people give public talks about a book that they have,
like the,

1627
01:35:57.741 --> 01:36:00.380
the,
the ability to hold people's attention.

1628
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:05.540
It's like there has to be something that you're doing some dramatic moment.

1629
01:36:05.541 --> 01:36:08.600
Either you have to have a certain amount of charisma or you have to have a

1630
01:36:08.601 --> 01:36:10.070
certain sense of humor.

1631
01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:15.220
You have to have something to be able to sort of glue the whole thing together.

1632
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.611
You know,

1633
01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:21.290
it's hard to listen to someone like lectures that like boring professors give.

1634
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.300
I remember like being in class,
listening to some of those lectures and 10,

1635
01:36:26.301 --> 01:36:30.170
15 minutes in I'm checked out.
I mean I'm fucking thinking about my laundry.

1636
01:36:30.171 --> 01:36:33.170
I got to do and I'm sort of paying attention cause I have to,

1637
01:36:33.171 --> 01:36:36.320
but I'm bored as fuck.
But if the guy was humorous,

1638
01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.450
like I remember I saw a debate once between,
uh,
a member of the moral majority.

1639
01:36:41.451 --> 01:36:44.150
Do you remember the moral majority and Barney frank,

1640
01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:46.010
who was an openly gay back then,

1641
01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:51.010
this was when I was in high school and a Barney frank was a humorous and uh,

1642
01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.000
he was,
he was so good at,
he knew how to publicly speak and uh,

1643
01:36:56.001 --> 01:36:59.690
it was in a small auditorium and Newton south high school in like 1984 or

1644
01:36:59.691 --> 01:37:01.550
something like that.
And Barney fry,

1645
01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.540
he was mocking this guy with an American flag on his lapel and what he was

1646
01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:06.374
trying to,

1647
01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.560
he was essentially setting up with this guy was trying to project to you like,

1648
01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.140
this is who he really is.
This is what he's trying to protect.
Like he's like,

1649
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:17.150
it's wearing a superhero outfit.
Like,
oh,

1650
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:20.720
he's so concerned about the morality of America,
but what he,

1651
01:37:20.721 --> 01:37:23.180
what he doesn't understand is this.
And I think that you,

1652
01:37:23.181 --> 01:37:24.920
people are smart enough to realize that.

1653
01:37:24.921 --> 01:37:29.360
And he was funny and I remember like listening to one guy talk and it was like

1654
01:37:29.361 --> 01:37:33.870
sanctimonious and fucking boring.
And it's just,
it's just,

1655
01:37:33.871 --> 01:37:36.290
it didn't know how to talk very well.
And the other guy,

1656
01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.580
even though it was just two people's opinions,
it was more pleasant to listen to.

1657
01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.250
It was more entertaining.
So he was better at it

1658
01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.540
<v 3>because of that.
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah,
the days of,
um,</v>

1659
01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.760
being able to get far without being able to speak well in public or are behind

1660
01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.210
us.
I think,
and it's,
it's interesting to,

1661
01:37:57.370 --> 01:38:00.000
this is something that I discovered a few years ago,

1662
01:38:00.001 --> 01:38:03.420
I actually blogged about this.
Um,
uh,

1663
01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:08.660
Jefferson had a morbid fear of public speaking and gave exactly two speeches,

1664
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:15.411
two state of the unions in his two terms as president and just read them in a,

1665
01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:21.110
in a kind of crushed monotone cause he was so terrified.

1666
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:26.100
Uh,
and that was,
that was it.
We could have heard those.
Yeah.
I'm going to put,

1667
01:38:26.101 --> 01:38:27.090
I'm sure they were terrible.
They get,

1668
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:29.790
they were barely a bit that for people at the time,
uh,

1669
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:32.370
reported that you could barely hear what he was saying and he's just hoarders of

1670
01:38:32.371 --> 01:38:34.320
his.
Yeah.
And they,
and he just,
he just,
he was,

1671
01:38:34.321 --> 01:38:37.120
and he would just walk like a condemned man to the scaffold,
you know,

1672
01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:40.080
when he had to give these speeches and he avoided it because he,

1673
01:38:40.090 --> 01:38:42.900
he was so uncomfortable doing it,
but he could avoid it.

1674
01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:45.750
Can you imagine being the president United States now and not feeling

1675
01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:48.470
comfortable getting Haskell?
It's impossible.
Well,

1676
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.920
fully on the force of his writing,
he had the influence he had.

1677
01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:56.190
<v 0>Isn't it fascinating too that you need not just to be able to speak well</v>

1678
01:38:56.191 --> 01:38:56.821
publicly,

1679
01:38:56.821 --> 01:39:00.540
but you need to have a certain style of communication that where you address

1680
01:39:00.541 --> 01:39:03.060
large numbers of people.
It's completely unnatural.

1681
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:06.990
Like Obama has the long pauses in this very,

1682
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:11.310
there's just something about the way talks where,
you know,

1683
01:39:11.311 --> 01:39:14.040
if someone was talking to you in your home in that same way,

1684
01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:15.630
you would think they are absolutely insane.

1685
01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:18.270
Like if you had someone over your house and you're having a conversation with

1686
01:39:18.271 --> 01:39:21.210
them and they spoke the way Obama speaks when he's addressing the nation,

1687
01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:23.970
he would go,
well,
I got a fucking crazy person in my house.

1688
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:25.920
Like even if they were just addressing your family,

1689
01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:30.690
if it was just one person standing at the table and he said,
hey Brock,
would you,

1690
01:39:30.691 --> 01:39:35.210
uh,
would you,
uh,
you know,
give us thanks for this meal that were about this half.

1691
01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.490
He gave this presidential type speech.

1692
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.880
The way he's communicating with these long pauses and weird affectations of his

1693
01:39:44.131 --> 01:39:47.640
voice.
He'd be like,
who is this fucking guy?
But he's,
he's

1694
01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:51.040
<v 3>not as bad as w where it really gets crazy for me.
It's when it,</v>

1695
01:39:51.210 --> 01:39:55.560
it becomes a full or a tutorial or rhetorical performance.
I mean,
someone like,

1696
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:59.190
you know,
Martin Luther King junior or you know,
or a a,
a preacher,

1697
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:03.570
somebody who's just going for it in the Stentorian way of just,

1698
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:06.960
it's going to be big and it's going to be dramatic and I'm going to make you
cry.

1699
01:40:06.961 --> 01:40:11.040
And,
and now obviously it's incredibly effective.
You know,
you see,
you know,

1700
01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:15.450
MLK speeches and that's something very powerful is going on there and he's

1701
01:40:15.451 --> 01:40:20.130
standing in front of whatever it was,
400,000 people.
Um,

1702
01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:22.980
so it's a big moment and you wouldn't,

1703
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:27.900
it wouldn't be the same if he was just conversational,
but,
um,

1704
01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:32.370
you know,
it,
it begins to look kind of Hitlarian.
I mean,

1705
01:40:32.371 --> 01:40:36.390
Hitler was the ultimate example of this,
to look at Hitler,
give a speech.

1706
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:41.490
I don't know how anyone thought the guy was saying.
I mean,
it just,
it looks,

1707
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:45.900
it's so,
so far from the,
the,
the normal,

1708
01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:50.250
the norms of human conversation that it's just,
it,

1709
01:40:50.251 --> 01:40:53.010
it seems pathological to me.
I mean,
I don't know German.
I don't,

1710
01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.110
I don't know exactly.
So I'm not,
when I watch him speak,
I'm,
you know,

1711
01:40:56.111 --> 01:40:59.050
reading the subtitles and I'm getting his vibe and there's,

1712
01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:03.640
I'm not getting the exact exactly what a German would have gotten,
but I don't,

1713
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:08.620
it's,
it's,
it's just,
I'm not comfortable there.
There's something,
um,

1714
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.740
that there's,

1715
01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:15.670
there's a dishonesty to the performance there that I feel like no matter how,

1716
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.980
how,
no matter what the content,
like the p one,

1717
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.470
the performance variable becomes,
I frankly get this,

1718
01:41:23.471 --> 01:41:26.950
even with people like MLK where it's,
it's,
it's,

1719
01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.500
I mean I recognize that the words are beautiful.

1720
01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:31.810
I recognized that he's delivering it well,

1721
01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:37.380
but there's a subtle dishonesty to the communication because it is a

1722
01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:41.650
performance.
It's not,
and I'm not coming,
you know,
as a speaker,
I,
you know,

1723
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:46.480
I tried to speak,
and this is one reason why I would never be a great speaker,

1724
01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:51.160
but I try to be as conversational as possible.
I just cause,

1725
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:55.480
cause internally to,
to inhabit it.
I,

1726
01:41:55.810 --> 01:42:00.550
I'm only comfortable feeling like I'm actually talking to a person.
So if,

1727
01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.390
if it's,
if it's just you or if it's a thousand people,
I mean maybe my,

1728
01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:09.220
maybe that situation is going to dictate a subtle changes in the way I speak,

1729
01:42:09.221 --> 01:42:13.690
but it's going to be going to be pretty close in terms of how I speak.

1730
01:42:13.691 --> 01:42:18.160
And so it's,
um,
cause I just can't,
the moment I started to,
you know,

1731
01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:23.230
ape Paraclese,
you know,
I begin to feel dishonest and yeah,

1732
01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:27.730
it's weird because it's so effective.
You know,
Jay Leno,

1733
01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:31.300
when he would a practice his monologue for the tonight show,

1734
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:35.080
he would go to the comedy and Magic Club every Sunday night.
And uh,

1735
01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:36.940
it was like a regular show he would do there.

1736
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.630
And on Sunday night when you would go to the comedy magic club and read these,

1737
01:42:40.631 --> 01:42:43.270
uh,
bits,
then he would try out for the weeks monologue.

1738
01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:47.740
He would do them dead like monotone.
The reason why I did it,
he goes,

1739
01:42:47.741 --> 01:42:52.450
I didn't want to add any extra pizzazz to the jokes to sell them.
He goes,

1740
01:42:52.451 --> 01:42:54.320
I just want to know whether they stood on their own right.

1741
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:58.720
And that was how we found out whether or not it was an actual funny idea or

1742
01:42:58.721 --> 01:43:02.610
whether or not it was just his master showmanship ability that was getting it

1743
01:43:02.611 --> 01:43:03.340
across.

1744
01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:07.540
And I think that's what you get when you get a Hitler or a Martin Luther King is

1745
01:43:07.541 --> 01:43:09.490
like,
it's not just their words,

1746
01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:13.060
it's just there's an energy behind them that's captivating,

1747
01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:17.200
that can be in the terms of like a guy like Martin Luther King.

1748
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.990
It can enhance the speech to the point where I have a dream.

1749
01:43:19.991 --> 01:43:22.000
It's like one of the greatest speeches in human history.

1750
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:25.400
And one of the reasons why it's such a great speech is not just because he said

1751
01:43:25.401 --> 01:43:28.090
it,
but imagine if the same speech was read by Noam Chomsky,

1752
01:43:28.091 --> 01:43:30.820
you'd fucking fall asleep halfway into it,
you know?
Yeah.
You know,
there's,

1753
01:43:30.850 --> 01:43:35.110
there's no question something would be lost,
but I s part of it is,
uh,

1754
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.490
I know part of it is the context.
I mean,
just,

1755
01:43:38.491 --> 01:43:42.910
just being in front of an audience that large and a live audience and just the

1756
01:43:42.911 --> 01:43:46.090
necessity of having to have your,
even though,
even though you're miked,

1757
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:49.300
there's the sense that your voice,
it needs to carry.
You know,

1758
01:43:49.301 --> 01:43:51.070
even though it's being aided by a mic,
he's,

1759
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.740
it's appropriate to be belting it out over,
over the heads of the audience.

1760
01:43:54.741 --> 01:43:58.840
Whereas if,
if you were just in a room with 10 people,
you know,
blasting,

1761
01:43:58.850 --> 01:44:01.250
I have a dream that loud would just be,
you'd be,

1762
01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:05.810
you'd be carted off.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
If you were right here,

1763
01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:10.640
just you and I are in a podcast started breaking out in that loud time for naked

1764
01:44:10.641 --> 01:44:13.310
choke guys,
nuts call the cops.

1765
01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:16.910
Kennison who started out as a reverend,
uh,

1766
01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:21.450
used to break out into it on stage sometimes as a part of his performance that

1767
01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:22.700
he would,
uh,
he would say,

1768
01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:27.050
<v 0>then they asked me,
Sam,
have you had to do it?
If you had to go back,</v>

1769
01:44:27.230 --> 01:44:31.640
have you had to teach the word of God?
Could you do it?
Do you have it in you?

1770
01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:33.650
It's the Holy Spirit alive.

1771
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:37.190
And he would go into this thing and it was so compelling.
They're just like,

1772
01:44:37.191 --> 01:44:39.080
whatever it is about human beings.

1773
01:44:39.081 --> 01:44:43.910
When we see someone who speaks with his dynamic power,
this passion,

1774
01:44:43.911 --> 01:44:47.430
this ability to project words,
it's so,
it's so impressive.
Yeah.

1775
01:44:47.530 --> 01:44:49.970
It's just because most of us can't do it or it's part of it,

1776
01:44:49.971 --> 01:44:53.900
I think in a part of it is,
there's just something about us that like,

1777
01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.290
like the reason why you can get hypnotized by a fucking watch swinging in front

1778
01:44:57.291 --> 01:45:01.050
of your face.
There's something about certain actions are either hypnotic,

1779
01:45:01.051 --> 01:45:05.480
certain patterns of speaking that are hypnotic,
oddly captivating.

1780
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:06.343
Oddly enough.

1781
01:45:06.970 --> 01:45:10.000
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
even just,
just eye contact.</v>

1782
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:13.260
This is something I write about briefly in the book.
It's a,
um,

1783
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:19.030
one thing you get in the spiritual world with gurus of various flavors is you

1784
01:45:19.031 --> 01:45:23.610
get this commitment to really intense eye contact.
Tom Cruise.
Yeah.
Oh,
sorry.

1785
01:45:23.670 --> 01:45:26.110
It was going to say about Tom Cruise when he talks to you.
He's like,
yeah,
well,

1786
01:45:26.111 --> 01:45:29.050
interesting sound.
It is a Scientology thing.
Yeah.

1787
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:32.350
Just locks up on you and you just want to believe him.

1788
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:37.510
But nobody's is incredibly intrusive and it's,
but it,
there,
I mean,
there,
there's,

1789
01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.530
there's every version of it.
There are people who are just non neurotic.

1790
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:45.520
They're not,
they don't feel any impulse to look away,
right?
They're not,

1791
01:45:45.521 --> 01:45:48.700
and they're not uncomfortable making silent eye contact with somebody.

1792
01:45:48.701 --> 01:45:49.000
They don't,

1793
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.270
they're not constantly throwing their words into the space because they're

1794
01:45:52.271 --> 01:45:54.670
uncomfortable.
And yet they're just,

1795
01:45:54.671 --> 01:45:56.590
they're just available and they're just looking at you and they're,

1796
01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:00.610
their attention is free because they're not,
they're not busy.

1797
01:46:00.610 --> 01:46:02.710
They're not worried that,
that,
you know,
the,

1798
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:05.570
about what you're thinking about them.
And they're just,
they're just so,

1799
01:46:05.571 --> 01:46:06.550
they're just presence.

1800
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:11.200
And these people can tend to make a highly,

1801
01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:15.880
unusually intense eye contact,
um,
which is to say,
you know,

1802
01:46:15.881 --> 01:46:19.420
completely unbroken eye contact.
And then there's,
you know,
psychopaths to do it.

1803
01:46:19.421 --> 01:46:22.240
And it's a real power game where it's just,
you know,
they're just,

1804
01:46:22.330 --> 01:46:26.480
they're not there.
They're running something.
Um,
uh,

1805
01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.250
they have a very different agenda,
but they're also comfortable,
you know,

1806
01:46:30.251 --> 01:46:34.140
I fucking you and,
and,
and just,
um,
uh,

1807
01:46:34.450 --> 01:46:37.960
doing it from a place of,
of aggression.
Uh,
but it's a,

1808
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:39.400
it was interesting when I first,

1809
01:46:39.401 --> 01:46:44.320
when I got into meditation and early on,
this is,
you know,

1810
01:46:44.321 --> 01:46:49.220
I was 20,
21 and got really into meditation.
And,
um,
uh,
this,

1811
01:46:49.221 --> 01:46:50.940
this is a period where I was doing a lot of psychedelics.

1812
01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:54.600
And one of the experiences you've probably had on psychedelics is the,

1813
01:46:54.810 --> 01:46:56.710
the amazing experience.

1814
01:46:56.711 --> 01:47:01.110
And just looking into somebody's eyes on acid or mushrooms and just having that

1815
01:47:01.710 --> 01:47:06.600
just open a kind of an inner landscape of profundity or seeming profundity where

1816
01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:07.021
you're just,
you know,

1817
01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:10.740
you can just be staring into someone's eyes silently for an eternity or what

1818
01:47:10.741 --> 01:47:14.480
seems like an eternity.
And,
um,

1819
01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:18.960
what often happens to people is that,
that after having experiences like this,

1820
01:47:18.961 --> 01:47:22.230
then looking into people's eyes can become a way of really,
uh,
of,

1821
01:47:22.231 --> 01:47:25.620
of kind of activating that state of mind where you,
you know,

1822
01:47:25.621 --> 01:47:30.240
you just being committed to looking into people's eyes and never look in a way

1823
01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:35.430
can be a way of sort of introducing that sort of liquid psychedelic experience,

1824
01:47:35.431 --> 01:47:40.140
you know,
interpersonally.
And I was sort of into that to,
to uh,
uh,

1825
01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:45.210
uh,
for a while and um,
uh,
so I was kind of walking through life,

1826
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:50.270
you know,
like,
like guess Tom Cruise does basically.
Yeah,
just,
just like,

1827
01:47:50.610 --> 01:47:53.520
exactly.
Just never just like,
oh,
I'm just going to go with it.
You,

1828
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:56.370
let's see where this goes and I'm just never going to look away from anyone ever

1829
01:47:56.371 --> 01:48:00.370
again.
And you,
you get,
you start having it's,

1830
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:03.940
it's intrusive and I stopped doing it.
You,

1831
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.820
you start having unusual experiences.

1832
01:48:05.821 --> 01:48:08.910
The first thing you do is you discover everyone else is doing that for whatever

1833
01:48:08.911 --> 01:48:12.120
reason.
So all of the psychopaths and the Scientologists and all,

1834
01:48:12.121 --> 01:48:13.680
everyone comes out of the woodwork because there,

1835
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:18.690
there's some number of people walking around earth at this moment who are

1836
01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.280
playing that game,
who are just all,

1837
01:48:20.281 --> 01:48:22.830
it's like you look into their eyes and it's just,

1838
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:26.490
I lock for as long as you're going to stay and you never,

1839
01:48:26.491 --> 01:48:27.510
they're never going to look away.

1840
01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:32.070
And so whether it's a Barista at Starbucks or whether it's just somebody who is,

1841
01:48:32.071 --> 01:48:35.850
you know,
50 feet across the room at a party and he make eye contact,

1842
01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:38.190
they're not going to be the first one to look away.

1843
01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:41.220
And so you get into these really weird encounters.
And I had this,

1844
01:48:41.221 --> 01:48:45.390
I remember this one party I went to where I was sitting,
sitting on a couch.

1845
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:48.340
I looked across the room and there was this guy looking at me and I

1846
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:52.560
probably,
you know,
40 feet between us.

1847
01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:56.790
And he looked at me and I looked at him and then it was just like war of the

1848
01:48:56.791 --> 01:49:01.710
warlocks,
you know,
it's like
neither of us were going to look away,
right.

1849
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:06.360
And it just be that.
And I was doing a lot of meditation and I was,
uh,
you know,

1850
01:49:06.361 --> 01:49:11.100
I had,
it was probably,
uh,
uh,
taking acid once a month,
you know,

1851
01:49:11.101 --> 01:49:14.640
so I was,
I was pretty tuned up for this kind of game where it's just like,
I,

1852
01:49:14.641 --> 01:49:18.810
you know,
I was not,
I had no problem making eye contact with some strange guy,

1853
01:49:18.811 --> 01:49:20.650
you know,
40 feet away.
Um,

1854
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:25.770
and after a certain point he jumped up and kind of raced over to me and,

1855
01:49:25.930 --> 01:49:29.730
you know,
we had a problem.
He's like,
what the fuck are you doing?
[inaudible] he,

1856
01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.340
there was like a real s so what I was doing was so intrusive,
you,
but he,

1857
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:38.160
he had his own game going because he,
you know,
he didn't look away.
Right.

1858
01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:41.160
He was available for it.
But in any case,

1859
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.280
when you walk through life like this,

1860
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.600
you discover that there are a lot of people doing this for,
for whatever reason.

1861
01:49:49.601 --> 01:49:52.080
And it's,
it's a,
you definitely have unusual

1862
01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:57.080
<v 0>counters with strangers.
A train.
Once when I was a kid,
um,</v>

1863
01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:00.750
I was probably like 16 or 17 years old and Boston and uh,

1864
01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:04.410
it was some guy and we were sitting across from each other and we looked,

1865
01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.350
looked at each other and,

1866
01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:09.870
and he looked at me and he gave me like a little extra look to get me to look

1867
01:50:09.871 --> 01:50:13.590
away like a little extra.
And I didn't.
And I was like,
what's going on here?

1868
01:50:13.770 --> 01:50:18.000
And for whatever reason I don't,
it wasn't like a,
a conscious practice.

1869
01:50:18.001 --> 01:50:19.620
I just decided I wasn't going to look away.

1870
01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:24.240
I just would act of defiance being a teenager and he progressively got more and

1871
01:50:24.241 --> 01:50:28.040
more angry.
And then my level of stress raised up to the point where like,

1872
01:50:28.230 --> 01:50:30.750
am I going to have to fight this whole motherfucker?
Like we're gonna,

1873
01:50:30.810 --> 01:50:33.330
we're gonna have to go at it because we're staring at each other.

1874
01:50:33.570 --> 01:50:35.490
And then finally something happened.
One of us broke,

1875
01:50:35.491 --> 01:50:36.900
but we didn't have a confrontation.

1876
01:50:37.110 --> 01:50:42.110
But I remember the intensity of this lock with me and this guy looking at each

1877
01:50:42.151 --> 01:50:45.360
other and he just fucking look like,
fuck,
are you looking at,

1878
01:50:46.050 --> 01:50:48.230
I don't remember how it resolved,
but it did.
There was no,

1879
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:50.070
there was no communication,
there was nothing.

1880
01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:54.510
But I remember very specifically thinking like,
this is so weird.

1881
01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:57.720
All we're doing this obviously some aggression being displayed here.

1882
01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.810
We're looking at each other in the eyes.
You,

1883
01:50:59.850 --> 01:51:01.350
Ms. Guy just don't want to turn away.

1884
01:51:01.351 --> 01:51:03.600
And I've decided I'm not going to turn away for whatever reason.

1885
01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:07.500
And here it's like a moment that I remember it to this day,
you know,

1886
01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:11.940
30 years later,
30 years later,
it's still in my head for no reason at all.

1887
01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:15.360
Just me in this fucking guy looking at each other on the train.

1888
01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:19.580
<v 3>It's,
um,
well it is very primal thing and it just is a,
it's a,</v>

1889
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:23.660
a biological transgression.
I mean,
we are,
you know,
we are primates,

1890
01:51:23.661 --> 01:51:26.990
so you do this to a macaque or you know,
any,

1891
01:51:26.991 --> 01:51:31.080
a monkey or Ayp and they,
they're not into it,
you know,
you know,

1892
01:51:31.090 --> 01:51:35.990
you're walking in.
Um,
I remember I was in Nepal a lot and there are these,

1893
01:51:35.991 --> 01:51:39.080
um,
uh,
um,

1894
01:51:39.110 --> 01:51:41.930
monkeys that basically now mug people.

1895
01:51:41.931 --> 01:51:46.250
They're so used to just showing up with their troop and demanding food that

1896
01:51:46.251 --> 01:51:47.050
you're just,
you,
you know,

1897
01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:50.600
you need to just throw your throw whatever you've got in your hand on the
ground.

1898
01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:55.340
But the,
um,
yeah,
mate,
you're making eye contact is a,
with a,
with a primate.

1899
01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.850
Um,
uh,
not even just a prime and a dog is a very,

1900
01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:01.790
it's an aggressive thing to do.
Uh,

1901
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:06.970
but it's interesting to be with someone who I studied with a lot of great

1902
01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:11.320
meditation masters who spent years in on retreat,

1903
01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:15.140
some of them decades on retreat doing nothing but meditate.

1904
01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:18.530
Some of them spending years meditating just on the compassion.

1905
01:52:18.610 --> 01:52:22.280
And when you're with someone like that you want,

1906
01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:26.810
then it's a very,
it's a very different vibe obviously.
And,
and the,
the,
um,

1907
01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:29.090
what you're getting from that,

1908
01:52:29.091 --> 01:52:34.091
that kind of eye contact is just a fundamental freedom from

1909
01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:41.030
kind of the neurotic self program that everyone's running.
I mean,
you can,

1910
01:52:41.031 --> 01:52:44.810
you can meet someone who you feel like is just there.

1911
01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.340
They don't have a problem.
They're not there.

1912
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:51.760
They wish you nothing but well and they're not,
um,

1913
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:54.680
they don't want anything from you.
You know,
they know that they're not,

1914
01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:57.320
they're not worried about what you think of them.

1915
01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:59.660
Their attention is free enough to just,

1916
01:53:00.110 --> 01:53:05.010
it just see what you need and what you want.
And it's a,
it's a very,
um,

1917
01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:06.980
it's a very freeing

1918
01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:14.270
thing to recognize in someone as being possible to just see someone who's just

1919
01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:20.080
dropped down to a level of non neurosis that you recognize you just haven't,

1920
01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:26.120
haven't experienced in yourself and their,
their,
their surrogates for this.

1921
01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.240
And there's this sort of their artifacts which are confusing to people because

1922
01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:33.860
now they say in any situation like this or power dynamics where when you are

1923
01:53:33.861 --> 01:53:37.910
just the,
when you're the guy on stage or you're the guy in the,

1924
01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:40.580
in the powerful role or you're the celebrity or whatever it is,

1925
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:45.970
you're kind of free to be non neurotic when everyone else is dancing around

1926
01:53:46.521 --> 01:53:48.510
being neurotic.
You know,
when someone's busy,

1927
01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:51.740
like trying to not be not spazz meeting Joe Rogan,

1928
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:56.230
you often are just free just to be a nice guy.
Who's who,

1929
01:53:56.231 --> 01:53:58.910
who um,
it's,
I mean,

1930
01:53:58.911 --> 01:54:01.580
I don't know if this is true of you and maybe it's not true all the time,

1931
01:54:01.581 --> 01:54:06.050
but it's,
it's,
you can be sort of empowered by a role,
uh,

1932
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:09.530
and it's kind of liberating and then you can find yourself in another context.

1933
01:54:09.531 --> 01:54:12.680
It's,
this goes to the first point we made about different states of self.

1934
01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:14.750
You can find yourself in another context where you're just trying,

1935
01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:18.520
you're not Joe Rogan the celebrity or you're not the guy who's on who was on

1936
01:54:18.521 --> 01:54:19.160
stage.

1937
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:21.410
You're just someone trying to get something done with somebody else who's not

1938
01:54:21.411 --> 01:54:22.250
taking you seriously.

1939
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:27.020
And you can feel all of your sort of normal level of neurosis kick in cause

1940
01:54:27.021 --> 01:54:28.490
you're not empowered in that situation.

1941
01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:32.870
There's nothing about the frame around the situation that is making you the

1942
01:54:32.871 --> 01:54:36.950
center of attention or making anyone defer to what you were saying or,

1943
01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:41.300
um,
and so contexts can,
I mean,
you can,

1944
01:54:41.301 --> 01:54:45.860
you can prop up a totally fake guru who has no skills at all.

1945
01:54:45.861 --> 01:54:49.850
Who's got who,
who's just,
and this experiment has been done,

1946
01:54:49.851 --> 01:54:54.230
I think I'm James Randy just created a fake guru,

1947
01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:56.150
I think it was in Australia and New Zealand.

1948
01:54:56.151 --> 01:55:01.151
He got some suitably mysterious looking Latin guy and called him the amazing

1949
01:55:03.501 --> 01:55:08.200
whatever and set him up as a,
a fully enlightened,
you know,

1950
01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:12.920
man from,
you know,
the Andes or whatever,
who had spent 20 years in a cave and,

1951
01:55:12.921 --> 01:55:16.940
and now it was going to deliver his wisdom to the world.
And they put out,

1952
01:55:16.941 --> 01:55:18.980
you know,
put up ads and they convene,
you know,

1953
01:55:18.981 --> 01:55:22.520
500 people and they gave this guy in earpiece and they were feeding him lines,

1954
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:24.170
uh,
and every,
you know,
he,

1955
01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:28.520
he transformed every bit about his life and that room to some degree.

1956
01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:29.540
And it was actually a documentary.

1957
01:55:29.541 --> 01:55:33.380
This Kumari I don't know if it's all US hilarious.
Is that on the same guy?
No,

1958
01:55:33.381 --> 01:55:35.960
different guy.
Different Guy,
but same,
same thought experiment.

1959
01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:39.410
What is it called again?
Komara yeah,
well worth seeing.

1960
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:41.900
It's hearing great things about it.
It's one of those things,

1961
01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:43.980
it's always on my to list and I never get

1962
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.160
<v 0>around to,
yeah,
that was hilarious.
The guy does a great job because he's,</v>

1963
01:55:47.161 --> 01:55:50.340
he's Indian and he,
he,
he speaks perfect English,
you know,
he just,

1964
01:55:50.341 --> 01:55:54.650
he just lays it down.
Yeah,
it's awesome.
Well this is also the,
the,

1965
01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:59.190
the sexual attraction thing.
The eye contact,
that context.

1966
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:03.240
Whereas you can't make eye contact with a woman like that and just lock eyes

1967
01:56:03.241 --> 01:56:06.480
with her without her thinking you want to have sex with her or was she locks

1968
01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:09.960
eyes with you without her thinking that you want to have or you know,

1969
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.823
the opposite.
Right.

1970
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:15.600
When that it's only in a gay sense w with two men,

1971
01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.290
you know,
like the,

1972
01:56:17.890 --> 01:56:21.840
the thing about looking at someone like it's almost like you're giving them the

1973
01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:24.990
green light.
Like,
I'm interested in you,
I'm looking at you,

1974
01:56:24.991 --> 01:56:28.800
I'm interested in you or I'm threatening you or I am challenging.

1975
01:56:28.801 --> 01:56:31.290
You are your position of dominance or whatever the fuck it is.

1976
01:56:31.291 --> 01:56:34.680
When you're looking locking eyes,
it's very different when it's intersexual.

1977
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:38.930
When it's male to female.
Well it can,
it can be just as intrusive.
Yes.
Yeah.

1978
01:56:39.210 --> 01:56:43.260
More so because especially male to woman,
you know,

1979
01:56:43.261 --> 01:56:48.070
because of a of a guy is locking eyes with another guy.
It's weird,
but it's,

1980
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:51.820
it's not like,
Oh God,
this guy has got to fuck me.
You know,

1981
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:56.580
between two guys,
you get that monkey dance of,
you know,
what are you looking at?

1982
01:56:56.581 --> 01:56:57.040
What are you looking at?

1983
01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.570
<v 3>Then it becomes,
do we have to fight kind of.
Whereas with a man to woman,</v>

1984
01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:03.880
it's just,
it's intrusive.

1985
01:57:03.881 --> 01:57:08.500
I think of the guy is not picking up whatever cues of disinterest or,
you know,

1986
01:57:08.501 --> 01:57:13.450
the boundary setting are there and he's just staring and that's just,

1987
01:57:13.451 --> 01:57:17.380
you know,
it's just uncomfortable given,
uh,
given that,
uh,
you know,

1988
01:57:17.381 --> 01:57:22.030
women are the targets of,
of,
uh,
sexual violence and just,
you know,
harassment.

1989
01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:25.000
So freewill.

1990
01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:28.420
<v 0>Yeah.
Let's get you have to get to,
because we only have an hour left.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

1991
01:57:29.630 --> 01:57:34.510
Um,
this is something that is perplexing,
confusing,

1992
01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:38.400
hotly debated is their free will and you will,
we will

1993
01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.650
<v 3>probably say no.
Yeah,</v>

1994
01:57:40.651 --> 01:57:45.210
I have said no much to the consternation of many a certain people,

1995
01:57:45.211 --> 01:57:50.000
a philosophers like Dan Dennett who,
who,
um,
I collided with on this issue.
Uh,

1996
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:53.810
even though,
um,
it didn't have to be as,

1997
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:58.860
as unpleasant as it turned out to be.
How did,
why was it unpleasant?
Well,
what he,

1998
01:57:58.861 --> 01:58:02.120
yeah,
I mean,
what happened is I,
so I wrote this very short book freewill,
uh,

1999
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:06.540
which was actually if there was a short section in my book,

2000
01:58:06.541 --> 01:58:10.200
the moral landscape,
which in which I laid out my,

2001
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:15.360
my argument against free will and it got so much attention and people found it

2002
01:58:15.361 --> 01:58:18.980
so interesting and,
and disturbing and um,

2003
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.420
it was clearly just one.
It would just,
you know,
I mean,

2004
01:58:21.421 --> 01:58:23.160
it might've been only 10 pages in the book,

2005
01:58:23.161 --> 01:58:25.890
but it was something that just people wanted more of.

2006
01:58:25.891 --> 01:58:29.280
And so what I did is I took those 10 pages and I could blew them up into a

2007
01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:32.850
hundred page but still very short book that you could read in an hour,

2008
01:58:32.850 --> 01:58:36.300
an hour and a half and published it as,
as a freewill.

2009
01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:37.890
And then Dan Dennett,

2010
01:58:37.891 --> 01:58:42.891
who is a very well known and very smart philosopher who's a colleague and friend

2011
01:58:45.011 --> 01:58:48.790
of mine and,
and you know,
comrade in arms or on the whole religion issue.

2012
01:58:48.791 --> 01:58:49.710
He and I have a,

2013
01:58:49.711 --> 01:58:53.950
along with Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens have often been talked about

2014
01:58:53.951 --> 01:58:58.670
in the same sentence as,
you know,
the four horsemen,
uh,
you know,
or the,

2015
01:58:58.870 --> 01:59:03.870
the,
the new atheists.
And,
and so we've been,
you know,
we are,
we are,

2016
01:59:03.871 --> 01:59:05.440
we are aligned on many,

2017
01:59:05.441 --> 01:59:09.040
many questions and certainly virtually all the questions related to the

2018
01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:13.030
collision between science and religion knew he,
he and I make the same noises on,

2019
01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:15.960
um,
and,
but free,

2020
01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:19.870
free will has always been a topic of his that he's,

2021
01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:23.920
he spent a lot of time on and he has a different take on it.

2022
01:59:23.921 --> 01:59:27.340
And it's a take that I'm really not a fan of.
And rather than,

2023
01:59:28.630 --> 01:59:29.463
uh,

2024
01:59:30.010 --> 01:59:34.840
rather than fully engage his view in,
in my book,

2025
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:38.650
uh,
because I actually,
the truth is I think his view on free will,
which has,

2026
01:59:38.651 --> 01:59:40.020
which is called compatible ism,

2027
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:44.720
is the argument that that free will is compatible with determinism.
It's,
it,

2028
01:59:44.721 --> 01:59:48.670
it's,
it's uh,
you don't have to,
even if,
even if we're in a,

2029
01:59:48.671 --> 01:59:53.050
in a universe where all causality is just,
we're kind of running like clockwork,

2030
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:58.040
uh,
we including every influence on the human brain and you know,

2031
01:59:58.060 --> 02:00:00.880
everything that's giving rise to thoughts and decisions and behavior of,

2032
02:00:00.881 --> 02:00:05.200
it's all just a machine that's kind of running out from the big bang to the heat

2033
02:00:05.201 --> 02:00:06.770
death of the universe.
Um,

2034
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:12.400
free will is compatible with that determinism.
And uh,

2035
02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:16.300
so then he,
he has a fleshed out his compatible ism.

2036
02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:19.270
He's not the only compatiblist,
but he's,
he's the most famous at this point.

2037
02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:22.420
He's fleshed out his compatible as a,
in a couple of books.

2038
02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:26.440
Now I think compatible ism is just actually,
it's just changing the subject.

2039
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:28.960
It's not,
it's redefining.
Freewill is something that is,

2040
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:33.190
that doesn't actually track what people think they have.
And in my view,

2041
02:00:33.191 --> 02:00:35.740
he's just not grappling with the illusion that,
that,

2042
02:00:35.890 --> 02:00:38.770
that can be penetrated here and it should be penetrated here.

2043
02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:44.020
So I didn't really want to engage his,
I mentioned his books.
I started,

2044
02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:47.050
I sort of,
I mentioned them only to kind of put them on the shelf as,
you know,

2045
02:00:47.051 --> 02:00:51.400
this is not,
this doesn't really get at the issue and this,
you know,

2046
02:00:51.401 --> 02:00:56.350
pissed him off frankly.
And He,
um,
he thought he was being,
you know,

2047
02:00:56.351 --> 02:00:59.580
in his defense,
I think he thought he was being very,
uh,

2048
02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:05.220
diplomatic and measured and a responsible in how he engaged me.

2049
02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:10.360
Uh,
and,
uh,
what he did is he wrote a review of a free,

2050
02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:13.420
I think he waited like a year,
but then he wrote a review of the book,

2051
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:18.400
which I published on my website.
But,
um,
it was a very hard hitting,

2052
02:01:18.850 --> 02:01:20.800
but in my view,

2053
02:01:20.890 --> 02:01:25.090
misguided and confused review of my book.

2054
02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.050
And so then I responded and,
you know,

2055
02:01:27.070 --> 02:01:29.560
he didn't like my response and then that was,
that's kind of where we left it.

2056
02:01:29.561 --> 02:01:34.270
But it was a kind of a very long review that,
that,
that,
um,
made a lot of noise,

2057
02:01:34.630 --> 02:01:36.490
uh,
to not much effect in,
in my view.

2058
02:01:36.491 --> 02:01:40.430
And then then I responded with a very long review where I hit back probably a

2059
02:01:40.431 --> 02:01:42.350
little too hard.
Um,

2060
02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.210
and it's one of those problems you get into when you're just writing rather than

2061
02:01:47.211 --> 02:01:49.790
having a conversation.
So what I,
what I urged him to do,

2062
02:01:49.791 --> 02:01:53.960
and this is the reason why my review came off as so frustrated and people can

2063
02:01:53.961 --> 02:01:57.500
read,
people can find all this on my blog,
my review,
I published his,

2064
02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:01.340
his review on my blog and an af,
I forget what the title was there,

2065
02:02:01.341 --> 02:02:05.860
but you'll can easily find on my blog.
And then my review,
it was called the,

2066
02:02:05.861 --> 02:02:07.820
the marionettes lament.
And then I,

2067
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:11.840
that was my response to his review of freewill.
Um,

2068
02:02:11.930 --> 02:02:14.300
but the problem was I told him,
I said,
Dan,
we should,

2069
02:02:14.301 --> 02:02:16.530
we should just have a public conversation about this.
This is the,

2070
02:02:16.570 --> 02:02:17.300
this is the old,

2071
02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:21.230
it's only in conversation that you can correct for somebody else's

2072
02:02:21.231 --> 02:02:22.820
misunderstandings in real time.

2073
02:02:22.821 --> 02:02:26.330
And you start to say something that is miss characterizing my view.
And I'll say,

2074
02:02:26.331 --> 02:02:28.940
no,
no,
that's not it.
Actually this.
And then,
and then you get,

2075
02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:33.080
you can keep getting back on track it more or less effortlessly.

2076
02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:35.360
But what happens is when you,
when you have these,

2077
02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.020
when you're writing and you're having these mutual,
you know,

2078
02:02:39.021 --> 02:02:43.010
3000 or 10,000 word volleys where I'm just going to lay it out,
what's,
you know,

2079
02:02:43.011 --> 02:02:47.240
what's totally wrong with your worldview.
And in the course of doing that,

2080
02:02:47.241 --> 02:02:52.100
I'm going to make 15 huge mistakes that,
you know,
you could have,

2081
02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.170
you could have corrected in real time.

2082
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:57.340
But now I'm committed to them because I wrote a page on each,
you know,
and then,

2083
02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:59.330
and then we just go back and forth.
And so that's,

2084
02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:04.360
so I really urged him to have a debate with me or a conversation and he didn't

2085
02:03:05.421 --> 02:03:09.230
want to do that.
And then,
um,
he,
uh,

2086
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:13.640
he wrote this review and I,
I said,
okay.

2087
02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:16.000
And he hadn't probably showed me the review before I put it,

2088
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:18.920
before he was going to publish,
it was gonna publish this,
publish it in a,

2089
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:23.940
on a website that was far more obscure than my blog.
Um,
which he did.
But I,
I,
I,

2090
02:03:24.210 --> 02:03:28.460
I co publish it on my blog,
but I said,
before you publish this,
just let me,

2091
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:32.630
let me make this a conversation.
Let me take this text and interrupt you.

2092
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:34.670
You know,
you,
you can say anything you want to say,

2093
02:03:34.671 --> 02:03:38.680
but let me just build in some mechanism where you can correct for it.

2094
02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:41.450
Cause like they're there 10 places here where you're misunderstanding me.

2095
02:03:41.451 --> 02:03:44.990
And so let me just let me turn this into a conversation.
And it was no,
go there.

2096
02:03:44.991 --> 02:03:49.670
And so then he's,
he just finally published it and I said,
okay,
well,
fine.

2097
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:55.160
Um,
so in any case,
people can,
can witness the collision.
They're on my blog.

2098
02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:59.750
But the,
the basic case against freewill is this,
it's two fold.

2099
02:03:59.751 --> 02:04:02.690
One is that,
and again,
it's the,
it's the,

2100
02:04:02.691 --> 02:04:04.730
it's the OBC verse of this sense of self.
It's the,

2101
02:04:04.731 --> 02:04:06.200
as the other side of the coin where you,

2102
02:04:06.650 --> 02:04:09.570
you feel like you're a thinker of thoughts,
you feel like you're the,
the,

2103
02:04:09.571 --> 02:04:13.850
the author of intentions,
you feel like you are a subject and

2104
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:20.410
commensurate with that feeling is the sense that you are in a position to do

2105
02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:25.060
what it is you do to decide to do.

2106
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:28.640
I can decide to lift my left hand or I can decide to lift my right hand and I

2107
02:04:28.641 --> 02:04:30.080
can deliberate between the two.

2108
02:04:30.081 --> 02:04:33.860
And I can have reasons for one or reasons for the other.
And um,

2109
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:38.730
I'm in the driver's seat,
I really am.
And then you tea and,
and so that's,

2110
02:04:38.731 --> 02:04:40.690
that's where everyone's starting.
Uh,

2111
02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.120
the problem with that is objectively,

2112
02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:49.110
we know that everything that you're consciously aware of all your thoughts and

2113
02:04:49.111 --> 02:04:52.840
your intentions and your impulses and your impulses to,

2114
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:56.820
to resist those impulses.
I mean,
well,
however,
however your,

2115
02:04:56.821 --> 02:04:57.960
whatever's coming up for you,

2116
02:04:58.410 --> 02:05:03.410
we know that's all proceeded by events in your nervous system of which you're

2117
02:05:03.421 --> 02:05:06.420
not aware in which you didn't create.
And the,

2118
02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:08.760
and the state of your brain in this moment,

2119
02:05:08.761 --> 02:05:13.761
it's in every sense is the product of variables that you are not responsible

2120
02:05:14.281 --> 02:05:17.220
for.
You didn't pick your parents,
you didn't pick your jeans,

2121
02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:18.990
you didn't sculpt your jeans,

2122
02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:24.020
you didn't pick the environment in which your genome was going to be expressed.

2123
02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:29.420
You didn't pick the way that your interaction with the world and other people

2124
02:05:29.821 --> 02:05:33.690
sculpted the micro structure of your brain.
So as to give you the brand new,

2125
02:05:33.691 --> 02:05:38.691
have you didn't pick the number of receptors you've ha have of every type.

2126
02:05:38.851 --> 02:05:41.640
But every sin APPS,
he didn't pick all the charges and eh,

2127
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:45.810
that are currently in place in your brain at this moment.
You haven't,

2128
02:05:45.811 --> 02:05:49.410
you haven't created your neurophysiology and yet your neurophysiology is going

2129
02:05:49.411 --> 02:05:54.411
to give rise to every next thought and intention that shows up for you.

2130
02:05:55.050 --> 02:05:58.740
And so,
so,
and we know that if you do an experiment,

2131
02:05:58.770 --> 02:06:03.600
like you put someone in a,
in a,
uh,
uh,
neuro imaging device,

2132
02:06:03.601 --> 02:06:07.730
whether it's,
whether it's EEG or whether it's a MRI or,
um,

2133
02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:12.240
and you image there their neural activity in real time.

2134
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:17.250
And you have a very simple choice between pushing the left button or pushing the

2135
02:06:17.251 --> 02:06:18.084
right button.

2136
02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:23.570
We can predict before the person is aware of having committed to right or left,

2137
02:06:24.630 --> 02:06:27.270
whether they're going to go right or left.
And we know that that's,

2138
02:06:27.271 --> 02:06:30.960
that ability to predict is only going to become more fine grain.
So that,

2139
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:34.620
so that if you take away as,
and again,

2140
02:06:34.621 --> 02:06:38.730
someone like Dan Dennett has a story about why this doesn't matter,
right?
But,
um,

2141
02:06:38.850 --> 02:06:42.510
and the truth is it actually doesn't matter because even if we couldn't predict

2142
02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:46.680
it matters in this in a sense that it's,
it's very persuasive to people that,

2143
02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:47.710
you know,

2144
02:06:47.710 --> 02:06:51.180
if I can predict what you're going to do before you are aware of what you're

2145
02:06:51.181 --> 02:06:55.650
going to do,
well then the basis for freewill seems to go out the window.

2146
02:06:56.340 --> 02:07:01.200
Okay.
Two things.
One,
how can you,
so,
but for instance,
just notice this moment.

2147
02:07:01.201 --> 02:07:04.320
So let's say I had written down on a piece of paper,

2148
02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:07.170
the next sentence you're going to speak,
right?

2149
02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:11.670
So I had verbatim what's going to come out of your mouth now and you just so you

2150
02:07:11.671 --> 02:07:11.821
know,

2151
02:07:11.821 --> 02:07:16.290
you start your side of the conversation and I just hold up this pad and you see

2152
02:07:16.291 --> 02:07:20.790
that I have everything that is just now occurring you just to current to you to

2153
02:07:20.791 --> 02:07:23.700
say that would be pretty persuasive to you,

2154
02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:27.990
that you're not running a freewill program over there.
Right?
Right.

2155
02:07:28.410 --> 02:07:32.130
And so that's the intuition that I'm trying to get at so that if we can predict

2156
02:07:32.610 --> 02:07:36.280
what you're going to think before you think it,
where is your freewill?

2157
02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:41.110
Because you're,
you're,
you are going to be,
you're thinking it is,
is the,

2158
02:07:41.111 --> 02:07:44.020
is this is the basis of your sense of free will in the first place.

2159
02:07:44.050 --> 02:07:48.670
You feel like you are offering this next thought.
You feel like you're,

2160
02:07:48.671 --> 02:07:49.770
do you feel like it's a,

2161
02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:53.380
but if I could show you that we knew what you were going to do before you did
it,

2162
02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:57.850
that would erode this sense that you're free to do otherwise.

2163
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:59.530
How in what sense could you have done otherwise?

2164
02:07:59.531 --> 02:08:04.300
If I can hold up this piece of paper and show you that you were committed to

2165
02:08:04.301 --> 02:08:07.120
saying what you were using.
The sounds a dishonest argument though,

2166
02:08:07.121 --> 02:08:10.270
because you can't do that.
Well,
no,
but we can do it in a very simple paradigm,

2167
02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:11.470
but you can,

2168
02:08:11.530 --> 02:08:15.370
you can predict whether or not someone's going to lift their right hand or their

2169
02:08:15.371 --> 02:08:17.080
left hand based on FM Ri.

2170
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:21.940
But how do you know when someone has decided or not decided?
Like what,

2171
02:08:21.970 --> 02:08:25.360
what is that point of decision?
What does that mean?
I mean,

2172
02:08:25.361 --> 02:08:30.040
if there's decisive sort of a thing like lifting your left hand or your right

2173
02:08:30.041 --> 02:08:34.900
hand.
Like if we just have an FMRI attached to your head and say randomly,

2174
02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:38.860
just every 30 seconds,
I want you to lift your left hand to your right hand.

2175
02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:42.770
Right?
How do you know when a person has decided?
Yeah,
well a good question.
It's,

2176
02:08:42.771 --> 02:08:42.881
it's,

2177
02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:47.881
and it's a little difficult to operationalize or make design an experiment

2178
02:08:49.151 --> 02:08:53.230
around.
But what they've done is they created a clock which made it,

2179
02:08:53.231 --> 02:08:55.580
and this has been done in a few different ways,
but they,

2180
02:08:55.581 --> 02:08:57.190
in each one of these experiments,

2181
02:08:57.191 --> 02:09:00.580
they could essentially create a clock that made it very easy for someone to

2182
02:09:00.581 --> 02:09:04.180
discriminate time.
So isn't,
it wasn't just what like watching an ordinary clock,

2183
02:09:04.181 --> 02:09:05.200
but it could be,

2184
02:09:05.201 --> 02:09:09.530
let's say a bunch of letters and numbers kind of streaming in front of you.

2185
02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:10.450
You know,
or you're getting,

2186
02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:14.650
you're being presented with a bunch of different letters,
numbers,
and um,

2187
02:09:14.770 --> 02:09:17.800
I'm asking you,
you're free to decide.
You can take as long as you want,
you know,

2188
02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:19.450
you're going to choose left or right.

2189
02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:22.570
And I'm not forcing you to go at any particular time.
Uh,

2190
02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:25.280
and you're just watching the letters and numbers and all.

2191
02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:30.300
Your only job is to tell me what letter a number or number was present the

2192
02:09:31.631 --> 02:09:35.680
moment you were,
you decided,
right.
So you as you're watching,
you know,

2193
02:09:35.681 --> 02:09:37.810
k and x and four and seven,

2194
02:09:37.811 --> 02:09:40.810
and so all these different numbers and letters that are easily discriminated,

2195
02:09:40.811 --> 02:09:41.590
coming,

2196
02:09:41.590 --> 02:09:45.010
appearing on a screen and you're just waiting to decide and you're thinking,
oh,

2197
02:09:45.011 --> 02:09:48.320
maybe I'll go laugh,
maybe I'll go,
right,
I'm free to do whatever I want.
And uh,

2198
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:50.350
you know,
I'm just going to,
I'm going to wait this out a little bit,

2199
02:09:50.351 --> 02:09:52.360
but all right,
I'm going to go.
Right.

2200
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:55.180
And the moment you feel that you're committed,

2201
02:09:55.181 --> 02:09:58.840
you recall what number or a letter you were looking at,

2202
02:09:59.350 --> 02:10:02.740
and then you tell the experimenter afterward I was looking at k a k was on the

2203
02:10:02.741 --> 02:10:05.500
screen when I was committed.
Now what's,

2204
02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:09.970
you might think this is not so compelling when the time interval is very brief

2205
02:10:09.971 --> 02:10:13.960
and some of these experiments,
that distance was like half a second,
right?

2206
02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:17.260
But with this recent FMRI experiment,

2207
02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:22.300
the distance stretched out to like five seconds,
five to seven seconds.
So that,

2208
02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:26.020
so that the,
the,
the activity,
uh,
that was,

2209
02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:30.070
was inclining a person to go right as opposed to left,

2210
02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:33.740
was building up subconsciously for that long.

2211
02:10:33.741 --> 02:10:36.650
So that at a certain point the person died.
All right,
I have decided,

2212
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:41.950
but the data show that we could have predicted that with great accuracy five to

2213
02:10:43.521 --> 02:10:46.940
seven seconds earlier.
See,
but that's for lying on a person.

2214
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:51.290
Being honest about when they decided that it seems,

2215
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:52.760
it seems rather crude.

2216
02:10:52.761 --> 02:10:55.850
And it also seems to conflict with what we were talking about earlier with,

2217
02:10:55.851 --> 02:10:58.310
which is the idea of controlling your thoughts,

2218
02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:03.350
the idea of getting to a point in your mind where you are,

2219
02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:07.790
uh,
essentially in control of which way you're,

2220
02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.440
your brain goes right.
Whether you adhere to one pattern of thinking or another.

2221
02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:13.573
And if you're,

2222
02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:18.010
you're talking about something as crude as lifting a left hand or right hand

2223
02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:23.020
deciding when to do so based on whatever idea that pops into your head.

2224
02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:27.920
That seems like an incredibly crude way to argue that there's no free will.
Well,

2225
02:11:27.921 --> 02:11:30.320
it's not a,
again,
let me,
let me just be clear about this.
It's an,

2226
02:11:30.321 --> 02:11:33.500
it's a very interesting experiment.
I agree.
It's crude.

2227
02:11:33.501 --> 02:11:36.800
Except I think that with this time interval it becomes,

2228
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.790
there's less of a concern that the person's judgment about when they decided

2229
02:11:40.791 --> 02:11:45.470
we'll be off by enough so as to to make it a,
an invalid experiment.

2230
02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:49.550
But I don't think it's enough to satisfy me.
But let me just tell you,
it's just,

2231
02:11:49.551 --> 02:11:50.384
there's no,

2232
02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:55.310
nothing hinges on this because even if your,

2233
02:11:55.630 --> 02:11:57.320
the decision that the,
the,
the,

2234
02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:01.880
the neural activity in the brain that that gave you the decision and you,

2235
02:12:01.890 --> 02:12:05.020
you are subjective feeling of having decided,
even if those were coincident,

2236
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:06.500
even if there was no time lag,
right,

2237
02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:11.920
it's still is coming out of nowhere in a sense for free for you subjectively.

2238
02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:15.410
You're still not in control of it and you're still,

2239
02:12:15.411 --> 02:12:19.940
it's still being caused by events that you didn't cause.
So again,

2240
02:12:19.941 --> 02:12:23.270
you didn't pick your genetics and you didn't pick any,
you didn't pick out,

2241
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:24.520
you know,
so it's like,

2242
02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:29.070
and the real illusion here or mode,

2243
02:12:29.090 --> 02:12:30.790
what most people think is that there's a very strong,

2244
02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:34.830
a very strong subjective case for freewill.
We all know we have,

2245
02:12:34.831 --> 02:12:36.350
but we all feel it.
We're all living it.

2246
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:41.630
And yet it's very difficult to map on to third person.
Reality is that it's very,

2247
02:12:41.631 --> 02:12:45.170
it's very difficult to map onto the physical world.
Um,
that,

2248
02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:48.290
that is not the situation from my point of view.
I think it,

2249
02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:50.510
it is very difficult to map on to,

2250
02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:53.510
in fact impossible to map onto the physical world.

2251
02:12:53.511 --> 02:12:58.511
There's no way to describe the way causes can propagate in the universe so as to

2252
02:12:58.881 --> 02:13:00.590
make this idea of freewill makes sense.

2253
02:13:00.590 --> 02:13:05.030
Because either they're determined or they're random or there's some combination

2254
02:13:05.031 --> 02:13:09.260
of both and no combination of determinism and randomness gets you free will,

2255
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:12.500
determinism doesn't get your freewill because you're just a machine.

2256
02:13:12.710 --> 02:13:15.500
Randomness doesn't get your freewill because you're just a machine that's

2257
02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:20.920
throwing dice occasionally.
Um,
so,
but,
but the,

2258
02:13:20.921 --> 02:13:24.080
the feeling is that,
and this is the feeling that I think Dan Dennett has,

2259
02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:26.750
there's this very compelling,

2260
02:13:26.751 --> 02:13:31.010
subjective sense of freewill that we somehow have to make room for.

2261
02:13:31.650 --> 02:13:34.080
And I'm saying we don't have to make room for it because if you look closely

2262
02:13:34.081 --> 02:13:36.510
enough,
you don't actually even feel it.
It's not even,

2263
02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:40.080
you don't even feel that you have the free freedom that you think you feel.

2264
02:13:40.081 --> 02:13:44.420
Because if you just look at how thoughts arise,
if you just look at it,

2265
02:13:44.421 --> 02:13:47.490
if I just pay attention to how I get to the end of this sentence,

2266
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:51.300
I don't know how I get to the end of the sentence.
He in,
in,
in the,

2267
02:13:52.050 --> 02:13:56.380
in the cases where I fail to get to the end of the sentence where I miss a word

2268
02:13:56.381 --> 02:13:58.800
I,
where I'm the speak in a way that's not grammatically correct.

2269
02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:02.910
Each one of those hiccups is a mystery to me.

2270
02:14:02.911 --> 02:14:06.270
Fun subjectively and no doubt it's caused by some,
uh,

2271
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:07.800
some events in my brain that,

2272
02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:11.490
that could be understood if we were scanning my brain.
Um,

2273
02:14:12.330 --> 02:14:16.590
but subjectively
it's always a surprise.

2274
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:21.360
But successfully finding the word you're looking for is also in some sense of

2275
02:14:21.361 --> 02:14:25.710
surprise.
It's also something that you're not actually offering.
And when you,

2276
02:14:26.010 --> 02:14:30.090
when you look at why you choose one word over another,
you know,
you,
you say

2277
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:34.280
<v 4>thing like,
um,
uh,</v>

2278
02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:39.200
<v 3>you know,
there's a,
there's a consistency between,
uh,
this story and that story.</v>

2279
02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:42.570
And then you say,
well,
why did I choose the word consistency?
You know,
there,

2280
02:14:42.571 --> 02:14:43.450
there are other synonym,

2281
02:14:43.451 --> 02:14:46.280
there are other words that mean consistency that I could have used.

2282
02:14:46.281 --> 02:14:50.090
I could have said there's a harmony between this story and that story,

2283
02:14:50.670 --> 02:14:52.410
<v 4>um,
that,</v>

2284
02:14:53.210 --> 02:14:57.860
<v 3>that is subjectively mysterious and was determined by events in your brain that</v>

2285
02:14:57.861 --> 02:15:01.860
you are not responsible for.
And so if I,
in a very simple experiment,

2286
02:15:01.861 --> 02:15:04.580
if I say to you,
what are you going to think of next?
You know,
so your net,

2287
02:15:04.581 --> 02:15:09.080
your next thought.
So I'm going to ask you to think of a city.

2288
02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:13.730
He city.
Chicago.
Okay.

2289
02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.630
So you thought of Chicago now perhaps it,

2290
02:15:17.631 --> 02:15:18.890
and then were there other cities that,

2291
02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:22.280
that kind of percolated there that were vying for inclusion and then you,

2292
02:15:22.281 --> 02:15:25.910
you decide on Chicago?
Yeah,
it could be.
Okay.
But were you consciously aware of,

2293
02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:28.340
Oh,
I just came here.
Okay.
I just randomly picked one.
Okay.

2294
02:15:28.610 --> 02:15:32.660
So Chicago now of all the cities,
you know the name of,
right?

2295
02:15:32.690 --> 02:15:34.630
You Pick Chicago now they're all the,

2296
02:15:34.631 --> 02:15:37.580
there's a bunch of cities that you don't know the names of.

2297
02:15:37.581 --> 02:15:39.440
So you couldn't have picked them.
Right,
so you're not,

2298
02:15:39.441 --> 02:15:42.230
you were not free to pick them.
But then there's,
you know,

2299
02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:46.340
probably hundreds of cities who,
who,
whose names you recognize and who would,

2300
02:15:46.341 --> 02:15:49.190
you could have potentially you could have said,
you know,
Budapest,

2301
02:15:49.191 --> 02:15:51.050
you could've said Cairo,
he could've said Paris,

2302
02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:56.090
but those cities didn't occur to you for whatever reason.
Now,
so,

2303
02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:57.400
so the question is that this is where,

2304
02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:01.130
and this is as free of choices I think you're ever going to make.

2305
02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:06.460
The question is where are you free to think what didn't occur to you?

2306
02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:11.030
To think where you for really free to say Paris.
Now you in some,

2307
02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:13.520
in Dan Dennett sense,
you were free to say Paris,

2308
02:16:13.521 --> 02:16:17.310
you had the item not holding a gun to your head saying don't say Paris.
You were,

2309
02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:22.130
you could have in some other situation similar to this thought of Paris,

2310
02:16:22.670 --> 02:16:26.990
but for whatever reason Paris was not in the cards for you.

2311
02:16:26.991 --> 02:16:29.060
And it was not the based on the state of your,

2312
02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:32.350
based on the inputs that had happened earlier today,

2313
02:16:32.351 --> 02:16:36.550
based on whatever variables could control how this experiment was going to run.

2314
02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:41.050
You thought Chicago and you didn't think Paris.
Now

2315
02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:47.850
in a deterministic universe you were not free to think Paris and in a,

2316
02:16:48.701 --> 02:16:52.420
in and the,
if we add randomness,

2317
02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:57.890
it doesn't give you the freedom of will that you think you have what the cause

2318
02:16:57.910 --> 02:17:02.910
the freedom of will people think they have is they are free to,

2319
02:17:03.710 --> 02:17:06.860
to have done otherwise they could have done otherwise.
You know,

2320
02:17:06.861 --> 02:17:11.840
you could have you.
So what does it mean to say you could have said Paris,
right?

2321
02:17:11.841 --> 02:17:13.820
You said Chicago,
we can't take that back.

2322
02:17:14.090 --> 02:17:19.090
But your belief in freewill entails the belief that,

2323
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:23.090
you know,
if we,
if we rewind the movie of our lives right now,

2324
02:17:23.091 --> 02:17:27.020
if we just go back in this conversation a few minutes and Sam says,

2325
02:17:27.021 --> 02:17:31.900
think of a city
leaving everything else the same as the university.

2326
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:33.110
Exactly.
In the same state.

2327
02:17:33.710 --> 02:17:37.250
I could have said Paris and there's no reason.

2328
02:17:37.251 --> 02:17:40.250
There's no reason scientifically to think that you could have because that would

2329
02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:42.560
<v 0>main,
the universe would have had to have been in a different state.</v>

2330
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:46.460
But are we not getting trapped in my new she here because is it not a

2331
02:17:46.461 --> 02:17:50.180
combination of determinism and randomness?
Because of course there's determinism,

2332
02:17:50.390 --> 02:17:51.290
of course there's,

2333
02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:54.110
there's certain events that have taken place in my life that I can't change.

2334
02:17:54.111 --> 02:17:57.770
Of course there's jeans,
there's life experiences.
Uh,
there's,

2335
02:17:57.850 --> 02:18:00.290
I have experienced in Chicago,
it's a city I love,

2336
02:18:00.291 --> 02:18:02.630
so it comes up to my mind pretty quickly.

2337
02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:07.280
But it's also randomness because I just went to Chicago.
I just picked a name.

2338
02:18:07.281 --> 02:18:11.060
But that doesn't apply to my life.
And I think when you talk about free will,

2339
02:18:11.061 --> 02:18:13.040
when most people talk about free will,
they,

2340
02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.860
they think about actions in terms of their life.

2341
02:18:15.861 --> 02:18:18.200
Like if you have an opportunity to cheat on your taxes,

2342
02:18:18.201 --> 02:18:20.600
but you think it's morally wrong and you don't want to go to jail,

2343
02:18:20.630 --> 02:18:25.520
isn't it not freewill to look at your tax form and make the decision to be

2344
02:18:25.521 --> 02:18:28.250
correct?
Like isn't that freewill is,
and they're not free will.

2345
02:18:28.370 --> 02:18:32.060
And we'll all listen to control your thoughts as we were discussing earlier.

2346
02:18:32.310 --> 02:18:33.510
Let me address that question cause he,

2347
02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:35.660
cause it seems so this can all seem very happy

2348
02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:38.420
<v 3>attract and academic and of no use to anyone.</v>

2349
02:18:38.421 --> 02:18:42.350
And what I argue in my book is that it admitting that free will is an illusion

2350
02:18:42.890 --> 02:18:45.590
actually does have some important consequences.
They're not.

2351
02:18:45.591 --> 02:18:49.400
The kind of consequences that people worry about is not that you have no basis

2352
02:18:49.401 --> 02:18:52.340
to be a better person or to change your life or to you to add,

2353
02:18:52.341 --> 02:18:56.360
to make efforts to improve yourself.
That all remains intact.

2354
02:18:56.630 --> 02:19:01.630
But it does change our ethical views of good and evil in some important ways.

2355
02:19:03.051 --> 02:19:05.720
And so we can maybe table that for the moment or,
or maybe we'll get to it,

2356
02:19:05.721 --> 02:19:10.110
but the,
you look at it.
So you look at an,
at your effort to be a better person.

2357
02:19:10.111 --> 02:19:13.100
And so your effort not to cheat on your taxes or to cheat on your wife or to

2358
02:19:13.101 --> 02:19:17.440
cheat on your diet,
um,
let's make it very simple.
You're on a diet and you're,

2359
02:19:17.470 --> 02:19:21.980
you've decided you're going to go carb free for the next week,
but then see you,

2360
02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:23.750
you come in here and someone's,
you know,

2361
02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:26.840
giving you some donuts and you're tempted to eat a,

2362
02:19:27.890 --> 02:19:30.950
but then you have that moment of a tug of war with yourself and you say,
no,
no,

2363
02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:35.150
I'm,
I'm,
I've decided to go carb free.
I'm,
um,
I'm going to toss these,
um,

2364
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:37.580
that back and forth.
Now you,
they're there,

2365
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:39.590
you've been in that situation many times before.

2366
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:43.010
Sometimes you cave in and eat the donut.
Sometimes you're just,

2367
02:19:43.011 --> 02:19:47.570
you've got a will of steel and you don't eat the doughnut.
But in each,

2368
02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.880
in each case,
the difference there,
your,
your ability to resist,

2369
02:19:52.881 --> 02:19:56.370
your inability to resist your,
your,
your,
you just,
you know,

2370
02:19:56.410 --> 02:20:01.410
w w which part of you wins in that circumstance is also being born of variables

2371
02:20:03.711 --> 02:20:07.940
in your nervous system that you didn't author,
that you didn't control.
I mean,

2372
02:20:07.941 --> 02:20:11.360
this is like a tiny,
and if you could,
and if you could understand them perfectly,

2373
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:13.910
right,
if you could,
if you could see all the causality,

2374
02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:19.640
you would see that you were not in control of that at that moment.

2375
02:20:19.641 --> 02:20:23.960
Your control,
you had exactly as much willpower as you had in that moment.

2376
02:20:23.961 --> 02:20:27.470
And not,
uh,
not,
uh,
Adam Moore and,

2377
02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:31.640
and you can't take cra and so,
but what that doesn't mean,

2378
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:34.730
that doesn't mean that willpower is irrelevant.

2379
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:37.520
That doesn't mean that training is irrelevant.
So I was like for,
you know,

2380
02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:41.390
if I want a black belt in Jujitsu,
I've got to train in Jujitsu.

2381
02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:43.550
I can't just sit back and see what happens.
Right?

2382
02:20:43.551 --> 02:20:46.910
I can't just wait to see if I get a black belt or your decision to train,

2383
02:20:46.911 --> 02:20:49.290
you're saying absolutely not.
It's part of the call,

2384
02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:51.140
but it is part of the causality.

2385
02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:55.910
My decision to train will be the proximate cause of my going into a school and

2386
02:20:55.911 --> 02:20:58.000
training.
My desire to,

2387
02:20:58.060 --> 02:21:02.730
to get a black belt is going to be the proximate cause in each moment of,
uh,

2388
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:07.520
of my making it a priority to train my,
making the effort to train my,

2389
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:11.780
my,
uh,
getting over injury,
my ignoring injuries when I,

2390
02:21:11.810 --> 02:21:16.240
when I otherwise would be cowed by them.
Whatever.
All,

2391
02:21:16.310 --> 02:21:18.030
all of those,
your,

2392
02:21:18.060 --> 02:21:23.060
your intentions and your efforts and your desires are just as causal and as

2393
02:21:23.661 --> 02:21:26.810
important as you think they are.
I mean,
they,
they are,

2394
02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:30.610
you are driven by desire and you're an effort does matter.
And,

2395
02:21:30.611 --> 02:21:34.730
and training has an effect.
All of that's true,
but,
and so,
so you can't,

2396
02:21:34.850 --> 02:21:38.330
where people get confused is they think that determinism is the same thing as

2397
02:21:38.331 --> 02:21:42.320
fatalism.
Whereas if everything's just going to happen as it happens,

2398
02:21:42.321 --> 02:21:44.530
well then I don't have to do anything.
Right.
You know,
I'm not,

2399
02:21:44.531 --> 02:21:47.810
so I'm just gonna see if I got a black belt,
you know,
I just not,
I'm not gonna,

2400
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:51.020
I'm not gonna make any efforts because if I,
if I'm destined to get a black belt,

2401
02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:54.010
you know,
someone's going to give me one.
Right.
Right.
That makes no sense.
Right,

2402
02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:57.140
right.
If I'm destined to learn Chinese,
I'm just going to start speaking Chinese.

2403
02:21:57.470 --> 02:21:58.303
<v 0>So how's that?</v>

2404
02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:03.580
Not a combination of determinism and maybe the momentum of your past

2405
02:22:05.391 --> 02:22:08.420
determination,
which is based on a conscious thought,

2406
02:22:08.770 --> 02:22:11.690
a conscious thought to decide to be disciplined,
to sought,

2407
02:22:11.691 --> 02:22:14.990
decided to have a very specific diet,
to write down goals.

2408
02:22:15.170 --> 02:22:19.610
I mean is that not freewill in some sense because isn't the only way to truly

2409
02:22:19.611 --> 02:22:23.450
tell whether or not there is the ability to alter your events and your life and

2410
02:22:23.451 --> 02:22:26.850
your behavior based entirely on will when you have to have someone live the

2411
02:22:26.851 --> 02:22:29.400
exact same life with the exact same genetics,

2412
02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:34.401
exact same life experiences and confront the exact same circumstances and decide

2413
02:22:34.770 --> 02:22:37.730
or find out whether or not they act randomly or whether or not it's,

2414
02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:38.910
you can determine it.

2415
02:22:39.130 --> 02:22:40.690
<v 3>Well that's the thing.
The thing is that,</v>

2416
02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:44.360
so the first part of your question,

2417
02:22:45.330 --> 02:22:49.680
someone like Dan Dennett wants to say that is all we mean by free will.

2418
02:22:49.770 --> 02:22:54.240
The only thing you need for freewill is this effect of intention and training

2419
02:22:54.241 --> 02:22:56.880
and willpower.
And that's all anyone cares about anyway.

2420
02:22:56.881 --> 02:23:01.740
So the all rest of the stuff is irrelevant.
Determinism is irrelevant.
Um,

2421
02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:07.090
but
I don't,
I don't think that's true for,
for a few reasons.

2422
02:23:09.290 --> 02:23:13.520
The crucial piece is ethical.
So once you acknowledge that if someone

2423
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:17.630
was,
it wasn't in exactly your situation,

2424
02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:22.720
given the same jeans and the same parents in the same environment,

2425
02:23:22.821 --> 02:23:25.430
same life influences,
same political circumstance,

2426
02:23:25.431 --> 02:23:29.780
same you just micro influences to his nervous system,

2427
02:23:30.050 --> 02:23:34.340
that person would make all the same choices you're making.

2428
02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:38.000
He'd have the exact same amount of willpower when he's confronted with a donut.

2429
02:23:38.330 --> 02:23:41.570
He'd fall off his diet the exact same number of times and in the same place as

2430
02:23:41.571 --> 02:23:43.490
you age,
the,
the movie of your life.

2431
02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:48.020
If replayed in your double on a,
on a nother planet,

2432
02:23:48.021 --> 02:23:52.670
that was exactly like this one would play out exactly the same and in the way.

2433
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:56.480
And if randomness intrudes to make a different,
well then random.

2434
02:23:56.481 --> 02:23:58.850
This doesn't give you a freewill random,
it's just gives you randomness.

2435
02:23:58.910 --> 02:24:00.960
It's just,
if I just told you that,

2436
02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:05.990
that you're going to be exactly the same as your double and we can completely

2437
02:24:05.991 --> 02:24:10.010
predict your behavior.
A thousand years before you were even born.
Right.

2438
02:24:10.011 --> 02:24:13.040
Cause we've run this experiment before and we've tuned your genes and your and

2439
02:24:13.041 --> 02:24:15.920
your world.
Exactly.
You're just a computer simulation of your double,
right.

2440
02:24:15.921 --> 02:24:20.090
You're just going to run out exactly the same way so you've got no freewill.

2441
02:24:20.091 --> 02:24:23.420
But we are going to throw in a little randomness to make you,
you know,

2442
02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:27.470
I mean random events,
random but random events in your,
in your nervous system.

2443
02:24:27.471 --> 02:24:30.320
Yeah.
Random events in the world and random events and your w we can,
we can,

2444
02:24:30.380 --> 02:24:34.070
you can put the randomness wherever you want but so it's going to change your

2445
02:24:34.071 --> 02:24:34.910
life in various ways.

2446
02:24:34.911 --> 02:24:38.780
You're going to decide to eat the donut in one case and not in another and then

2447
02:24:38.781 --> 02:24:41.990
your,
your,
your history,
your joint history with your,

2448
02:24:41.991 --> 02:24:46.910
your double is kind of diverge.
But that's not free will.
That's just,
you know,

2449
02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:52.020
if you knew that your decision to marry your wife as opposed to somebody else

2450
02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:59.180
was born of someone having thrown the dice in a lab somewhere,
you wouldn't,

2451
02:24:59.690 --> 02:25:02.720
you wouldn't ascribe that to freewill that you,
that would just be,

2452
02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:07.190
that would be a bizarre thing to dictate your,
your decision process.

2453
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:09.590
So that's not what it,
when anyone means by free will.
So random,

2454
02:25:09.591 --> 02:25:12.660
this doesn't give you the freedom you think you have.
Um,

2455
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:16.550
let me just say a bit about why this,
why,
why this is important.
Ethically,

2456
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:21.380
it's just,
it's when you look at when we perceive good and evil in the world,

2457
02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:25.210
we look at people as agents really are the authors of their actions.
We really,

2458
02:25:25.211 --> 02:25:27.400
we,
we,
we relate to people like they have free will.

2459
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:32.650
And this seems to make ethical sense to us.
And it seems to,

2460
02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:34.980
it's definitely the basis for our,
our,

2461
02:25:35.090 --> 02:25:38.380
our impulse for vengeance and retributive justice and,

2462
02:25:38.381 --> 02:25:41.050
and the feeling that people really deserve to be punished.
You know,

2463
02:25:41.051 --> 02:25:43.090
bad people deserve what they get.

2464
02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:48.660
And I'm not arguing that punishment is never valid and there may be a role for

2465
02:25:49.121 --> 02:25:51.850
punishment that we,
we want to retain in our justice system.

2466
02:25:51.850 --> 02:25:56.850
But this idea of punishing people because they deserve it doesn't make a lot of

2467
02:25:57.521 --> 02:25:57.881
sense.

2468
02:25:57.881 --> 02:26:02.881
And the way to see that is to a way to see that one is you look at these cases

2469
02:26:04.451 --> 02:26:08.680
where you have someone like Charles Whitman who got on the the clock tower at

2470
02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:13.720
the University of Texas in 1964 I think it was,
or 66 and shot,

2471
02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:15.730
you know,
dozens of people.

2472
02:26:15.731 --> 02:26:20.050
I think he killed 14 and he killed his mom and his girlfriend for Kelly's mom

2473
02:26:20.051 --> 02:26:20.711
and his wife first.

2474
02:26:20.711 --> 02:26:23.620
And then he got on the clock tower and killed 14 people and injured like 30

2475
02:26:23.621 --> 02:26:28.210
people.
And this is just like pure evil,
right?
So this guy is,

2476
02:26:28.211 --> 02:26:30.730
if anyone deserves to be punished,
this guy does.
And,

2477
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:32.630
and he was killed by the cops.
Um,

2478
02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:35.650
and he knew he was going to be killed by the cops and said,
and he had,

2479
02:26:35.710 --> 02:26:39.270
he had written essentially a suicide note.
Uh,
but you look at this behavior,

2480
02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:43.540
you think,
all right,
that's a stark,
as,
as,
as stark,
as evil as we ever see.
A,

2481
02:26:43.541 --> 02:26:45.550
and this guy really is the cause of his actions.

2482
02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:50.570
But then you read a suicide note and he describes how he was overcome with rages

2483
02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:52.420
that he found inexplicably.
And he does,

2484
02:26:52.421 --> 02:26:55.690
did not know why he was killing his wife or his mom.
He loved them both,

2485
02:26:55.691 --> 02:26:58.060
but he just quit.
He just felt like he had to do it.

2486
02:26:58.061 --> 02:27:03.061
And he recommended the doctors do a postmortem on his brain because he knows

2487
02:27:03.461 --> 02:27:05.320
something's wrong with it.
And there's,
you know,

2488
02:27:05.390 --> 02:27:07.630
maybe they can find the reason why he did all these terrible things.

2489
02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:11.500
So they do an autopsy and they see that he's got a giant tumor and his

2490
02:27:11.501 --> 02:27:13.480
hypothalamus pressing on the Amygdala.

2491
02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:18.960
And that is a certainly a plausible place for it to be driving some rages in

2492
02:27:19.391 --> 02:27:22.580
somebody and to be undermining their,
their impulse control.
Um,

2493
02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:26.230
and so most people look at the story of Charles Whitman and they think,

2494
02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:28.510
all right,
this is an unlucky guy.

2495
02:27:28.690 --> 02:27:33.690
He had a brain tumor who was driven to act out on the basis of this brain tumor.

2496
02:27:34.091 --> 02:27:38.470
And that is not freewill,
right?
I mean this is the,
he's,
he was,
uh,

2497
02:27:39.010 --> 02:27:42.640
an unlucky puppet,
a and a victim of biology.
Now

2498
02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:48.880
the problem is a brain tumor really is just a special case of physical

2499
02:27:48.881 --> 02:27:51.370
causality.
And what I'm arguing is that if we fully,

2500
02:27:51.371 --> 02:27:53.500
if we had a perfect understanding of the brain,

2501
02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:56.650
if we could scan your brain at this moment and,
and,

2502
02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:02.280
and see every variable that influenced behavior as clearly and as compellingly

2503
02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:07.210
as a brain,
as a golf ball sized brain tumor,
right,

2504
02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:11.860
we would see that your behavior and your thoughts and your innermost desires and

2505
02:28:11.861 --> 02:28:16.090
your commitment to your diet and your love of Jujitsu and everything was just as

2506
02:28:16.091 --> 02:28:21.091
determined as Charles Whitman's rages by a a Glioblastoma.

2507
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.890
Um,
and it all begins to look like a brain tumor.
It's a,

2508
02:28:26.910 --> 02:28:30.800
your,
your responsibility and your,
the fact that you're,

2509
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:34.390
you're a mensch and you're a kind guy as opposed to a,
um,

2510
02:28:34.830 --> 02:28:39.640
a vindictive one.
All of those variables.
Again,
getting the,
that got,
uh,

2511
02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:44.840
uh,
that you inherited courtesy of genes and environment,
um,

2512
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:48.650
which are the only influences we think you have.
Right?
And let the truth is,

2513
02:28:48.651 --> 02:28:50.850
even if you add an a soul,
you know,

2514
02:28:50.851 --> 02:28:55.070
you add an immortal Christian soul to the clockwork.
You didn't create your soul.

2515
02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:56.600
You know,
you,
you can't,
you,

2516
02:28:56.601 --> 02:29:00.140
you can't take credit for the fact that you don't have the soul of a psychopath.

2517
02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:05.270
So whatever you add is in some sense a gift,
you know,
brain tumors,

2518
02:29:05.271 --> 02:29:09.680
souls,
jeans,
a cosmic ray bombardment,

2519
02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:13.520
any influence that,
and,
and if we could understand these influences,

2520
02:29:13.521 --> 02:29:18.521
clearly it would all begin to look like the Charles Whitman's brain tumor.

2521
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:21.830
And if you add the rolling of dice,
you know,

2522
02:29:21.831 --> 02:29:24.800
you add some randomness to it that doesn't give you freedom.

2523
02:29:24.801 --> 02:29:28.070
That just gives you randomness.
See when I'm talking about randomness,
I'm not,

2524
02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:31.250
when you were saying like random events in the mind,

2525
02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:34.100
what I was saying is that the only way to truly determine whether or not someone

2526
02:29:34.101 --> 02:29:37.760
has the choice to make a decision one way or another is to have them live the

2527
02:29:37.761 --> 02:29:40.760
exact same life,
meaning the exact same amount of randomness,

2528
02:29:40.761 --> 02:29:45.320
the exact same events inside their mind and see whether or not conscious

2529
02:29:45.321 --> 02:29:48.620
decision making has any part in what you do.

2530
02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:52.880
Like the idea of free will is people are confronted with a scenario and they

2531
02:29:52.881 --> 02:29:55.280
decide what do I do here?

2532
02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:58.280
It's based on a lot of variables based on life experience.

2533
02:29:58.281 --> 02:29:59.660
It's certainly based on genetics.

2534
02:29:59.661 --> 02:30:02.210
It's certainly based on the environment that you grew up in,

2535
02:30:02.211 --> 02:30:05.960
the environment that you find yourself in.
But is there not a choice there?

2536
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:07.010
Is there not a choice?

2537
02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:11.570
There's something that's going on in your mind where it's causing you to act in

2538
02:30:11.571 --> 02:30:13.550
one way or another.
And in my opinion,

2539
02:30:13.551 --> 02:30:18.290
the only way to know whether or not it is all determined by momentum and the

2540
02:30:18.291 --> 02:30:21.920
momentum of the past and your genetics is to have someone live the exact same

2541
02:30:21.921 --> 02:30:26.060
life and see what they do.
The exact same thing.
But you can exact same chemicals,

2542
02:30:26.061 --> 02:30:29.360
exact same diet,
the exact same,
no randomness at all.

2543
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:33.120
And whether or not you decide to go one way or another,
okay?

2544
02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:38.000
But we know that every decision has to be proceeded by something,

2545
02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:40.330
right?
So it's,
and if you have,

2546
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:44.480
you're going to take a scientific view of these things we know is proceeded by

2547
02:30:45.140 --> 02:30:48.260
neurophysiology,
right?
That's the same measure consciousness though.

2548
02:30:48.261 --> 02:30:50.920
If there is a consciousness.
So if there's a something in the mind,
right?
So,

2549
02:30:50.921 --> 02:30:54.050
so either whether you think what I'm arguing is that whether you think

2550
02:30:54.051 --> 02:30:58.030
consciousness is arising out of the information processing of the brain.
So it,

2551
02:30:58.040 --> 02:30:58.311
it's just,

2552
02:30:58.311 --> 02:31:01.550
it was what the brain and the mind is what the brain is doing or you think

2553
02:31:01.551 --> 02:31:04.550
consciousness is something else.
And even even something very spooky,

2554
02:31:04.551 --> 02:31:08.120
let's say it's Ectoplasm,
let's say it's a Christian soul,
whatever it is,

2555
02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:14.030
even in those,
even in that case of dualism,
you don't get free will.
You don't.

2556
02:31:14.031 --> 02:31:16.970
You just get,
you just get some spooky or causality that we don't,

2557
02:31:16.971 --> 02:31:21.510
we can't describe,
but it's still just coming out of the darkness for,
from,

2558
02:31:21.511 --> 02:31:25.740
from your point of view,
subjectively,
you don't know what you're gonna do next.

2559
02:31:25.741 --> 02:31:29.340
And when you do it,
you don't know.
We really don't know why you did it.

2560
02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:33.780
And if you have a story about why you did it,
you don't know why I make it.

2561
02:31:33.781 --> 02:31:34.081
So you can,

2562
02:31:34.081 --> 02:31:37.530
you can take a thousand years to choose between your right hand and your left

2563
02:31:37.531 --> 02:31:41.440
hand.
You could say it's going to be left,
is going to be right.
No,
no.
I rose my,
I,

2564
02:31:41.441 --> 02:31:44.250
I use my right yesterday.
I'm going to go for left you,

2565
02:31:44.251 --> 02:31:46.470
it doesn't matter how long you you take,
right?

2566
02:31:46.471 --> 02:31:49.050
You could take a literally a thousand years and you could have,

2567
02:31:49.051 --> 02:31:53.510
you could write a,
you know,
a million page document about what,

2568
02:31:53.511 --> 02:31:55.080
what it was like to deliberate over this,

2569
02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:58.650
but in the final moment where you decide,
you know what,
after all this,

2570
02:31:58.710 --> 02:32:01.970
I'm going to go with the right,
that there's,

2571
02:32:01.980 --> 02:32:04.890
there's a inherent mystery for subjectively speaking.

2572
02:32:05.310 --> 02:32:10.310
You don't know what tipped the balance and the sense that you did is just this

2573
02:32:10.861 --> 02:32:15.510
feeling of the,
I mean I it again,
it's,

2574
02:32:15.511 --> 02:32:17.650
it's the other side of this feeling of,
of,

2575
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:20.580
of just being the thinker of your thoughts is the feeling of self.

2576
02:32:20.610 --> 02:32:23.390
It's the feeling of I as the feeling of I,
the feeling of May.

2577
02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:24.890
You're the one pushing the,
the,

2578
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:26.510
<v 0>the machine.
I understand what you're saying,</v>

2579
02:32:26.511 --> 02:32:30.140
but the choice of a left hand or right hand is completely irrelevant.

2580
02:32:30.141 --> 02:32:33.050
There's no consequences one way.
That's just the simplest case.

2581
02:32:33.051 --> 02:32:35.120
But you can make it as big as you want.
What do,
whether I shoot,

2582
02:32:35.240 --> 02:32:37.100
shoot the intruder in my living room or not,

2583
02:32:37.130 --> 02:32:40.700
or whether or not you stick to a diet or whether or not you choose to be

2584
02:32:40.701 --> 02:32:44.870
inspired,
whether or not you get divorce.
Yeah,
well what?
What are those things?

2585
02:32:44.871 --> 02:32:47.000
I mean what is it that's causing those choices?

2586
02:32:47.001 --> 02:32:51.440
You're saying that it's all just genetics,
live experience of course,

2587
02:32:51.470 --> 02:32:55.880
random variables.
The mind that there is no self that makes a choice.

2588
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:57.710
There is no self that the self,

2589
02:32:57.800 --> 02:33:01.790
even though the self is comprised of all these random variables like genetics,

2590
02:33:01.791 --> 02:33:05.400
life experiences,
the environment that you surround yourself with,

2591
02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:08.600
people that are in your life that influenced you.

2592
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:13.990
These variables are the funnel through which all decisions are made and there is

2593
02:33:14.751 --> 02:33:16.220
no conscious choice.
There is no,

2594
02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:20.060
today I'm going to be a better person that you saying today I'm going to be a

2595
02:33:20.061 --> 02:33:20.631
better person,

2596
02:33:20.631 --> 02:33:24.050
is based entirely on a bunch of things that are outside of your control.
Right?

2597
02:33:24.290 --> 02:33:28.420
Right,
and yet there's that experience seemed semantic to me.
What will know that,

2598
02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:30.380
but there's that as well.
Here's why.
Why

2599
02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:32.780
<v 3>it's not semantic in the sense that it's semantic.</v>

2600
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:36.920
It may be semantic and in how most people will live their lives most of the
time.

2601
02:33:36.921 --> 02:33:39.290
So you can still,
if you want to lose weight,
you still have to go on a diet,

2602
02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:41.330
right?
And if,
and if you want to stay on the Diet,

2603
02:33:41.331 --> 02:33:42.830
he still can't eat the doughnut,
right?

2604
02:33:42.831 --> 02:33:47.090
So you still have to have this negotiation with yourself.
But,

2605
02:33:47.570 --> 02:33:50.330
um,
and then all the,
all the things that,

2606
02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:53.780
that conventionally matter in that situation matters.

2607
02:33:53.781 --> 02:33:56.600
So it matters whether you keep donuts around or if you don't keep them around in

2608
02:33:56.601 --> 02:33:58.410
matters.
If your,
if your friends,
you know,

2609
02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:00.950
support you on your diet or they don't support you,
et cetera.

2610
02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:03.290
But here's where it changes.
Where,

2611
02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:06.560
so you think of an evil person like Uday Hussein,

2612
02:34:06.561 --> 02:34:11.060
who we've mentioned at the beginning,
um,
the,

2613
02:34:11.450 --> 02:34:16.040
the view of him as just pure evil,
worthy of being destroyed,
worthy.
If we could,

2614
02:34:16.041 --> 02:34:18.280
if we could have locked him,
you know,
it's worth,
he's worth,

2615
02:34:18.310 --> 02:34:22.090
it's worthy of punishment is anyone we could ever,
uh,
capture.
Um,

2616
02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:25.990
and that it makes sense to hate him,
that the,

2617
02:34:25.991 --> 02:34:30.850
the logic of hatred erodes here because it doesn't make sense to hate Charles

2618
02:34:30.850 --> 02:34:33.050
Whitman,
right?
Charles Whitman was unlucky.
You know,

2619
02:34:33.051 --> 02:34:36.670
that poor bastard had a brain tumor that caused him to kill his wife,

2620
02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:39.760
kill his mother,
and then kill a bunch of people and get killed himself,
right?

2621
02:34:40.270 --> 02:34:45.010
A very unlucky person.
Uday Hussein was also unlucky,

2622
02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:46.710
right?
So he,
and,

2623
02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:50.230
and you can see this if you just roll back the clock of his life,
right?

2624
02:34:50.231 --> 02:34:52.360
So when you look at him as a 40 year old,

2625
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:57.100
he's the scariest psychopath you've ever seen when you look at him as a,

2626
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:59.080
as a three year old,
okay.

2627
02:34:59.081 --> 02:35:03.880
He was a little boy who was going to become Uday Hussein.

2628
02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:06.010
He was a little boy who through no fault of his own,

2629
02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:09.580
had Saddam Hussein as a father,
right?
Imagine what that was like.

2630
02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:12.300
He has the genes he has,
right?
He has the,

2631
02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:15.520
the completely fucked up society that he has,
right?

2632
02:35:15.521 --> 02:35:20.140
And the honor culture and the,
and the crazy brother.
Right?
And,
um,

2633
02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:24.370
and he,
and you have to acknowledge,
given,

2634
02:35:25.890 --> 02:35:30.520
uh,
if whatever variables you want to include,
genes,

2635
02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:34.420
environment,
souls,
if you could trade places with him,

2636
02:35:34.570 --> 02:35:38.350
you get the same genes,
you get the same daddy,
you get the same environment,

2637
02:35:38.351 --> 02:35:43.090
you get the same s sole,
same ectoplasm,
whatever you want to put in to the,

2638
02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:47.740
to the box,
you would become Uday Hussein.
There's nothing,

2639
02:35:47.770 --> 02:35:50.050
there's nothing left,
right?
And,

2640
02:35:50.170 --> 02:35:52.870
and it's the sense that there's something left,

2641
02:35:53.260 --> 02:35:56.740
which is an illusion.
And,

2642
02:35:56.741 --> 02:36:01.600
but what I'm arguing is that this actually can become the basis for compassion

2643
02:36:01.601 --> 02:36:03.490
and for a wiser justice system.

2644
02:36:03.490 --> 02:36:06.040
And we have a justice system that's predicated on the notion of free will.

2645
02:36:06.041 --> 02:36:06.371
And we have,

2646
02:36:06.371 --> 02:36:11.371
we've locked up 13 year olds for their entire lives based on a sense that this

2647
02:36:11.891 --> 02:36:15.850
evil little bastard is really deserves what he gets.

2648
02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:19.540
I think we've done that because we want to protect everyone else from this evil

2649
02:36:19.541 --> 02:36:24.040
bastard.
I think the idea is not whether or not this person is free to make these

2650
02:36:24.041 --> 02:36:26.700
choices.
Well,
no,
we got there a day.
It is a sign,
you know,

2651
02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:31.180
know that the Supreme Court has actually said that our system is based on the

2652
02:36:31.181 --> 02:36:35.080
notion of free will and the determinism is hostile to any notion of retributive

2653
02:36:35.081 --> 02:36:38.740
justice.
So consciously as a matter of jurisprudence,
uh,

2654
02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:42.100
we think we are implementing a doctrine of free will.

2655
02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:46.110
Well then how do you indict people based on their responsibility for something?

2656
02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:49.310
What's exactly like,
um,

2657
02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:54.630
what we would do if grizzly bears were walking around outside.
So it's like,
it's,

2658
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:55.780
so if we,

2659
02:36:55.781 --> 02:36:59.860
if I walk outside in the parking lot after this podcast and I see a grizzly
bear,

2660
02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.740
uh,
I can be afraid of it.
I can defend myself from it.
I can run from it.

2661
02:37:05.741 --> 02:37:09.480
I can shoot it.
If I have a gun,
I can,
I can decide to lock it up if,

2662
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:11.710
if there's no place safe to put it.

2663
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:14.830
You can do all of those things without attributing freewill to it.

2664
02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:17.450
I don't think a grizzly bear you can attribute,
no,

2665
02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:20.930
you can attribute no freewill to a 13 year old psychopath and still lock 'em up.

2666
02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:23.990
How does that change?
Life will change.
It will be in the case of a 13 year old.

2667
02:37:23.991 --> 02:37:28.580
We know that a 13 year old is not truly representative of who he's going to

2668
02:37:28.581 --> 02:37:30.220
become as a 40 year old.
And you can see,
you can,

2669
02:37:30.290 --> 02:37:34.700
you can change meant most 13 year olds that the book isn't written on their
life.

2670
02:37:35.010 --> 02:37:39.080
Uh,
that's not who everybody responsible for letting some 13 year olds is killed.

2671
02:37:39.081 --> 02:37:41.840
A bunch of people out on the street,
you'd see,
you know,

2672
02:37:41.841 --> 02:37:44.840
you put them back in some sort of an institution,
you train them for five years,

2673
02:37:44.841 --> 02:37:47.360
he goes out and kills again.
Are you responsible for that now?

2674
02:37:47.361 --> 02:37:49.880
Did you have the free will to decide to let this kid free?

2675
02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:52.250
We do a lot worse than that though.
We let,

2676
02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:58.010
we let people go who are obviously going to re-offend in the most shocking ways

2677
02:37:58.011 --> 02:38:00.450
and wait,
and we do it because we're making room for,
you know,

2678
02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:03.860
people are selling acid.
You get out of their dorm room.
I mean,
so it's like,
it's,

2679
02:38:03.861 --> 02:38:06.290
it's,
it's what,
right.
But that's a different argument,
isn't it?

2680
02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:11.000
I mean that's an argument of privatized prisons and financial systems that have

2681
02:38:11.001 --> 02:38:13.220
been cooptive by pharmaceutical companies and,

2682
02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:17.630
and special interest groups like prison guard lobbyists.
And there's,

2683
02:38:17.631 --> 02:38:22.040
so there's a lot more going on there.
I mean,
what is,
what is,

2684
02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:23.293
what's the,

2685
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:28.450
what's the basis for decision making when it comes to keeping society safe?

2686
02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:33.290
It's,
it's all it's all about.
So this is another way to see the problem here.

2687
02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:38.080
Imagine we had a cure for psychopathy.
Imagine that we had a cure for evil.
So,

2688
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:40.550
so we completely understand human evil,

2689
02:38:40.590 --> 02:38:43.460
the level of the brain turns out just by sheer luck,

2690
02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:45.610
it's just we get kind of one,
you know,

2691
02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:50.490
there's one neurotransmitter quite possible.
It's unlikely,
but it's possible.
Um,

2692
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:55.270
and let's just say there's just one kind of one drug or a shot.

2693
02:38:55.450 --> 02:38:59.000
Give him a pill.
It's just a nutrient.
You know,
he was put it in the food supply,

2694
02:38:59.030 --> 02:39:02.870
right?
And we cure evil.
Now imagine to now we see we have this,

2695
02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:05.090
we have someone locked up.
It's Uday Hussein.

2696
02:39:05.091 --> 02:39:09.320
Or is this 13 year old who's done these evil things and we think,
you know what,

2697
02:39:09.650 --> 02:39:11.060
this guy was such an evil bastard,

2698
02:39:11.061 --> 02:39:15.560
we're going to withhold the cure from him as it just an extra punishment.

2699
02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:18.150
Right.
And that wouldn't make any sense.
Now that's the,

2700
02:39:18.151 --> 02:39:22.280
that would be like withholding surgery from Charles Whitman when you knew that

2701
02:39:22.281 --> 02:39:25.280
the brain tumor was the reason why he was going to be Charles Whitman.
Right?

2702
02:39:25.281 --> 02:39:26.180
So Charles Whitman,

2703
02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:30.200
you discover the brain tumor pressing on the Amygdala before he's going to go

2704
02:39:30.201 --> 02:39:31.670
out and kill every one.
And you say,
all right,

2705
02:39:31.671 --> 02:39:33.380
we're just going to solve the problem here.
Right?

2706
02:39:33.890 --> 02:39:38.030
So there'd be no ethical basis to before it though.
But PV,
but even after it.

2707
02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:41.900
But afterwards,
there's this concept of retribution where people want revenge.

2708
02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:45.890
The illusion debt.
Okay,
but that you wouldn't have that on the grizzly bear.

2709
02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:49.870
So say that's the different wood.
Well,
grizzly bear killed 30 people.

2710
02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.490
It'd be on a kilo would be different.
It would be,

2711
02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:54.530
didn't want to give them a pill to make them a happy grizzly bear.
No,
no.

2712
02:39:54.531 --> 02:39:55.680
But he's like,
I'm on some level,

2713
02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:58.450
you understand that a grizzly bear can't help it be a grizzly bear.
Yes.

2714
02:39:58.610 --> 02:40:02.030
And so it does actually,
people used to do this,
so there was this,

2715
02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:06.050
you could probably find this online.
There was a,
a circus elephant,
elephant,

2716
02:40:06.051 --> 02:40:10.580
and I'm in 1919 that ran a muck and killed a bunch of people.

2717
02:40:10.610 --> 02:40:15.510
And the townspeople people were so outraged and attributed so much evil to this,

2718
02:40:15.511 --> 02:40:18.480
this elephant that they hung it from a railroad crane.
I mean,

2719
02:40:18.481 --> 02:40:19.740
they lynched an elephant,
right?

2720
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:22.320
And they felt they were very satisfied with themselves.
So this is,
you know,

2721
02:40:22.321 --> 02:40:25.530
justice.
But the reality is you have a mistreated circus element.

2722
02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:29.000
The elephant that went crazy and,
and,
and trampled some people.
Um,

2723
02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:32.850
and he was just being an elephant.
This is,
if we,

2724
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:36.300
with someone like Charles Whitman,
and when you see that there's a brain tumor,

2725
02:40:36.301 --> 02:40:37.081
you recognize,
all right,

2726
02:40:37.081 --> 02:40:40.680
he's just being a guy who's got a brain tumor in the wrong place.
Right?
And,

2727
02:40:40.681 --> 02:40:43.590
and the,
and if we had a cure for it,
even after the fact,

2728
02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:47.610
that would be the appropriate thing to do.
If we had a cure for evil,

2729
02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:51.120
if we had a pill that just could make Uday Hussein a nice guy,

2730
02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:53.740
we would just give him the pill.
Right.

2731
02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:56.730
But then they're not responsible for their past actions cause they're a totally

2732
02:40:56.731 --> 02:40:59.670
different person.
Now they were seeing this pill.
Well yeah because Eh,

2733
02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:01.140
because evil is just a,

2734
02:41:01.290 --> 02:41:04.060
it's just the bad luck of having bad genes and bad neurochemistry.

2735
02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:06.600
That's a hard pill for people to swallow up there.

2736
02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:11.070
Their daughter was fed to the dogs of Uday Hussein.
That's a hard deal.

2737
02:41:11.370 --> 02:41:15.630
But he's not responsible in any way for his actions in the past because he had

2738
02:41:15.631 --> 02:41:19.020
some bad stuff going on in his child.
But then again,
look at his timeline.

2739
02:41:19.021 --> 02:41:22.770
He's not the three year old who has Saddam as a father isn't responsible.
Right.

2740
02:41:22.771 --> 02:41:25.950
So there's walking forward day by day,
month by month.

2741
02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:29.670
What can we just,
yeah,
exactly.

2742
02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:33.450
At what point his 18th birthday is that when you want to just bring down the

2743
02:41:33.451 --> 02:41:34.284
hammer on them?

2744
02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:38.520
It's an interesting question and I think it sort of highlights the great nature

2745
02:41:38.521 --> 02:41:40.200
of reality itself is that there's,
you know,

2746
02:41:40.201 --> 02:41:43.560
everybody wants everything to be black and white.
Yes and no plus and minus,

2747
02:41:43.561 --> 02:41:44.340
but it's not,

2748
02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:48.900
there's a lot of weird variables when it comes to being a human being.
And,
um,

2749
02:41:49.050 --> 02:41:52.920
I don't,
I see what you're saying,
but it's,
it's sort of a,

2750
02:41:52.921 --> 02:41:55.290
a weird argument because the pills don't exist.

2751
02:41:55.290 --> 02:41:59.190
The shot doesn't exist to turn someone from WHO's a psychopath into a good

2752
02:41:59.191 --> 02:42:03.540
person.
Well,
but that just proves,
it's just the point of concept that it makes.

2753
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:08.870
It doesn't make sense to hold someone responsible for their jeans any more than

2754
02:42:10.651 --> 02:42:14.970
it does a brain tumor.
Uh,
and if you can't,
then,
but once you start taking,

2755
02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.000
taking each of these causal factors off the table of responsibility,

2756
02:42:20.941 --> 02:42:25.890
genes,
parents,
society,
environment,
cosmic rays,

2757
02:42:26.190 --> 02:42:30.750
there's nothing left.
And you can even take the sole off of it.
You know,
the soul,

2758
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:33.710
you didn't pick your soul,
right?
Even if you think you have one,

2759
02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:37.710
you didn't make it.
And that's the problem.
And,
but again,
it doesn't change.

2760
02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:40.680
The important things that it doesn't change are things like self defense.
Yeah.

2761
02:42:40.681 --> 02:42:44.340
Esu.
You want to defend yourself against Uday Hussein.
You want to,
if,

2762
02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:46.260
if you don't have a cure for psychopathy,

2763
02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:48.990
you absolutely have to lock psychopaths up.

2764
02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:52.480
You can't let them run around harming people.
Um,

2765
02:42:53.130 --> 02:42:55.920
or psychopaths have a certain,
uh,
extremity.

2766
02:42:55.921 --> 02:42:58.760
Obviously there are a lot of psychopaths out who actually haven't harmed people.

2767
02:42:58.761 --> 02:43:03.660
They're just,
uh,
making inappropriate high eye contact.
Uh,
but the,

2768
02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:09.830
the difference is hatred and the kind of psychological suffering born of it

2769
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:17.830
doesn't make a lot of sense and a clear path to solutions should they become

2770
02:43:18.101 --> 02:43:22.540
available,
opens up so that,
you know,
it's,
it's just like there's something.

2771
02:43:22.541 --> 02:43:26.260
So clarifying about the Charles Whitman Story.
Once you,

2772
02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:30.070
once you hear about the brain tumor,
you just think,
oh man,
all right,

2773
02:43:30.071 --> 02:43:32.590
well let's just,
you know,

2774
02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:36.190
it turns out this was not evil.
We're not talking about evil.

2775
02:43:36.191 --> 02:43:38.170
We're talking about a brain tumor.
Right?
Okay.

2776
02:43:39.610 --> 02:43:42.850
What I'm saying is the more we understand the human mind,
the level of the brain,

2777
02:43:42.851 --> 02:43:47.851
the more that feeling is going to encroach on all of these.

2778
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:51.860
<v 0>But do I know enough about the human brain to really make that determination?</v>

2779
02:43:51.861 --> 02:43:54.860
Because when we're talking about where does a thought come from,
what,
what,

2780
02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:57.230
you know,
what is going on inside your mind?

2781
02:43:57.231 --> 02:44:01.760
We can very crudely look at Fmr eyes and see areas of the brain that are

2782
02:44:01.761 --> 02:44:06.200
receiving activity,
but we don't necessarily know what is going on in slack.

2783
02:44:06.410 --> 02:44:10.610
Like creativity,
for example.
What makes a John Coltrane,

2784
02:44:10.730 --> 02:44:13.370
what makes of Richard Pryor?
I mean,

2785
02:44:13.371 --> 02:44:15.920
is it just the sum of their life experiences,

2786
02:44:15.921 --> 02:44:20.600
their genetics or expression or when,
when a thought comes to mind,
like,

2787
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:21.650
okay,
put three,

2788
02:44:21.651 --> 02:44:26.060
in your case when you're writing and you're sitting in front of your computer

2789
02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:27.470
and you know,

2790
02:44:27.471 --> 02:44:32.471
I'm sure you probably have those moments where a concept or a sentence comes in,

2791
02:44:32.481 --> 02:44:35.270
it almost feels like it appears that at a midair,
right?

2792
02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:40.040
<v 3>Everything appears that emitter,
that's the other thing is that,</v>

2793
02:44:41.300 --> 02:44:46.010
I mean the other reason why I'm so committed to this is uh,

2794
02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:47.840
the subjective illusion,

2795
02:44:48.730 --> 02:44:52.730
the subjective side of the illusion can be cut through.
It's like a nick again,

2796
02:44:52.731 --> 02:44:57.270
most people starting point is we have this really robust feeling of freewill
and,

2797
02:44:57.300 --> 02:45:02.300
and self authorship and self creation and self determination and it's just as

2798
02:45:02.451 --> 02:45:05.570
hard to make it square with Charles Whitman and jeans and you know,

2799
02:45:05.571 --> 02:45:10.400
the rest of the neuro,
the neuro chemical story.
And um,
but I know I've got it.

2800
02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:12.320
You know,
by God I Know I've got this thing,

2801
02:45:12.321 --> 02:45:16.370
I can feel it right now that can be cut through.
You can actually feel it.

2802
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:19.130
You can actually feel that when you say Chicago,

2803
02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:24.530
that is as that's like me saying Chicago.
It's like me saying,
okay,

2804
02:45:24.531 --> 02:45:27.670
he's going to say Chicago now.
Uh,
and you,
it just,

2805
02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:28.970
and it coming down to your mouth

2806
02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:32.350
<v 0>consequences to these ideas.
Like picking a left hand,</v>

2807
02:45:32.351 --> 02:45:35.620
the right hand picking Chicago,
it doesn't mean anything to me.
I,

2808
02:45:35.930 --> 02:45:37.310
<v 3>well that's it.
That's just the simplest,</v>

2809
02:45:37.340 --> 02:45:39.600
the simplest case that we can easily demonstrate.
But you can,

2810
02:45:39.620 --> 02:45:41.990
you can raise the stakes as much as you want,
but it means a lot.

2811
02:45:41.991 --> 02:45:46.970
If I decide to drive drunk,
it means a lot.
If,
I mean,
if you have let,

2812
02:45:46.971 --> 02:45:50.030
but arguably you have less control.
If I,
if I ask you,
you know,

2813
02:45:50.031 --> 02:45:52.300
you and I go out now and,
and,
and,
uh,

2814
02:45:52.310 --> 02:45:56.450
have a few drinks and we're sitting around for a few hours wondering whether
our,

2815
02:45:56.460 --> 02:46:01.220
whether we're sober,
you're in a worse position to go to the talks kit.
Yeah.

2816
02:46:01.221 --> 02:46:03.230
It was like the way you look at that example then,
yeah,

2817
02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:04.660
<v 0>about speeding.
What if I'm,</v>

2818
02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:07.990
I'm at a red light and someone revs their car engine and Michael,
yeah,
bitch,

2819
02:46:07.991 --> 02:46:10.070
c'mon,
let's go and crash into someone.

2820
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:10.530
<v 3>But again,</v>

2821
02:46:10.530 --> 02:46:13.560
you have more variables there that are driving you and influencing you and you,

2822
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:18.350
and you feel like you're being led along,
around by the nose,

2823
02:46:18.351 --> 02:46:21.560
by the environment a little bit more there.
And this and this case is the,
I mean,

2824
02:46:21.561 --> 02:46:25.550
there's no stakes,
but this is as pure a moment of,

2825
02:46:25.610 --> 02:46:27.140
of agency as you're ever going to get.

2826
02:46:27.141 --> 02:46:32.120
When I say think now of a famous woman,

2827
02:46:34.010 --> 02:46:37.150
you're free to free to pick it.
Think of a bunch.
Right?
Okay.

2828
02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:40.040
And pick anyone you want just to,
and take as long as you want.

2829
02:46:40.041 --> 02:46:44.510
And just he just go back to the Lawrence.
Okay.
There you go.
Jennifer Lawrence.

2830
02:46:44.830 --> 02:46:47.570
Um,
I wonder why that is as pure.

2831
02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:52.100
That's gotta be as pure a demonstration of freedom of will as anything you're

2832
02:46:52.101 --> 02:46:55.260
going to get in life.
Now again,
nothing turns on it,
but that's,
that's pure and,

2833
02:46:55.261 --> 02:46:57.800
and less constrained by,
I don't know,
Shit.
Are you,

2834
02:46:57.801 --> 02:47:01.460
am I sober enough to drive or should I just speed or,
you know,
should I,

2835
02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:04.580
should I buy this thing or not?
Or am I going to have the doughnut?

2836
02:47:04.581 --> 02:47:07.370
And there's nothing like,
there's nothing riding on it.
So you were totally free.

2837
02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:10.010
Jesse.
You could have,
you had Jennifer Lawrence,

2838
02:47:10.011 --> 02:47:12.510
but then you had Oprah Winfrey and then you could have went back and say,

2839
02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:16.040
well then,
but what were you,
okay,
so where are you free to pick Oprah Winfrey?

2840
02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:19.220
You know who Oprah is?
Yeah.
Well Jennifer Lawrence is in the news.

2841
02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:21.230
It's one of the reasons why I picked it,
but that that's,

2842
02:47:21.770 --> 02:47:23.870
that's demonstrating a constraint that is driving you.

2843
02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:28.100
But I thought about Ann Wolfe first actually he was a boxer and I just decided

2844
02:47:28.101 --> 02:47:32.740
it's too obscure.
Right.
It would've been lost on me.
Yeah.
Um,

2845
02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:34.370
I just think that,

2846
02:47:34.970 --> 02:47:39.770
I agree with you without a doubt that there most certainly are a bunch of

2847
02:47:39.771 --> 02:47:44.480
factors involved in who a person is and many of them are outside of your
control.

2848
02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:45.670
But,
but when I asked you at missing,

2849
02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:48.590
the point you're missing here is that I'm not asking you,
I mean,

2850
02:47:48.591 --> 02:47:51.560
you can grant all of that,
the fact that they're those factors,

2851
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:56.590
but what I'm saying is that you can subjectively experience the absence of free

2852
02:47:57.001 --> 02:48:00.680
will in that moment of picking Jennifer Lawrence.
You can,

2853
02:48:00.681 --> 02:48:02.990
you can subjectively no longer feel like,

2854
02:48:02.991 --> 02:48:04.880
like the problem of free will really goes away.

2855
02:48:04.881 --> 02:48:06.960
You no longer have this problem of,
I see what you're saying.
No,

2856
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:10.220
I've got this thing and I can't figure out how to make it square with reality.

2857
02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:15.980
Jennifer Lawrence just comes out of the ether and the evil of the Internet.
Yeah.

2858
02:48:15.981 --> 02:48:19.490
And even if you deliberate,
she,
no matter how many times you go back and forth,

2859
02:48:19.491 --> 02:48:23.450
what the fact that you've set finally settle on her as opposed to somebody else

2860
02:48:24.020 --> 02:48:27.440
is inexplicably.
While I was trying to be funny,
that's why I went with her,

2861
02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:29.990
cause she's naked pictures of her all over the Internet today.

2862
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:34.130
I don't know if you're aware.
I,
I have a loop.
I heard that somebody,

2863
02:48:34.131 --> 02:48:35.850
it was like some bunch of them,
some ice,

2864
02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:40.460
some apple hacking thing and the rally is not,
apparently it may be a,

2865
02:48:40.461 --> 02:48:41.690
that might be a factor,

2866
02:48:41.691 --> 02:48:45.470
but apparently people who have been collecting images off of people's computers

2867
02:48:45.471 --> 02:48:47.680
and because there's not just her,
it's,
it's a bunch of celebrities.

2868
02:48:47.690 --> 02:48:48.700
Bunch of celebrities.
Yeah.

2869
02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:54.200
I see what you're saying and I agree with you mostly.
Uh,

2870
02:48:54.201 --> 02:48:56.960
I don't disagree with you really.
Uh,

2871
02:48:57.020 --> 02:49:00.680
I'm just sort of bouncing it around inside my head.
So when I,
when I say,

2872
02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:01.461
but what about this?

2873
02:49:01.461 --> 02:49:04.920
But what about that I'm doing that as much for myself as I am to to,

2874
02:49:05.490 --> 02:49:08.120
I'm not trying to disprove your point.
Um,

2875
02:49:08.370 --> 02:49:13.230
I think there's so many variables as to what makes a person to,

2876
02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:18.000
to tribute any,
anything to one thing,
whether it's discipline or whether it's a,

2877
02:49:18.390 --> 02:49:22.200
whether it's life experience,
whether it's what makes a man great,

2878
02:49:22.201 --> 02:49:25.800
what makes a woman fantastic,
what makes someone creative?
I don't know.

2879
02:49:26.260 --> 02:49:29.600
I think to boil it down to simply,
uh,

2880
02:49:29.940 --> 02:49:34.200
chemicals in the mind and neurosynapse is firing left or right.

2881
02:49:34.380 --> 02:49:37.380
I don't know.
I don't,
I think it's both.

2882
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:39.990
I have a feeling that it's not just,

2883
02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:44.460
I don't think it's just determinism.
I think there's determinism,

2884
02:49:44.461 --> 02:49:46.830
but there's all this also mean you could,

2885
02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:49.680
your life changes based on whether or not eat a salad,

2886
02:49:49.940 --> 02:49:52.920
you need a sound or eat a bowl of pasta.
But I had a bowl of pasta.

2887
02:49:52.921 --> 02:49:55.890
You're just throwing in more neurochemistry there.
Yeah.
Without a doubt.
Yeah,

2888
02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:59.860
no doubt.
But what is the decision to eat that salad is the decision.

2889
02:49:59.930 --> 02:50:02.940
I decided today I want to be a healthier,
better person.

2890
02:50:03.150 --> 02:50:05.870
What's making me decide that this is just neurochemistry?
I mean,

2891
02:50:05.871 --> 02:50:09.090
is it just synapses is just my environment,
my life experiences.

2892
02:50:09.091 --> 02:50:09.930
If that's the case,

2893
02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:15.200
then the human beings are fucking robots where we will most certainly most of my

2894
02:50:15.570 --> 02:50:18.440
intention robot.
Yeah.
But that doesn't think it's,

2895
02:50:18.450 --> 02:50:22.020
that doesn't take out any of the good stuff of life.
So even if you,

2896
02:50:23.310 --> 02:50:24.360
from my point of view,

2897
02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:29.850
nothing important is lost here and something ethical is gained.
I mean,

2898
02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:33.960
so for instance,
that the possibility of having compassion for even,

2899
02:50:33.961 --> 02:50:36.960
even for evil people loving your enemy,
you know,

2900
02:50:36.961 --> 02:50:38.460
being like Jesus in that respect,

2901
02:50:38.850 --> 02:50:43.850
which makes absolutely no sense until you actually see a basis for having

2902
02:50:45.481 --> 02:50:48.930
compassion for someone like Uday Hussein.
Um,

2903
02:50:49.470 --> 02:50:53.490
I feel like that opens up based on this consideration,
but nothing else changes.

2904
02:50:53.491 --> 02:50:58.390
You know,
if Uday Hussein walked into the room,
you know,
you know,
I,
Eh,

2905
02:50:58.470 --> 02:51:01.920
I would put a bullet in him in self defense as quickly as the next guy.
I mean,

2906
02:51:01.921 --> 02:51:04.950
so it's just though that doesn't change,
but it's,

2907
02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:09.270
it is the difference between,
let me guess.

2908
02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:12.600
Someone like who Davis Jane is a malfunctioning robot.
You know,
he's a,

2909
02:51:12.601 --> 02:51:14.400
he's a grizzly bear.
So in that sense,

2910
02:51:14.401 --> 02:51:18.570
we really are just a product of our environments.
We are really are just numbers.

2911
02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:22.680
We really are just a sea of variables.
But we're also,
but we're,

2912
02:51:22.770 --> 02:51:25.800
we are consciousness subjectively speaking,

2913
02:51:25.801 --> 02:51:27.480
we are consciousness and its contents.

2914
02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:31.200
Now we know that there's a lot of unconscious massively affected by those Sia

2915
02:51:31.201 --> 02:51:35.820
variables and in fact cannot be detached from those Sia variables.
Yeah.

2916
02:51:35.821 --> 02:51:38.550
And yet it's as beautiful as you ever want it to be.
And it's a,

2917
02:51:38.551 --> 02:51:42.090
it's as profound as you want it to be.
It's not,
it doesn't become less profound.

2918
02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:47.130
And the spooky stuff that people want to introduce it doesn't actually amp up

2919
02:51:47.131 --> 02:51:50.010
the profundity.
It makes it,
it makes it less profound.
Well,

2920
02:51:50.011 --> 02:51:54.330
it actually makes us more responsible for engineering a healthy society because

2921
02:51:54.331 --> 02:51:59.280
we have to be aware of all the variables that are involved in every single human

2922
02:51:59.281 --> 02:52:01.170
beings developmental process.

2923
02:52:01.500 --> 02:52:04.350
And the more we can mitigate the negative ones,

2924
02:52:04.351 --> 02:52:06.190
the better we can make our society.

2925
02:52:06.430 --> 02:52:11.430
<v 0>And that doesn't really discount the idea of people being responsible for their</v>

2926
02:52:11.651 --> 02:52:14.310
actions or punishing people or

2927
02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:16.060
<v 3>removing people.
Not at all.
Not at all.</v>

2928
02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:20.920
We're saying it because punishment has its effects and,
but,
but,

2929
02:52:20.921 --> 02:52:23.530
but now we're now we're free to see that.

2930
02:52:23.531 --> 02:52:26.650
We just want the punishments that have the effects we want.
We don't,
we can,

2931
02:52:26.651 --> 02:52:30.490
we can get rid of retribution and vengeance and we can just think,
okay,

2932
02:52:30.491 --> 02:52:31.630
what kind of world we want to live in.

2933
02:52:31.631 --> 02:52:35.770
And so maybe punishing people in certain ways,
um,

2934
02:52:36.050 --> 02:52:39.510
can be justified totally on pragmatic lines because it has a certain effect that

2935
02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:43.420
deter a certain crimes.
It makes them better people,
whatever it,

2936
02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:46.090
whatever those punishments are.
Let's say they,
they exist,

2937
02:52:46.540 --> 02:52:50.380
then you don't need us to a retributive story.
You just have a story of,
you know,

2938
02:52:50.381 --> 02:52:51.620
we want,
we want fewer car.

2939
02:52:51.621 --> 02:52:56.500
Jackings and we want the car jackers to be better people.
So we're going to do x,

2940
02:52:56.501 --> 02:52:58.080
Y,
andZ and,
and,

2941
02:52:58.090 --> 02:53:02.920
and deter carjacking on the one hand and rehabilitate carjacker car jackings and

2942
02:53:02.980 --> 02:53:03.813
carjackers on the other.

2943
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:08.910
<v 0>And another way that also highlights the really truly unethical practices of</v>

2944
02:53:10.210 --> 02:53:13.000
privatized prisons,
uh,
of,

2945
02:53:13.001 --> 02:53:18.001
of things along those lines where you are purposely setting up laws in order to

2946
02:53:19.391 --> 02:53:22.330
victimize people to make it so that you know,
like you're playing a game,

2947
02:53:22.540 --> 02:53:26.200
you make it so that there,
there are pitfalls if they fall those pits.
Ooh Look,

2948
02:53:26.201 --> 02:53:30.050
I caught a beaver,
he fell into my trap.
And incentives are all wrong incentives.

2949
02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:32.770
That's one thing that uh,
I mean what you just said was,

2950
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:37.660
was very important that seeing this co kind of web work

2951
02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:42.780
<v 3>causality makes us more responsible for aligning society and all of its</v>

2952
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:48.730
incentives more wisely so as to make better people.
And I mean,

2953
02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:53.080
this I think is the biggest problem of our time are really anytime we have

2954
02:53:53.081 --> 02:53:57.960
systems where incentives are a poorly aligned,
where we,
where we were

2955
02:53:58.070 --> 02:54:03.070
<v 0>even good people are attempted to be terrible because of the profit motive in</v>

2956
02:54:03.381 --> 02:54:06.560
the system or because,
or they're very issue of our law itself.

2957
02:54:06.561 --> 02:54:10.760
Like when you have a prosecutor who's entire,
your,
your,

2958
02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:15.500
your reputation is built on winning.
Yeah.

2959
02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:17.370
So it doesn't matter if he's innocent.

2960
02:54:17.590 --> 02:54:22.040
[inaudible] happened to win a massive amount of cases and a massive amount of

2961
02:54:22.041 --> 02:54:25.700
cases.
They're well aware that it's possible they could be wrong,

2962
02:54:25.820 --> 02:54:30.290
but their job is to prosecute.
The same can be said for a defense lawyer.

2963
02:54:30.530 --> 02:54:33.830
The defense lawyer could be aware that their client is probably lying,

2964
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:37.280
but they must defend that client to the best of their ability,

2965
02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:39.980
including manipulating witnesses,

2966
02:54:39.981 --> 02:54:43.100
including the way they communicate with these witnesses to try to lead them down

2967
02:54:43.101 --> 02:54:47.870
certain paths to get him to say things that might be misconstrued by the jury.

2968
02:54:48.380 --> 02:54:53.380
All those things become more unethical if you look at the,

2969
02:54:54.570 --> 02:54:56.090
this concept of determinism.

2970
02:54:56.380 --> 02:55:00.730
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
Uh,
yeah.
Aligned incentives are,</v>

2971
02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:04.070
are,
are huge.
And I mean that,
that one is

2972
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:08.930
<v 0>a,
is a classic case where what you'll get from defense attorneys is a very</v>

2973
02:55:08.931 --> 02:55:11.860
strenuous defense of even the get,

2974
02:55:11.861 --> 02:55:13.790
you know that even the guilty need representation.

2975
02:55:13.791 --> 02:55:17.180
And I mean our adversarial system completely depends on my giving the best

2976
02:55:17.181 --> 02:55:20.210
possible defense of Jeffrey Dahmer.
I can,

2977
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:24.260
even though I know that if I succeed and I sure hope I to succeed,

2978
02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:27.450
he's going to go off and cannibalize more people.
Um,

2979
02:55:28.310 --> 02:55:30.760
I think there's a pro ethical problem with that and,
and it,

2980
02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:34.430
but it's set up by the problem on the other side where you have a prosecutorial

2981
02:55:34.431 --> 02:55:34.791
system,

2982
02:55:34.791 --> 02:55:39.410
which is really not that concerned about send locking up an innocent person for

2983
02:55:39.411 --> 02:55:40.130
the rest of his life.

2984
02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:45.130
So it's a sense the system itself is so inherently flawed that it's all,

2985
02:55:46.210 --> 02:55:50.090
it almost would be tossed out and it should be where no one has an incentive,

2986
02:55:50.091 --> 02:55:52.490
whether then that person is guilty or innocent.

2987
02:55:52.820 --> 02:55:54.650
I mean that would be the most ethical way.

2988
02:55:54.651 --> 02:55:56.420
You just want to get to the truth and whatever,

2989
02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:59.060
whatever system is going to track the truth best.

2990
02:55:59.061 --> 02:56:00.700
I think this is the system we want them.

2991
02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:02.870
It's like you shouldn't be able to hire a Johnny Cochran.

2992
02:56:02.871 --> 02:56:04.700
You shouldn't be able to hire a Robert Shapiro.

2993
02:56:04.701 --> 02:56:06.860
They're too good at manipulating reality.

2994
02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:10.700
What you should do is you should have some sort of a system where you have

2995
02:56:10.701 --> 02:56:14.810
people that have no dog in the fight and these people have no,

2996
02:56:14.850 --> 02:56:17.690
there's no financial motive to make you guilty or innocent.

2997
02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:21.260
Like the idea of a jury system is also equally flawed because you're picking all

2998
02:56:21.261 --> 02:56:24.680
these people.
He sit down with them.
How do you feel about capital punishment?

2999
02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:27.920
How do you feel about birth control?
How do you feel about this?

3000
02:56:27.921 --> 02:56:28.910
That the other thing,
you know,

3001
02:56:29.010 --> 02:56:31.740
you ask him all these questions and then you pick the,
the,
the,

3002
02:56:31.750 --> 02:56:34.740
the defense and the prosecution gets to pick,
you know,

3003
02:56:34.820 --> 02:56:39.410
from all these people based on their decisions with the idea being that this is

3004
02:56:39.411 --> 02:56:41.150
our likelihood for success.

3005
02:56:41.330 --> 02:56:45.860
If we go with these people and they have like a whole algorithm based on like

3006
02:56:45.861 --> 02:56:49.190
what answers they were there trying to get from these,
these various people.

3007
02:56:49.610 --> 02:56:50.091
That's a,

3008
02:56:50.091 --> 02:56:53.810
that's a really big hole in the system that's sort of highlighted by these
ideas.

3009
02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:58.840
This idea that someone has that you can benefit financially from some of being

3010
02:56:59.210 --> 02:57:03.730
innocent or guilty.
Yeah.
And if we had a,
a reliable lie detector,

3011
02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:07.460
this whole problem would go away.
Well,
will be eventually.
Maybe,
you know,

3012
02:57:07.461 --> 02:57:10.070
I know that,
uh,
I talked to you about this before.

3013
02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:13.400
One of your colleagues was on my Pamela everything.
I'm with Douglas.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3014
02:57:13.401 --> 02:57:18.401
With the FM Ri results of someone being arrested and prosecuted in India because

3015
02:57:19.491 --> 02:57:23.060
they had functional knowledge of a crime scene and well that was a troubling

3016
02:57:23.061 --> 02:57:26.450
case.
It seems premature,
you know,
we're,
we're running out of time here.

3017
02:57:26.660 --> 02:57:29.030
All right man.
Thank you very much.
Pleasure.

3018
02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:31.820
Bunch of people's minds and freaked a bunch of people out and I'm sure people

3019
02:57:31.821 --> 02:57:34.400
are going crazy writing blogs,

3020
02:57:34.430 --> 02:57:38.120
responding to comments all over the Internet and uh,

3021
02:57:38.121 --> 02:57:41.030
whoever that guy is that you had the issue with telling the fucking lighten up.

3022
02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:42.201
Sam Harris,

3023
02:57:42.201 --> 02:57:46.730
waking up a guide to spirituality and that spirituality should be in quotes,

3024
02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:50.450
put scare quotes on it without religion and it's available now.

3025
02:57:50.451 --> 02:57:54.320
I got a copy of it right here.
Is it on a audio book as well?
It's a,

3026
02:57:54.321 --> 02:57:59.010
it's available.
It's on sale next week or week early as an audio book to autumn.

3027
02:57:59.130 --> 02:58:01.980
Are you reading it?
Yes.
Oh Great.
Excellent.
I love that.

3028
02:58:01.981 --> 02:58:04.860
I don't like it when some act to read someone else's book,

3029
02:58:04.861 --> 02:58:06.900
but they do that a lot.
Some amazingly hard to do.

3030
02:58:06.901 --> 02:58:09.840
I don't know if you would be probably better at it than I am,
but I,

3031
02:58:09.841 --> 02:58:11.700
I found it incredibly hard to do.

3032
02:58:11.700 --> 02:58:14.400
It's really humbling to realize that people do this professionally with other

3033
02:58:14.401 --> 02:58:17.810
people's books.
I mean,
it's,
it's amazing.
What was hard about it?
It's just I,

3034
02:58:17.811 --> 02:58:18.260
you know,
I,

3035
02:58:18.260 --> 02:58:23.260
I find that I inadvertently have written tongue twisters into my pro there.

3036
02:58:24.230 --> 02:58:25.080
There were a few sentences.

3037
02:58:25.081 --> 02:58:27.450
I literally had to change words because I couldn't get through them.

3038
02:58:27.451 --> 02:58:30.780
It was like a Cirque de Solei act that I couldn't perform really just to read

3039
02:58:30.781 --> 02:58:32.400
the sentence.
Well that's interesting because yeah,
