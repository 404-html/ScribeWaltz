00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Hello Barry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>And that we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this.</v>

5
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

6
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a very fortuitous your timing comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the middle of this big hubbub</v>

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>about this native American elder in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>young boy with one of those stupid</v>

8
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 1>fucking red hats on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you have ever imagined that a</v>

9
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>slogan make America great again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would be so divisive as somehow or</v>

10
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>another like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be like make America great</v>

11
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like they just want to make</v>

12
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.200
<v Speaker 1>things great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all positive.</v>

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>No red hat with white letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been a time like that</v>

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>where an object like a red hat with</v>
<v Speaker 1>white letters was so repulsive to half</v>

15
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>the country?</v>

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

17
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean some people see it as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of a white hood.</v>

18
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

19
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

20
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Do they do what they believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing it,</v>

21
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 2>wearing it that a 16 year old wearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hat sort of carries intense moral</v>

22
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 2>weight that surely we know that a 16</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old is not aware of all the</v>

23
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 2>implications of wearing that hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that is Kanye wears</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

25
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

26
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

27
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying there are people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>really make that argument.</v>

28
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the people who are paid for their</v>

29
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.473
<v Speaker 2>opinions.</v>

30
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

31
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also people that are calling for</v>

32
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:31.611
<v Speaker 1>this child's name and address or calling</v>
<v Speaker 1>to docs him and publicly expose him.</v>

33
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>This is a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 16.</v>

34
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he is?</v>

35
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 2>He's 16 years old and it was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that was just so amazing about</v>

36
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 2>the whole brouhaha around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was even a way like this</v>

37
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 2>perfect encapsulation of our outrage</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

38
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people saw a tiny clip of this</v>

39
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:55.131
<v Speaker 2>video and it was like a Rorschach test</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw in it this morality play of what</v>

40
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 2>would it look to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a group of mostly white kids from</v>

41
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Coventry Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in Kentucky and it looked</v>

42
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 2>like at first glance that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>smirking and smug and had these sort of</v>

43
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 2>shifting and grins on their faces and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were surrounding this older</v>

44
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 2>native American man and I have to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

45
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I had a visceral reaction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second I saw it,</v>

46
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 2>like so many other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

47
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 2>where we are in our broken culture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're bullying this guy and here's the</v>

49
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>rise of the.</v>

50
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I had all of those reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The challenge of what it means to be a</v>

51
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 2>journalist is to not see people as</v>
<v Speaker 2>signifiers or as stand ins just based on</v>

52
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 2>their identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what like 94,</v>

53
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 2>95 percent of the press corps did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sort of leapt to the leap to assume</v>

54
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>are visceral reaction was accurate when</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact when you actually looked at like</v>

56
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 2>the two hour video of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction,</v>

57
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 2>which also included this group of black</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel lights or Hebrew Israelites,</v>

58
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 2>they called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not that at all.</v>

59
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>The native American man had walked up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group,</v>

60
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>the four other guys had been heckling</v>
<v Speaker 2>the group beforehand,</v>

61
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>calling them crackers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling them Satan,</v>

62
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 2>calling the one black kid in the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that can't even be said.</v>

63
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>So it was just far more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

64
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was really,</v>

65
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:25.231
<v Speaker 2>really disheartening is that the initial</v>
<v Speaker 2>outrage was enough for the mainstream</v>

66
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 2>press to report on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like twitter has kind of become almost</v>

67
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:35.461
<v Speaker 2>an assigning editor for places like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York Times and the Washington Post</v>

68
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 2>and the Wall Street Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when the actual truth of the</v>

69
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 2>thing comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we move past the outrage cycle,</v>

70
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.830
<v Speaker 2>they have to sort of write the followup</v>
<v Speaker 2>story to the fake outrage to begin with.</v>

71
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm defending the fake outrage instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of backing up and saying we made a</v>

72
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:51.864
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

73
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

74
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.350
<v Speaker 2>some people said that they made a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

75
00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>That's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good sign.</v>

76
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

77
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.610
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that was so horrifying</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that people that are supposed to be</v>

78
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 2>adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 2>people with blue check marks on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying things like,</v>

80
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 2>this is the face of white patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 16 year old kid</v>

81
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>raise the US on set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen him more punchable</v>

82
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 2>face?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Griffin was saying,</v>

83
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I need names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame him.</v>

84
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Docs him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do these people not understand the</v>

85
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 2>implications of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened over the weekend was</v>

86
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:32.071
<v Speaker 2>sleuthy detectives on twitter found a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid who they thought was the kid in the</v>

88
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't actually the kid.</v>

89
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 2>So there's the actual kid who was docs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The family was harassed.</v>

90
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Everything that we now know happens in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these outreach cycles.</v>

91
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 2>But then there was another kid who looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspiciously like him who was not him at</v>

92
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose family.</v>

93
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>There was an amazing and heartbreaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter thread about it,</v>

94
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 2>whose family was in the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>family wedding and they spend their</v>

95
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 2>whole weekend fighting off these mobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were trying to destroy them.</v>

96
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't even the kid in the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

97
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 2>that is really horrifying to me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where we are and the fact that</v>

98
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:11.881
<v Speaker 2>adults who should know better or</v>
<v Speaker 2>fomenting this and don't see how thin</v>

99
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.270
<v Speaker 2>like the v s sounds heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like the veneer of civilization is</v>

100
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 2>like they're taking a pickax to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>

101
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I just found the whole thing to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying.</v>

102
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you felt</v>

103
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same way and I think it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unique moment because it's so</v>

104
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>public and it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so prevalent in whether it's</v>

105
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:40.050
<v Speaker 1>twitter or facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere and it sort of embodies</v>

106
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.140
<v Speaker 1>everything that's wrong with a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuance and with people taking one side</v>

107
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:49.860
<v Speaker 1>versus the other and sticking with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with not confronting their own personal</v>

108
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:54.861
<v Speaker 1>biases with looking at these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of this is the enemy.</v>

109
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the good side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on the bad side.</v>

110
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also this,</v>

111
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.250
<v Speaker 1>this distorted idea of what it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to be violent.</v>

112
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Like this idea of this is a punchable</v>
<v Speaker 1>person like calling for violence.</v>

113
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.061
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

114
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing a lot of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

115
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that troubles</v>
<v Speaker 1>me so much about the left.</v>

116
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>My family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents were hippies.</v>

117
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up when I was a little kid.</v>

118
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>We lived from age of seven to 11 and San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco during the Vietnam War.</v>

119
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>While the Vietnam War was ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in the middle of the hippie</v>

120
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always felt that people on the left,</v>

121
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 1>we're like these well read kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate people,</v>

122
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the last few years,</v>

123
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>people on the left are calling for</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

124
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>This is very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very confusing to me,</v>

125
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this frivolous social media call</v>

126
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 1>for violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an in person,</v>

127
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.670
<v Speaker 1>be their boots on the ground call for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

128
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange call for Violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punch Nazis.</v>

129
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing this all the time because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right,</v>

130
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 1>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

131
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.320
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to say is what does a</v>

132
00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Nazi okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you mean punch actual Nazis that are</v>

133
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>putting Jews in the concentration camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you,</v>

134
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>but when you call a guy with a Maga hat</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

135
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 1>he wears one of those red hats and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an asshole.</v>

136
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>He's a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

137
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>some guy who maybe is not that educated</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be a contrarian,</v>

138
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 1>sees all these liberals that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining all the time so it puts this</v>

139
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>red hat on and now he's a white</v>
<v Speaker 1>supremacist and a Nazi and you want to</v>

140
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 1>punch him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

141
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.150
<v Speaker 2>that's with a lot of people in very high</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions of power in this country,</v>

142
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.420
<v Speaker 2>at least in the culture actually believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't understand the</v>

143
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.610
<v Speaker 2>implications of hollowing out words like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

144
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I know this personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

145
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm called alt right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm called an apologist for rape</v>

146
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:53.680
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been called everything.</v>

147
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm a centrist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

148
00:07:56.621 --> 00:08:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Jewish center left on most things.</v>

149
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Person who lives on the upper west side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Manhattan and you know it's super</v>

150
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 2>socially liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal on pretty much any issue you</v>

151
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:10.450
<v Speaker 2>want to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm alt right,</v>

152
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.360
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What words do we have left for people</v>

153
00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:15.970
<v Speaker 2>that actually are that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what words do we have left for</v>

154
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:20.971
<v Speaker 2>people who actually are part of a sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of racist blood and soil nativism that's</v>

155
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:25.240
<v Speaker 2>rising in this country and around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world that should terrify people that</v>

156
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:28.570
<v Speaker 2>are using that language in the sloppiest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ways.</v>

157
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think they're seeing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>implications of it.</v>

158
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I also think that when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're just,</v>

159
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your keyboard warrior and you're just</v>

160
00:08:37.991 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 2>tossing this stuff out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of it is about signaling to your</v>

161
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:46.591
<v Speaker 2>tribe that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this thing is bad and I really</v>

162
00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:51.670
<v Speaker 2>don't think people are understanding the</v>
<v Speaker 2>implications of this and I don't think</v>

163
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a stretch to imagine something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happening a week,</v>

164
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 2>two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a month,</v>

165
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>two months from now and someone actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting killed.</v>

166
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Charlottesville mean.</v>

167
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar to what happened there.</v>

168
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.491
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

169
00:09:03.491 --> 00:09:06.580
<v Speaker 1>this kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when that guy drove over those</v>

170
00:09:06.581 --> 00:09:09.910
<v Speaker 1>protesters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ramping up of the dialogue on both</v>

171
00:09:09.911 --> 00:09:10.691
<v Speaker 1>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rhetoric,</v>

172
00:09:10.691 --> 00:09:14.710
<v Speaker 1>the violent talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so disturbing and so unnecessary.</v>

173
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it's disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like calling someone like you alright or</v>

174
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.060
<v Speaker 1>me cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get called alt right adjacent.</v>

175
00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one all the time.</v>

176
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I'd go left on everything basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>except guns.</v>

177
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a few things that I'm like</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeal the second amendment.</v>

178
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

179
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.890
<v Speaker 1>I do think that there should be some</v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions for gun use.</v>

180
00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Just like I think there should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions for car use.</v>

181
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I actually think there should be testing</v>
<v Speaker 1>for guns and you should have to go look.</v>

182
00:09:43.391 --> 00:09:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You have to go through a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to take driver's Ed to get a</v>

183
00:09:46.721 --> 00:09:48.850
<v Speaker 1>car license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come you don't have to do any,</v>

184
00:09:48.851 --> 00:09:50.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do anything to get a</v>

185
00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:52.390
<v Speaker 1>gun like you once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not a criminal,</v>

186
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:55.780
<v Speaker 1>you just get a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to know how to take</v>

187
00:09:55.781 --> 00:09:58.480
<v Speaker 1>care of it and clean it and sit safely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Handle it.</v>

188
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.040
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to know the ethics of</v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

189
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to know anything.</v>

190
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.200
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

191
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just spent six weeks in Australia</v>

192
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 2>where they had basically one major</v>
<v Speaker 2>massacre 20 years ago and then I forget</v>

193
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.190
<v Speaker 2>who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could look it up,</v>

194
00:10:12.191 --> 00:10:15.130
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prime minister conservative got rid of</v>

195
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:15.964
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

196
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think we're insane and psychotic</v>

197
00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:20.830
<v Speaker 2>the way that we live where we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely weird.</v>

198
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.080
<v Speaker 2>The thing also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one other thing that,</v>

199
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.550
<v Speaker 2>that</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped out to me about the Catholic</v>

200
00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:31.840
<v Speaker 2>school boy incident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of signifies something broader</v>

201
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:36.010
<v Speaker 2>that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the eraser of the individual,</v>

202
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.310
<v Speaker 2>which is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a horrifying problem in our</v>

203
00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:44.170
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what actually happened was one our</v>

204
00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:48.370
<v Speaker 2>incident on a random afternoon in</v>
<v Speaker 2>January between a group of individuals.</v>

205
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But instead in our mind,</v>

206
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.860
<v Speaker 2>why was everyone there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The boys were there for the march for</v>

207
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

208
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why the Hebrew Israelites</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there,</v>

209
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's DC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're crazy protesters all the</v>

210
00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:01.370
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

211
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Lincoln memorial and outside of</v>

212
00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:05.590
<v Speaker 2>the White House were there for a school</v>
<v Speaker 2>event?</v>

213
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Is that what we're there for the march</v>
<v Speaker 2>for life as part of their school and</v>

214
00:11:08.591 --> 00:11:11.260
<v Speaker 2>they had like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been had free time I think.</v>

215
00:11:11.261 --> 00:11:14.320
<v Speaker 2>And then we're converging at the Lincoln</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memorial.</v>

216
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.970
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have a chaperone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

217
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.900
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the teachers,</v>

218
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.280
<v Speaker 2>there was a teacher there and they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked the teacher at one point in order</v>

219
00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:25.000
<v Speaker 2>to drown out the heckling of the Hebrew</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israelites,</v>

220
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm getting the name of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>group right.</v>

221
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Could we do a school cheer to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore them?</v>

222
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.280
<v Speaker 2>And they did that and I think they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with permission from the teachers</v>

223
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.360
<v Speaker 2>at one point early on it was rumored</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were chanting build the wall,</v>

224
00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:40.690
<v Speaker 2>but no one has surfaced any evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whatsoever.</v>

225
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I heard from the native</v>

226
00:11:41.861 --> 00:11:44.530
<v Speaker 1>American elder when he was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation in the video.</v>

227
00:11:44.531 --> 00:11:46.300
<v Speaker 1>He said they were chanting out build</v>

228
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.000
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just haven't seen anything and I've</v>

229
00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:49.834
<v Speaker 2>watched every video.</v>

230
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.420
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible there also 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

231
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Make your friends</v>

232
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 3>laugh and they're assholes and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just being silly and stupid.</v>

233
00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have to say,</v>

234
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 3>as someone who was a total nerd in high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

235
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.710
<v Speaker 3>I saw the face of the main kid in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>still photograph and that video and like</v>

236
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 3>the 14 and 15 year old girl in me with</v>
<v Speaker 3>like enraged,</v>

237
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.850
<v Speaker 3>really like I was like I see the face of</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many kids who said the nastiest</v>

238
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 3>things to me and who through friends of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine into garbage cans,</v>

239
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like disgusting bullying.</v>

240
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Was it because the thing is you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to the next step if you're a jerk.</v>

241
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.683
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we was.</v>

242
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

243
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

244
00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 3>If he's just standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the hat face.</v>

245
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even still if it's a group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he put the.</v>

246
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:43.110
<v Speaker 3>My thing is like your initial reaction</v>
<v Speaker 3>to something is not the truth.</v>

247
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.620
<v Speaker 3>It's your emotional reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And anyone who calls themselves a</v>

248
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 3>journalist like your job is to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the facts of the case.</v>

249
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Not to make this into a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>identitarian morality play.</v>

250
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.680
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that so many people in so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many publications did just that.</v>

251
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the real facts surfaced,</v>

252
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 3>just sort of dug their heels in and were</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically like,</v>

253
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a stand in for the white</v>

254
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.610
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

255
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

256
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Like there was an actual buzzfeed writer</v>
<v Speaker 3>that said it.</v>

257
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 3>It's the look of white patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his face.</v>

258
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 3>You're really going to put that on a 16</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old,</v>

259
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.011
<v Speaker 3>would we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

260
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 3>it's just nuts to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

261
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 3>it's cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a denial of the individual.</v>

262
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:31.930
<v Speaker 3>It's very cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're 16 years old,</v>

263
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:34.420
<v Speaker 3>you're basically a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what the fuck you're</v>

264
00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:36.130
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're incredibly susceptible to the</v>

265
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 3>influence of your peers.</v>

266
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.370
<v Speaker 3>You're around a bunch of other boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not around girls cause you don't</v>

267
00:13:40.371 --> 00:13:43.120
<v Speaker 3>go to school with girls because he goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>some wacky religious school,</v>

268
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.283
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That this is,</v>

269
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to really be a social justice</v>

270
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:48.550
<v Speaker 3>warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really want to save the world.</v>

271
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.740
<v Speaker 3>How about you do something about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic Church?</v>

272
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Everyone wants to go after our Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

273
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 3>But how about the Catholic Church?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about the number one kid fucking</v>

274
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 3>organization of all times?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

275
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was raised Catholic,</v>

276
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did anything happen?</v>

277
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 3>And nothing happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got lucky,</v>

278
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 3>but I know people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a bunch of people.</v>

279
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 3>I know a bunch of people with stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is all over the world.</v>

280
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these kids come from that Colt.</v>

281
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if that was not the Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 3>church.</v>

282
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 3>If it was insead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology,</v>

283
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.061
<v Speaker 3>we will be going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

284
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 3>these kids are a part of a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went there.</v>

285
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:26.230
<v Speaker 3>They were part of this weird cult that</v>
<v Speaker 3>suppresses sexuality amongst its priests</v>

286
00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:31.231
<v Speaker 3>and encourages the placement of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>pedophile priests in new places in order</v>

287
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 3>to get away from whatever crime they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>committed in the area where they were</v>

288
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 3>initially established.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what the Catholic church is,</v>

289
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they travel all over the place,</v>

290
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.270
<v Speaker 3>but it also is good people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the.</v>

291
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.780
<v Speaker 3>This is where the nuance comes into</v>
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>

292
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.060
<v Speaker 3>It's good people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of people that are</v>

293
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Catholics because they want a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>with God or the universe or love or</v>

294
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like it's a good moral</v>

295
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 3>framework for their children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take them there,</v>

296
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 3>they believe in the 10 commandments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe in this moral structure for</v>

297
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 3>society that's laid down by what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe is God.</v>

298
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.340
<v Speaker 3>There's great people that are involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Catholic church,</v>

299
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.800
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the number one kid fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>organization the world.</v>

300
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 3>It's those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

301
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So these kids are a part of something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's way worse than smirking at a</v>

302
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 3>native American with a drum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in my opinion,</v>

303
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 3>being A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was 16,</v>

304
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I was a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a dumb person,</v>

305
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was bullied,</v>

306
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I was little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small and I learned martial arts when I</v>

307
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:33.960
<v Speaker 3>was 15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

308
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it was a dick to some people</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because I can get away with it.</v>

309
00:15:36.331 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really remember it,</v>

310
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 3>but I'm definitely girls differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are dicks.</v>

311
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:42.640
<v Speaker 3>You're trying it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

312
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 3>you don't even know how to talk yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You basically just learning words and</v>

313
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 3>this kid with this guy beating the drum</v>
<v Speaker 3>inches from his face.</v>

314
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.020
<v Speaker 3>He handled it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe way better than I was.</v>

315
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see.</v>

316
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

317
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

318
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.200
<v Speaker 3>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 pop punk.</v>

319
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 3>When I was 16 to also I was competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing a lot of martial arts</v>

320
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe I would've kept it together</v>

321
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:10.550
<v Speaker 3>better than I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking I would have,</v>

322
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely was a fucking idiot and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 16.</v>

323
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just don't.</v>

324
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 3>And who knows what's going on that day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

325
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have the anxiety about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future of your girlfriend broke up with</v>

326
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:27.311
<v Speaker 3>you or you failed the test or what else</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is like bouncing around inside your</v>

327
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overwhelming your ability to form</v>

328
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.500
<v Speaker 3>reasonable thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way that everyone's initial.</v>

329
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Not everyone's every liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

330
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone on the center and center left</v>

331
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 3>and even the center reits reaction to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was accurate that he was a little</v>

332
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.750
<v Speaker 3>asshole and he's a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic,</v>

333
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:51.260
<v Speaker 3>transphobic hates immigrants in every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single thing.</v>

334
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Does that deserve to be news that a 16</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old kid with those views smirked at</v>

335
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 3>a native American elder?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially considering what he actually</v>

336
00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:01.634
<v Speaker 3>did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

337
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

338
00:17:04.611 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 3>I think it's strange that we're covering</v>
<v Speaker 3>it like it is and because of the</v>

339
00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that we're my timeline on</v>

340
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:14.390
<v Speaker 3>twitter and on facebook and on</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

341
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.170
<v Speaker 3>This was way bigger news than day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

342
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:20.870
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>31 of the government shutdown where</v>

343
00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:24.470
<v Speaker 3>people are having to get on breadlines</v>
<v Speaker 3>to feed their families.</v>

344
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Then here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it like it's people what it's what</v>

345
00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:32.330
<v Speaker 3>people want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's this idea that there's</v>

346
00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:35.660
<v Speaker 3>things that are happening right now like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government shutdown and then there's</v>

347
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:40.661
<v Speaker 3>things that are happening right now in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of our culture shifting and when</v>

348
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 3>these things that come up in opposition</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what many people believe is a</v>

349
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:50.970
<v Speaker 3>beneficial shift to a more progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more responsible culture.</v>

350
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.600
<v Speaker 3>When these little hiccups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get addressed and they get address</v>

351
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:59.601
<v Speaker 3>rapidly and I think it's because people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are aware that things are changing in</v>

352
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:05.031
<v Speaker 3>this almost like unprecedented way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look back on pace.</v>

353
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

354
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.710
<v Speaker 3>like nothing we've ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that you could find in</v>

355
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:14.940
<v Speaker 3>the historical record for human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>is ever been what we've experienced over</v>

356
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:19.941
<v Speaker 3>just the past 10 plus years of social</v>
<v Speaker 3>social networks and social media and the</v>

357
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:25.340
<v Speaker 3>ability to spread information very</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly with a youtube video or a tweet</v>

358
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I mean these,</v>

359
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way people are exchanging</v>

360
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 3>information is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very different and because of that</v>

361
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 3>culture is shifting at a hyperspace</v>
<v Speaker 3>speed.</v>

362
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 3>It's just turbo charged for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think when something comes up that</v>

363
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:41.760
<v Speaker 3>we think is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

364
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.090
<v Speaker 3>there's one get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

365
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 3>But it's not logical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's like road rage.</v>

366
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 3>You know why you get road rage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons because you're going</v>

367
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 3>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

368
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:52.570
<v Speaker 3>you're in a car and you're nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

369
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.320
<v Speaker 3>you're heightened senses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anything that happens,</v>

370
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.930
<v Speaker 3>it gets magnified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone's,</v>

371
00:18:56.931 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 3>you look motherfucker in my lane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hong Kong because you already jacked up</v>

372
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:04.620
<v Speaker 3>to eight because you're in a car going</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 miles an hour on twitter.</v>

373
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twitter's doing that 100 percent.</v>

374
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Social media is doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life is doing that.</v>

375
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.440
<v Speaker 3>So when something like this comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this rapid pace of change,</v>

376
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 3>which is almost an impossible to keep up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

377
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the new cycle and this constant</v>

378
00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 3>wave of change and information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when something comes up,</v>

379
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.840
<v Speaker 3>people were road raging on this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

380
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.350
<v Speaker 3>That's why we just have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

381
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.570
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of things to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one thing has just continued to</v>

382
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:33.810
<v Speaker 3>insist on truth and facts.</v>

383
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not allowing people to be ins for a</v>

384
00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not a stand in for anyone.</v>

385
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.370
<v Speaker 3>You're yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You answered for yourself.</v>

386
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that trend on both sides really,</v>

387
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 3>really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because people are insecure and you</v>

388
00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:50.470
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for someone like Cathy who's</v>

389
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 3>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kathy Griffin,</v>

390
00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 3>who's experienced that public shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that amazes me,</v>

391
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:58.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she's been publicly shamed herself</v>

392
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.710
<v Speaker 3>in the most horrific way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has he basically had to live underground</v>

393
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 3>and now she's saying shame him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>name him and docs.</v>

394
00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 3>It reinforces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it reinforces people's idea that they</v>

395
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.190
<v Speaker 3>should be more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more committed to their side,</v>

396
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.440
<v Speaker 3>more committed to their team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way you're going to get any</v>

397
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 3>support if you have been attacked and</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolated,</v>

398
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:20.790
<v Speaker 3>not alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to get back deep,</v>

399
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 3>deep into the team again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you get back deep into the</v>

400
00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 3>team again?</v>

401
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be fucking rabid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

402
00:20:26.731 --> 00:20:28.010
<v Speaker 3>and that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

403
00:20:28.011 --> 00:20:32.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural reaction that people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of signal to everyone else on</v>

404
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 3>the team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all in,</v>

405
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.870
<v Speaker 3>they're fully committed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't even care about their fucking</v>

406
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an activist like that kind of shit</v>

407
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:41.190
<v Speaker 3>happens and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's people that want love.</v>

408
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.940
<v Speaker 3>That's what a lot of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's they.</v>

409
00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:45.040
<v Speaker 3>They do recognize that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong they'd,</v>

410
00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 3>they are reacting to a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not denying that,</v>

411
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 3>but I am saying that the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the overwhelming reason,</v>

412
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:57.100
<v Speaker 3>the motivation for this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>overzealous reaction is often a</v>

413
00:20:57.101 --> 00:20:59.990
<v Speaker 3>signaling thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they want to let everybody know I'm</v>

414
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.250
<v Speaker 3>on the fucking team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

415
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm all in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go punch Nazis.</v>

416
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 3>And the people that I've talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have said that and in real</v>

417
00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:09.100
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

418
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:09.621
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

419
00:21:09.621 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 3>you can't punch any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you shouldn't punch anybody.</v>

420
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 3>They're going to punch you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you don't punch first of all?</v>

421
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Who's your savior?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Punch for a real,</v>

422
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.240
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real one,</v>

423
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Poland or in Hungary right now,</v>

424
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

425
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at,</v>

426
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 3>not a 16 year old kid who maybe has no</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea what that had signifies.</v>

427
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

428
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 3>and I mean there's a broader point which</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like the very same people,</v>

429
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.460
<v Speaker 3>like one of the sort of wisdoms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of criminal justice reform,</v>

430
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:43.120
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is which I believe in,</v>

431
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 3>is that we shouldn't try kids as adults</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we should forgive.</v>

432
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.760
<v Speaker 3>We should have greater generosity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>mercy and forgiveness for the crimes of</v>

433
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 3>a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if they're,</v>

434
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 3>they've committed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those same people are the ones saying</v>

435
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 3>him and shame him generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politically.</v>

436
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing that now.</v>

437
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 3>And this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's never been a doxing before.</v>

438
00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:05.020
<v Speaker 3>There was no doxing.</v>

439
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long has [inaudible] been around?</v>

440
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:08.090
<v Speaker 3>A decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

441
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since Game Gamergate is when it got</v>

442
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

443
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe let's go crazy and say the first</v>

444
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 3>doxing was 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a blip,</v>

445
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so recent.</v>

446
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.740
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a thing that people have</v>

447
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:25.741
<v Speaker 3>really had to balance out in their mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>when to do it and when not to do it,</v>

448
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 3>they just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people have no idea of what that</v>

449
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:29.854
<v Speaker 3>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

450
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.470
<v Speaker 3>And unless you've experienced it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch someone,</v>

451
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience it,</v>

452
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's like an abstraction</v>
<v Speaker 3>because these people are abstractions.</v>

453
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.990
<v Speaker 3>They're two dimensional little puppets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it is.</v>

454
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.560
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this extreme lack of empathy.</v>

455
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.310
<v Speaker 3>The lack of empathy towards anyone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't share your position.</v>

456
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 3>This is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

457
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's piss poor thinking and it's</v>

458
00:22:55.271 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and in.</v>

459
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Everyone wants to feel like not being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of one of the tribes is that</v>

460
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:05.710
<v Speaker 3>extremely lonely position and you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>called all the bad names because people</v>

461
00:23:05.711 --> 00:23:08.970
<v Speaker 3>want you to be a part of their tribe and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't want to be called that name</v>

462
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they want to feel like they're in an</v>

463
00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 3>ingroup huddle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like emotionally.</v>

464
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.690
<v Speaker 3>I totally got that kind of sucks being</v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless.</v>

465
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just politically homeless.</v>

466
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 3>It's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you got a president that's so</v>

467
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:28.651
<v Speaker 3>polarizing and you have an opposition to</v>
<v Speaker 3>him that's so there,</v>

468
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.690
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much momentum in opposing</v>

469
00:23:31.691 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is a giant wedge in</v>

470
00:23:35.591 --> 00:23:39.450
<v Speaker 3>between these two sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have that hat and that hat.</v>

471
00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:42.610
<v Speaker 3>If that kid wasn't wearing that hat a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guaranteed be like 20 percent less hate,</v>

472
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.760
<v Speaker 3>it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be great.</v>

473
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 3>People would still get mad at him</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was staying like.</v>

474
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people say when a native elder</v>
<v Speaker 3>walks up to you and he's banging his</v>

475
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:52.430
<v Speaker 3>drums,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of the way.</v>

476
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

477
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't expect that you what?</v>

478
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 3>You can't just beat your drum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

479
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:01.370
<v Speaker 3>he got right in the kids face like</v>
<v Speaker 3>inches from the kid's face.</v>

480
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The restraint this kid had to just</v>

481
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 3>smile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that you're going to judge</v>

482
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:09.950
<v Speaker 3>this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Millions and millions and millions of</v>

483
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:12.620
<v Speaker 3>people are going over this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kid woke up that morning,</v>

484
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.610
<v Speaker 3>he had no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a kid in a cult.</v>

485
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in a Catholic school and he's going</v>

486
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 3>to some weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some march for life where people trying</v>

487
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:25.160
<v Speaker 3>to kill babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to stop them from killing</v>

488
00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:25.971
<v Speaker 3>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

489
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:29.720
<v Speaker 3>And he goes there and there's this black</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israelites calling them the faggots and</v>

490
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.440
<v Speaker 3>there's all these people calling them</v>
<v Speaker 3>names and then all of a sudden this</v>

491
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 3>guy's beating the drum in front of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>face and we're supposed to.</v>

492
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to dock this kid now</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he smirked.</v>

493
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.440
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An impossible lack of empathy.</v>

494
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.550
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to defend like unless</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hate boys,</v>

495
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.980
<v Speaker 3>unless you hate all boys because boys</v>
<v Speaker 3>are dumb.</v>

496
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Like 16 year old boys are almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>universally dumb.</v>

497
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 3>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all grow up to be men.</v>

498
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Some of those men will be your best</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend,</v>

499
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.270
<v Speaker 3>so when those men will be amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of those men would be so happy to</v>

500
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:03.110
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see him,</v>

501
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:04.520
<v Speaker 3>you give him a big hug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

502
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 3>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's me.</v>

503
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I was a stupid fucking 16 year old and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a man now and I try to be as nice as</v>

504
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 3>I can to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go way out of my way to be a kind</v>

505
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 3>person that could be that kid to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is not good for</v>

506
00:25:18.201 --> 00:25:19.380
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

507
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for society to take this</v>
<v Speaker 3>trend and run with it and this is,</v>

508
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what people do now you know,</v>

509
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:28.490
<v Speaker 3>you dock 16 year olds turbo charges the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

510
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.080
<v Speaker 3>like think people are not quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that dynamic.</v>

511
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.800
<v Speaker 3>If you're someone who you know is</v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrated with trump and is maybe</v>

512
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.810
<v Speaker 3>moving to the middle and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that person,</v>

513
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:44.660
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you see this and you're like,</v>

514
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't let those people being in charge</v>
<v Speaker 3>of me.</v>

515
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't want those people running the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

516
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.980
<v Speaker 3>That's the visceral reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

517
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're understanding the</v>
<v Speaker 3>implications of what they're doing.</v>

518
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they understand that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

519
00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no mastermind behind this.</v>

520
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:03.400
<v Speaker 3>There's and there's no understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they do understand their</v>

521
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:06.590
<v Speaker 3>implications that when you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum right,</v>

522
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.290
<v Speaker 3>the far right and the far left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a very similar reaction as</v>

523
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.080
<v Speaker 3>they drive a person to the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person that sees the far right and</v>

524
00:26:15.081 --> 00:26:20.081
<v Speaker 3>sees repulsive racism and bigotry that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

525
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.130
<v Speaker 3>build that wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck these Mexicans,</v>

526
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 3>fuck those little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should have known better.</v>

527
00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:27.770
<v Speaker 3>They're all illegals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of person that pushes people</v>

528
00:26:27.771 --> 00:26:31.520
<v Speaker 3>towards progressivism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it pushes people towards much more</v>

529
00:26:31.521 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even socialist ideology.</v>

530
00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like fuck that gross snus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing can be said for</v>

531
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:38.120
<v Speaker 3>someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to send you something,</v>

532
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:42.470

533
00:26:42.471 --> 00:26:44.150
<v Speaker 3>sending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They</v>

534
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.610
<v Speaker 1>were putting on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

535
00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:51.000

<v Speaker 1>on walls and fence posts and shit in the</v>

536
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually kind of hilarious</v>

537

<v Speaker 1>because it's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

539
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 1>put it up on the screen here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

540
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:01.104
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whoops,</v>

542

543
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.850
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Kilstein.</v>

544

<v Speaker 1>Here you go buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sent it.</v>

545
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you date a white,</v>

546
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

547
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.330
<v Speaker 1>it's telling people to not date white</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

548
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Propagation of lights is propagation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred,</v>

549
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 1>oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobia,</v>

550
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:24.240
<v Speaker 1>sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transphobia,</v>

551
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 1>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enablism.</v>

552
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Now followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are we supposed to sterilize white</v>

553
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:29.701
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

554
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:32.520
<v Speaker 1>We can see it up on the big screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's even closer because it's large.</v>

555
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.590
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing.</v>

556
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Racism is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racism is terrible,</v>

557
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:39.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you stop racism?</v>

558
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Racism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can only be perpetrated by white people.</v>

559
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the problem is white people.</v>

560
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.260
<v Speaker 1>We've got to stop white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you're racist.</v>

561
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you're literally being racist to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

562
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Is this really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

563
00:27:50.831 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 1>there are people are finding it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>posting it online and someone sent it to</v>

564
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:55.640
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

565
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably just one asshole.</v>

566
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the person exists,</v>

567
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 1>but that person exists and they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a progressive.</v>

568
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you see the cold civil war that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in this country?</v>

569
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope not.</v>

570
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why I worried about this punch</v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

571
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.280
<v Speaker 1>This go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>

572
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 1>If we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could make a lot of money in the</v>

573
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 1>stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

574
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 1>this is why I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because I understand violence</v>

575
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 1>a lot better than most people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just say go punch people when</v>

576
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:28.350
<v Speaker 1>raise the Oslo and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen a more punchable face that</v>

577
00:28:28.351 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 1>is so fucking dangerous because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost saying,</v>

578
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.510
<v Speaker 1>go punch this kid.</v>

579
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I saw someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accidentally favored something.</v>

580
00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to favorite favorite it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

581
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Someone pointed to me and I'm just lucky</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I looked at it because I normally</v>

582
00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 1>don't even read comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody pointed out that I favored</v>

583
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.450
<v Speaker 1>a really preposterous tweet that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

584
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.050
<v Speaker 1>It said the reply from the school is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathetic and impotent.</v>

585
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Name these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

586
00:28:56.071 --> 00:28:59.340
<v Speaker 1>that's Kathy Griffin a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the one that said it.</v>

587
00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.040
<v Speaker 1>This guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it,</v>

588
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was basically saying,</v>

589
00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:09.030
<v Speaker 1>no need to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a face like that never changes.</v>

590
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.760
<v Speaker 1>This image will define his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No need,</v>

591
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.760
<v Speaker 1>no one need ever forgive him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the person with the blue</v>

592
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 1>check mark by their name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one need ever forgive him.</v>

593
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.260
<v Speaker 1>A face like that defines his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is virtual signaling in the most</v>

594
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 1>toxic form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

595
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:29.060
<v Speaker 1>so dangerous to think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of it just.</v>

596
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to.</v>

597
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.193
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

598
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.990
<v Speaker 1>The idea that people cannot change to</v>
<v Speaker 1>irredeemable,</v>

599
00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 1>right is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cancel culture.</v>

600
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Kanye.</v>

601
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

602
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about cancel cultures</v>
<v Speaker 2>here on the show.</v>

603
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.510
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a person on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

604
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just going to be on the show.</v>

605
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly,</v>

606
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.590
<v Speaker 2>he's a little nervous to see him with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Samurai sword posing and he would go</v>

607
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 2>with the Elon musk on that poster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been.</v>

608
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.500
<v Speaker 2>It was first posted over two years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's supposedly as a like a troll.</v>

609
00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

610
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.670
<v Speaker 2>But this is the world where it's hard.</v>

611
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Define what's a troll was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to say that if I was</v>

612
00:30:10.291 --> 00:30:13.580
<v Speaker 1>cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that if I was a person who</v>

613
00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:15.730
<v Speaker 1>is like far right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't put that up.</v>

614
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to fuck with these people and sweet</v>

615
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.000
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's basically like some CIA</v>

616
00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:23.100
<v Speaker 1>psyops type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

617
00:30:23.101 --> 00:30:26.490
<v Speaker 1>This is this worth so through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking glass here.</v>

618
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.260
<v Speaker 1>They'll like that post that I just read</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

619
00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:31.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a real post about this guy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unredeemable.</v>

620
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.150
<v Speaker 1>No one knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never forgive him.</v>

621
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.240
<v Speaker 1>That's just as bad in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that poster saying,</v>

622
00:30:36.241 --> 00:30:38.430
<v Speaker 1>don't date white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all crazy.</v>

623
00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.830
<v Speaker 2>We pressing no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

624
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to like fight.</v>

625
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I have to fight this feeling of despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to like,</v>

626
00:30:46.891 --> 00:30:51.891
<v Speaker 2>I find myself fighting it because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic like some like basic virtues,</v>

627
00:30:53.281 --> 00:30:54.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That used to be normal,</v>

628
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:55.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like civility,</v>

629
00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.800
<v Speaker 2>civility has now become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some people a code word for like</v>

630
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.450
<v Speaker 2>complicity with Nazi-ism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're,</v>

631
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 2>if you're civil and you believe in</v>
<v Speaker 2>civility and you believe in,</v>

632
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treating people decently and with giving</v>

633
00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:15.450
<v Speaker 2>them the benefit of the doubt like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that word itself has become a code or a</v>

634
00:31:15.451 --> 00:31:18.180
<v Speaker 2>signal in a negative way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Empathy,</v>

635
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.300
<v Speaker 2>like human doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even saying it.</v>

636
00:31:21.301 --> 00:31:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

637
00:31:22.411 --> 00:31:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

638
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:28.130
<v Speaker 2>these basic virtues seemed to have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>swept away and I don't know when they,</v>

639
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.960
<v Speaker 2>when they got lost.</v>

640
00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a key ingredient for sure.</v>

641
00:31:33.271 --> 00:31:35.160
<v Speaker 1>The thing that hardened the epoxy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

642
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I think these trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these trends are going in that direction</v>

643
00:31:38.551 --> 00:31:40.710
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he capitalized on that.</v>

644
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very smart manipulator.</v>

645
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.900
<v Speaker 1>He knew how to capitalize on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

646
00:31:45.901 --> 00:31:48.750
<v Speaker 1>this chant of build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an accident.</v>

647
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:53.620
<v Speaker 1>That's something that he concentrates on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just that it's there.</v>

648
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.730
<v Speaker 1>We're in a political battle right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they get him to back down off</v>

649
00:31:56.731 --> 00:31:59.820
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he looks like a loser when 20,</v>

650
00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:02.160
<v Speaker 1>20 comes around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks less powerful to all those</v>

651
00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:04.620
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that for sure,</v>

652
00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but there's also this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so egregious like everything.</v>

653
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.280
<v Speaker 1>He's so he sold that guy.</v>

654
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gotten rid of all the guardrail,</v>

655
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 2>like he's broken the damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My question,</v>

656
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 2>like thinking about how we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get beyond this is how do we build it</v>

657
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 2>back because he's broken something or he</v>
<v Speaker 2>signifying the fact that it was broken.</v>

658
00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:26.950
<v Speaker 2>One or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that he was both a symptom of</v>

659
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 2>something that was broken that we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize and now he's further catalyze</v>

660
00:32:30.131 --> 00:32:30.964
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken it.</v>

661
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think both sides have to recognize</v>

662
00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:36.860
<v Speaker 1>that the other side has some points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing,</v>

663
00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 1>and then I think we also have to treat</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves like all family.</v>

664
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 1>We're all in a big team because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we really are.</v>

665
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.690
<v Speaker 1>If we really are the United States of</v>
<v Speaker 1>American,</v>

666
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

667
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.560
<v Speaker 1>What is a country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if anything,</v>

668
00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:52.100
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to be a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we're separated and were</v>

669
00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 1>two teams in this one team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real differences in terms of who</v>

670
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:59.000
<v Speaker 1>gets elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how it's going to affect your life,</v>

671
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 1>involve business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>involves some social policies,</v>

672
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 1>involve some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way we interact with each other</v>

673
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:07.370
<v Speaker 1>on a day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't involve that at all.</v>

674
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 1>That has to be fixed first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way we think about each other on a</v>

675
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 1>day to day basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to be a time where you could</v>

676
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 1>have a conservative friend and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a liberal and you could be a fucking</v>

677
00:33:17.241 --> 00:33:21.590
<v Speaker 1>long haired Hippie guy and as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good hardworking person who</v>

678
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 1>didn't let their long go crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your next door neighbor who was like a</v>

679
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.980
<v Speaker 1>goldwater Republican would talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you would go,</v>

680
00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:28.730
<v Speaker 1>how's it going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike?</v>

681
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:29.570
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

682
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys at the forest or try to put</v>

683
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:34.070
<v Speaker 1>together this case and this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

684
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 1>a professor could live right next to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cop and they would be friends and one</v>

685
00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:40.700
<v Speaker 1>would be conservative and one would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal and they would make fun of each</v>

686
00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:43.760
<v Speaker 1>other a little bit and rib each other a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and that would be the end of</v>

687
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:44.540
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be it.</v>

688
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be this civil war that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing right now,</v>

689
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:50.450
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just verbal and hopefully it stays that</v>

690
00:33:50.451 --> 00:33:51.760
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

691
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.510
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's confusing.</v>

692
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.750
<v Speaker 1>It's confusing because there's a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a frustrating lack of empathy that when</v>

693
00:33:59.691 --> 00:34:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I look at human beings and when I look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at people that aren't seeing what</v>

694
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 1>everyone else was seeing or they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing things objective,</v>

695
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Lee and their rational and overly</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>

696
00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I always assume there's something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>to running from.</v>

697
00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I always assume when I see someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>lashing out and insulting everyone</v>

698
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:19.220
<v Speaker 1>around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always assume it's not the people</v>

699
00:34:19.221 --> 00:34:22.280
<v Speaker 1>around that it's something internal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some something,</v>

700
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe some existential angst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting against some</v>

701
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.520
<v Speaker 1>realization of the futility of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the bucket is mean.</v>

702
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Finite organisms playing this game as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lasts forever and accumulating stuff</v>

703
00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.460
<v Speaker 1>is if it's going somewhere with you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get in that wooden canoe</v>

704
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.520
<v Speaker 1>and the God is going to take it with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the afterlife.</v>

705
00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:48.521
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense and somehow or another we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know this and we as especially as people</v>

706
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:51.590
<v Speaker 1>get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to push it further and further</v>

707
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:55.400
<v Speaker 1>in the back of their mind and they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more ideologically based.</v>

708
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.910
<v Speaker 1>They're less open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're less open to nuance.</v>

709
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare to see a 65 year old guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>switched parties that's calcified.</v>

710
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.570
<v Speaker 1>You become that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

711
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking asshole uncle that has a</v>

712
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.290
<v Speaker 1>couple of drinks in them and starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the gays,</v>

713
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this and that and all the things</v>

714
00:35:15.501 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 1>that are wrong with our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sodomites,</v>

715
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people start talking crazy.</v>

716
00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Ever heard that at a Thanksgiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner?</v>

717
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:22.443
<v Speaker 1>I haven't either.</v>

718
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.340
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a few things that can</v>

719
00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:33.341
<v Speaker 1>help us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One I think is just time realizing that</v>

720
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>these stupid fucking blow ups over this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid and the discussion that comes</v>

721
00:35:38.071 --> 00:35:41.100
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully some of this will settle down.</v>

722
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 1>We're allowed to have disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're allowed to have opinions about how</v>

723
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:49.911
<v Speaker 1>these kids should have behaved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were allowed to have ideas in there,</v>

724
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 1>in our minds about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you would behave if you were that</v>

725
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:56.130
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you're allowed to dock</v>

726
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:57.840
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're allowed to even say</v>

727
00:35:57.841 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're allowed to say that</v>

728
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you want to punch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that needs to become socially</v>

729
00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 1>unacceptable to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

730
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:07.350
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be checked for that because</v>

731
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:08.890
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when,</v>

732
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.470
<v Speaker 1>when someone says things like eyes him</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

733
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 1>who's punched him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he punched you buddy.</v>

734
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Who's ever punched you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punched.</v>

735
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Feels like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might.</v>

736
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Georgia probably punch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan's more of a I'll punch you type</v>

737
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 1>of a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Sam would ever say you</v>

738
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:26.020
<v Speaker 1>would punch somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot.</v>

739
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I have to say I can not imagine</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's on that.</v>

740
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I will punch you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

741
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.620
<v Speaker 1>you know the feeling of I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>punch you,</v>

742
00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:34.080
<v Speaker 1>but I can never imagine it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

743
00:36:34.081 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're protecting someone you</v>

744
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:40.530
<v Speaker 1>care about or your own self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I did see this amazing video of</v>

745
00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Buzz Aldrin to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see this?</v>

746
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punching the guy who said that he didn't</v>

747
00:36:43.051 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 1>go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that guy.</v>

748
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 1>That Guy Bart cerebral that he punched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the moon landing tonight.</v>

749
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones.</v>

750
00:36:50.221 --> 00:36:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a moon landing denier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to believe.</v>

751
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I used to believe totally that we never</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the moon because there was a</v>

752
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:56.020
<v Speaker 1>documentary that came on Fox.</v>

753
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

754
00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

755
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to number four in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties in the 19 nineties,</v>

756
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Fox had a show called conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we go to the moon and they aired it</v>

757
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:09.390
<v Speaker 1>on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime time.</v>

758
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 1>They got me hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and sinker,</v>

759
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.760
<v Speaker 1>and for years I believe that we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the Mon.</v>

760
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.450
<v Speaker 1>What changed you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly talking to neil degrasse tyson,</v>

761
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 1>but also critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also realizing that I Was fully</v>

762
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:26.850
<v Speaker 1>committed to that idea without really</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring the possibility whether that</v>

763
00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:30.900
<v Speaker 1>idea was incorrect and that I would take</v>
<v Speaker 1>in everything that I saw in that</v>

764
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:33.510
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is incredibly convincing and with</v>

765
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 1>100 percent confirmation bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only looked at that and I didn't look</v>

766
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:40.230
<v Speaker 1>at all the contrary evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some fucked up stuff about the</v>

767
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:43.650
<v Speaker 1>moon landing unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fucked up stuff is mostly people</v>

768
00:37:43.651 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 1>that were involved in publicity that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing stupid things with</v>

769
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.120
<v Speaker 1>photographs.</v>

770
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Like they had taken a picture of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going into unchartered territory or</v>

771
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.090
<v Speaker 1>just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an expert on this.</v>

772
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I've never gotten into landing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denialism</v>

773
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.860
<v Speaker 1>was buzz aldrin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

774
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.280
<v Speaker 1>who was the guy that was Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collins?</v>

775
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Michael collins in gemini 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs.</v>

776
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.430
<v Speaker 1>He seen it many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pulled up that photo.</v>

777
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.390
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

778
00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

779
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.080
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a photo that they,</v>

780
00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:19.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put out as an official photograph</v>

781
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.970
<v Speaker 1>of Michael Collins doing a spacewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it actually is,</v>

782
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:27.210
<v Speaker 1>is a photo of them testing equipment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they blacked out the backgrouNd.</v>

783
00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:30.300
<v Speaker 1>So he's in this suit that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with testing and instead,</v>

784
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:32.790
<v Speaker 1>because they really couldn't get good</v>
<v Speaker 1>photos in space because no one's out</v>

785
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:34.650
<v Speaker 1>there with him taking his pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

786
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So they lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They faked it.</v>

787
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.410
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the see the one on the left,</v>

788
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:41.980
<v Speaker 1>you see the real photograph and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in a studio where they're working on</v>

789
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 1>him or warehouse rather or some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a testing environment working on how to</v>

790
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:52.020
<v Speaker 1>control these harnesses that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>use when you're on a space walk because</v>

791
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:55.630
<v Speaker 1>that thing propels him forward and back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's learning how to use it.</v>

792
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.950
<v Speaker 1>What they did was they just blacked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the background and reversed it and then</v>

793
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 1>they sold that as him actually being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

794
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So this is probably an overzealous</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicists and there's a bunch of these.</v>

795
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of these when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to different backgrounds in areas of the</v>

796
00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:13.151
<v Speaker 1>moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many,</v>

797
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:15.970
<v Speaker 1>many miles apart from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be the same background and</v>

798
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 1>more likely than not what you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with is overzealous publicist because</v>

799
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.750
<v Speaker 1>photographs were incredibly difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

800
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

801
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morAl of the story to me,</v>

802
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 2>thank god first of all that you're no</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer a moon landing denier,</v>

803
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:33.690
<v Speaker 2>but also the power of the media and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>press and like you saw one documentary,</v>

804
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple after I saw that.</v>

805
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Quite a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that sent you down this rabbit hole</v>

806
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:40.984
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

807
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that roku is,</v>

808
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I think d platformed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Info wars,</v>

809
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instantly,</v>

810
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.030
<v Speaker 1>like within a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted to ask you a question</v>

811
00:39:49.031 --> 00:39:49.620
<v Speaker 1>before we get.</v>

812
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I have to say I feel.</v>

813
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I think I support that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want like in an age in which</v>

814
00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.270
<v Speaker 2>people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

815
00:40:02.271 --> 00:40:06.860
<v Speaker 2>like a 15 year old clicking through</v>
<v Speaker 2>their roku doesn't necessarily know the</v>

816
00:40:06.861 --> 00:40:11.720
<v Speaker 2>difference between cnn and info wars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York times and msnbc and</v>

817
00:40:11.721 --> 00:40:13.820
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course some of those other ones</v>

818
00:40:13.821 --> 00:40:18.200
<v Speaker 2>have biases obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but info wars promotes conspiracy</v>

819
00:40:18.201 --> 00:40:23.201
<v Speaker 2>theories and do I want a 15 year old kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>stumbling into that and thinking that</v>

820
00:40:23.541 --> 00:40:28.541
<v Speaker 2>that information is on par on a level</v>
<v Speaker 2>with actual facts</v>

821
00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.640
<v Speaker 1>fix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with conspiracy theories is</v>

822
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.220
<v Speaker 1>that some of them are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the real problem.</v>

823
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.110
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you don't know which ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>are real,</v>

824
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:39.860
<v Speaker 1>but some of them are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gulf of tonkin that got us into the</v>

825
00:40:39.861 --> 00:40:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of that?</v>

826
00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sandy hook,</v>

827
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.820
<v Speaker 1>sandy hook for sure happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of kids died and these are</v>

828
00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:49.130
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are horrible evil conspiracies.</v>

829
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.370
<v Speaker 1>The problem is loaded by Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

830
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.320
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt,</v>

831
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 1>and I saw the media matters clip that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen before.</v>

832
00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I saw it recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you clip the one that shows every</v>

833
00:41:01.461 --> 00:41:02.900
<v Speaker 1>time he brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

834
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.210
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How just one time.</v>

835
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know many,</v>

836
00:41:05.211 --> 00:41:06.950
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many tImes and was saying it was an</v>

837
00:41:06.951 --> 00:41:10.820
<v Speaker 1>absolutely fake thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has he ever apologize backed off of the</v>

838
00:41:10.821 --> 00:41:13.250
<v Speaker 1>position now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think because of the lawsuit or</v>

839
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's the pressure.</v>

840
00:41:15.531 --> 00:41:18.350
<v Speaker 1>It sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a realization that he knows</v>

841
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:21.230
<v Speaker 1>that it really did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a giant group of people out</v>

842
00:41:21.231 --> 00:41:25.520
<v Speaker 1>there that still believe it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and they still confront these</v>

843
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:29.380
<v Speaker 1>parents even in court and they call them</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

844
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:30.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the time.</v>

845
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.110
<v Speaker 2>it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing reporting on this.</v>

846
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth Williamson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mild sick.</v>

847
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.840
<v Speaker 1>It's sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's twisted.</v>

848
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we probably shouldn't.</v>

849
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can go into conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

850
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know to go into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing to go into because</v>

851
00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:44.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

852
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:45.760
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

853
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious what you think drove around.</v>

854
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.100
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of roku taking info</v>
<v Speaker 1>wars up?</v>

855
00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to decide what,</v>

856
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.370
<v Speaker 1>what is twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is facebook?</v>

857
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 1>What is youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The position that most people have is</v>

858
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.380
<v Speaker 1>these are private companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can make their own rules.</v>

859
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.550
<v Speaker 1>This is just like cbs deciding that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use a,</v>

860
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drunkenly yell the n word out at</v>

861
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:15.220
<v Speaker 1>a black police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't want you as a newscaster</v>

862
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.951
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

863
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a public account or a private</v>

864
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:20.330
<v Speaker 1>company that can make these</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions.</v>

865
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.390
<v Speaker 1>If you take a position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

866
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 1>an antisemitic position publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

867
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 1>they can decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

868
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 1>we don't want you on the air anymore.</v>

869
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other people that think</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech in this form is so</v>

870
00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:38.231
<v Speaker 1>important and that the answer to bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas is not stopping those ideas.</v>

871
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.780
<v Speaker 1>It's good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good ideas confronting those ideas</v>

872
00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 1>and you see it all work itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

873
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.940
<v Speaker 1>that's the does the other side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coin.</v>

874
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:50.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the other side of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The argument that we should treat,</v>

875
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 1>whether it's twitter or youtube or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these social media platforms as a</v>

876
00:42:54.711 --> 00:42:58.040
<v Speaker 1>public utility and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to distribute</v>

877
00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is with all of this,</v>

878
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:02.380
<v Speaker 1>is that it's very messy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

879
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.283
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

880
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.400
<v Speaker 1>this is a nuanced issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on because when you</v>

881
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:12.430
<v Speaker 1>do decide to deep platform someone for</v>
<v Speaker 1>having an awful position and spreading a</v>

882
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:17.630
<v Speaker 1>false conspiracy about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are gonna agree with you,</v>

883
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it stop there and does it move on</v>

884
00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:25.070
<v Speaker 1>to you are a person who believes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>white nationalism.</v>

885
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.481
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

886
00:43:26.481 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I believe that black pride is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also believe white pride is fine.</v>

887
00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:32.870
<v Speaker 1>What about those people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do we go with them?</v>

888
00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Then it gets slippery and then jason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

889
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 1>jason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met people that have given the</v>

890
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 1>outright of platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

891
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:42.080
<v Speaker 1>what are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they a part of the problem now?</v>

892
00:43:42.081 --> 00:43:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Should we d platform them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

893
00:43:44.001 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

894
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a paper that someone had put together an</v>

895
00:43:49.761 --> 00:43:54.761
<v Speaker 1>article that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious where it's like everyone has</v>

896
00:43:55.221 --> 00:43:58.390
<v Speaker 1>this very bizarre connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's six degrees of kevin bacon.</v>

897
00:43:58.391 --> 00:43:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

898
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.460
<v Speaker 1>And but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're using yet in terms of the</v>

899
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.940
<v Speaker 1>way the connections is almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's scientific data,</v>

900
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.870
<v Speaker 1>well they would basically say have you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like.</v>

901
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Well they did say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

902
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:11.880
<v Speaker 1>have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a gateway to the outright.</v>

903
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I said is Barbara Walters</v>

904
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:16.130
<v Speaker 1>interviewed castro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make her a communist?</v>

905
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:18.890
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

906
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 1>pretty left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

907
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.620
<v Speaker 1>just ask me questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to know I'm not going</v>

908
00:44:22.621 --> 00:44:24.910
<v Speaker 1>to hide my positions on things from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

909
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm very open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

910
00:44:26.271 --> 00:44:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I've told people I used to believe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon landing was fake.</v>

911
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you all the stupid shit I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed,</v>

912
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.393
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

913
00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 3>the question with this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do people want that?</v>

914
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 3>because it's simple and easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get them,</v>

915
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.490
<v Speaker 3>get rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punch them,</v>

916
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.650
<v Speaker 3>punch the nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lazy,</v>

917
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:47.310
<v Speaker 3>stupid people thinking and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking publicly and they,</v>

918
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:51.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they represent a progressive viewpoint</v>

919
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.830
<v Speaker 3>with their lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid thinking.</v>

920
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:57.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not that progressivism and</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive viewpoints or bad is that</v>

921
00:44:57.301 --> 00:44:58.760
<v Speaker 3>lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid thinking.</v>

922
00:44:58.761 --> 00:45:01.560
<v Speaker 3>And applying a progressive viewpoint is</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

923
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not even that socialism is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking a lot about socialism</v>

924
00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:09.690
<v Speaker 3>lately in terms of like what is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>point if if we get to a certain point</v>

925
00:45:10.621 --> 00:45:15.140
<v Speaker 3>and then our our hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our heart stops beating and we dye it</v>

926
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.840
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you left behind $18,</v>

927
00:45:17.841 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars to your kids because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were the ultimate capitalist and you</v>

928
00:45:22.321 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 3>went hog wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sets a fool's path.</v>

929
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 3>That Is a nonsense path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why did you do that?</v>

930
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.430
<v Speaker 3>like why didn't you try to use that</v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

931
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:37.340
<v Speaker 3>this insane amount of wealth and have</v>
<v Speaker 3>this massive impact on,</v>

932
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.380
<v Speaker 3>on the populous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

933
00:45:38.381 --> 00:45:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't you try to figure out some</v>
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>

934
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be a choice to but what if</v>

935
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.850
<v Speaker 3>bill gates right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if this bill gates is doing</v>

936
00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 3>that and a lot of ways with some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>money tomorrow if he throws a million</v>

937
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:57.960
<v Speaker 3>here or there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really ain't shit for him and he's</v>

938
00:45:57.961 --> 00:45:59.910
<v Speaker 3>gotten like $90,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

939
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 3>But the point is that things like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire department,</v>

940
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.500
<v Speaker 3>we agree this is a socialist thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

941
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 3>We were all chip in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have public utilities,</v>

942
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 3>we have people that parks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreation,</v>

943
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:19.550
<v Speaker 3>people that are department of fish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife and the sheriffs that patrol</v>

944
00:46:20.521 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 3>our national forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all chip in to pay for these things.</v>

945
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:25.350
<v Speaker 3>We all agree these are important thIngs.</v>

946
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that was so</v>

947
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:30.690
<v Speaker 3>interesting about Australia is that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain ways it's a more,</v>

948
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's thought of as sort of a macho</v>

949
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe more masculine,</v>

950
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:37.440
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more conservative than here</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally,</v>

951
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 3>and yet the left has one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are so many of the major issues</v>

952
00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:45.030
<v Speaker 3>that we're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're killing each other over now.</v>

953
00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.800
<v Speaker 3>They're very universal healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

954
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.520
<v Speaker 3>mandatory 401k</v>
<v Speaker 3>$18 minimum wage pensions,</v>

955
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 3>four weeks of vacation a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think they get maternity leave as</v>

956
00:46:57.451 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like so many of the things</v>

957
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:02.610
<v Speaker 3>that are up for grabs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they already solved.</v>

958
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.070
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to take things into</v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>

959
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:10.071
<v Speaker 3>One that they have a small population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small in homogenous in its enormous</v>

960
00:47:10.471 --> 00:47:12.870
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with a place as large as</v>

961
00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:15.750
<v Speaker 3>the contiguous United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's only 20 million people on</v>

962
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.260
<v Speaker 3>way because when they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crowded in that restaurant,</v>

963
00:47:19.261 --> 00:47:21.420
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean I don't have to wait for an</v>

964
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 3>hour to get in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

965
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.290
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've never seen a crowd of people.</v>

966
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what a real crowd is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also I think their culture</v>

967
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.820
<v Speaker 1>is less constrained by history because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came,</v>

968
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 1>they were essentially prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

969
00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.980
<v Speaker 4>several generations removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

970
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's not,</v>

971
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 4>not only that they're not indigenous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

972
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean like the non indigenous</v>
<v Speaker 4>population prisoners.</v>

973
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:47.330
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

974
00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:50.330
<v Speaker 4>well they came from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were sent there because england and</v>

975
00:47:50.331 --> 00:47:53.810
<v Speaker 4>warm and that's literally how the</v>
<v Speaker 4>country got founded for like stealing a</v>

976
00:47:53.811 --> 00:47:55.400
<v Speaker 4>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they were low level.</v>

977
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.430
<v Speaker 4>Then they sent them to the much better</v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

978
00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:00.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way better.</v>

979
00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.370
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a gold coast.</v>

980
00:48:01.371 --> 00:48:02.480
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy shit.</v>

981
00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.640
<v Speaker 4>It just takes forever to get fewer</v>
<v Speaker 4>manchester.</v>

982
00:48:04.641 --> 00:48:06.500
<v Speaker 4>It's raining everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fuck this place</v>

983
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.660
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

984
00:48:07.661 --> 00:48:10.150
<v Speaker 1>you stole a watch and they shipped you</v>
<v Speaker 1>off to the gold coast.</v>

985
00:48:10.151 --> 00:48:10.984
<v Speaker 1>She be like,</v>

986
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.140
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What just happened?</v>

987
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.840
<v Speaker 4>This is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your fish out here.</v>

988
00:48:15.841 --> 00:48:17.550
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're nice</v>

989
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.740
<v Speaker 1>people and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they're so nice.</v>

990
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they are slightly less nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>than canadians who are way more nice</v>

991
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 1>than us.</v>

992
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.680
<v Speaker 4>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also think that they have.</v>

993
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.190
<v Speaker 4>They have it so good that they're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little complacent and that makes me</v>

994
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 4>concerned because China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

995
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the big story there.</v>

996
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

997
00:48:41.221 --> 00:48:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

998
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999
00:48:43.681 --> 00:48:47.220
<v Speaker 1>that is to be considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the United States,</v>

1000
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:52.020
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this momentum of innovation and</v>

1001
00:48:52.021 --> 00:48:54.270
<v Speaker 1>of ass kicking and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1002
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and getting things done and creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that's so different than any</v>

1003
00:48:58.171 --> 00:49:00.900
<v Speaker 1>other part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we took that shit down a notch,</v>

1004
00:49:00.901 --> 00:49:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1005
00:49:02.701 --> 00:49:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think we definitely do have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about China and know I've been</v>

1006
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:12.230
<v Speaker 1>really trying to closely follow all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>walway stuff where these executives keep</v>

1007
00:49:13.111 --> 00:49:18.111
<v Speaker 1>getting arrested and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the close relationship between some</v>

1008
00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:25.191
<v Speaker 1>tech companies and this communist</v>
<v Speaker 1>government is very confusing,</v>

1009
00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:29.010
<v Speaker 1>but some people look it over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you talk to people that are</v>

1010
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.050
<v Speaker 1>chinese natives or who have been to</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

1011
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.440
<v Speaker 1>they almost look at as a positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's less resistance.</v>

1012
00:49:34.441 --> 00:49:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the censorship is open,</v>

1013
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.500
<v Speaker 1>it's at least you know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with over there as opposed to,</v>

1014
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nsa is spiraling up.</v>

1015
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy It at all,</v>

1016
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.310
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some people make that</v>

1017
00:49:46.311 --> 00:49:47.510
<v Speaker 4>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrifying.</v>

1018
00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:49.670
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's horrifying.</v>

1019
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.860
<v Speaker 4>So I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

1020
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.930
<v Speaker 4>You do have to worry about China,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think Australia is like,</v>

1021
00:49:53.931 --> 00:49:55.550
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking americans take care of it.</v>

1022
00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.560
<v Speaker 4>So they think sorta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except like their situation is that</v>

1023
00:50:00.561 --> 00:50:04.310
<v Speaker 4>they're enormously economic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're enormously dependent on China</v>

1024
00:50:04.311 --> 00:50:07.760
<v Speaker 4>economically and they love having that</v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

1025
00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.480
<v Speaker 4>but they seem to be a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep walking through history and not is</v>

1026
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.480
<v Speaker 4>at least some people that I spoke to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's.</v>

1027
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:20.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the real story in Australia is</v>
<v Speaker 4>China.</v>

1028
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1029
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.190
<v Speaker 1>when you're not a military might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1030
00:50:25.191 --> 00:50:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not like one of the big players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of like sitting back</v>

1031
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 1>watching because what are we going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

1032
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Like what if Australia decides to ramp</v>
<v Speaker 1>up its defense budget by 5,000 percent</v>

1033
00:50:35.121 --> 00:50:40.121
<v Speaker 1>over the next 10 years and develop a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy arsenal of weapons and super</v>

1034
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 1>soldiers and shoot them all off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>

1035
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:44.900
<v Speaker 1>give them exoskeletons and get ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to war,</v>

1036
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:49.330
<v Speaker 1>start building bunkers and freak the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world out and take this like</v>

1037
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 1>North Korea with money approach the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in North Korea with money.</v>

1038
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>norTh Korea is basically like this scary</v>

1039
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.480
<v Speaker 1>spot that nobody wants to invade even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though we know that there's a military</v>

1040
00:50:59.481 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have their weapons,</v>

1041
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 1>we have nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a madman who's in control.</v>

1042
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.720
<v Speaker 1>They have people that escaped with</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific stories and we have a president</v>

1043
00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:11.180
<v Speaker 1>who talks about them as if they're sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a normal country.</v>

1044
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the weird thing is like he might be</v>

1045
00:51:13.341 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 1>able to sit down with them and actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to them is his unconventional</v>

1046
00:51:17.751 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 1>approach might actually lead to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of communication at least.</v>

1047
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Which is better than nothing I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1048
00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 1>But if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean like in North Korea,</v>

1049
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 1>like they take over the country and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>prison it's people.</v>

1050
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become kind of dangerous and</v>

1051
00:51:30.771 --> 00:51:33.770
<v Speaker 1>sketchy and small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like North Korea is not a military dick</v>

1052
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of like the way the soviet</v>

1053
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 1>union is where they could take over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1054
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.260
<v Speaker 1>but they're scared but they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>untouchable.</v>

1055
00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1056
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:44.570
<v Speaker 1>If Australia became that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think we have a totally different</v>

1057
00:51:44.571 --> 00:51:46.390
<v Speaker 1>attitude about Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

1058
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Australia is just laid back and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1059
00:51:49.131 --> 00:51:51.350
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>americans take arabic and then we're</v>

1060
00:51:51.351 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 1>over here building fucking walls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting missiles.</v>

1061
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it would be really weird</v>

1062
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.160
<v Speaker 1>to watch us from afar if you were paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to world politics</v>

1063
00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:04.850
<v Speaker 4>because they know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1064
00:52:04.851 --> 00:52:07.700
<v Speaker 4>everyone I talked to there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about gerrymandering in</v>

1065
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:08.860
<v Speaker 4>Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

1066
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:15.410
<v Speaker 4>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to follow what's going on here</v>

1067
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 4>in ways that I found kind of amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like genuinely actually gerrymandering</v>

1068
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.100
<v Speaker 4>in Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1069
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:25.170
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you have the news going on for a</v>

1070
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.430
<v Speaker 4>year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the answer is sort of note.</v>

1071
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.020
<v Speaker 4>YeAh.</v>

1072
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Comedians move over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They move over there and become huge in</v>

1073
00:52:30.811 --> 00:52:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to my friend,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Gigantic over there.</v>

1076
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.910

1079
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:47.510

<v Speaker 4>celebrity comes over,</v>

1080
00:52:47.511 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to sell out</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything because that's the only game</v>

1081
00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:50.450
<v Speaker 4>in town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1082
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:54.230
<v Speaker 4>he's not a giant american celebrity.</v>

1083
00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.150
<v Speaker 4>No barker.</v>

<v Speaker 4>march stuff at all or no?</v>

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antisemitic stuff.</v>

1101
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Fucking groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you have a group,</v>

1103
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you have a group of people and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1104
00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.690
<v Speaker 2>That was a little bit to me as related</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1105
00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.640
<v Speaker 2>what happened at the lincoln memorial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1106
00:53:40.641 --> 00:53:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Where you had these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.910
<v Speaker 2>the leadership of the women's march,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which looked like a shepard fairey</v>

1108
00:53:46.911 --> 00:53:49.400
<v Speaker 2>poster come to life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they were just perfect.</v>

1109
00:53:49.401 --> 00:53:53.000
<v Speaker 2>You had linda sarsour and her hijab</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind tamika mallory.</v>

1110
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:58.550
<v Speaker 2>what's going on is that back in August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017,</v>

1111
00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a column called wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive's embrace hate,</v>

1112
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:06.880
<v Speaker 2>and it was saying I was super moved by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women's march as so many other</v>

1113
00:54:06.921 --> 00:54:07.970
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're,</v>

1114
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.130
<v Speaker 2>but let's look at some of the very</v>
<v Speaker 2>troubling ideas and associations that</v>

1115
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.610
<v Speaker 2>the people who are in charge of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership of the women's march have,</v>

1116
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:20.660
<v Speaker 2>namely the worst of the worst was tamika</v>
<v Speaker 2>mallory,</v>

1117
00:54:20.661 --> 00:54:22.730
<v Speaker 2>who'd been in gun rights activists</v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand.</v>

1118
00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:28.760
<v Speaker 2>She called louis farrakhan the goat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest of all time.</v>

1119
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:31.760
<v Speaker 2>She took lots of instagram pictures.</v>

1120
00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:35.120
<v Speaker 2>You should check this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she praised him.</v>

1121
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:38.420
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a casual acquaintance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She praised him as the greatest of all</v>

1122
00:54:38.421 --> 00:54:43.421
<v Speaker 2>time and yet she was treated to glowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>profiles in every women's magazine,</v>

1123
00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.810
<v Speaker 2>her and the rest of the leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I basically said like,</v>

1124
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.790
<v Speaker 2>let's look past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1125
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:54.791
<v Speaker 2>the benetton ad of these leaders and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually look at what they believe and</v>

1126
00:54:54.861 --> 00:54:58.250
<v Speaker 2>what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them is extremely disturbing,</v>

1127
00:54:58.251 --> 00:55:01.310
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to jews say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write this column.</v>

1128
00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:04.340
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like pilloried for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the left.</v>

1129
00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:07.160
<v Speaker 2>One of the leaders of the women's march,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman bob bland,</v>

1130
00:55:07.161 --> 00:55:10.070
<v Speaker 2>wrote this letter to the New York times</v>
<v Speaker 2>where she calls me,</v>

1131
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>

1132
00:55:11.931 --> 00:55:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I want to find what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1133
00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:17.120
<v Speaker 2>she calls me an apologist for the status</v>
<v Speaker 2>quo,</v>

1134
00:55:17.121 --> 00:55:20.840
<v Speaker 2>racist ideology and the white</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalist patriarchy because you</v>

1135
00:55:20.841 --> 00:55:25.790
<v Speaker 2>responded to someone because I said</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest of all time is a man who called</v>

1136
00:55:25.791 --> 00:55:28.340
<v Speaker 2>judaism termites who calls juice</v>
<v Speaker 2>termites,</v>

1137
00:55:28.341 --> 00:55:31.970
<v Speaker 2>who calls judaism a gutter religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who says that we should burn in ovens</v>

1138
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:36.890
<v Speaker 2>and who by the way is a massage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobe also the leaders of the</v>

1139
00:55:36.891 --> 00:55:40.790
<v Speaker 2>women's march or associating with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and had the nation of islam security</v>

1140
00:55:40.791 --> 00:55:41.630
<v Speaker 2>protecting them.</v>

1141
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is Like the most sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>retro grade hate group and yet for</v>

1142
00:55:46.521 --> 00:55:48.660
<v Speaker 2>calling them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was called all of these things</v>

1143
00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:50.453
<v Speaker 1>flies.</v>

1144
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a deep question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that part of it is the fact that</v>

1145
00:55:56.350 --> 00:56:01.350
<v Speaker 2>in intersectional leftwing politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jews have been whitewashed.</v>

1146
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Jews are viewed as sort of the white</v>
<v Speaker 2>privileged power and part of the white</v>

1147
00:56:07.751 --> 00:56:11.650
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy and less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They genuflect and say,</v>

1148
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:12.940
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1149
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.870
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1150
00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:17.200
<v Speaker 2>we have poor our privilege and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other things that you're supposed to</v>

1151
00:56:17.201 --> 00:56:19.480
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a blIndness to the fact</v>

1152
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.910
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a blindness to the fact that</v>

1153
00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not jews are white.</v>

1154
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Half of the jews in the state of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1155
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:30.550
<v Speaker 2>are arab and from arab countries that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were kicked out of a 19,</v>

1156
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:32.980
<v Speaker 2>48.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea that jews are white is</v>

1157
00:56:32.981 --> 00:56:36.220
<v Speaker 2>this canard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I'm an ashkenazi jew,</v>

1158
00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm my family is from eastern europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have white skin but I don't think of,</v>

1159
00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:43.600
<v Speaker 2>and I have white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think of myself as white</v>

1160
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:43.870
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1161
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I think of myself as a jew first and</v>
<v Speaker 2>foremost,</v>

1162
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:49.660
<v Speaker 2>so it's a complicated identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that it's sort of a.</v>

1163
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 2>It's whitewashed by these people and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that antisemitism just isn't taken</v>

1164
00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 2>seriously and doesn't rate because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people perceive jews as having privilege</v>

1165
00:56:58.931 --> 00:57:01.480
<v Speaker 2>and power in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which largely they do.</v>

1166
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.980
<v Speaker 2>But the fact is is that the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics show that more hate crimes</v>

1167
00:57:05.981 --> 00:57:10.120
<v Speaker 2>were committed against jews in the past</v>
<v Speaker 2>year than any other minority group.</v>

1168
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:14.770
<v Speaker 2>The fbi's like sounding the alarm every</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day in crown heights and in other</v>

1169
00:57:14.771 --> 00:57:17.830
<v Speaker 2>parts of brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>random jews who looked jewish,</v>

1170
00:57:17.831 --> 00:57:19.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who were hasidic.</v>

1171
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Jews are just beaten up for being</v>
<v Speaker 2>jewish.</v>

1172
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:26.950
<v Speaker 2>and yet everyone's ignoring that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the imperfect victim will.</v>

1173
00:57:26.951 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 2>They're also very isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very.</v>

1174
00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.370
<v Speaker 2>They have their own tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stick with them,</v>

1175
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 2>they look different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dress different.</v>

1176
00:57:35.381 --> 00:57:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if any other minority group,</v>

1177
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:38.340
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

1178
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're outraged when we see at least i</v>

1179
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:42.190
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you are.</v>

1180
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 2>When we see a police officer assaulting</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

1181
00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.880
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying is the young</v>
<v Speaker 2>black person,</v>

1182
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:52.150
<v Speaker 2>they don't make a big deal to go into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public about it.</v>

1183
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:56.620
<v Speaker 2>They keep it almost insulated inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>their environment and their community.</v>

1184
00:57:57.070 --> 00:58:00.130
<v Speaker 2>There's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to say is that these</v>

1185
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.690
<v Speaker 2>people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do here saying antisemitic</v>

1186
00:58:04.691 --> 00:58:07.870
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're equating american jews living in</v>

1187
00:58:07.871 --> 00:58:12.010
<v Speaker 2>America with the policies of Israel and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Israel is doing with palestine.</v>

1188
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 2>And that somehow if you're an american</v>
<v Speaker 2>jew,</v>

1189
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:18.550
<v Speaker 2>even if you're not even political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're somehow or another complicit with</v>

1190
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:22.000
<v Speaker 2>atrocities that are going on between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jewish people and the palestinians,</v>

1191
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conflict,</v>

1192
00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:26.620
<v Speaker 2>any kind of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this makes it.</v>

1193
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000
<v Speaker 2>It reinforces their idea about you being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of this group.</v>

1194
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also straw men it and say,</v>

1195
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.790
<v Speaker 2>criticism of Israel is an antisemitic.</v>

1196
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:39.940
<v Speaker 2>No one's saying that criticism isn't of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel antisemitic.</v>

1197
00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I criticize Israel at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an obsession on the state of</v>

1198
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were an alien that landed</v>

1199
00:58:46.091 --> 00:58:49.000
<v Speaker 2>from outer space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think that the greatest</v>

1200
00:58:49.001 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 2>oppressor in the world is this tiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>state that's the size of New Jersey.</v>

1201
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:57.690
<v Speaker 2>These people say nothing about the genet</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally about the genocide of weger</v>

1202
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.910
<v Speaker 2>muslims in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say nothing about any number of</v>

1203
00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.280
<v Speaker 2>even aware that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1204
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:06.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a genocide going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carried out by the government of China</v>

1205
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.310
<v Speaker 2>against weaker muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're literally being put into</v>

1206
00:59:09.311 --> 00:59:12.250
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is literally a first.</v>

1207
00:59:12.251 --> 00:59:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So [inaudible] is spelled you I g,</v>

1208
00:59:15.791 --> 00:59:17.010
<v Speaker 2>h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

1209
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a good thing to read about the</v>

1210
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:22.670
<v Speaker 2>New York times that we've reported on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1211
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an enormous story and it's like the</v>

1212
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:31.391
<v Speaker 2>fact that that's getting know that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know about it and that people</v>

1213
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.430
<v Speaker 2>obsessive talk about the state of Israel</v>
<v Speaker 2>is if it's the and by the way the state</v>

1214
00:59:37.431 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 2>of Israel does lots of things wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that it's among the worst</v>

1215
00:59:41.541 --> 00:59:43.550
<v Speaker 2>human rights tragedies of our time.</v>

1216
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insanity.</v>

1217
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:51.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the reality of what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in gaza.</v>

1218
00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what is happening with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel and palestine.</v>

1219
00:59:54.701 --> 00:59:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not going to be the person that</v>

1220
00:59:56.741 --> 01:00:00.160
<v Speaker 1>talks about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I do know some stuff to read,</v>

1221
01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.550
<v Speaker 1>but I do know from people that have gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>there like abby martin,</v>

1222
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.500
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who came back with some pretty horrific</v>

1223
01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of terrible shit</v>

1224
01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:10.510
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of awful violence and</v>

1225
01:00:10.511 --> 01:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of despair on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the palestinians and I don't.</v>

1226
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's to blame for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many people blame the israelis.</v>

1227
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:23.950
<v Speaker 1>They blame the israelis for treating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>palestinians as if they're in this one</v>

1228
01:00:23.951 --> 01:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>area of the world is essentially a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

1229
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots to say about this,</v>

1230
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.690
<v Speaker 2>but I think one of the main problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have in the way that Israel is</v>

1231
01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:37.691
<v Speaker 2>covered is that if you have a camera</v>
<v Speaker 2>lens and you're only looking at a tiny</v>

1232
01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:42.050
<v Speaker 2>piece of land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1233
01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>you're only looking at Israel proper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The west bank and gaza,</v>

1234
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Israel to some extent is the goliath in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that situation,</v>

1235
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.830
<v Speaker 2>but if you zoom out your camera just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

1236
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:57.250
<v Speaker 2>you see that Israel is literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded on all sides by genocidal</v>

1237
01:00:57.261 --> 01:00:59.630
<v Speaker 2>regimes like in the form of hamas in</v>
<v Speaker 2>gaza,</v>

1238
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 2>whose charter blamed the jews for</v>
<v Speaker 2>fomenting that.</v>

1239
01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 2>The french revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the russian revolutions,</v>

1240
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.540
<v Speaker 2>both world wars and says that it wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill all the jews.</v>

1241
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the government of gaza right now.</v>

1242
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I spoke to a mother who fled gaza</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

1243
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.780
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And her family's house was just</v>

1244
01:01:17.781 --> 01:01:19.520
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was it destroyed by?</v>

1245
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Hamas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Israel.</v>

1246
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 2>You never hear those storIes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just saying it is a very</v>

1247
01:01:25.761 --> 01:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>complicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

1248
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>but when you see people obsessively</v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on this one state and the</v>

1249
01:01:35.031 --> 01:01:40.031
<v Speaker 2>crimes of this one state to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusion of actual dictatorships in the</v>

1250
01:01:40.401 --> 01:01:45.200
<v Speaker 2>world who are killing their own people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be suspicious of that.</v>

1251
01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>You do have to be suspicious and you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be aware of their position in</v>

1252
01:01:49.781 --> 01:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the world surrounded by arab states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do have to realize that they</v>

1253
01:01:54.371 --> 01:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're alone out there.</v>

1254
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>You also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do wonder,</v>

1255
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.230
<v Speaker 1>what is the motivation for so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people focusing on jews?</v>

1256
01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.870
<v Speaker 1>What is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it is as a jewish</v>

1257
01:02:07.871 --> 01:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the motivation for</v>

1258
01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>this kind of racism and discrimination</v>
<v Speaker 1>against jews and why is it tolerated?</v>

1259
01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can someone like louis farrakhan</v>

1260
01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>tweet that jews are in</v>

1261
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.120
<v Speaker 2>his twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stays up.</v>

1262
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:23.670
<v Speaker 2>It's the olDest hatred in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1263
01:02:23.671 --> 01:02:25.350
<v Speaker 2>a lot of exam what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1264
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:25.741
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1265
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>You're asking me why is it still with</v>
<v Speaker 2>us?</v>

1266
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:30.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like the mystery of history like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>

1267
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.470
<v Speaker 2>That is deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1268
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:34.320
<v Speaker 2>that is something that goes back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>new testament.</v>

1269
01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The jews were blamed in the book of john</v>

1270
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:38.221
<v Speaker 2>and mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1271
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 2>we could go to matthew for the death of</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus.</v>

1272
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Their role in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least according to some of the books,</v>

1273
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:51.140
<v Speaker 2>is that they convinced the most powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>empire at the time,</v>

1274
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>the roman empire in the form of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>governor of judea,</v>

1275
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:58.971
<v Speaker 2>punches pilot to kill the son of god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That becomes sort of the template for</v>

1276
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.910
<v Speaker 2>the antisemitic conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1277
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a confusion about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism is,</v>

1278
01:03:05.371 --> 01:03:07.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a hate.</v>

1279
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:08.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not just like this.</v>

1280
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Hate of a group racist perceived</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as punching down against a</v>

1281
01:03:11.671 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 2>group that's lesser antisemites perceive</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as punching up against the</v>

1282
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:21.231
<v Speaker 2>secret cabal of wildly operators who</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretly controlled the leavers of</v>

1283
01:03:21.271 --> 01:03:24.300
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the canard of antisemitism,</v>

1284
01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:29.340
<v Speaker 2>and that begins with this group that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>able somehow to get the roman empire to</v>

1285
01:03:29.341 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 2>kill jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1286
01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:33.150
<v Speaker 2>the catholic church disavows this in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1965,</v>

1287
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.600
<v Speaker 2>which was an enormous historical event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that template is still there and you</v>

1288
01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:43.050
<v Speaker 2>see it play out right in who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who led us into the war in Iraq,</v>

1289
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.600
<v Speaker 2>it was the jews of the bush</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>

1290
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:50.370
<v Speaker 2>You can see it play itself out all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place and right now in the</v>

1291
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 2>demonology of current contemporary</v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism,</v>

1292
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Israel has sort of been made into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jew among the nations.</v>

1293
01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.480
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to say anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the old school antisemitism,</v>

1294
01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:02.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I grew up in a place where there</v>

1295
01:04:02.161 --> 01:04:04.170
<v Speaker 2>was some country clubs where jews</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't go into them.</v>

1296
01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.440
<v Speaker 2>That frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not dangerous.</v>

1297
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 2>What's dangerous is the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism that says,</v>

1298
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one state in the world of all of</v>

1299
01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:14.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 200 states,</v>

1300
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:16.680
<v Speaker 2>that's the one that doesn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to exist.</v>

1301
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:18.630
<v Speaker 2>That's the one that should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismantled.</v>

1302
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.720
<v Speaker 2>That's actually dangerous to jewish</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives right now.</v>

1303
01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.653
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1304
01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.610
<v Speaker 2>it's an unusual group in that it is both</v>
<v Speaker 2>a religion and a tribe.</v>

1305
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes us very hard to understand in</v>

1306
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>the contemporary landscape because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not just a religion.</v>

1307
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.670
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing else like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because most jews that I know do not</v>

1308
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.830
<v Speaker 2>practice judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1309
01:04:37.831 --> 01:04:42.510
<v Speaker 2>And yet they choose us because we were a</v>
<v Speaker 2>people hood before we were a religion.</v>

1310
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Religion is a very contemporary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern thing that jews are sort of</v>

1311
01:04:47.701 --> 01:04:50.670
<v Speaker 2>slotted into and it makes us easier to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1312
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:54.240
<v Speaker 2>But then our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our sort of national identity or</v>

1313
01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:57.600
<v Speaker 2>peoplehood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our tribalism is left out and that's an</v>

1314
01:04:57.601 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 2>essential part of who the jews are.</v>

1315
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.880
<v Speaker 2>My friend ari shaffir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a fantastic stand up comedian,</v>

1316
01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:07.881
<v Speaker 2>he's a rabid atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also very jewish and he has a</v>

1317
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:12.050
<v Speaker 2>new hour that he's working on right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to film called jew.</v>

1318
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.660
<v Speaker 2>I want to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

1319
01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a perfect example is a tribe.</v>

1320
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:22.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also because the jewish</v>

1321
01:05:22.781 --> 01:05:24.640
<v Speaker 2>religion itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emphasis,</v>

1322
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.760
<v Speaker 2>the emphasis is not on what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The emphasis is on deeds.</v>

1323
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It almost doesn't matter what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

1324
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:36.020
<v Speaker 2>It matters that you follow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hahaha.</v>

1325
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Which is jewish law matters your deeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It matters all these things.</v>

1326
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:44.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible to be a good jew and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really think about god that much,</v>

1327
01:05:45.161 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 2>which is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

1328
01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:51.740
<v Speaker 2>To christian ears or you go full ben</v>
<v Speaker 2>shapiro where he's both a good jew and</v>

1329
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:55.930
<v Speaker 2>very much like follows the whole deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal,</v>

1330
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:56.853
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal.</v>

1331
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you say that?</v>

1332
01:05:59.060 --> 01:05:59.861
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1333
01:05:59.861 --> 01:06:03.970
<v Speaker 2>can I say one more place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just find it like kind of astonishing</v>

1334
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.680
<v Speaker 2>the blindness to this because imagine a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader of the women's march said</v>

1335
01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1336
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I think louis ck is the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian of all time even though I</v>

1337
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 2>disavow x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>

1338
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:18.760
<v Speaker 2>and z thing that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fast to let person was kicked out of</v>

1339
01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:23.260
<v Speaker 2>the leadership of the women's march.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be like minutes hours.</v>

1340
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are certain things that</v>

1341
01:06:26.351 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 2>get people outraged and other much worse</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that do not.</v>

1342
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 2>And I'm fascinated by why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that if it was a white</v>

1343
01:06:35.411 --> 01:06:38.530
<v Speaker 2>person that had this opinion about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jews,</v>

1344
01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:43.180
<v Speaker 2>that it would be more scrutinized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think thAt it is much easier to fight</v>

1345
01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism when it comes in the form</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Richard Spencer.</v>

1346
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:46.744
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1347
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Because then there's liberal consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1348
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:54.700
<v Speaker 2>About him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's have a green light to criticize.</v>

1349
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>It is much harder when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when an an.</v>

1350
01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much harder when someone like ilhan</v>

1351
01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:03.130
<v Speaker 2>omar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new freshman senator.</v>

1352
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.031
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1353
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Not senator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new freshman congresswoman for</v>

1354
01:07:06.051 --> 01:07:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota who's like this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>american dream story comes here at 12</v>

1355
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:11.020
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refugee from Somalia,</v>

1356
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.330
<v Speaker 2>wears a hijab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a mother,</v>

1357
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 2>is the first woman of color representing</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota.</v>

1358
01:07:15.851 --> 01:07:20.851
<v Speaker 2>Like obviously I want to cheer her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my reaction to her and yet she</v>

1359
01:07:21.761 --> 01:07:25.930
<v Speaker 2>has this tweet that she refused to</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize is four where she says,</v>

1360
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Israel is hypnotize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world may all awake in the world to</v>

1361
01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 2>the evil doings of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1362
01:07:32.231 --> 01:07:36.520
<v Speaker 2>That's a classically antiseMitic trope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if she said it unwittingly and by</v>

1363
01:07:36.521 --> 01:07:39.400
<v Speaker 2>this point she should have known she</v>
<v Speaker 2>should eduCate herself.</v>

1364
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:43.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much harder to criticize that,</v>

1365
01:07:43.241 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an untenable position to say that</v>

1366
01:07:45.821 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 2>you can't criticize someone for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas because of their identity.</v>

1367
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.210
<v Speaker 2>It also seems like a road to nowhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say that.</v>

1368
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 2>That is a very vague thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be incredibly specific.</v>

1369
01:07:56.230 --> 01:08:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Have you want to say it's evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should say what's evil and then open</v>

1370
01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:02.530
<v Speaker 2>that up to some sort of a discussion or</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>

1371
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.560
<v Speaker 2>but as describing supernatural evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>powers to a state is very much recalling</v>

1372
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:13.890
<v Speaker 2>classic antisemetic canards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1373
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>So with that I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a piece about this today,</v>

1374
01:08:16.101 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 2>trying to like explain that to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she went on cnn saying,</v>

1375
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how jewish americans could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be offended by this,</v>

1376
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.590
<v Speaker 2>which I think is incredible.</v>

1377
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1378
01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:27.300
<v Speaker 1>What do you think if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1379
01:08:27.301 --> 01:08:31.620
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be objective as I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>step outside of your jewish identity,</v>

1380
01:08:31.621 --> 01:08:36.621
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is wrong with how</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel is dealing with the palestinian</v>

1381
01:08:37.231 --> 01:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is the big criticisM of</v>

1382
01:08:41.811 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only criticism really that's the big</v>

1383
01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big one is gaza and palestine.</v>

1384
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.020
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong?</v>

1385
01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Palestine meaning the west bank?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1386
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say what the untenable position</v>

1387
01:08:54.061 --> 01:08:56.910
<v Speaker 2>that they're in is that they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>oCcupying another people.</v>

1388
01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.930
<v Speaker 2>That is what is going on in the west</v>
<v Speaker 2>bank and I've been there many times,</v>

1389
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:04.530
<v Speaker 2>met with many palestinians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really educated myself on this.</v>

1390
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:07.620
<v Speaker 2>The problem is is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1391
01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:10.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not all of palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all the west bank,</v>

1392
01:09:10.381 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 2>there's areas a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>b and c.</v>

1393
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a really like we'd have to pull up</v>
<v Speaker 2>a map.</v>

1394
01:09:14.701 --> 01:09:17.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty complicated thinG.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are places where it's much more</v>

1395
01:09:17.671 --> 01:09:20.680
<v Speaker 2>autonomous and the pa's in charge and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1396
01:09:20.681 --> 01:09:24.630
<v Speaker 2>it really varies depending on the area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the big criticism,</v>

1397
01:09:24.631 --> 01:09:28.080
<v Speaker 2>right is that they're occupying and</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people and that is corrosive to</v>

1398
01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.720
<v Speaker 2>the state of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of morally like to,</v>

1399
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.200
<v Speaker 2>to occupy and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

1400
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>what happens if they pull out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>west bank tomorrow?</v>

1401
01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for a two state solution ultimately</v>

1402
01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.200
<v Speaker 2>ending the occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm real,</v>

1403
01:09:43.201 --> 01:09:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I have to be honest about what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would look like.</v>

1404
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.190
<v Speaker 2>WHat would it look like in gaza?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that now you have a terrorist state</v>

1405
01:09:49.191 --> 01:09:52.350
<v Speaker 2>lit right at the border which is ruled</v>
<v Speaker 2>by hamas.</v>

1406
01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:56.880
<v Speaker 2>It is quite likely that that very same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing could happen in the west bank.</v>

1407
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Now let's say actually we actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>should pull up a map.</v>

1408
01:09:59.401 --> 01:10:04.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's say Israel does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then like the whole of Israel proper is</v>

1409
01:10:04.171 --> 01:10:08.580
<v Speaker 2>something like we have to look two miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide.</v>

1410
01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:10.051
<v Speaker 2>We actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1411
01:10:10.051 --> 01:10:15.051
<v Speaker 2>we should look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the distance between like tool car,</v>

1412
01:10:15.221 --> 01:10:17.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like the end of the west bank and</v>

1413
01:10:17.101 --> 01:10:19.650
<v Speaker 2>natanya or tel aviv and you see how</v>
<v Speaker 2>small that is.</v>

1414
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's hard to even conceive of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were in charge of Protecting the</v>

1415
01:10:25.441 --> 01:10:28.770
<v Speaker 2>security of the people who live in</v>
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>

1416
01:10:28.771 --> 01:10:31.500
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago when in the year after high</v>

1417
01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:34.140
<v Speaker 2>school when I was living there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were suicide bombings blowing up</v>

1418
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:36.840
<v Speaker 2>in cafes around the corner from where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>

1419
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Or you going to subject those people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that risk.</v>

1420
01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the actual question facing the</v>

1421
01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:45.930
<v Speaker 2>government of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

1422
01:10:45.931 --> 01:10:48.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm extremely critical of and if I lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Israel,</v>

1423
01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I'd be voting center left in Israel for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

1424
01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:55.710
<v Speaker 2>but that is what they're facing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you zoom out and you pull up</v>

1425
01:10:55.711 --> 01:10:57.900
<v Speaker 2>a map of all of the countries around it,</v>

1426
01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I just want to look.</v>

1427
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:02.980
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

1428
01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:03.401
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iT's okay.</v>

1429
01:11:03.401 --> 01:11:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Actually the one you were on was good</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it showed if you zoomed out it</v>

1430
01:11:07.421 --> 01:11:08.254
<v Speaker 2>had everything,</v>

1431
01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.100
<v Speaker 2>so you have Egypt there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have Jordan,</v>

1432
01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.500
<v Speaker 2>which is teetering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you Syria,</v>

1433
01:11:13.501 --> 01:11:17.100
<v Speaker 2>then you of Lebanon and hIs bellows on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the southern border of Lebanon,</v>

1434
01:11:17.101 --> 01:11:19.040
<v Speaker 2>which is constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1435
01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:24.050
<v Speaker 2>so that's the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people talk about this fantasy</v>

1436
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:28.650
<v Speaker 2>of why can't it just look like America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't there just be a democratic one</v>

1437
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:30.150
<v Speaker 2>state solution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1438
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.250
<v Speaker 2>no one wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pull people constantly.</v>

1439
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.900
<v Speaker 2>But the second thing is like step really</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that's gonna look like if we</v>

1440
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:41.370
<v Speaker 2>dismantle the state of Israel or is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to look like enormous bloodshed?</v>

1441
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.820
<v Speaker 2>The likes of which we see in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these countries surrounding it.</v>

1442
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Like someone once said to me that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to know the word for,</v>

1443
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:52.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a jew without a military,</v>

1444
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.480
<v Speaker 2>it's the [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1445
01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:55.710
<v Speaker 2>It's these eds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the people.</v>

1446
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 2>It's the minorities in the middle east</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had been absolutely</v>

1447
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 2>destroyed and overrun.</v>

1448
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:03.570
<v Speaker 2>ANd this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1449
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think when americans talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this part of the world,</v>

1450
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:11.690
<v Speaker 2>they fully appreciate this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely painful and hard decisions</v>

1451
01:12:12.601 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 2>and the grappling with violence really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1452
01:12:17.191 --> 01:12:20.370
<v Speaker 2>what happened to jamal [inaudible] shogi</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that saudi embassy that's like</v>

1453
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 2>normative for this part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that Israel has somehow with</v>

1454
01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:28.740
<v Speaker 2>all of its flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to eke out a western style</v>

1455
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:31.830
<v Speaker 2>liberal democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly the only place where you and I</v>

1456
01:12:31.831 --> 01:12:35.010
<v Speaker 2>would feel happy and comfortable living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1457
01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:37.500
<v Speaker 2>why are we never talking about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1458
01:12:37.501 --> 01:12:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very difficult for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find the forum,</v>

1459
01:12:40.411 --> 01:12:45.411
<v Speaker 2>to discuss it the way you just did and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to really lay it out in cold,</v>

1460
01:12:46.771 --> 01:12:50.640
<v Speaker 2>stark reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the solution?</v>

1461
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.880
<v Speaker 2>What is the solution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no magic.</v>

1462
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.190
<v Speaker 2>The solution right now is to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything possible to build up the</v>

1463
01:12:59.191 --> 01:13:03.480
<v Speaker 2>palestinian economy to for Israel to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build relationships.</v>

1464
01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a very,</v>

1465
01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:08.250
<v Speaker 2>very positive relationships with Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which gave back the sinai,</v>

1466
01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:10.350
<v Speaker 2>which had had one in the six day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six day war,</v>

1467
01:13:10.351 --> 01:13:12.900
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave it back to Egypt for a cold piece,</v>

1468
01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:16.530
<v Speaker 2>which it's had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a good relationship of all</v>

1469
01:13:16.531 --> 01:13:18.360
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would have thought with Saudi Arabia</v>

1470
01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:20.120
<v Speaker 2>because of their common enemy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran.</v>

1471
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean things shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're rapidly,</v>

1472
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:23.443
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1473
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.170
<v Speaker 2>but as for the palestinians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the solution is to build up the economy,</v>

1474
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:33.260
<v Speaker 2>make life better and support people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>movements inside the west bank that are</v>

1475
01:13:33.781 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 2>genuinely nonviolent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those people exist.</v>

1476
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes they're murdered by groups</v>

1477
01:13:42.421 --> 01:13:44.760
<v Speaker 2>like hamas and their bodies are dragged</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the streets.</v>

1478
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.360
<v Speaker 2>If you're accused of being an israeli</v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborator in the west bank,</v>

1479
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.520
<v Speaker 2>you know what happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your lynched?</v>

1480
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.440
<v Speaker 2>No one talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1481
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.570
<v Speaker 2>no one does talk about that.</v>

1482
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:59.630
<v Speaker 2>What would you be open to discussing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this in this sort of a form with that</v>

1483
01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:04.080
<v Speaker 2>woman from the women's march a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1484
01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you think she would do something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1485
01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be open to it.</v>

1486
01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that people like her have</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever had a conversation with someone</v>

1487
01:14:10.891 --> 01:14:13.830
<v Speaker 2>like you who could lay it out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1488
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 2>because I think that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people who talk about this issue</v>

1489
01:14:18.131 --> 01:14:23.131
<v Speaker 2>have sort of exported aMerican domestic</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics to a foreign region of the</v>

1490
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:28.530
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in a way that this is talked about</v>

1491
01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.850
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the oppressor,</v>

1492
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 2>the oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white,</v>

1493
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:32.110
<v Speaker 2>the blaCk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1494
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:34.960
<v Speaker 2>that's not what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people understand when</v>

1495
01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:38.500
<v Speaker 2>they talk about israeli jews that half</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them are middle eastern,</v>

1496
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:42.070
<v Speaker 2>like half of israeli jews are arab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1497
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:44.410
<v Speaker 2>there's no appreciation of that reality.</v>

1498
01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.690
<v Speaker 2>They think that Israel was just founded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1499
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:51.520
<v Speaker 2>to save the remnant of the jews who</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't destroyed in the holocaust and</v>

1500
01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:54.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helped for those who survived,</v>

1501
01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:57.040
<v Speaker 2>but then once the state of Israel was</v>
<v Speaker 2>established,</v>

1502
01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:02.350
<v Speaker 2>there was a mass exodus of the jews from</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the arab countries where they had</v>

1503
01:15:02.351 --> 01:15:06.160
<v Speaker 2>been living as second class citizens</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they are either self deported</v>

1504
01:15:06.161 --> 01:15:08.860
<v Speaker 2>because they were living at as second</v>
<v Speaker 2>class citizens or they were expelled.</v>

1505
01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.170
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exodus,</v>

1506
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:16.500
<v Speaker 2>that deportation never talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be happy to talk about this with</v>

1507
01:15:16.841 --> 01:15:18.850
<v Speaker 2>someone from the women's march.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

1508
01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.450
<v Speaker 2>what is the response currently like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1509
01:15:21.451 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the current position that most</v>

1510
01:15:24.281 --> 01:15:28.180
<v Speaker 2>people were taking about that woman and</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the woman's march in general</v>

1511
01:15:28.181 --> 01:15:30.320
<v Speaker 2>because of these things because of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>analysts,</v>

1512
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.540
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic statements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people in the past few</v>

1513
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks in part to meghan mccain,</v>

1514
01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:39.610
<v Speaker 2>had five minutes on the view with tamika</v>
<v Speaker 2>mallory and bob land and she did an</v>

1515
01:15:39.611 --> 01:15:42.610
<v Speaker 2>amazing job grilling them on the view.</v>

1516
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.520
<v Speaker 2>The view is what's changed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1517
01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she did an amazing job because,</v>

1518
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:53.250
<v Speaker 2>because frankly because their image was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so powerful in the same way that the</v>

1519
01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:55.450
<v Speaker 2>image of the lincoln memorial was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>

1520
01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.870
<v Speaker 2>journalists just sort of accepted it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't interrogate that.</v>

1521
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Who doesn't want to support that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's our job to be skeptical and</v>

1522
01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:05.630
<v Speaker 2>criticize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1523
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.650
<v Speaker 2>So I think finally a lot of people woke</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to it.</v>

1524
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.851
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1525
01:16:09.851 --> 01:16:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I wrote that column in August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 and it took until now everything in</v>

1526
01:16:13.871 --> 01:16:15.760
<v Speaker 2>that column is the thing people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1527
01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.780
<v Speaker 2>There was also an amazing 10,000 word</v>
<v Speaker 2>expos and tablet magazine and jewish</v>

1528
01:16:19.781 --> 01:16:22.000
<v Speaker 2>online magazine that did a lot of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

1529
01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:25.630
<v Speaker 2>so I think it did reach a tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that is,</v>

1530
01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of my friends on the left</v>

1531
01:16:29.531 --> 01:16:33.850
<v Speaker 2>who are jewish grappling with is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they so desperately want to be a part of</v>

1532
01:16:33.851 --> 01:16:38.851
<v Speaker 2>these movements that they're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of check their identity at the door</v>

1533
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:41.560
<v Speaker 2>in order to gain entry.</v>

1534
01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:47.140
<v Speaker 2>And my thing is any progressive movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's asking you to check your jewish</v>

1535
01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:49.690
<v Speaker 2>identity at the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your full jewish identity,</v>

1536
01:16:49.691 --> 01:16:52.150
<v Speaker 2>which is acknowledging that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a faith,</v>

1537
01:16:52.151 --> 01:16:55.330
<v Speaker 2>but we're at people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not just people that like have</v>

1538
01:16:55.331 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 2>matzah ball soup or something bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

1539
01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 2>That's not a space I want to be a part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1540
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 2>They would never ask that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If any other group.</v>

1541
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Why us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1542
01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Why do they ask that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1543
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:08.320
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the real question.</v>

1544
01:17:08.321 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I really think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1545
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it goes back to what I</v>

1546
01:17:11.451 --> 01:17:14.600
<v Speaker 2>was saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this misunderstanding if you</v>

1547
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:17.240
<v Speaker 2>see the world in an intersectional way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1548
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:21.410
<v Speaker 2>not is intersectionality was originally</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant to be,</v>

1549
01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:25.160
<v Speaker 2>but how it functions in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it functions as a caste system and the</v>

1550
01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:29.240
<v Speaker 2>higher you are on the victim scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least on the left and it's reversed</v>

1551
01:17:29.241 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 2>on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right on the right.</v>

1552
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:33.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cis gendered men are at the top on the</v>

1553
01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:36.980
<v Speaker 2>left there at the bottom and the jews or</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere close down to there at least</v>

1554
01:17:36.981 --> 01:17:40.510
<v Speaker 2>in the way that the left the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this part of the left,</v>

1555
01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about the fringe at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>for now.</v>

1556
01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Perceive the jews to be the woke left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1557
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.350
<v Speaker 2>The jews are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The jews don't rate.</v>

1558
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.640
<v Speaker 2>The jews don't have a place in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>victim scale because they have achieved</v>

1559
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:57.470
<v Speaker 2>so much success because they can pass as</v>
<v Speaker 2>white because of any number of things</v>

1560
01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 2>and so I think that that's a huge reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

1561
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:05.510
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge reason why I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>intersectionality is a dead end and why</v>

1562
01:18:05.511 --> 01:18:09.170
<v Speaker 2>we need to be talking about ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not identity.</v>

1563
01:18:09.171 --> 01:18:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

1564
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 2>That is the thing about America that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>so amazing and like,</v>

1565
01:18:14.391 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really feel it.</v>

1566
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:21.790
<v Speaker 2>That makes us so special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not a country based on blood and</v>

1567
01:18:22.401 --> 01:18:25.430
<v Speaker 2>soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are a country whose national common</v>

1568
01:18:25.431 --> 01:18:29.390
<v Speaker 2>identity is based on ascribing to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>common set of ideas.</v>

1569
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:33.980
<v Speaker 2>That is what we're about and so any</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics that's insisting from the left</v>

1570
01:18:33.981 --> 01:18:37.850
<v Speaker 2>or the right that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually what we are is this warring set</v>

1571
01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:40.340
<v Speaker 2>of groups competing for scarce</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources?</v>

1572
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

1573
01:18:42.321 --> 01:18:44.240
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of politics are unamerican.</v>

1574
01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree more in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

1575
01:18:47.581 --> 01:18:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I think identity politics and the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you belong to a group is so</v>

1576
01:18:51.121 --> 01:18:55.410
<v Speaker 1>intoxicating but so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'S so important to treat people as</v>

1577
01:18:55.411 --> 01:18:57.570
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so important to think of yourself</v>

1578
01:18:57.571 --> 01:19:02.571
<v Speaker 1>as an individual and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this need to become a part of this group</v>

1579
01:19:02.611 --> 01:19:06.240
<v Speaker 1>in a signal to that group is a big part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the problem that we're having right</v>

1580
01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:06.940
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

1581
01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.980
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't mean that you can't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>

1582
01:19:08.981 --> 01:19:13.981
<v Speaker 2>Like I have tremendous pride the most in</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a jew and like jonathan heit talks</v>

1583
01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:18.730
<v Speaker 2>so brilliantly about good identity</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and bad identity politics that</v>

1584
01:19:18.731 --> 01:19:23.620
<v Speaker 2>good identity politics says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk with me in my shoes.</v>

1585
01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:27.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like a big tent sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1586
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.360
<v Speaker 2>come along with me while I explained to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you my experience in the world that</v>

1587
01:19:31.361 --> 01:19:35.920
<v Speaker 2>identity politics says you can never</v>
<v Speaker 2>escape the gender of the racial,</v>

1588
01:19:35.921 --> 01:19:39.790
<v Speaker 2>the economic lane you were born into and</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even try and understand me because</v>

1589
01:19:39.791 --> 01:19:41.560
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bad.</v>

1590
01:19:41.561 --> 01:19:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Identity politics and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's enforced and rising right now in</v>

1591
01:19:45.971 --> 01:19:48.670
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's dangerous and</v>

1592
01:19:48.671 --> 01:19:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about it a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's martin luther king day and</v>

1593
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:56.410
<v Speaker 2>he said this unbelievable thing about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's actually in the.</v>

1594
01:19:56.410 --> 01:19:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I had a dream speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where he talks about the,</v>

1595
01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:04.810
<v Speaker 2>the promissory note of the constitution</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the declaration of independence,</v>

1596
01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That these people who wrote it,</v>

1597
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:11.160
<v Speaker 2>who were slave owners didn't even know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in writing it.</v>

1598
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.820
<v Speaker 2>That every american was going to fall</v>
<v Speaker 2>heir to this promissory note.</v>

1599
01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:19.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's like he saw himself even in</v>
<v Speaker 2>documents that were written by people</v>

1600
01:20:19.261 --> 01:20:24.261
<v Speaker 2>who would not have seen them as fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>human as a way of sort of using that</v>

1601
01:20:24.481 --> 01:20:28.680
<v Speaker 2>common set of values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those common documents to like write</v>

1602
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:31.590
<v Speaker 2>himself into the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that is an example of,</v>

1603
01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:32.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1604
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:37.340
<v Speaker 2>of inclusive identity politics and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling on the thing that we have in</v>

1605
01:20:38.101 --> 01:20:42.270
<v Speaker 2>common too wide in the tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just don't see a lot of that</v>

1606
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 2>happening these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really butchered that.</v>

1607
01:20:44.521 --> 01:20:45.930
<v Speaker 2>But everyone should look up to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1608
01:20:45.931 --> 01:20:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look up,</v>

1609
01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:51.000
<v Speaker 2>jonathan heit gave a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can find the whole text of</v>

1610
01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:52.840
<v Speaker 2>it at city journal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1611
01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:56.280
<v Speaker 2>but if you just look up jonathan heit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good identity politics,</v>

1612
01:20:56.281 --> 01:20:58.470
<v Speaker 2>martin luther king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does an amazing job.</v>

1613
01:20:58.471 --> 01:21:00.270
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really moving</v>

1614
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:03.410
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the happiness hypothesis.</v>

1615
01:21:03.411 --> 01:21:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle of it right now.</v>

1616
01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:06.540
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fantastic.</v>

1617
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:10.190
<v Speaker 1>It's so crucial for people that want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand their own personal biases and</v>

1618
01:21:10.191 --> 01:21:12.520
<v Speaker 1>what's coming and saying he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on here last week.</v>

1619
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is the,</v>

1620
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:16.583
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1621
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.680
<v Speaker 1>the idea of having pride in something</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1622
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.980
<v Speaker 1>is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1623
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that have pride</v>

1624
01:21:23.431 --> 01:21:26.630
<v Speaker 1>for their ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they had nothing to do with,</v>

1625
01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:29.640
<v Speaker 1>with choosing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that they're born</v>

1626
01:21:29.641 --> 01:21:32.670
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people get nervous about that</v>

1627
01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there should be a settling.</v>

1628
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:39.660
<v Speaker 1>It would be wonderful if we could keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these cultures and yet all</v>

1629
01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:43.740
<v Speaker 1>appreciate each other as equals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be wonderful if you could go and</v>

1630
01:21:43.741 --> 01:21:47.160
<v Speaker 1>eat ethiopian food one day or cuban food</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day and they,</v>

1631
01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:49.860
<v Speaker 1>these people exist in the small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the beauty of this.</v>

1632
01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can right now you can,</v>

1633
01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:56.480
<v Speaker 1>but as we get more and more homogenized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you will be able to</v>

1634
01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.820
<v Speaker 2>wait more homogenized or more insistent</v>
<v Speaker 2>on you have to stay in your lane.</v>

1635
01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.890
<v Speaker 1>There's both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both things.</v>

1636
01:22:01.891 --> 01:22:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I think we're definitely cooking off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria as well.</v>

1637
01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Where we're wearing homogenization is</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're making things safer and</v>

1638
01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:15.330
<v Speaker 1>easier for everybody and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some messiness,</v>

1639
01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:19.470
<v Speaker 1>messiness to cultures exchanging with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

1640
01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:21.700
<v Speaker 1>but it is also fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very excited</v>

1641
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:25.300
<v Speaker 2>to say I loved Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I get off that plane and I</v>

1642
01:22:25.301 --> 01:22:30.250
<v Speaker 2>landed at like a shitty as they are at</v>
<v Speaker 2>jfk or laguardia and I see like every</v>

1643
01:22:30.251 --> 01:22:32.410
<v Speaker 2>kind of human being on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1644
01:22:32.411 --> 01:22:34.900
<v Speaker 2>and like I walk everyday from I live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1645
01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I live in manhattan and I walked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1646
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:40.870
<v Speaker 2>They are in bag everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just helps me decompress and the kind</v>

1647
01:22:40.871 --> 01:22:45.280
<v Speaker 2>of like the diversity of people on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sidewalk of midtown manhattan.</v>

1648
01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:49.060
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it to be the most exciting thing</v>

1649
01:22:49.061 --> 01:22:53.380
<v Speaker 2>in the world and the fact that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to live amongst such difference and</v>

1650
01:22:53.381 --> 01:22:57.640
<v Speaker 2>not kill each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles is what drives,</v>

1651
01:22:57.970 --> 01:23:00.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that or you drive there.</v>

1652
01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I love it heRe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why I couldn't live here.</v>

1653
01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Well no one walks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's locked in together in their.</v>

1654
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:08.470
<v Speaker 1>They Stay in their neighborhood and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive out to go somewhere else and they</v>

1655
01:23:08.471 --> 01:23:10.360
<v Speaker 1>don't even interact with each other on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>

1656
01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:13.270
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about the subway in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about walking on the</v>

1657
01:23:13.271 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 1>street is everybody's together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's Together.</v>

1658
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>And there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this interesting melting pot of human</v>

1659
01:23:20.891 --> 01:23:23.920
<v Speaker 1>beings that exist in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist anywhere else in that</v>

1660
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:26.620
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like boston is so much more white.</v>

1661
01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of ethnicities and.</v>

1662
01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.370
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same.</v>

1663
01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:33.790
<v Speaker 1>New york is fucking flavorful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit going on.</v>

1664
01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of great parts to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also what concerns me is that</v>

1665
01:23:38.561 --> 01:23:40.900
<v Speaker 1>people in New York are uniquely hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

1666
01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:42.573
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure,</v>

1667
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:47.480
<v Speaker 1>very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people that I'm even</v>

1668
01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:48.950
<v Speaker 1>friends with from New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1669
01:23:48.951 --> 01:23:51.230
<v Speaker 1>you mother fuckers are stacked on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other too much.</v>

1670
01:23:51.450 --> 01:23:52.730
<v Speaker 1>You like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don'T.</v>

1671
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:54.110
<v Speaker 1>People aren't unique.</v>

1672
01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Like would it be fair?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm from pittsburgh.</v>

1673
01:23:55.961 --> 01:23:58.020
<v Speaker 4>So you might be getting that like</v>
<v Speaker 4>midwestern flavor.</v>

1674
01:23:58.021 --> 01:23:59.140
<v Speaker 4>I bet that's exactly what it is,</v>

1675
01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.380
<v Speaker 1>is pittsburgh's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little more relaxed,</v>

1676
01:24:01.381 --> 01:24:05.260
<v Speaker 1>leSs people have to count on each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and fucking snow gets you.</v>

1677
01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.350
<v Speaker 1>It gets rough out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1678
01:24:07.351 --> 01:24:09.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in a city the same way.</v>

1679
01:24:09.991 --> 01:24:12.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to drive places so different,</v>

1680
01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:14.270
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is very midwest,</v>

1681
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:15.570
<v Speaker 1>pittsburgh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very midwest,</v>

1682
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:17.400
<v Speaker 1>nice place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like pittsburgh,</v>

1683
01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.800
<v Speaker 1>but New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love New York,</v>

1684
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:24.950
<v Speaker 1>but New York always makes me feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have that many people slammed</v>

1685
01:24:25.411 --> 01:24:28.620
<v Speaker 1>on top of each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in this completely unnatural</v>

1686
01:24:28.621 --> 01:24:33.621
<v Speaker 1>environment that literally has never</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed in human nature up until a few</v>

1687
01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.580
<v Speaker 1>hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never happened like that and now it's</v>

1688
01:24:35.581 --> 01:24:39.720
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented because there's more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people there that just buzzing and</v>

1689
01:24:39.721 --> 01:24:41.050
<v Speaker 1>they're putting these buildings up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've.</v>

1690
01:24:41.051 --> 01:24:43.380
<v Speaker 1>You've got 100 floors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend jim norton talks about it all</v>

1691
01:24:43.381 --> 01:24:46.030
<v Speaker 1>the time because he lives in a building</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know a fucking person in</v>

1692
01:24:46.031 --> 01:24:46.500
<v Speaker 1>my building.</v>

1693
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.480
<v Speaker 4>Thousand people in the spirit living in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a building like that.</v>

1694
01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:50.460
<v Speaker 4>I could never live in a high rise</v>
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>

1695
01:24:50.461 --> 01:24:52.380
<v Speaker 4>It freaks me out too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you live in?</v>

1696
01:24:52.381 --> 01:24:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Like a small walk?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brownstone.</v>

1697
01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.130
<v Speaker 4>that's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good move up.</v>

1698
01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.113
<v Speaker 4>Sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the.</v>

1699
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:02.940
<v Speaker 4>But knowing your neighbor like I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:04.650
<v Speaker 4>I also think as an adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>freak me out</v>

1701
01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:06.870
<v Speaker 1>as an intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person like yourself,</v>

1702
01:25:06.871 --> 01:25:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's incredible important to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to experience this.</v>

1703
01:25:11.610 --> 01:25:16.610
<v Speaker 1>There's an exchange of cultures and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought thought in New York that you</v>

1704
01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.900
<v Speaker 1>just don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get on the west coast.</v>

1705
01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:23.130
<v Speaker 1>it's also not entertainment based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a frivolousness to the thought</v>

1706
01:25:23.131 --> 01:25:26.070
<v Speaker 1>process out here that's flavored by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire for fame.</v>

1707
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.870
<v Speaker 4>Avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the one thing I'll say is that,</v>

1708
01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:30.850
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's important for that and I find it so</v>

1709
01:25:30.851 --> 01:25:33.040
<v Speaker 4>energizing New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the reasons you said,</v>

1710
01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 4>but I also have to force myself to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the bubble.</v>

1711
01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:37.953
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

1712
01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.880
<v Speaker 4>I go home to pittsburgh and I hear a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>more oftentimes political and</v>

1713
01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:49.480
<v Speaker 4>intellectual diversity than I hear</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes in a week in New York.</v>

1714
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because everyone's left.</v>

1715
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:52.700
<v Speaker 4>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone in the.</v>

1716
01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Most of my friends are not everyone but</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone.</v>

1717
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Just conservative people in New York</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

1718
01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:59.890
<v Speaker 4>but it's certainly norman ever left</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaning,</v>

1719
01:25:59.950 --> 01:26:01.980
<v Speaker 4>leaning city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oregon.</v>

1720
01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:03.470
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1721
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 4>people</v>

1722
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.510
<v Speaker 2>believe a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1723
01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 2>My mom was the one who told me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump was gonna win</v>

1724
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 2>because she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for her business,</v>

1725
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:13.700
<v Speaker 2>we live in squirrel hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My family,</v>

1726
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.500
<v Speaker 2>we went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was bar mitzvahed in the synagogue.</v>

1727
01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:19.010
<v Speaker 2>That was shot up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's where we live in squirrel hill</v>

1728
01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 2>and the jewish neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my mom for her work has to drive</v>

1729
01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:26.891
<v Speaker 2>like two or three hours out of the city</v>
<v Speaker 2>and during the campaign she would see</v>

1730
01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:28.940
<v Speaker 2>every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone I knew thought hillary was</v>

1731
01:26:28.941 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 2>gonna win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including me,</v>

1732
01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.750
<v Speaker 2>and she called me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barry,</v>

1733
01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.900
<v Speaker 2>you would not believe like the homemade</v>
<v Speaker 2>signs,</v>

1734
01:26:34.901 --> 01:26:36.550
<v Speaker 2>like they're giant homemade signs on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1735
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.370
<v Speaker 2>on the side of people's houses and barns</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are enormous.</v>

1736
01:26:40.371 --> 01:26:44.240
<v Speaker 2>That took them many hours to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a passion for him that I don't</v>

1737
01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:48.440
<v Speaker 2>think people are fully appreciating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't see that everyone I knew</v>

1738
01:26:48.441 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Speaker 2>was voting for hillary clinton.</v>

1739
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:50.583
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1740
01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.431
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1741
01:26:53.431 --> 01:26:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's like for you out</v>
<v Speaker 2>here</v>

1742
01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.550
<v Speaker 1>is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1743
01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

1744
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:02.430
<v Speaker 1>not only is it incredibly left leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is also the entertainment aspect of</v>

1745
01:27:02.431 --> 01:27:07.230
<v Speaker 1>it where people have to signal the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're left so they'd go out of</v>

1746
01:27:07.231 --> 01:27:12.060
<v Speaker 1>their way to project this image of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive on top of being progressive.</v>

1747
01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:14.220
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost critical to your job.</v>

1748
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

1749
01:27:15.331 --> 01:27:18.240
<v Speaker 1>you have to show everybody you can out</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive with the people</v>

1750
01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.970
<v Speaker 2>in secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they tell you what they really think</v>

1751
01:27:20.971 --> 01:27:22.320
<v Speaker 2>because you're like a safe person?</v>

1752
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1753
01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.560
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not those people to people that are</v>

1754
01:27:27.561 --> 01:27:28.394
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1755
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't like her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's such a piece of shit I'm going</v>

1756
01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:32.060
<v Speaker 1>to vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

1757
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:37.070
<v Speaker 1>That was more common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing was we like socially.</v>

1758
01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:42.190
<v Speaker 1>People appreciate the democrats and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left because they feel like socially in</v>

1759
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:44.030
<v Speaker 1>terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example.</v>

1760
01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 1>When barack obama was the president and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1761
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:51.521
<v Speaker 1>people can criticize his policies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whistle blower or the fact that he</v>

1762
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.760
<v Speaker 1>cracked down on whistle blowers and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that there was more innocent killed</v>

1763
01:27:55.761 --> 01:27:57.830
<v Speaker 1>by drone strikes and they have all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is.</v>

1764
01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.170
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's pr.</v>

1765
01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It's an impossible job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's perfect as a president,</v>

1766
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.810
<v Speaker 1>but what he did do was he represented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1767
01:28:05.811 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 1>he represented the fact that a minority</v>
<v Speaker 1>or an african american who was born from</v>

1768
01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:15.011
<v Speaker 1>a single mother can somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>rise to be the president of the United</v>

1769
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:20.330
<v Speaker 1>States and be incredibly well spoken and</v>
<v Speaker 1>measured and calm and just seems to know</v>

1770
01:28:20.331 --> 01:28:24.440
<v Speaker 1>how to carry himself and makes us feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone better than us is in a</v>

1771
01:28:24.441 --> 01:28:28.700
<v Speaker 1>position of power and it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there was a lot of racism</v>

1772
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:33.320
<v Speaker 1>from what from a horrible white people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looked at him in a terrible way and</v>

1773
01:28:33.321 --> 01:28:35.690
<v Speaker 1>saw this black person trying to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1774
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:38.950
<v Speaker 1>but way more people that aren't racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1775
01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:39.843
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

1776
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have an african american</v>

1777
01:28:42.261 --> 01:28:44.600
<v Speaker 1>president look at this like we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting better.</v>

1778
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like we're getting better.</v>

1779
01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Like culturally the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we communicate,</v>

1780
01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.220
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that right now and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have that with her.</v>

1781
01:28:55.750 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 1>What she didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she represented was the same old</v>

1782
01:29:00.021 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's been fucking</v>

1783
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.940
<v Speaker 3>you and the reason why your family lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>the farm and the reason why in this</v>

1784
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:09.120
<v Speaker 3>donald trump's going to come in here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to clean up the swamp,</v>

1785
01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:13.290
<v Speaker 3>and when he came out with that drain the</v>
<v Speaker 3>swamp and lock her up,</v>

1786
01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:18.270
<v Speaker 3>build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he boiled it down so that the people</v>

1787
01:29:18.271 --> 01:29:22.920
<v Speaker 3>that don't have the time or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>inclination to really deep dive into</v>

1788
01:29:22.921 --> 01:29:27.060
<v Speaker 3>their own personal biases to their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>objective reasoning and find out what is</v>

1789
01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I think the way?</v>

1790
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:30.330
<v Speaker 3>I think the people that don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

1791
01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:32.940
<v Speaker 3>all that build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wall shit was perfect.</v>

1792
01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Line it up and that's most folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most folks don't have the time.</v>

1793
01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Most folks Work all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're tired.</v>

1794
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.170
<v Speaker 3>They have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably have a hobby.</v>

1795
01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:43.650
<v Speaker 3>they don't have the fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a person who thinks for living,</v>

1796
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.210
<v Speaker 3>you think and write for a living.</v>

1797
01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:47.610
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1798
01:29:47.611 --> 01:29:50.430
<v Speaker 3>one thing I'm seeing when I asked you</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the people,</v>

1799
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:52.650
<v Speaker 3>people telling you their secret thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>crimes,</v>

1800
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I am noticing and in a weird way this</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives me kind of a hope.</v>

1801
01:29:58.610 --> 01:30:03.600
<v Speaker 3>There is a big gap between people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>public personas of the politics that</v>

1802
01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:08.340
<v Speaker 3>they preach and then what they really</v>
<v Speaker 3>think and what they'll say around the</v>

1803
01:30:08.341 --> 01:30:11.760
<v Speaker 3>kitchen table and a lot of them are</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing what I call,</v>

1804
01:30:11.761 --> 01:30:16.761
<v Speaker 3>what I think about is like second woke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're seeing the poverty or the</v>

1805
01:30:17.521 --> 01:30:20.760
<v Speaker 3>flaws in the wilk worldview and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are holes with it,</v>

1806
01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:23.970
<v Speaker 3>but they're kind of too scared to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that out loud because they know it'll be</v>

1807
01:30:23.971 --> 01:30:27.360
<v Speaker 3>a loss of friends and social capital and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>

1808
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:29.580
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people talk to me a lot.</v>

1809
01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Those people send me emails a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes there are people with</v>

1810
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:39.080
<v Speaker 3>platforms who don't want to lose their</v>
<v Speaker 3>audience and I find that somewhat</v>

1811
01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:40.224
<v Speaker 3>hopeful.</v>

1812
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:43.830
<v Speaker 3>I find it somewhat hopeful too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also got to nut nut up.</v>

1813
01:30:43.890 --> 01:30:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like come out,</v>

1814
01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:50.510
<v Speaker 3>come on rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured I'd say something like that</v>

1815
01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:51.840
<v Speaker 3>met up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good way,</v>

1816
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:55.140
<v Speaker 3>but you're right that the thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>process behind nutting up is exactly</v>

1817
01:30:55.141 --> 01:30:57.330
<v Speaker 3>what they need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's more people did it.</v>

1818
01:30:57.331 --> 01:30:58.680
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1819
01:30:58.681 --> 01:31:00.510
<v Speaker 3>we're kind of surrounded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like,</v>

1820
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:03.103
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1821
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:06.990
<v Speaker 3>What I think about like I am never the</v>
<v Speaker 3>smartest person in any room.</v>

1822
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I promise you,</v>

1823
01:31:08.911 --> 01:31:10.230
<v Speaker 3>you're probably smarter than us in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

1824
01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if jamie had to top trust</v>

1825
01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:16.290
<v Speaker 3>me what makes me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason I'm sitting here is that</v>

1826
01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:20.670
<v Speaker 3>I have like slightly more courage than</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people and that I'm willing to say</v>

1827
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:25.671
<v Speaker 3>what I think to hell with pissing some</v>
<v Speaker 3>people off or losing some friends that</v>

1828
01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:28.380
<v Speaker 3>weren't really my friends.</v>

1829
01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Most people aren't willing to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

1830
01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I like about your writing in a.</v>

1831
01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:38.370
<v Speaker 3>What I like about talking to you today</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you represent reason and well</v>

1832
01:31:38.371 --> 01:31:42.240
<v Speaker 3>thought out opinions and those two</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are very rare.</v>

1833
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opinions are way more rare in my</v>

1834
01:31:47.041 --> 01:31:49.680
<v Speaker 3>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than what you usually get,</v>

1835
01:31:49.710 --> 01:31:53.280
<v Speaker 3>which you usually get is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conglomeration of opinions that seemed</v>

1836
01:31:53.281 --> 01:31:57.420
<v Speaker 3>to make sense per peripherally or</v>
<v Speaker 3>casually.</v>

1837
01:31:57.421 --> 01:32:00.210
<v Speaker 3>They have a veneer of logic to them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1838
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll go with that because I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time because most people don't have</v>

1839
01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.120
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1840
01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:06.310
<v Speaker 3>going back to Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we're probably.</v>

1841
01:32:06.311 --> 01:32:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Are we wrapping up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going back to Israel for one second.</v>

1842
01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:11.020
<v Speaker 3>It's become like a pillar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1843
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:12.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1844
01:32:12.071 --> 01:32:14.740
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in</v>

1845
01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:19.180
<v Speaker 3>criminal justice reform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like any number of things.</v>

1846
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:19.901
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

1847
01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:20.590
<v Speaker 3>Israel is bad.</v>

1848
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Like it became one of those things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people don't really think about.</v>

1849
01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I think it's really important</v>

1850
01:32:27.011 --> 01:32:30.490
<v Speaker 3>to think about things issue by issue and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just be like,</v>

1851
01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.800
<v Speaker 3>yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>signing up for this whole slew of</v>

1852
01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 3>policies and views on things when</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually some of those things don't go</v>

1853
01:32:37.061 --> 01:32:38.000
<v Speaker 3>together at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1854
01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:41.500
<v Speaker 3>one thing than the woke left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to do is criticize</v>

1855
01:32:41.501 --> 01:32:46.000
<v Speaker 3>the more repressive aspects of islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to.</v>

1856
01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:49.180
<v Speaker 3>You don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you bring up anything becomes</v>

1857
01:32:49.181 --> 01:32:52.960
<v Speaker 3>islamophobic in even if it's homophobic</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

1858
01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:58.490
<v Speaker 3>if the ideas are homophobic or if women</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to wear restrictive clothing,</v>

1859
01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.100
<v Speaker 3>all any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of the things that are incredibly</v>

1860
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:07.030
<v Speaker 3>commonplace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not allowed to criticize those</v>

1861
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:09.400
<v Speaker 3>because those fall into a protected</v>
<v Speaker 3>category.</v>

1862
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I first ran into this in</v>
<v Speaker 3>college when we were talking,</v>

1863
01:33:15.191 --> 01:33:18.220
<v Speaker 3>I was in a conversation with other</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists and I definitely consider</v>

1864
01:33:18.221 --> 01:33:22.330
<v Speaker 3>myself a feminist about female genital</v>
<v Speaker 3>mutilation and I encountered for the</v>

1865
01:33:22.331 --> 01:33:24.700
<v Speaker 3>first time a species that I've come to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know well,</v>

1866
01:33:24.701 --> 01:33:27.190
<v Speaker 3>which is feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who sorta defend female genital</v>

1867
01:33:27.191 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 3>mutilation on the grounds of cultural</v>
<v Speaker 3>relativism.</v>

1868
01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Who are we to judge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember just like I did not get</v>

1869
01:33:35.561 --> 01:33:37.370
<v Speaker 3>over the shock of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't.</v>

1870
01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.020
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1871
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:41.741
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1872
01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm an outspoken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rabid critic of circumcision.</v>

1873
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:49.120
<v Speaker 3>I think it's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's ridiculous.</v>

1874
01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:51.640
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least your dick still works.</v>

1875
01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:57.820
<v Speaker 3>The idea that someone tried to equate</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumcision and female genital</v>

1876
01:33:57.821 --> 01:34:00.340
<v Speaker 3>mutilation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person on the left did when I talked</v>

1877
01:34:00.341 --> 01:34:03.400
<v Speaker 3>about it recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some fucking asshole online.</v>

1878
01:34:03.401 --> 01:34:06.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't even.</v>

1879
01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1880
01:34:08.381 --> 01:34:10.720
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read it and I went there.</v>

1881
01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Their vagina doesn't work the same way</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1882
01:34:13.001 --> 01:34:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand that you can't have an</v>
<v Speaker 3>orgasm anymore.</v>

1883
01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.740
<v Speaker 3>You're cutting off a woman's cliteracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1884
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Not because of cleanliness or any</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking weird logic that they're using</v>

1885
01:34:22.601 --> 01:34:26.590
<v Speaker 3>today to try to justify circumcision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way worse,</v>

1886
01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.020
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing it to try to eliminate</v>

1887
01:34:29.021 --> 01:34:30.490
<v Speaker 3>pleasure because you don't want the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman to leave.</v>

1888
01:34:30.491 --> 01:34:34.270
<v Speaker 3>It'S the same reason why you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>cover up with some crazy,</v>

1889
01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.000
<v Speaker 3>but why barb?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1890
01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:39.790
<v Speaker 3>the leaders of the women's march talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about say,</v>

1891
01:34:39.791 --> 01:34:41.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honor killings,</v>

1892
01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:46.390
<v Speaker 3>female genital mutilation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forced marriage for,</v>

1893
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:48.250
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for girls,</v>

1894
01:34:48.251 --> 01:34:49.360
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

1895
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Instead they're talking about bds in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>

1896
01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:56.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to ask someone about that also.</v>

1897
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Have you been to Israel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1898
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take you say yes.</v>

1899
01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go.</v>

1900
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly go.</v>

1901
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I've got to bring already though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll translate.</v>

1902
01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good friend.</v>

1903
01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he loves to travel too,</v>

1904
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 1>so he'd be down in heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1905
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:16.933
<v Speaker 1>what was I gonna say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1906
01:35:17.690 --> 01:35:20.240
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that,</v>

1907
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.990
<v Speaker 1>do you think that here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a better way for them.</v>

1908
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's too many things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to?</v>

1909
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Not just worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even in terms of like left versus</v>

1910
01:35:33.201 --> 01:35:34.480
<v Speaker 1>right in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1911
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:38.390
<v Speaker 1>in these positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I often talk to people about gun</v>

1912
01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:43.370
<v Speaker 1>control and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when people find out that I own guns</v>

1913
01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:48.080
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not entirely in favor of second</v>

1914
01:35:48.081 --> 01:35:52.310
<v Speaker 1>amendment being repealed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that drives me crazy is they</v>

1915
01:35:52.311 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 1>want to always bring up school</v>
<v Speaker 1>shootings,</v>

1916
01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:56.540
<v Speaker 1>mass shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things which I agree</v>

1917
01:35:56.541 --> 01:36:01.541
<v Speaker 1>are horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible occurrence in our culture and</v>

1918
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:04.160
<v Speaker 1>is happening in this insanely frequent</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1919
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people don't want to talk about is</v>

1920
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:09.920
<v Speaker 1>that almost all those people are on</v>
<v Speaker 1>psych medication.</v>

1921
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of them right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation does not equal causation.</v>

1922
01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Them being on the psych medicine might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the same reason why they're shooting</v>

1923
01:36:18.441 --> 01:36:19.850
<v Speaker 1>up schools in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1924
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:23.900
<v Speaker 1>they're incredibly mentally unwell and</v>
<v Speaker 1>legally buy a gun.</v>

1925
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.220
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

1926
01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.210
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1927
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.370
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do I think that you should then</v>

1928
01:36:31.371 --> 01:36:32.990
<v Speaker 1>here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>

1929
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:37.640
<v Speaker 1>who is the person to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the what the nra would say,</v>

1930
01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:40.040
<v Speaker 1>and this is what a pro second amendment</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would say.</v>

1931
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Who are you to decide whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is healthy enough or well enough</v>

1932
01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:48.620
<v Speaker 1>to own a gun and does a person who is on</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants or person who has</v>

1933
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:51.860
<v Speaker 1>psychological problems not have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to defend themselves if they</v>

1934
01:36:51.861 --> 01:36:54.470
<v Speaker 1>have never exhibited violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the problem.</v>

1935
01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:57.470
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these mother fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't exhibit violence until they</v>

1936
01:36:57.471 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 1>break until they pop and then they'd go</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot up a school.</v>

1937
01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's threats like adam</v>
<v Speaker 1>lanza or a couple other ones were the</v>

1938
01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:07.640
<v Speaker 1>fbi comes and visits them and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to them or the guy in Colorado</v>

1939
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:10.070
<v Speaker 1>where they knew he was like hanging on</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a string,</v>

1940
01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:15.020
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on that gap,</v>

1941
01:37:15.021 --> 01:37:17.640
<v Speaker 1>which I think is like a far writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely used by the fire,</v>

1942
01:37:17.641 --> 01:37:19.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used by the far right.</v>

1943
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:22.190
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when you have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction whatsoever and you have</v>

1944
01:37:22.191 --> 01:37:23.840
<v Speaker 1>restriction and all these other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1945
01:37:23.841 --> 01:37:26.990
<v Speaker 1>If you say something antisemitic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist on twitter,</v>

1946
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:28.970
<v Speaker 1>they will ban you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do it on facebook,</v>

1947
01:37:28.971 --> 01:37:32.330
<v Speaker 1>they'll ban you and gab is committed 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of free speech.</v>

1948
01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read things the owners of gab have</v>

1949
01:37:35.901 --> 01:37:40.901
<v Speaker 1>said about this and that they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very steadfast in their support</v>

1950
01:37:41.031 --> 01:37:45.980
<v Speaker 1>for freedom of speech because they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I said earlier that the best way to</v>

1951
01:37:45.981 --> 01:37:50.690
<v Speaker 1>ensure that good ideas get through is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not suppress bad ideas,</v>

1952
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but to combat them with better ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say is that the guy who</v>

1953
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>shot up</v>

1954
01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.700
<v Speaker 2>the synagogue in pittsburgh was saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most horrific things about the cake</v>

1955
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.270
<v Speaker 2>infestation in your country</v>

1956
01:38:02.770 --> 01:38:05.100
<v Speaker 1>on gab and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the question is,</v>

1957
01:38:05.101 --> 01:38:08.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should someone like roku pull Alex</v>

1958
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should they take off?</v>

1959
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that this is a real question</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as someone who's to myself on the</v>

1960
01:38:15.281 --> 01:38:17.650
<v Speaker 2>free making the free speech argument a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>

1961
01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's something that we really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really have to grapple with.</v>

1962
01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:23.620
<v Speaker 2>IT really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we're dealing with</v>

1963
01:38:23.621 --> 01:38:26.320
<v Speaker 2>crude tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're trying to perform surgery</v>

1964
01:38:26.321 --> 01:38:31.321
<v Speaker 2>with hatchets oh fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get to those people and have</v>

1965
01:38:32.021 --> 01:38:34.330
<v Speaker 2>that discussion with all those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is.</v>

1966
01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean in terms of there being too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about and cover,</v>

1967
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:41.800
<v Speaker 2>that's where I do think that things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York times can make a real</v>

1968
01:38:41.801 --> 01:38:46.801
<v Speaker 2>contribution because we like there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>adults in the room deciding what the</v>

1969
01:38:48.761 --> 01:38:52.570
<v Speaker 2>important news is that you should pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to in theory at least.</v>

1970
01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1971
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wholeheartedly agree.</v>

1972
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:58.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to learn about the genocide</v>

1973
01:38:58.301 --> 01:39:01.450
<v Speaker 2>of the week muslims in the New York to</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like if you really read the New York</v>

1974
01:39:01.451 --> 01:39:04.030
<v Speaker 2>times every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to know a lot about the</v>

1975
01:39:04.031 --> 01:39:07.060
<v Speaker 2>world and you're going to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the government shut down is a</v>

1976
01:39:07.061 --> 01:39:10.000
<v Speaker 2>bigger deal than what happened on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>steps of the lincoln memorial.</v>

1977
01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:14.440
<v Speaker 2>If you're just trolling through twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how like every person I know,</v>

1978
01:39:14.441 --> 01:39:17.530
<v Speaker 2>or twitter or snapchat or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my youngest sister,</v>

1979
01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:20.830
<v Speaker 2>how she gets her news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to necessarily know</v>

1980
01:39:20.831 --> 01:39:25.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real problem is I don't know</v>

1981
01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:29.350
<v Speaker 2>how to solve it other than tell people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to subscribe to newspapers,</v>

1982
01:39:29.351 --> 01:39:32.620
<v Speaker 2>which still have some standards and</v>
<v Speaker 2>which still when they make a mistake,</v>

1983
01:39:32.650 --> 01:39:33.820
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mistake.</v>

1984
01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.440
<v Speaker 1>How many of those are left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few.</v>

1985
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work at one of them.</v>

1986
01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.550
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely do.</v>

1987
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1988
01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said something to someone from the New</v>

1989
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:48.680
<v Speaker 1>York times online after a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an article that they wrote about a</v>

1990
01:39:48.681 --> 01:39:51.290
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a boxing match economy.</v>

1991
01:39:51.291 --> 01:39:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor and floyd mayweather were</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress.</v>

1992
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.050
<v Speaker 1>It was a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd made with school them,</v>

1993
01:39:55.750 --> 01:40:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but at the end it said that conor</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor's face was swollen and bleeding</v>

1994
01:40:01.190 --> 01:40:04.700
<v Speaker 1>and he was knocked through the ropes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1995
01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:07.100
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that because everybody saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight.</v>

1996
01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.200
<v Speaker 1>That didn't happen in this crazy time</v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody is crying out for fake</v>

1997
01:40:12.201 --> 01:40:15.650
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say his face was covered in</v>

1998
01:40:15.651 --> 01:40:18.740
<v Speaker 1>blood when there was no blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that like don't do.</v>

1999
01:40:18.741 --> 01:40:20.930
<v Speaker 1>That was corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was corrected.</v>

2000
01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Which is so rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually not.</v>

2001
01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:24.840
<v Speaker 2>We correct things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2002
01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.060
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2003
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.950
<v Speaker 2>but how do you stop it from happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place?</v>

2004
01:40:27.951 --> 01:40:29.680
<v Speaker 2>How do you stop that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2005
01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:31.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first one is really high blood.</v>

2006
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:33.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no blood when it doesn't exist.</v>

2007
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying it's really hard.</v>

2008
01:40:35.541 --> 01:40:38.990
<v Speaker 2>What I mean is journalists just</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't make mistakes like that,</v>

2009
01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:43.430
<v Speaker 2>but we do the difference with the New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York times and any number of these other</v>

2010
01:40:43.431 --> 01:40:46.850
<v Speaker 2>places is that we say we made a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we correct.</v>

2011
01:40:47.150 --> 01:40:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's high part matters pros.</v>

2012
01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:52.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like someone having getting ahead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of themselves having a little too much</v>

2013
01:40:52.821 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't remember that article.</v>

2014
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't necessarily think it's getting</v>

2015
01:40:56.411 --> 01:41:00.340
<v Speaker 1>ahead and read some fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They applied fiction to an actual sport</v>

2016
01:41:00.341 --> 01:41:01.870
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was bizarre,</v>

2017
01:41:01.871 --> 01:41:03.610
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they correct.</v>

2018
01:41:03.710 --> 01:41:04.640
<v Speaker 1>They did correct it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2019
01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:08.320
<v Speaker 1>here's what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's important is you can at least get</v>

2020
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:11.560
<v Speaker 1>a better version of the facts there than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can anywhere else.</v>

2021
01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2022
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's some people in the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>media landscape that I see and I don't</v>

2023
01:41:17.411 --> 01:41:20.350
<v Speaker 2>know if it's because they want to sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of join up their own audiences are what</v>

2024
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:26.310
<v Speaker 2>like nihilistic getting like using</v>
<v Speaker 2>trumpist language to describe the press.</v>

2025
01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Would they don't see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would they don't know?</v>

2026
01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I think what they don't understand is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the loss of trust in the press is a</v>

2027
01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:41.440
<v Speaker 2>symptom of the loss of trust in lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>public institutions.</v>

2028
01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.380
<v Speaker 2>The who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world health organization just came</v>

2029
01:41:44.381 --> 01:41:48.490
<v Speaker 2>out with this terrifying report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like one of the top 10 threats to</v>

2030
01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:51.180
<v Speaker 2>health in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the country you should,</v>

2031
01:41:51.190 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 2>we should look this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is people who aren't getting vaccines.</v>

2032
01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 2>People who think vaccines cause autism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and are not getting vaccines.</v>

2033
01:41:58.330 --> 01:42:03.330
<v Speaker 2>The stakes of like loss of trust in</v>
<v Speaker 2>public institutions doesn't just mean</v>

2034
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.010
<v Speaker 2>like you're gonna like hurt the New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

2035
01:42:06.011 --> 01:42:08.500
<v Speaker 2>bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a threat to all of our health.</v>

2036
01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Like quite literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2037
01:42:10.841 --> 01:42:13.780
<v Speaker 2>I see these things as being very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very connected.</v>

2038
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:18.250
<v Speaker 2>So when I see people gleefully</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrating like the fake news of the</v>

2039
01:42:18.251 --> 01:42:21.190
<v Speaker 2>New York times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like juva better alternative right</v>

2040
01:42:21.191 --> 01:42:23.520
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2041
01:42:23.610 --> 01:42:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

2042
01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Not you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>

2043
01:42:25.861 --> 01:42:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2044
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why anyone would</v>

2045
01:42:28.981 --> 01:42:30.840
<v Speaker 1>celebrate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think it falls into what we were talking</v>

2046
01:42:30.841 --> 01:42:34.280
<v Speaker 1>about before that it's an easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>digestible ideology that you can just</v>

2047
01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:37.010
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a conglomeration of preformed</v>

2048
01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:39.720
<v Speaker 1>opinions and you lock in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start saying fake news,</v>

2049
01:42:39.930 --> 01:42:41.970
<v Speaker 1>and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

2050
01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.200
<v Speaker 1>it's exacerbated by this situation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find ourselves in where people aren't</v>

2051
01:42:46.201 --> 01:42:49.680
<v Speaker 1>really buying newspapers anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get people to subscribe.</v>

2052
01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:55.370
<v Speaker 1>I subscribe to several on my phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my computer and that's how I digest</v>

2053
01:42:55.621 --> 01:42:58.530
<v Speaker 1>things now or an ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

2054
01:42:58.890 --> 01:43:03.890
<v Speaker 1>you think about what they have to do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get those clicks and you see these weird</v>

2055
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:08.130
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not a knock on forbes.</v>

2056
01:43:08.131 --> 01:43:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I think forbes is an excellent</v>
<v Speaker 1>periodical.</v>

2057
01:43:10.530 --> 01:43:11.510
<v Speaker 1>They're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2058
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:13.830
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they write some really important stuff,</v>

2059
01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:19.250
<v Speaker 1>but almost every month they will write</v>
<v Speaker 1>this super click baity thing about cell</v>

2060
01:43:20.691 --> 01:43:21.524
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

2061
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Like it comes with a nasty surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new galaxy s 10 has a nasty surprise</v>

2062
01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's so unimaginative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2063
01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2064
01:43:31.450 --> 01:43:36.450
<v Speaker 1>see if you can find how many nasty</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise articles about iphones and I've</v>

2065
01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:40.830
<v Speaker 1>about video games and stuff a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have like a contributor network</v>

2066
01:43:40.831 --> 01:43:42.570
<v Speaker 1>that people are just allowed to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>articles on?</v>

2067
01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they allow post used to have that too.</v>

2068
01:43:46.890 --> 01:43:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking stuff is so dangerous</v>

2069
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:54.500
<v Speaker 1>because as soon as people lose trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are unbiased and you're giving</v>

2070
01:43:55.401 --> 01:43:58.550
<v Speaker 1>them an objective perspective on exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on,</v>

2071
01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.010
<v Speaker 1>as soon as that mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be nothing when it comes to</v>

2072
01:44:01.011 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 1>galaxy s tens or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about.</v>

2073
01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:06.010
<v Speaker 1>This has a nasty surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2074
01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:09.910
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it flavors your perspective on news of</v>

2075
01:44:09.911 --> 01:44:12.110
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these people are fighting for their</v>

2076
01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:14.840
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journalists and people in contributors</v>

2077
01:44:14.841 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 1>to these websites and news and</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers are fighting for their life</v>

2078
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 1>because everything is dropping off.</v>

2079
01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.760
<v Speaker 1>The revenues are down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revenues are.</v>

2080
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:23.900
<v Speaker 1>And then like what's what takes their</v>
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

2081
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>What took place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bloggers,</v>

2082
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.110
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's looking at them?</v>

2083
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure that they have journalistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics and standards that are like what</v>

2084
01:44:32.631 --> 01:44:34.460
<v Speaker 1>we would expect from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

2085
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:35.400
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2086
01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:38.320
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this brings you to the end from ars</v>

2087
01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 1>info wars thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2088
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:42.740
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's a journalist,</v>

2089
01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:45.830
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely not a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>

2090
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:48.440
<v Speaker 1>but this is what people are fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2091
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:51.540
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the whole shebang.</v>

2092
01:44:51.550 --> 01:44:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some of that news that you're getting</v>

2093
01:44:54.351 --> 01:44:59.000
<v Speaker 1>in these traditional venues is fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is dangerous.</v>

2094
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:02.660
<v Speaker 1>If any of it is click baity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If any of it is deceptive and agree with</v>

2095
01:45:02.661 --> 01:45:04.310
<v Speaker 1>you more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking dangerous.</v>

2096
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Especially because we have a president</v>
<v Speaker 1>who attacks the presses,</v>

2097
01:45:06.930 --> 01:45:09.500
<v Speaker 1>the member like clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the context we're operating.</v>

2098
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2099
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:13.670
<v Speaker 1>we have trump calling us the enemy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people so crazy.</v>

2100
01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:18.210
<v Speaker 1>The lack of understanding of views it</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

2101
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2102
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:22.220
<v Speaker 1>There were easy to drive insane though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest.</v>

2103
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:24.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of dummies out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the problem.</v>

2104
01:45:24.711 --> 01:45:27.950
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy to prod a certain group and</v>

2105
01:45:27.951 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

2106
01:45:28.821 --> 01:45:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do something about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2107
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:33.440
<v Speaker 1>this is the danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you have to worry about.</v>

2108
01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.240
<v Speaker 1>The people that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2109
01:45:35.241 --> 01:45:37.910
<v Speaker 1>they're signaling to their signaling to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the far right,</v>

2110
01:45:37.911 --> 01:45:41.090
<v Speaker 1>they're signaling to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people like that.</v>

2111
01:45:41.091 --> 01:45:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Not that would shoot people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know a lot of people that are</v>

2112
01:45:43.791 --> 01:45:47.570
<v Speaker 1>signalers that like far right signaler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like they'll see things and I've.</v>

2113
01:45:47.571 --> 01:45:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people that I hope trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>wins because we've got to put a stop to</v>

2114
01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:53.180
<v Speaker 1>all this nonsense with the nonsense.</v>

2115
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:56.810
<v Speaker 1>It's progressive nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea socialist like bernie sanders</v>

2116
01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:58.550
<v Speaker 1>going to come along and take all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2117
01:45:58.551 --> 01:46:01.940
<v Speaker 1>We're struggling hard working americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to put America first.</v>

2118
01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Put America first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just lack of understanding about</v>

2119
01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:11.300
<v Speaker 1>the complexity of the entire landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire landscape in terms of</v>

2120
01:46:11.301 --> 01:46:13.490
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire landscape in terms of</v>

2121
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.710
<v Speaker 1>international politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

2122
01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 1>All the above the war machine into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2123
01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:21.530
<v Speaker 1>the lack of understanding about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military industrial complex and the</v>

2124
01:46:21.531 --> 01:46:24.140
<v Speaker 1>influence that it has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lack of understanding about the</v>

2125
01:46:24.141 --> 01:46:27.560
<v Speaker 1>bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how few people went to jail after</v>

2126
01:46:27.561 --> 01:46:30.830
<v Speaker 1>the fucking crazy economic collapse that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just recovered.</v>

2127
01:46:30.831 --> 01:46:33.840
<v Speaker 1>From what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you view,</v>

2128
01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you've seen inside job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seen that documentary.</v>

2129
01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:39.920
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all about the financial</v>

2130
01:46:39.921 --> 01:46:41.360
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pulled that up,</v>

2131
01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:42.650
<v Speaker 1>find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2132
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from 2000,</v>

2133
01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to say 10:11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's so sobering</v>

2134
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.010
<v Speaker 3>when you have this guy who's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>economics of real,</v>

2135
01:46:53.011 --> 01:46:58.011
<v Speaker 3>true economics expert questioning these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who in many cases they're a</v>

2136
01:46:58.530 --> 01:47:03.530
<v Speaker 3>economics professors at major</v>
<v Speaker 3>universities who give advice.</v>

2137
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand 10.</v>

2138
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charles ferguson.</v>

2139
01:47:06.570 --> 01:47:08.790
<v Speaker 3>That was a gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did a good job.</v>

2140
01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:09.810
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so sad.</v>

2141
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.490
<v Speaker 3>He's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him,</v>

2142
01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:15.540
<v Speaker 3>but he's forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Team America is one of the greatest</v>

2143
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:18.740
<v Speaker 3>movies of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That ideology should roll.</v>

2144
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:19.603
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2145
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:21.900
<v Speaker 3>And you know what I love about it more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than anything,</v>

2146
01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:24.330
<v Speaker 3>the whole idea that actors have to save</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world</v>

2147
01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:30.880
<v Speaker 3>because I just think is so brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I inadvertently saw that movie with</v>

2148
01:47:32.641 --> 01:47:36.120
<v Speaker 3>my dad and my grandfather and I will</v>
<v Speaker 3>never forget the puppet sex scene</v>

2149
01:47:36.121 --> 01:47:40.270
<v Speaker 3>watching that</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

2150
01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 3>That oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rIght next to your desk and you know you</v>

2151
01:47:43.531 --> 01:47:46.650
<v Speaker 3>should they ever make that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I made a mistake of</v>

2152
01:47:46.651 --> 01:47:47.484
<v Speaker 3>doing yesterday?</v>

2153
01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.000
<v Speaker 3>I watch ace ventura pet detective with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my eight year old and my 10 year old</v>

2154
01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:56.580
<v Speaker 3>since they came out with a good still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize how transphobic that</v>

2155
01:47:56.671 --> 01:47:59.790
<v Speaker 3>fucking movie is</v>
<v Speaker 3>alert.</v>

2156
01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:04.940
<v Speaker 3>The whole premise is that there was an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ace ventura pet detective.</v>

2157
01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:09.640
<v Speaker 3>I got a spoiler it myself because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>forgot the Whole premise was wet.</v>

2158
01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:13.500
<v Speaker 3>This guy steals a dolphin and when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>steals a dolphin,</v>

2159
01:48:14.010 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 3>ace ventura fines because he's a pet</v>
<v Speaker 3>detective,</v>

2160
01:48:16.710 --> 01:48:21.710
<v Speaker 3>finds a tiny ruby that's at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this dolphin tank that is missing</v>

2161
01:48:22.861 --> 01:48:27.861
<v Speaker 3>from a miami dolphins ring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he finds out through this exhaustive</v>

2162
01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:33.230
<v Speaker 3>search that the one guy who he couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>account for his ring was a kicker who</v>

2163
01:48:34.261 --> 01:48:36.840
<v Speaker 3>fucked up the world series or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>superbowl rather.</v>

2164
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.920
<v Speaker 3>So this suit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

2165
01:48:41.190 --> 01:48:46.190
<v Speaker 3>this guy that they found out is Sean</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young in the movie who's gorgeous.</v>

2166
01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:49.650
<v Speaker 3>And then in the movie can take that down</v>
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>

2167
01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:54.720
<v Speaker 3>So in the movie at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reveal is that Sean Young is really</v>

2168
01:48:54.721 --> 01:48:59.721
<v Speaker 3>this football player who wants to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>back at dan marino because dan murray,</v>

2169
01:49:00.210 --> 01:49:03.360
<v Speaker 3>he's Go psycho because the world hates</v>
<v Speaker 3>him because he blew the kick.</v>

2170
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:08.100
<v Speaker 3>So he's a guy pretending to be a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ace ventura made out with them.</v>

2171
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:11.130
<v Speaker 3>And just like everyone saw the cops are</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing up.</v>

2172
01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's throwing up on or off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's off the charts.</v>

2173
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:18.330
<v Speaker 3>At the end he pulls her top off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows and she has breasts.</v>

2174
01:49:18.331 --> 01:49:20.790
<v Speaker 3>He was like trying to show that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't really abreast and she did.</v>

2175
01:49:20.970 --> 01:49:21.391
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2176
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:24.300
<v Speaker 3>anybody can get those and an afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about this?</v>

2177
01:49:24.301 --> 01:49:29.130
<v Speaker 3>And he pulls her pants down and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes by and then everybody sees her and</v>

2178
01:49:29.131 --> 01:49:31.530
<v Speaker 3>she's got her legs together so you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>see your penis.</v>

2179
01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:36.480
<v Speaker 3>And then from behind you see her junk is</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressed up against her butt cheeks</v>

2180
01:49:36.481 --> 01:49:38.310
<v Speaker 3>because she's tucked her penis and her</v>
<v Speaker 3>vagina.</v>

2181
01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:42.750
<v Speaker 3>So the cops all start throwing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then cops started cleaning cops that</v>

2182
01:49:42.751 --> 01:49:44.910
<v Speaker 3>made out with her and start cleaning</v>
<v Speaker 3>their mouth off.</v>

2183
01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:48.180
<v Speaker 3>They start chewing giant wad there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's her scene.</v>

2184
01:49:48.330 --> 01:49:52.600
<v Speaker 3>So watch all the cops see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he points to the fact that sean,</v>

2185
01:49:52.601 --> 01:49:53.890
<v Speaker 3>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all start throwing up.</v>

2186
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's throwing up.</v>

2187
01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 3>This is dan marino's throwing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See how he's cleaning his mouth because</v>

2188
01:49:59.471 --> 01:50:01.690
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made out with her tone loke the</v>

2189
01:50:01.691 --> 01:50:04.090
<v Speaker 3>dolphins freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's freaking out.</v>

2190
01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:09.080
<v Speaker 3>It is so insanely transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what the left would say is the reason</v>

2191
01:50:09.081 --> 01:50:11.980
<v Speaker 3>that they're right is that a movie like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this won't get made anymore.</v>

2192
01:50:11.981 --> 01:50:15.580
<v Speaker 3>And isn't that a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe should they pull it?</v>

2193
01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should it be illegal to have that on</v>

2194
01:50:18.341 --> 01:50:21.100
<v Speaker 3>itunes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course not.</v>

2195
01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe someone on the left might disagree</v>

2196
01:50:23.531 --> 01:50:24.364
<v Speaker 3>with you right now.</v>

2197
01:50:24.810 --> 01:50:29.530
<v Speaker 3>You transphobic for defending this</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible cisgendered heteronormative</v>

2198
01:50:30.230 --> 01:50:33.760
<v Speaker 3>shit movie that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's crazy,</v>

2199
01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:38.500
<v Speaker 3>and I guess this is a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the remodelization project is</v>

2200
01:50:38.501 --> 01:50:41.320
<v Speaker 3>working because when I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure is.</v>

2201
01:50:41.321 --> 01:50:42.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year did that come out?</v>

2202
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.390
<v Speaker 3>90 five for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2203
01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.190
<v Speaker 3>So when I saw that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2204
01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:49.570
<v Speaker 3>I was born in 84.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do math.</v>

2205
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:52.690
<v Speaker 3>I want to say [inaudible] 93.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was before I came to</v>

2206
01:50:52.691 --> 01:50:55.450
<v Speaker 3>hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I saw that movie I was 10.</v>

2207
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Transphobia was not a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2208
01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.020
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the thing.</v>

2209
01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:02.950
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's good about when things are</v>

2210
01:51:02.951 --> 01:51:05.920
<v Speaker 3>changing so rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the question is where are the lines</v>

2211
01:51:05.921 --> 01:51:09.940
<v Speaker 3>being drawn and is the overton window</v>
<v Speaker 3>being shrunk too small?</v>

2212
01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:12.970
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about them pulling the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dukes of hazzard off the air for the</v>

2213
01:51:12.971 --> 01:51:13.804
<v Speaker 3>flag?</v>

2214
01:51:14.010 --> 01:51:15.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't know about that?</v>

2215
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:17.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pulled the dukes of hazard.</v>

2216
01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.660
<v Speaker 3>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand how many of these</v>

2217
01:51:19.661 --> 01:51:20.980
<v Speaker 3>there are so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2218
01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:22.000
<v Speaker 3>so no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that one.</v>

2219
01:51:22.001 --> 01:51:23.140
<v Speaker 3>What's that one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one.</v>

2220
01:51:23.141 --> 01:51:26.410
<v Speaker 3>They yanked the dukes of hazzard off</v>
<v Speaker 3>television forever because the</v>

2221
01:51:26.411 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 3>confederate flag was on the roof of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally did not follow this.</v>

2222
01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot watch the news a hazard</v>

2223
01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:35.200
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot watch it.</v>

2224
01:51:35.530 --> 01:51:38.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not on television anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to be on tv land all the time.</v>

2225
01:51:39.010 --> 01:51:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Can you just get it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck no,</v>

2226
01:51:42.130 --> 01:51:44.770
<v Speaker 3>no chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to show that god damn</v>

2227
01:51:44.771 --> 01:51:49.060
<v Speaker 3>awful flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a poster in the bathroom over</v>

2228
01:51:49.061 --> 01:51:54.061
<v Speaker 3>there of leonard skinner from like 1970</v>
<v Speaker 3>something and they have a giant janis</v>

2229
01:51:54.221 --> 01:51:55.570
<v Speaker 3>joplin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought in the bathroom.</v>

2230
01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.510
<v Speaker 3>The other bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

2231
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Janis joplin.</v>

2232
01:51:58.210 --> 01:51:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other bathroom.</v>

2233
01:51:59.171 --> 01:52:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's different like.</v>

2234
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:01.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great one.</v>

2235
01:52:01.541 --> 01:52:02.710
<v Speaker 3>That's her mug shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2236
01:52:02.711 --> 01:52:03.544
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

2237
01:52:03.690 --> 01:52:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

2238
01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:09.550
<v Speaker 3>the leonard scared one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a giant confederate flag on</v>

2239
01:52:09.551 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>

2240
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:15.541
<v Speaker 3>Enormous in the background that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>there like southern pride,</v>

2241
01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 3>this idea of southern pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was okay to have that flag.</v>

2242
01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:25.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm basically for trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the realm of art and</v>

2243
01:52:25.031 --> 01:52:27.250
<v Speaker 3>movies and books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave it alone.</v>

2244
01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Try to leave It alone as much as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

2245
01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:32.480
<v Speaker 3>It's generally a very good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2246
01:52:32.481 --> 01:52:35.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be in the book banning</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie banning tv,</v>

2247
01:52:35.051 --> 01:52:37.790
<v Speaker 3>banning business or editing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried to mobile.</v>

2248
01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.520
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they did successfully at least</v>

2249
01:52:39.521 --> 01:52:44.500
<v Speaker 3>in some venues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>edit a tom sawyer and huck finn because</v>

2250
01:52:44.530 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 3>the n word was used prolifically,</v>

2251
01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy's name was nigger jim.</v>

2252
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:54.490
<v Speaker 1>That was the name in the book because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how people talk back then and I</v>

2253
01:52:56.121 --> 01:53:01.121
<v Speaker 1>think we need to keep that stuff as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>time capsule to show how racism.</v>

2254
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2255
01:53:05.850 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 4>It's important to show the progress like</v>
<v Speaker 4>ace ventura,</v>

2256
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:12.050
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like for trans people,</v>

2257
01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:16.500
<v Speaker 4>keep him for history for trans people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's amazing that no one's ever</v>

2258
01:53:16.501 --> 01:53:17.610
<v Speaker 4>brought this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2259
01:53:17.670 --> 01:53:22.230
<v Speaker 4>I feel like this is something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>never been discussed from you.</v>

2260
01:53:22.231 --> 01:53:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Joe rogan about the implant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got shit to do.</v>

2261
01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.273
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got jokes.</v>

2262
01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:28.490
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is.</v>

2263
01:53:28.650 --> 01:53:31.380
<v Speaker 4>You got an Israel trip that I'm planning</v>
<v Speaker 4>and are,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You want to take you on an amazing trip</v>

2266
01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:39.030
<v Speaker 4>and then we're going to go to the west</v>
<v Speaker 4>bank and you're gonna see all this stuff</v>

2267
01:53:39.190 --> 01:53:43.290
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to come away with</v>
<v Speaker 4>loving certain parts of it and not</v>

2268
01:53:43.291 --> 01:53:46.050
<v Speaker 4>liking certain parts of it and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to realize it's a country just</v>

2269
01:53:46.051 --> 01:53:50.550
<v Speaker 4>like any other country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is a democracy and it's trying to</v>

2270
01:53:50.551 --> 01:53:53.250
<v Speaker 4>do what's best in a really rough</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood and we'll go like,</v>

2271
01:53:53.251 --> 01:53:55.710
<v Speaker 4>I want you to see what the occupation</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like.</v>

2272
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:58.500
<v Speaker 4>Like I think that's something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>really important to see to get a full</v>

2273
01:53:58.501 --> 01:53:59.334
<v Speaker 4>picture of it.</v>

2274
01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I think you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is an important thing for</v>

2275
01:54:01.621 --> 01:54:02.730
<v Speaker 1>people to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2276
01:54:02.731 --> 01:54:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that I need to see to really get a</v>

2277
01:54:05.041 --> 01:54:06.930
<v Speaker 1>grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you want to go?</v>

2278
01:54:06.931 --> 01:54:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Where you going next in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You travel a lot.</v>

2279
01:54:09.330 --> 01:54:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2280
01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family and I,</v>

2281
01:54:14.491 --> 01:54:16.800
<v Speaker 1>we do a european vacation trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't really count.</v>

2282
01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:18.390
<v Speaker 1>We just lounge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fun.</v>

2283
01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I went to Thailand last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was fascinating.</v>

2284
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand was fascinating because that</v>

2285
01:54:23.851 --> 01:54:28.590
<v Speaker 1>was kind of a vacation trip too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's such a uniQue culture because</v>

2286
01:54:28.591 --> 01:54:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Thailand is run by the king or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize the king.</v>

2287
01:54:32.071 --> 01:54:33.150
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

2288
01:54:33.330 --> 01:54:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in real trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his is everywhere.</v>

2289
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's pictures of him in the throne</v>

2290
01:54:38.461 --> 01:54:41.310
<v Speaker 1>like wearing like super nice clothes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look good,</v>

2291
01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:44.940
<v Speaker 1>but the people are so kind.</v>

2292
01:54:45.090 --> 01:54:48.930
<v Speaker 1>they're so friendly and they're always</v>
<v Speaker 1>smiling and they have,</v>

2293
01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that you'll run</v>

2294
01:54:50.671 --> 01:54:54.480
<v Speaker 1>into that have very little yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem to be having a problem</v>

2295
01:54:54.481 --> 01:54:55.710
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wear flip flops.</v>

2296
01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:58.860
<v Speaker 1>You're on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's three people on a motorcycle is</v>

2297
01:54:58.861 --> 01:55:00.780
<v Speaker 1>a baby in a basket and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting.</v>

2298
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:04.590
<v Speaker 1>No helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then friend that just went to</v>

2299
01:55:04.591 --> 01:55:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people are so nice.</v>

2300
01:55:07.770 --> 01:55:09.300
<v Speaker 1>They're so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so kind.</v>

2301
01:55:09.690 --> 01:55:11.360
<v Speaker 1>It's so unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2302
01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.600
<v Speaker 1>me and my famIly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had.</v>

2303
01:55:12.630 --> 01:55:13.770
<v Speaker 1>We always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever we go somewhere,</v>

2304
01:55:13.771 --> 01:55:18.330
<v Speaker 1>we always have this real long</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations about like what was</v>

2305
01:55:18.331 --> 01:55:20.550
<v Speaker 1>interesting about it for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

2306
01:55:20.551 --> 01:55:22.370
<v Speaker 1>what did you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your kids?</v>

2307
01:55:22.710 --> 01:55:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Eight and 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young ones and I have a 22 year old</v>

2308
01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:29.450
<v Speaker 1>to all girls holla and from for girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue jeans,</v>

2309
01:55:30.570 --> 01:55:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2310
01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:35.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's fascinating to me about it is,</v>

2311
01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.730
<v Speaker 1>well first of all I love exposing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>little people to different parts of the</v>

2312
01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:41.810
<v Speaker 1>world so they get to see like what this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

2313
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:43.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here we are,</v>

2314
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:44.243
<v Speaker 1>show them on the map.</v>

2315
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 1>This is America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're over here.</v>

2316
01:55:46.450 --> 01:55:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but when the fucking 15 hours to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>here a plane that goes 500 plus miles an</v>

2317
01:55:50.971 --> 01:55:51.840
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

2318
01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.120
<v Speaker 1>And just to realize like human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the same but different.</v>

2319
01:55:57.510 --> 01:56:00.720
<v Speaker 1>We're the same everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a different way.</v>

2320
01:56:00.721 --> 01:56:04.410
<v Speaker 1>We choose to interact with each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that happens is we</v>

2321
01:56:04.411 --> 01:56:07.080
<v Speaker 1>fall into their way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we go there.</v>

2322
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Like if we go to Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say razzi,</v>

2323
01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to start learning.</v>

2324
01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:17.460
<v Speaker 1>We'll just start trying to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the worDs that people use in</v>

2325
01:56:17.461 --> 01:56:19.060
<v Speaker 1>their culture and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2326
01:56:19.090 --> 01:56:20.720
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cups,</v>

2327
01:56:20.730 --> 01:56:24.000
<v Speaker 1>zoom crop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how you said it's like</v>

2328
01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:29.070
<v Speaker 1>hello and good morning and but they all</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that and eveRyone makes a lotus</v>

2329
01:56:29.071 --> 01:56:31.500
<v Speaker 1>flower with their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so common.</v>

2330
01:56:31.530 --> 01:56:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people greet you and they do thIs and</v>

2331
01:56:34.411 --> 01:56:36.690
<v Speaker 1>it's such a warm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>

2332
01:56:36.930 --> 01:56:39.060
<v Speaker 1>peaceful way of greeting each other.</v>

2333
01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.920
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that we talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

2334
01:56:40.921 --> 01:56:41.754
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2335
01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:45.810
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like way more friendly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like greeting and this thing about</v>

2336
01:56:45.811 --> 01:56:49.050
<v Speaker 1>clapping their hands together and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>all agree to do it and everyone can sort</v>

2337
01:56:49.051 --> 01:56:53.400
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this unique pattern that</v>

2338
01:56:53.401 --> 01:56:56.190
<v Speaker 1>people can fall into and people fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>into all sorts of patterns.</v>

2339
01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.000
<v Speaker 1>They fall into like really aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of honking at people on the</v>

2340
01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:04.110
<v Speaker 1>road and driving real fast and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into these peaceful patterns and</v>

2341
01:57:04.111 --> 01:57:07.470
<v Speaker 1>some of it's dictated by culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of It's dictated by climate.</v>

2342
01:57:07.650 --> 01:57:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is dictated by the economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation in the world they're in,</v>

2343
01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:15.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's such a weird trip to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>different places and see like,</v>

2344
01:57:15.991 --> 01:57:16.561
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2345
01:57:16.561 --> 01:57:18.300
<v Speaker 1>if I lived over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how I'd rocket,</v>

2346
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I'd be wearing flip flops and shorts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get around this way and this is the</v>

2347
01:57:22.561 --> 01:57:23.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of food that I would eat.</v>

2348
01:57:23.730 --> 01:57:28.470
<v Speaker 1>And real spicy because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to have those spices</v>

2349
01:57:28.471 --> 01:57:31.190
<v Speaker 1>actually protect against bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're there.</v>

2350
01:57:31.191 --> 01:57:34.530
<v Speaker 1>They're actually antIbacterial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the food grade fucking amazing.</v>

2351
01:57:34.531 --> 01:57:36.540
<v Speaker 1>We took some court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took classes,</v>

2352
01:57:36.541 --> 01:57:38.610
<v Speaker 1>we learned how to cook over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2353
01:57:38.611 --> 01:57:40.080
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

2354
01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:42.930
<v Speaker 1>But my kid got lit up by bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

2355
01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:47.670

<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they're called.</v>

2356
01:57:47.671 --> 01:57:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I forget what they're called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my youngest had a horrible allergic</v>

2357
01:57:51.151 --> 01:57:54.150
<v Speaker 1>reaction to some of the bugs over there</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

<v Speaker 1>who was like the sweetest guy on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet earth.</v>

2374
01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:33.240
<v Speaker 1>He was from kids in the hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on news radio with me.</v>

2375
01:58:34.110 --> 01:58:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Dave foley was on malaria medication</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was going to visit his kids</v>

2376
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:40.410
<v Speaker 1>in Egypt so we have to take this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was drinking,</v>

2377
01:58:40.411 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to drink on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2379
01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:46.240
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was going crazy.</v>

2380
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Taking reporters a microphone or as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tape recorder away and put it in a</v>

2381
01:58:50.321 --> 01:58:52.420

01:58:52.421 --> 01:58:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Like I had to protect him yelling at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like crowd.</v>

2383
01:58:54.751 --> 01:58:57.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm like calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile the sweetest,</v>

2384
01:58:57.670 --> 01:58:59.920
<v Speaker 3>kindest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nicest guy you would ever meet.</v>

2385
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:03.490
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile he was like super aggro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was crazy.</v>

2386
01:59:03.491 --> 01:59:05.710
<v Speaker 3>It didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the medication.</v>

2387
01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:09.040
<v Speaker 3>He just had a horrible reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have other friends that had just like</v>

2388
01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:12.940
<v Speaker 3>horrific waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soaked in sweat,</v>

2389
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.140
<v Speaker 3>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nightmares,</v>

2390
01:59:14.170 --> 01:59:16.900
<v Speaker 3>demons chasing them like fuck this</v>
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>

2391
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:19.600
<v Speaker 3>This is too much man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

2392
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:22.420
<v Speaker 3>But my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2393
01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:24.480
<v Speaker 3>I'd be down to go to Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be good.</v>

2394
01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.340
<v Speaker 3>I think I need to go to open to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the world.</v>

2395
01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go to giza too.</v>

2396
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:31.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the other place I really need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to.</v>

2397
01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:34.210
<v Speaker 3>I've been obsessed with the pyramid</v>
<v Speaker 3>since I was a little kid.</v>

2398
01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Can be one trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2399
01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:37.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2400
01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:38.830
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>

2401
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:41.380
<v Speaker 3>And you can set up a debate for me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in for that to</v>

2402
01:59:43.290 --> 01:59:43.570
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2403
01:59:43.570 --> 01:59:44.403
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go pee.</v>

2404
01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Go pee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go pee.</v>

2405
01:59:47.010 --> 01:59:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm setting up a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>debates.</v>

2406
01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:52.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I can set that one up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one seems problematic.</v>

2407
01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.930
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's hilarious.</v>

2408
01:59:56.200 --> 02:00:00.370

<v Speaker 6>and he was being tracked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He found out once he got back,</v>

02:00:39.561 --> 02:00:41.960
<v Speaker 6>he met ronald reagan when he met</v>
<v Speaker 6>president reagan.</v>

2426
02:00:41.961 --> 02:00:43.130
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's nice to meet you.</v>

2427
02:00:43.131 --> 02:00:44.330
<v Speaker 6>We've been following you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like after you take,</v>

2431
02:00:51.391 --> 02:00:53.180

<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

2432
02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.400
<v Speaker 6>There was a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2433
02:00:55.670 --> 02:00:57.660
<v Speaker 6>You're just going to deliver a hot dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His name is hot dog hair.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He was trying to help the troops and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>

02:00:59.061 --> 02:01:01.460
<v Speaker 6>And what was the threat?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were trying to kill them.</v>

2436

<v Speaker 6>didn't die.</v>

2441
02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:16.220

<v Speaker 6>for delivering high.</v>

2442
02:01:16.221 --> 02:01:19.190
<v Speaker 6>Don't remember the exact situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they weren't happy.</v>

2443
02:01:19.191 --> 02:01:23.240
<v Speaker 6>He was over there trying to help someone</v>
<v Speaker 6>do shit.</v>

2444
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:24.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe that's how it went down.</v>

2445
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:25.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck</v>

2446
02:01:28.890 --> 02:01:30.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's spots in the world that are just</v>

2447
02:01:30.331 --> 02:01:34.000
<v Speaker 3>so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't want to go because you,</v>

2448
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear and you're like,</v>

2449
02:01:35.250 --> 02:01:38.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get caught up in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get caught up in that</v>

2450
02:01:38.401 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could just stay burbank.</v>

2451
02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Why would I go and get caught up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2452
02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>But then there's other parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2453
02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your own edification,</v>

2454
02:01:46.521 --> 02:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>you should probably go just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it's like.</v>

2455
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about those ladies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were killed in Morocco?</v>

2456
02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're back.</v>

2457
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shut that door.</v>

2458
02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just talking about going to</v>

2459
02:01:59.181 --> 02:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>dangerous places and it's probably a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good idea.</v>

2460
02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>But you get scared and you know for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most part you probably shouldn't be</v>

2461
02:02:06.051 --> 02:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you should.</v>

2462
02:02:07.071 --> 02:02:09.830
<v Speaker 1>And we were just talking about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>women that were killed in Morocco,</v>

2463
02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>those norwegian hikers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were from where they're from,</v>

2464
02:02:13.701 --> 02:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Norway or Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>

2465
02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:19.160
<v Speaker 1>They were there hiking and morocco's to</v>
<v Speaker 1>women and they were killed by these.</v>

2466
02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>But one was just kidding Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 year old israeli good.</v>

2467
02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:26.870
<v Speaker 1>The one that killed people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it because of the United States</v>

2468
02:02:26.871 --> 02:02:31.871
<v Speaker 1>involvement in Syria and they cut their</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads off and phone camera and they put</v>

2469
02:02:32.121 --> 02:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>it on the internet and I watched it.</v>

2470
02:02:34.130 --> 02:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>You watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would you watch that?</v>

2471
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was reading the story and the</v>

2472
02:02:38.451 --> 02:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>video was there and I just clicked it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I shouldn't have.</v>

2473
02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>And just to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of me wants to know that</v>

2474
02:02:45.681 --> 02:02:48.100
<v Speaker 1>people like that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They exist.</v>

2475
02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I know they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want it to be an abstract.</v>

2476
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the danny pearl video.</v>

2477
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I've never watched another video like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that again.</v>

2478
02:02:58.891 --> 02:02:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that one too.</v>

2479
02:03:00.710 --> 02:03:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I've seen quite a few of them now you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to know,</v>

2480
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2481
02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth it to go to a place where</v>

2482
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:10.550
<v Speaker 1>that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to know that that's</v>

2483
02:03:10.551 --> 02:03:11.480
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2484
02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:14.270
<v Speaker 1>In order to have a realistic perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>on world events,</v>

2485
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.810
<v Speaker 1>you need to know what it is at the worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the spectrum.</v>

2486
02:03:18.410 --> 02:03:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

2487
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:23.000
<v Speaker 1>what are the consequences for rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies?</v>

2488
02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:25.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about that with like what</v>

2489
02:03:25.011 --> 02:03:28.160
<v Speaker 2>we decide to show and not show after</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass shootings here,</v>

2490
02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:29.503
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2491
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:33.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in pittsburgh like right after and</v>

2492
02:03:33.741 --> 02:03:38.741
<v Speaker 2>I was because I knew the rabbi who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing some of the cleanup and</v>

2493
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:41.760
<v Speaker 1>because of religious reasons and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

2494
02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:43.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bat mitzvah was there.</v>

2495
02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:44.790
<v Speaker 1>That is sO crazy.</v>

2496
02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dad knew six of the people who were</v>

2497
02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>murdered and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

2498
02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:56.460
<v Speaker 2>it was really crazy to me how locked</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2499
02:03:56.471 --> 02:04:00.130
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like you couldn't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there with a photographer and you</v>

2500
02:04:00.131 --> 02:04:03.430
<v Speaker 2>couldn't take any pictures at all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

2501
02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a real lockdown on showing</v>

2502
02:04:06.461 --> 02:04:08.650
<v Speaker 2>people Because you don't want to terrIfy</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2503
02:04:08.651 --> 02:04:13.651
<v Speaker 2>but I've wondered would it prick</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's consciousness about the reality</v>

2504
02:04:13.661 --> 02:04:17.620
<v Speaker 2>of what gun violence looks like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2505
02:04:17.621 --> 02:04:20.380
<v Speaker 2>like the carnage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people that I know that saad</v>

2506
02:04:20.381 --> 02:04:24.220
<v Speaker 2>said it looked like a war zone and would</v>
<v Speaker 2>that change public policy and would that</v>

2507
02:04:24.221 --> 02:04:27.460
<v Speaker 2>be a posItive thing or would we just</v>
<v Speaker 2>become numb to it?</v>

2508
02:04:27.461 --> 02:04:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Like we become numb to everything else?</v>

2509
02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:30.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2510
02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:31.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2511
02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm never in favor of suppressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

2512
02:04:35.550 --> 02:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>even horrific information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2513
02:04:37.591 --> 02:04:42.591
<v Speaker 1>I was a big critic of that during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bush administration when they passed</v>

2514
02:04:44.970 --> 02:04:49.970
<v Speaker 1>laws on whether or not you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show actual coffins,</v>

2515
02:04:50.610 --> 02:04:53.970
<v Speaker 1>just coffins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't allowed to show coffIns</v>

2516
02:04:53.971 --> 02:04:56.250
<v Speaker 1>being flown back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like that was,</v>

2517
02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:57.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a disgrace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2518
02:04:58.040 --> 02:04:58.873
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

2519
02:04:58.900 --> 02:04:59.510
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2520
02:04:59.510 --> 02:05:04.020
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to consider whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not we want to go to war,</v>

2521
02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:07.380
<v Speaker 1>we should be able to understand the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

2522
02:05:07.381 --> 02:05:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And one of the best ways is to not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>get information in terms of text.</v>

2523
02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Text is very difficult for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize,</v>

2524
02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:18.210
<v Speaker 1>but when you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing american flags covering coffins,</v>

2525
02:05:18.250 --> 02:05:21.420
<v Speaker 1>when you're seeing hundreds of them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize these are your neighbors,</v>

2526
02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:23.880
<v Speaker 1>these are your neighbors children's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2527
02:05:23.881 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 1>this is people that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2528
02:05:26.041 --> 02:05:27.840
<v Speaker 1>and they're dyIng over there and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't really.</v>

2529
02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:31.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't wrap your head around why</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it and whether or not it's</v>

2530
02:05:31.861 --> 02:05:33.480
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not we should have been there</v>

2531
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:36.750
<v Speaker 1>and then whether or not they're actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>were weapons of mass destruction in</v>

2532
02:05:36.751 --> 02:05:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not we're in the business of</v>

2533
02:05:38.521 --> 02:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>nation building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not ron paul is right,</v>

2534
02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:42.930
<v Speaker 1>whether or not other people are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well who's right,</v>

2535
02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 1>like the only way we're really going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a clear picture is to see a picture.</v>

2536
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:49.080
<v Speaker 1>To have an actual</v>

2537
02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:49.681
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2538
02:05:49.681 --> 02:05:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why I've thought about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot because rIght now I think in most</v>

2539
02:05:54.541 --> 02:05:57.780
<v Speaker 2>american's minds it's like the shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

2540
02:05:57.781 --> 02:06:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes a hashtag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes a tee shirt.</v>

2541
02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes a memorial thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a memorial concert.</v>

2542
02:06:03.271 --> 02:06:08.271
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like actually sickening like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the choreography of it and I think</v>

2543
02:06:09.661 --> 02:06:14.280
<v Speaker 2>what's lost is what it looks like and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this rabbi in pittsburgh who is really</v>

2544
02:06:14.281 --> 02:06:18.390
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>describe to me what he saw and I'll</v>

2545
02:06:18.391 --> 02:06:21.870
<v Speaker 2>never forget just the description of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he told me and I wondered.</v>

2546
02:06:21.871 --> 02:06:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I've wondered a lot in the wake of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll think about it with the next</v>

2547
02:06:24.481 --> 02:06:26.850
<v Speaker 2>shooting happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that have made a difference at all</v>

2548
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:28.290
<v Speaker 2>in terms of waking people up?</v>

2549
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>What's fucked up as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the shooting happens,</v>

2550
02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:33.180
<v Speaker 1>that's what's fucked when we know it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will happen.</v>

2551
02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>We know a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

2552
02:06:38.250 --> 02:06:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2553
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because because there are a lot of guns</v>

2554
02:06:44.451 --> 02:06:49.451
<v Speaker 2>in this country and people have access</v>
<v Speaker 2>to those guns who are not only mentally</v>

2555
02:06:49.911 --> 02:06:51.860
<v Speaker 2>unwell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're just evil and they</v>

2556
02:06:51.861 --> 02:06:55.010
<v Speaker 2>want to kill people and they want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>

2557
02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean for a million reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that we're living in a</v>

2558
02:06:59.451 --> 02:07:04.310
<v Speaker 2>culture that seems to worship people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom to own those weapons more than</v>

2559
02:07:04.311 --> 02:07:07.670
<v Speaker 2>human life seems crazy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really does.</v>

2560
02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The argument against that would be this,</v>

2561
02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:15.311
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2562
02:07:15.311 --> 02:07:19.300
<v Speaker 1>the real crazies believed that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are happening and that they're</v>

2563
02:07:19.301 --> 02:07:22.780
<v Speaker 1>happening because of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>government wants to take away our guns.</v>

2564
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:25.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the real crazies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain that.</v>

2565
02:07:25.691 --> 02:07:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I followed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are making these people do these</v>

2566
02:07:28.511 --> 02:07:32.080
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government that the worst worst</v>

2567
02:07:32.081 --> 02:07:34.210
<v Speaker 1>aspects of our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2568
02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>fill the blank with whatever left wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy that you know,</v>

2569
02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:41.020
<v Speaker 1>whatever person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2570
02:07:41.090 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>boogeyman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>george soros,</v>

2571
02:07:42.641 --> 02:07:47.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck the boogie man is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whatever boogeyman or book or cabal</v>

2572
02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:52.560
<v Speaker 1>of boogie people that they are somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another either using like manchurian</v>

2573
02:07:54.671 --> 02:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>candidate type influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they're doing,</v>

2574
02:07:58.091 --> 02:08:02.650
<v Speaker 1>they're getting people to do this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then even creating false flags where</v>

2575
02:08:02.651 --> 02:08:05.290
<v Speaker 1>these things didn't happen so they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>take away guns.</v>

2576
02:08:05.291 --> 02:08:06.124
<v Speaker 1>This is the.</v>

2577
02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2578
02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:10.653
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2579
02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:11.740
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is dumb,</v>

2580
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:14.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

2581
02:08:14.081 --> 02:08:17.860
<v Speaker 1>In terms of the influence that it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people actually do believe that</v>

2582
02:08:17.861 --> 02:08:22.861
<v Speaker 1>there are these false flag events that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're designing to to get your guns,</v>

2583
02:08:23.231 --> 02:08:27.780
<v Speaker 1>that people are training people to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and kill a bunch of people so that</v>

2584
02:08:27.781 --> 02:08:31.900
<v Speaker 1>they can take away your guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it makes them more rabid about their</v>

2585
02:08:31.901 --> 02:08:33.760
<v Speaker 1>support of the second amendment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2586
02:08:33.761 --> 02:08:35.800
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like they're being attacked on</v>

2587
02:08:35.801 --> 02:08:39.460
<v Speaker 1>all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you looked very recently?</v>

2588
02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Last week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mindset of the conspiracy thinker is</v>

2589
02:08:44.351 --> 02:08:46.180
<v Speaker 1>totally fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2590
02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:49.480
<v Speaker 1>A midwest is actually just as good or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even better.</v>

2591
02:08:49.481 --> 02:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>he runs medibank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy.</v>

2592
02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I used to do the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the show for awhile on scifi.</v>

2593
02:08:56.050 --> 02:08:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I called joe Rogan questions everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that we went into</v>

2594
02:08:59.651 --> 02:09:03.850
<v Speaker 1>was a why people believe in chem trails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people believe that the heat of jet</v>

2595
02:09:03.851 --> 02:09:06.130
<v Speaker 1>engines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which causes these artificial clouds</v>

2596
02:09:06.131 --> 02:09:08.680
<v Speaker 1>when it interacts with condensation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere and creates,</v>

2597
02:09:08.810 --> 02:09:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates artificial clouds.</v>

2598
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:13.570
<v Speaker 1>You see called trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe that these are,</v>

2599
02:09:14.150 --> 02:09:19.150
<v Speaker 1>that someone's spraying something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this weather control from these</v>

2600
02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:24.100
<v Speaker 1>commercial jets that they're somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>though is this gigantic conspiracy of</v>

2601
02:09:24.101 --> 02:09:28.030
<v Speaker 1>all these people involved and that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in some way,</v>

2602
02:09:28.290 --> 02:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2603
02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:33.940
<v Speaker 1>they're either doing weather control or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're controlling us or mind control.</v>

2604
02:09:33.941 --> 02:09:37.750
<v Speaker 1>It depends on who you ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that may kind of really interesting</v>

2605
02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:40.090
<v Speaker 1>way of discussing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he said is</v>

2606
02:09:40.091 --> 02:09:43.480
<v Speaker 1>this is like the training wheels for</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory because you see it in</v>

2607
02:09:43.481 --> 02:09:44.171
<v Speaker 1>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look.</v>

2608
02:09:44.171 --> 02:09:45.980
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that anymore.</v>

2609
02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:49.630
<v Speaker 1>There's photographs from world war ii</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can see from the 19 forties,</v>

2610
02:09:49.631 --> 02:09:51.970
<v Speaker 1>you could see contrails in the sky that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked just like the ones up here,</v>

2611
02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:54.490
<v Speaker 1>but people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember those when we were kids</v>

2612
02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.060
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2613
02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2614
02:09:55.961 --> 02:09:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts fueling this paranoid</v>

2615
02:09:58.811 --> 02:10:03.190
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's this program going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are real programs that</v>

2616
02:10:03.191 --> 02:10:06.700
<v Speaker 1>the government is CoNsideriNg to combat</v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming.</v>

2617
02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Where they talked about thIs in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the seventies and the eighties.</v>

2618
02:10:10.150 --> 02:10:13.600
<v Speaker 1>They talked about reflective particles</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the atmosphere.</v>

2619
02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I think they were when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned that the ozone layer was meant</v>

2620
02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.270
<v Speaker 1>mammals the eighties probably probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>later than that,</v>

2621
02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but even more recently they've talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about suspending reflective particles in</v>

2622
02:10:23.861 --> 02:10:26.080
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere to protect it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be very differeNt,</v>

2623
02:10:26.230 --> 02:10:28.810
<v Speaker 1>but why do people believe conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories?</v>

2624
02:10:28.811 --> 02:10:33.310
<v Speaker 1>what is it in the nature of certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that when I'm just so fascinated</v>

2625
02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.850
<v Speaker 1>bY it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

2626
02:10:34.851 --> 02:10:37.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was going to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>

2627
02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:41.150
<v Speaker 1>When you see it from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see something like a,</v>

2628
02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>like The most horrific ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sandy hook,</v>

2629
02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:50.390
<v Speaker 1>sandy hook being a false flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would be the motivation for someone</v>

2630
02:10:50.391 --> 02:10:52.610
<v Speaker 1>saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be the Motivation?</v>

2631
02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:57.310
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the most plausible I guess would</v>

2632
02:10:57.311 --> 02:11:02.130
<v Speaker 2>be</v>
<v Speaker 2>capturing an audience,</v>

2633
02:11:02.131 --> 02:11:06.900
<v Speaker 2>like getting people to believe in you is</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sier behind the veil.</v>

2634
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's only the people that are</v>

2635
02:11:08.451 --> 02:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>projecting this in terms of the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex jones,</v>

2636
02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:16.730
<v Speaker 1>like why does he say that was my</v>
<v Speaker 1>question is why do other people think</v>

2637
02:11:16.731 --> 02:11:18.020
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they look for it?</v>

2638
02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a person?</v>

2639
02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:20.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's.</v>

2640
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason people look to</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories is that the world is</v>

2641
02:11:29.730 --> 02:11:34.730
<v Speaker 2>deeply chaotic and seems to lack a logic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are desperate for a system of</v>

2642
02:11:38.011 --> 02:11:43.011
<v Speaker 2>understanding the world and conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>theories often seem to like offer a</v>

2643
02:11:44.971 --> 02:11:47.100
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very actually like an incredibly</v>

2644
02:11:47.101 --> 02:11:50.780
<v Speaker 2>simplistic explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is there's this secret fit.</v>

2645
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Like if there's always a secret thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a plan that the public doesn't</v>

2646
02:11:54.421 --> 02:11:55.450
<v Speaker 2>know about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>General mills.</v>

2647
02:11:55.530 --> 02:11:57.390
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that no one really is at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheel.</v>

2648
02:11:57.780 --> 02:11:58.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2649
02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:00.560
<v Speaker 2>The real thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2650
02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:03.050
<v Speaker 2>haven't we learned that from the trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>presidency?</v>

2651
02:12:03.051 --> 02:12:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like institutions are just made up with</v>

2652
02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:10.660
<v Speaker 2>people like they can fall apart if the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that take them over are</v>

2653
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:15.110
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

2654
02:12:15.111 --> 02:12:16.760
<v Speaker 2>venal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic.</v>

2655
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Everything that we're seeing in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump administration will also like</v>

2656
02:12:20.410 --> 02:12:22.100
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that kind of.</v>

2657
02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:24.410
<v Speaker 2>It's weirdly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's both terrifying,</v>

2658
02:12:24.411 --> 02:12:28.970
<v Speaker 2>but also comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like if it's people,</v>

2659
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:32.420
<v Speaker 2>if it's just people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can also change it.</v>

2660
02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's a secret hand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to get to just,</v>

2661
02:12:37.341 --> 02:12:38.450
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the solution?</v>

2662
02:12:38.690 --> 02:12:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Elect better people.</v>

2663
02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the hopeful part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think that this such as it is,</v>

2664
02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:47.630
<v Speaker 1>this constant conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this social conflict that we're involved</v>

2665
02:12:47.631 --> 02:12:49.790
<v Speaker 1>in right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woke left and the outright and all</v>

2666
02:12:49.791 --> 02:12:53.030
<v Speaker 1>this jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's the boiling of it right now</v>

2667
02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:57.650
<v Speaker 1>will eventually boiled down to something</v>
<v Speaker 1>more rational because if it seems like</v>

2668
02:12:57.651 --> 02:13:00.470
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read steven pinker's work and</v>

2669
02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>people that study violence and in danger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and society over the course of history</v>

2670
02:13:06.501 --> 02:13:09.050
<v Speaker 1>that we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're certainly on an upward trend.</v>

2671
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Even though data shows us all the data</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that no one's denying that there</v>

2672
02:13:13.621 --> 02:13:18.050
<v Speaker 1>are some awful aspects to our culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in society and crime and violence</v>

2673
02:13:18.051 --> 02:13:21.770
<v Speaker 1>and fill in the blank disparity and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things exist,</v>

2674
02:13:22.070 --> 02:13:26.810
<v Speaker 1>but there's more understanding of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more awareness of that and there's</v>

2675
02:13:26.811 --> 02:13:31.380
<v Speaker 1>certainly a safer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safer world today than was 100,</v>

2676
02:13:31.381 --> 02:13:34.030
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of like your own.</v>

2677
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just think about my life like I am a</v>

2678
02:13:36.861 --> 02:13:41.861
<v Speaker 2>woman who can walk down the street of</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost any american city with all the</v>

2679
02:13:42.321 --> 02:13:45.920
<v Speaker 2>privileges that I have granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unharmed.</v>

2680
02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a miracle in human history.</v>

2681
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:50.960
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's one day I was at the beach</v>

2682
02:13:50.961 --> 02:13:51.920
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2683
02:13:51.921 --> 02:13:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm just sitting here in a bathing suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's coming up to me.</v>

2684
02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:57.260
<v Speaker 2>No one's harassing me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many parts of the world could I do</v>

2685
02:13:57.261 --> 02:13:58.670
<v Speaker 2>that in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2686
02:13:58.671 --> 02:14:01.070
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try and keep that in mind when I'm</v>

2687
02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:04.220
<v Speaker 2>falling into despair about where we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a country where I'm like,</v>

2688
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:06.800
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually in a lot of ways it's still</v>

2689
02:14:06.801 --> 02:14:11.780
<v Speaker 2>like the best thing of the worst things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best thing in history so far.</v>

2690
02:14:11.781 --> 02:14:16.310
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly for women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I try and kind of keep that in mind</v>

2691
02:14:16.311 --> 02:14:21.080
<v Speaker 2>when I'm losing myself to feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fears that things are going to get</v>

2692
02:14:21.081 --> 02:14:23.390
<v Speaker 2>worse before they get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I think.</v>

2693
02:14:24.290 --> 02:14:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have</v>

2694
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:32.430
<v Speaker 1>all daughters and I have friends that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are women and I have a lot of friends</v>

2695
02:14:32.441 --> 02:14:34.390
<v Speaker 1>that are women in the world of standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy and</v>

2696
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I oftentimes see misogynist shit online</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shocks me and one of the things</v>

2697
02:14:43.991 --> 02:14:48.040
<v Speaker 1>that shocked me was there's a guy that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow and he was talking about how his</v>

2698
02:14:48.041 --> 02:14:52.180
<v Speaker 1>wife a thread on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well thought out,</v>

2699
02:14:52.181 --> 02:14:54.760
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a lawyer and I was talking about</v>

2700
02:14:54.761 --> 02:14:57.730
<v Speaker 1>how his wife's gas tank is always empty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so every time he gets into his wife's</v>

2701
02:14:57.731 --> 02:14:58.900
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's always out of gas.</v>

2702
02:14:58.901 --> 02:14:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2703
02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Why do I always have to get gas for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she explained she doesn't to</v>

2704
02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:09.440
<v Speaker 1>park to get gas because she gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassed and it creeps her out and it</v>

2705
02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:11.620
<v Speaker 1>was like a man will never think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2706
02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Not only men never think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The messages he was getting from men</v>

2707
02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:20.440
<v Speaker 1>calling him a cock making excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2708
02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:21.333
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2709
02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:22.193
<v Speaker 1>there is</v>

2710
02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

2711
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot that I didn't think darkly</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough because of course it was going to</v>

2712
02:15:27.081 --> 02:15:27.914
<v Speaker 2>go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2713
02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:30.170
<v Speaker 1>and he told me direct messages getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly,</v>

2714
02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:35.200
<v Speaker 1>it's just people saying all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit to him because they not only</v>

2715
02:15:35.531 --> 02:15:40.531
<v Speaker 1>are they in denial that this could be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where their mother was in or</v>

2716
02:15:41.231 --> 02:15:44.860
<v Speaker 1>their wife or their daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't have a daughter.</v>

2717
02:15:44.861 --> 02:15:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they have a bad relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>her mother.</v>

2718
02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had so many bat,</v>

2719
02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a guy has had so many bad</v>

2720
02:15:50.981 --> 02:15:54.070
<v Speaker 1>interactions with women and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart and he's just decided that</v>

2721
02:15:54.071 --> 02:15:56.530
<v Speaker 1>women are evil and you see anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like saying,</v>

2722
02:15:56.531 --> 02:15:58.840
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should look at it in terms of</v>

2723
02:15:58.841 --> 02:16:01.450
<v Speaker 1>like how the woman looks at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

2724
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Like that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are real and they're out</v>

2725
02:16:03.971 --> 02:16:06.370
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a gas station the other night</v>

2726
02:16:06.371 --> 02:16:08.620
<v Speaker 1>at 2:00 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was coming home from the comedy store</v>

2727
02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:11.840
<v Speaker 1>and I pulled into this gas station and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this guy,</v>

2728
02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:14.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bulletproof thing where this thick</v>

2729
02:16:14.231 --> 02:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's talking to.</v>

2730
02:16:15.670 --> 02:16:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm using my credit card and this guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to use his debit card and I pull</v>

2731
02:16:21.461 --> 02:16:23.980
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get out of my car and I hear yelling</v>

2732
02:16:24.370 --> 02:16:26.230
<v Speaker 1>and I hear him going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey bro,</v>

2733
02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:28.630
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a fucking bank teller.</v>

2734
02:16:28.690 --> 02:16:29.650
<v Speaker 1>A right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2735
02:16:29.651 --> 02:16:33.550
<v Speaker 1>you're taking this job so seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make $10 an hour and the guy says</v>

2736
02:16:33.551 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no money on the cars.</v>

2737
02:16:34.630 --> 02:16:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's $800 on this card.</v>

2738
02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And his friend from the car saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2739
02:16:39.590 --> 02:16:42.010
<v Speaker 1>he's an I am nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2740
02:16:42.011 --> 02:16:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2741
02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:46.720
<v Speaker 1>it's 2:00 in the morning and I'm nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like fuck.</v>

2742
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:49.000
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if this guy turns any of this</v>

2743
02:16:49.001 --> 02:16:51.410
<v Speaker 1>aggression on me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if he decides?</v>

2744
02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a fucking asshole and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably drunk or high or something and</v>

2745
02:16:56.171 --> 02:17:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it's 2:00 in the morning and it's him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's another guy in the car and</v>

2746
02:17:00.610 --> 02:17:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm so nervous humiliating the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

2747
02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2748
02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:07.150
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so nervous that I'm thinking of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting my pump short.</v>

2749
02:17:07.151 --> 02:17:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking I just don't get a full</v>
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>

2750
02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Just get five bucks and get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>outta here.</v>

2751
02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:12.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't run out of gas,</v>

2752
02:17:12.371 --> 02:17:14.800
<v Speaker 1>but let's just get the fuck out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get the gas tomorrow during the</v>

2753
02:17:14.801 --> 02:17:18.400
<v Speaker 1>daylight and I'm a man and I'm looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at these two guys and I'm saying,</v>

2754
02:17:18.401 --> 02:17:20.260
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some shit goes down,</v>

2755
02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:23.620
<v Speaker 1>if these guys don't have a weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some shit goes down,</v>

2756
02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beat the fuck out of these two guys.</v>

2757
02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Did they look skinny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look like they don't exercise,</v>

2758
02:17:28.091 --> 02:17:29.440
<v Speaker 1>but they're aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're angry,</v>

2759
02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:30.880
<v Speaker 1>they're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2760
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:33.940
<v Speaker 1>god damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all my spidey senses are going to</v>

2761
02:17:33.970 --> 02:17:37.360
<v Speaker 1>get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go get out of here and like an asshole.</v>

2762
02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I decided to stay and pump my gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the the these guys are yelling</v>

2763
02:17:42.341 --> 02:17:42.700
<v Speaker 1>at each other.</v>

2764
02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I literally went around the front of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car instead of the back way because it</v>

2765
02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:51.790
<v Speaker 1>was a shorter path for me being exposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their view.</v>

2766
02:17:52.210 --> 02:17:56.470
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hiding behind my Truck while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>filling my tank and I'm a man who could</v>

2767
02:17:56.471 --> 02:17:59.440
<v Speaker 1>kill these two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly thought where this story was</v>

2768
02:17:59.441 --> 02:18:01.870
<v Speaker 1>going to go is that you were going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and tell them to stop.</v>

2769
02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of going over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to get shot and I'm</v>

2770
02:18:04.601 --> 02:18:05.790
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if this,</v>

2771
02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:10.820
<v Speaker 1>some people die now I'm saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also where you can get hit in the</v>

2772
02:18:12.431 --> 02:18:16.300
<v Speaker 1>head with a pipe thing that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry that you're going to get shot at.</v>

2773
02:18:16.301 --> 02:18:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2774
02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:19.450
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just shot.</v>

2775
02:18:19.451 --> 02:18:23.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just violence in general and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a martial arts expert so I'm</v>

2776
02:18:23.590 --> 02:18:28.590
<v Speaker 1>less worried than most men and certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>way less worried than a woman.</v>

2777
02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:31.300
<v Speaker 1>If I was a woman and I pulled up and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard that guy go,</v>

2778
02:18:31.450 --> 02:18:33.460
<v Speaker 1>fuck you make $10 an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

2779
02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Fucking relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2780
02:18:34.810 --> 02:18:36.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get me the fuck out of here.</v>

2781
02:18:36.311 --> 02:18:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I was on fumes though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raising two daughters made you so much</v>

2782
02:18:41.051 --> 02:18:42.760
<v Speaker 1>more aware of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hundred percent.</v>

2783
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also just raising babies.</v>

2784
02:18:44.951 --> 02:18:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Even if there were boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that people were babies.</v>

2785
02:18:47.771 --> 02:18:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Now I used to think of people as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a static state.</v>

2786
02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:51.970
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty four.</v>

2787
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:52.751
<v Speaker 1>I meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2788
02:18:52.751 --> 02:18:54.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>34 year old person.</v>

2789
02:18:54.011 --> 02:18:58.450
<v Speaker 1>this is a 34 year old person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't meet you in think in the past I</v>

2790
02:18:58.451 --> 02:19:01.540
<v Speaker 1>would have met you and only thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as a 34 year old person.</v>

2791
02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Now I look at everyone as a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I process things and it made</v>

2792
02:19:08.831 --> 02:19:12.460
<v Speaker 1>me way more compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more understanding and way more</v>

2793
02:19:12.461 --> 02:19:15.190
<v Speaker 1>patient with people because I now I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2794
02:19:15.250 --> 02:19:18.580
<v Speaker 1>when I meet this asshole at the gas</v>
<v Speaker 1>station to clock in the morning,</v>

2795
02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:19.960
<v Speaker 1>that's berating that guy.</v>

2796
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is he will?</v>

2797
02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Because his dad's a fucking piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shiT.</v>

2798
02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:25.900
<v Speaker 1>his life probably sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably dumb.</v>

2799
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 1>He's probably been on drugs since he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

2800
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.900
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have any smart friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any money to get gas at</v>

2801
02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:32.990
<v Speaker 1>2:00 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making poor life choices.</v>

2802
02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:36.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't enemy discipline in his life.</v>

2803
02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:39.830
<v Speaker 1>He's never gone through any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trials and tribulations that taught him</v>

2804
02:19:39.831 --> 02:19:42.680
<v Speaker 1>about things he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't or didn't receive life lessons.</v>

2805
02:19:42.681 --> 02:19:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Probably didn't get a good education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are and I might have to kick</v>

2806
02:19:46.011 --> 02:19:48.800
<v Speaker 1>this guy's ass because it's 2:00 in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and he's threatening.</v>

2807
02:19:48.801 --> 02:19:51.230
<v Speaker 1>He's loud and he's probably going To be</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to.</v>

2808
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Other people look at them the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just fucking toxically stupid,</v>

2809
02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:58.190
<v Speaker 1>but it was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a baby at one point in time,</v>

2810
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:59.270
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to go over there.</v>

2811
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2812
02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to create violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking he's just going to drive</v>

2813
02:20:02.241 --> 02:20:06.850
<v Speaker 1>away and eventually he did and that poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who probably is probably making just</v>

2814
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:10.790
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more than $10 an hour is</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in this fucking cubicle.</v>

2815
02:20:10.850 --> 02:20:15.650
<v Speaker 1>This little glass box with this asshole</v>
<v Speaker 1>berating him at 2:00 in the morning,</v>

2816
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:18.260
<v Speaker 1>but that's a baby that I was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

2817
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:22.790
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my except not acceptance,</v>

2818
02:20:22.791 --> 02:20:27.791
<v Speaker 1>but my curiosity was socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My real curiosity with any socialist</v>

2819
02:20:28.761 --> 02:20:33.761
<v Speaker 1>ideas is how do we recognize the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some people are dealt the shittiest</v>

2820
02:20:34.911 --> 02:20:39.911
<v Speaker 1>of shitty hand of cards and that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire sections of cities where everyone</v>

2821
02:20:41.631 --> 02:20:45.860
<v Speaker 1>has a shit hand of cards and some some</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it out through basketball and</v>

2822
02:20:45.861 --> 02:20:48.470
<v Speaker 1>football and sports and rap music and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2823
02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:51.860
<v Speaker 1>but that whole spot sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole spot sucks.</v>

2824
02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:55.160
<v Speaker 1>The aberrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the few that make it out.</v>

2825
02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:58.700
<v Speaker 1>That's not indicative of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good place and these people</v>

2826
02:20:58.701 --> 02:21:02.330
<v Speaker 1>just need to pull themselves up by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bootstraps is that some salmon make it</v>

2827
02:21:02.331 --> 02:21:04.910
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This crazy waterfall and the grizzly</v>

2828
02:21:04.911 --> 02:21:08.130
<v Speaker 1>bears don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that the waterfall is</v>

2829
02:21:08.131 --> 02:21:11.060
<v Speaker 1>save for salmon and the salmon to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter bunch of pussies.</v>

2830
02:21:11.310 --> 02:21:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>

2831
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:16.040
<v Speaker 1>this is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This the fact that we don't address that</v>

2832
02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:20.540
<v Speaker 1>and that our civilization just plows on</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same stupid path that we've had</v>

2833
02:21:20.541 --> 02:21:23.630
<v Speaker 1>for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of the fact that we have an</v>

2834
02:21:23.631 --> 02:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>absolute understanding of the complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality of the.</v>

2835
02:21:27.911 --> 02:21:30.950
<v Speaker 1>The real ghettos of our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's the south side of chicago</v>

2836
02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:32.840
<v Speaker 1>or whether it's baltimore or wherever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2837
02:21:32.841 --> 02:21:34.760
<v Speaker 1>we have a real understanding of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't,</v>

2838
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.390
<v Speaker 1>this isn't guesswork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really know and we don't do a goddamn</v>

2839
02:21:38.391 --> 02:21:39.050
<v Speaker 1>thing about it.</v>

2840
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:42.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes me want to embrace</v>
<v Speaker 1>some aspects of socialism.</v>

2841
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:45.650
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I know it's not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fair.</v>

2842
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a Great childhood,</v>

2843
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:50.010
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got through.</v>

2844
02:21:50.011 --> 02:21:50.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2845
02:21:50.461 --> 02:21:52.250
<v Speaker 1>he shot me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody raped me.</v>

2846
02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I got through like it could have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>way worse and it is way worse for many,</v>

2847
02:21:56.571 --> 02:21:59.540
<v Speaker 1>many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all these pull yourself up by your</v>

2848
02:21:59.541 --> 02:22:00.920
<v Speaker 1>booTstraps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>

2849
02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:04.010
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I noticed about them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're rarely really successful.</v>

2850
02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Like they are rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really rarely are these pull</v>

2851
02:22:07.641 --> 02:22:10.910
<v Speaker 1>yourself up by your bootstraps people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who have accomplished anything</v>

2852
02:22:10.911 --> 02:22:13.340
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like an idea.</v>

2853
02:22:13.690 --> 02:22:14.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2854
02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:19.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a simplistic ideology that they've</v>

2855
02:22:19.650 --> 02:22:21.960
<v Speaker 1>subscribed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have aoc on.</v>

2856
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I would love to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>

2857
02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Her and I have gone back and on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2858
02:22:25.951 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

2859
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:28.230
<v Speaker 4>would be really interesting to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

2860
02:22:28.231 --> 02:22:30.060
<v Speaker 4>She's so young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so interested in,</v>

2861
02:22:30.090 --> 02:22:31.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's 28 years old.</v>

2862
02:22:31.441 --> 02:22:32.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>

2863
02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:34.460
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's just fascinating.</v>

2864
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:36.810
<v Speaker 4>You should haVe her own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about when she was getting a hard</v>

2865
02:22:36.811 --> 02:22:39.870
<v Speaker 4>time because they found a video like</v>
<v Speaker 4>they thought they were going to get her</v>

2866
02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:42.870
<v Speaker 4>college dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2867
02:22:42.871 --> 02:22:45.690
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone loved that video,</v>

2868
02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:48.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole narrative that like some</v>

2869
02:22:48.211 --> 02:22:50.640
<v Speaker 4>random person on tWitter put that video</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2870
02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:53.250
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the point is they did it because</v>

2871
02:22:53.251 --> 02:22:54.570
<v Speaker 4>they thought they were going to shame</v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

2872
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:56.880
<v Speaker 4>TheY're idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how funny is that?</v>

2873
02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:00.300
<v Speaker 4>They thought it was the most charming</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing in the entire world.</v>

2874
02:23:00.610 --> 02:23:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Anyone who did not love her already fell</v>
<v Speaker 4>in love with you.</v>

2875
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:06.390
<v Speaker 4>That's what it accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then her response to that was her</v>

2876
02:23:06.391 --> 02:23:08.880
<v Speaker 4>doing a little dance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a genius.</v>

2877
02:23:08.881 --> 02:23:10.980
<v Speaker 4>She's a social media genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>

2878
02:23:10.981 --> 02:23:14.640
<v Speaker 4>does she do her ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stand up at all will be interesting to</v>

2879
02:23:14.641 --> 02:23:15.380
<v Speaker 4>hear.</v>

2880
02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Ideas can evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what she has,</v>

2881
02:23:17.331 --> 02:23:20.600
<v Speaker 3>it's unique and she's real and she seems</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a really good person.</v>

2882
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:24.170
<v Speaker 3>She seems to be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now whether or not I agree with her tax</v>

2883
02:23:24.171 --> 02:23:25.760
<v Speaker 3>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an economist.</v>

2884
02:23:25.761 --> 02:23:26.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking moron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2885
02:23:26.931 --> 02:23:30.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about economics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>

2886
02:23:30.890 --> 02:23:34.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have her almost like now</v>

2887
02:23:34.530 --> 02:23:37.160
<v Speaker 3>rather have her on per just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to know about her as a</v>

2888
02:23:37.161 --> 02:23:38.430
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For my.</v>

2889
02:23:38.450 --> 02:23:41.310
<v Speaker 3>My thoughts on politicians is you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>hire an economist.</v>

2890
02:23:41.311 --> 02:23:43.280
<v Speaker 3>You could listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could talk to them.</v>

2891
02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:47.660
<v Speaker 3>What we really need is people that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right idea as far as we're human</v>

2892
02:23:47.661 --> 02:23:51.110
<v Speaker 3>should go the way we should behave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we should treat each other.</v>

2893
02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:54.830
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this overwhelming need for community</v>

2894
02:23:54.831 --> 02:23:57.140
<v Speaker 3>that we all share.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to.</v>

2895
02:23:57.320 --> 02:24:00.740
<v Speaker 3>We have to pull this thing together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to be.</v>

2896
02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:04.850
<v Speaker 3>We have to look at each other as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>community and that's lacking and the</v>

2897
02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:07.790
<v Speaker 3>people that are polarizing both on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left and the right want,</v>

2898
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:12.140
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't they want to look at people and</v>

2899
02:24:12.141 --> 02:24:12.974
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2900
02:24:13.010 --> 02:24:15.620
<v Speaker 3>you will never get better like that 16</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old kid.</v>

2901
02:24:15.621 --> 02:24:18.530
<v Speaker 3>No need to ever forgive him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This kind of crazy talk,</v>

2902
02:24:18.770 --> 02:24:20.840
<v Speaker 3>whether it's from the right or from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

2903
02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:24.500
<v Speaker 3>is what we really need to stomp out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to stop,</v>

2904
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:27.410
<v Speaker 3>we need to be nicer to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to figure out where we don't</v>

2905
02:24:27.411 --> 02:24:29.750
<v Speaker 3>have time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to live long.</v>

2906
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:33.050
<v Speaker 3>If you're 50 years old and this is your</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the world,</v>

2907
02:24:33.051 --> 02:24:33.621
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>

2908
02:24:33.621 --> 02:24:35.540
<v Speaker 3>you're halfway done and you're an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an idiot.</v>

2909
02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:39.110
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at shit completely wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're halfway done with this trip.</v>

2910
02:24:39.111 --> 02:24:39.944
<v Speaker 3>If everything goes perfect.</v>

2911
02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:44.740
<v Speaker 4>I know we're like in an antireligious</v>
<v Speaker 4>period of the world's history,</v>

2912
02:24:44.741 --> 02:24:47.740
<v Speaker 4>but like ideas like grace and mercy.</v>

2913
02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would,</v>

2914
02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:51.450
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go a long way in the culture right</v>

2915
02:24:51.451 --> 02:24:52.500
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2916
02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:53.401
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2917
02:24:53.401 --> 02:24:57.330
<v Speaker 3>And even even if it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's really wacky,</v>

2918
02:24:58.130 --> 02:25:00.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mindfulness and yoga,</v>

2919
02:25:00.871 --> 02:25:05.871
<v Speaker 3>even if it's like comes from a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake guru we place in the beginning,</v>

2920
02:25:06.421 --> 02:25:08.730
<v Speaker 3>which a lot of times it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just people have.</v>

2921
02:25:08.731 --> 02:25:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have deep</v>

2922
02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:16.030
<v Speaker 4>the religious impulses and that needs to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go somewhere and so it's going to</v>

2923
02:25:16.031 --> 02:25:20.530
<v Speaker 4>politics and doctrinaire politics or</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to willfulness or it's going</v>

2924
02:25:20.531 --> 02:25:22.800
<v Speaker 4>to self care and wellness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2925
02:25:22.810 --> 02:25:23.950
<v Speaker 4>all these things are</v>

2926
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:27.260
<v Speaker 3>astrology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like making a comeback isn't</v>

2927
02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:28.180
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2934
02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:41.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like all religious expert</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that energy inside of us I think is</v>

2935
02:25:41.021 --> 02:25:45.060
<v Speaker 3>deeply human and goat needs to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere are really smart guy who told</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>

2939
02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie does not have one.</v>

<v Speaker 3>desire for a space daddy,</v>

2943
02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:09.850
<v Speaker 3>a higher power of someone that knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that knows more than you.</v>

2944
02:26:09.851 --> 02:26:14.851
<v Speaker 3>Some grand pattern to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That leads to harmony.</v>

2945
02:26:15.450 --> 02:26:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tHink everybody sort of has that thing</v>

2946
02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:20.680
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about before,</v>

2947
02:26:20.681 --> 02:26:24.580
<v Speaker 3>we do realize if we are being honeSt</v>
<v Speaker 3>that no one's at the wheel,</v>

2948
02:26:25.090 --> 02:26:29.110
<v Speaker 3>that we wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're almost like we're in a spaceship</v>

2949
02:26:29.530 --> 02:26:33.130
<v Speaker 3>and we wake up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in Hyper sleep and this thing</v>

2950
02:26:33.131 --> 02:26:35.150
<v Speaker 3>has been flying for millions of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're like,</v>

2951
02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:37.060
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is flying this?</v>

2952
02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Do we know who's flying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you,</v>

2953
02:26:39.121 --> 02:26:40.390
<v Speaker 3>you're not flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not flying them.</v>

2954
02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

2955
02:26:40.930 --> 02:26:43.630
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get together and with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>form of group that flies it like,</v>

2956
02:26:43.631 --> 02:26:44.261
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2957
02:26:44.261 --> 02:26:47.380
<v Speaker 3>but it still moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still moving while we're trying to</v>

2958
02:26:47.381 --> 02:26:49.540
<v Speaker 3>figure out who flies it and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to slow it down.</v>

2959
02:26:49.541 --> 02:26:51.270
<v Speaker 3>There's no breaks in this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2960
02:26:51.271 --> 02:26:53.680
<v Speaker 3>we are in an organic spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>

2961
02:26:53.681 --> 02:26:55.690
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're flying through infinity.</v>

2962
02:26:55.691 --> 02:26:59.200
<v Speaker 3>We're spinning a thousand miles an hour</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're going through space and that's</v>

2963
02:26:59.201 --> 02:27:01.570
<v Speaker 3>real and you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all those things are real.</v>

2964
02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:05.560
<v Speaker 3>All those things sort of make everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else sort of pale in comparison.</v>

2965
02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.800
<v Speaker 3>The reality of that is so Bizarre and</v>
<v Speaker 3>while while we're avoiding those</v>

2966
02:27:11.411 --> 02:27:16.411
<v Speaker 3>thoughts were concentrating on these</v>
<v Speaker 3>very minor differences that we have that</v>

2967
02:27:16.481 --> 02:27:20.470
<v Speaker 3>are really framed by our teams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the team,</v>

2968
02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:22.390
<v Speaker 3>this team says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta do this,</v>

2969
02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:24.100
<v Speaker 3>this team says you got to do that.</v>

2970
02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I can tell almost to a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you tell me you're pro life,</v>

2971
02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you vote republican.</v>

2972
02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Feel everything else about that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2973
02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:36.600
<v Speaker 3>The idea also that you know that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to die and yet there are people</v>

2974
02:27:37.241 --> 02:27:42.241
<v Speaker 3>who are spending their lives hurling</v>
<v Speaker 3>pixels at other people and pixels like</v>

2975
02:27:42.731 --> 02:27:44.560
<v Speaker 3>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious though.</v>

2976
02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Pixels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought about it that way.</v>

2977
02:27:46.270 --> 02:27:50.260
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is your one life.</v>

2978
02:27:50.310 --> 02:27:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you want to spend it.</v>

2979
02:27:52.990 --> 02:27:54.670
<v Speaker 3>being mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go outside.</v>

2980
02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like go outside,</v>

2981
02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:00.160
<v Speaker 3>but it's so intoxicating and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>new.</v>

2982
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:04.750
<v Speaker 3>That's also the problem with social</v>
<v Speaker 3>media and phones in a world in which</v>

2983
02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:09.190
<v Speaker 3>people live alone and stare down at</v>
<v Speaker 3>their flashy screen and worship it like</v>

2984
02:28:09.191 --> 02:28:10.360
<v Speaker 3>a god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2985
02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:13.300
<v Speaker 3>these networks gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you a sense of belonging and</v>

2986
02:28:13.301 --> 02:28:14.340
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2987
02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:17.530
<v Speaker 3>and it also gives you something to think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about if you,</v>

2988
02:28:17.531 --> 02:28:18.364
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2989
02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about jamie kilstein</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier were accidental tweeted or</v>

2990
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:27.130
<v Speaker 4>texted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jamie used to be but social justice and</v>

2991
02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:32.170
<v Speaker 4>he was describing how he would go after</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and then he would be locked onto</v>

2992
02:28:32.301 --> 02:28:35.480
<v Speaker 4>his phone all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the responses and completely</v>

2993
02:28:35.481 --> 02:28:37.640
<v Speaker 4>addicted to it no matter what he did</v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout his day.</v>

2994
02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:41.360
<v Speaker 4>He was checking his phone every couple</v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes and couldn't help that</v>

2995
02:28:41.361 --> 02:28:43.580
<v Speaker 4>compulsion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of people out there that</v>

2996
02:28:43.581 --> 02:28:46.940
<v Speaker 4>are locked into this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2997
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:48.550
<v Speaker 4>it is an addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had to get.</v>

2998
02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:51.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I had a small period of a few</v>

2999
02:28:51.530 --> 02:28:52.850
<v Speaker 4>months where I had not really been on</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter.</v>

3000
02:28:52.851 --> 02:28:56.120
<v Speaker 4>I joined the times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sort of thing happened to me and</v>

3001
02:28:56.121 --> 02:28:58.100
<v Speaker 4>then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is horrible.</v>

3002
02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:03.070
<v Speaker 4>Like I hate the way this is physically</v>
<v Speaker 4>making me feel like I'm nauseous and</v>

3003
02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:04.830
<v Speaker 4>sweating like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3004
02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:07.160
<v Speaker 4>I hate this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this.</v>

3005
02:29:07.470 --> 02:29:09.710
<v Speaker 4>IT's to be a better way saying something</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean to you,</v>

3006
02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:10.430
<v Speaker 4>oh my god.</v>

3007
02:29:10.430 --> 02:29:13.240
<v Speaker 4>And then you look at it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should say something back like this</v>

3008
02:29:13.430 --> 02:29:14.780
<v Speaker 4>really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then people,</v>

3009
02:29:14.781 --> 02:29:16.640
<v Speaker 4>you see them like formulating and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

3010
02:29:16.641 --> 02:29:17.970
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in,</v>

3011
02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:20.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in mortal kombat here.</v>

3012
02:29:20.210 --> 02:29:23.240
<v Speaker 4>Mortal online to know you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you catch yourself.</v>

3013
02:29:23.241 --> 02:29:26.900
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember I was at a dinner party</v>
<v Speaker 4>once and I was like ta describing some</v>

3014
02:29:26.901 --> 02:29:29.330
<v Speaker 4>twitter fight I was at and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

3015
02:29:29.331 --> 02:29:34.070
<v Speaker 4>I've become one of those people and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to allow myself to be thAt</v>

3016
02:29:34.071 --> 02:29:36.050
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you have to fight it.</v>

3017
02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:39.020
<v Speaker 4>You do have to fight it and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be aware of what it is,</v>

3018
02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:42.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it feels like something you have to</v>

3019
02:29:42.891 --> 02:29:43.860
<v Speaker 4>pay attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3020
02:29:43.970 --> 02:29:47.060
<v Speaker 4>But the beauty is that I get to write</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the New York times.</v>

3021
02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3022
02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.300
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to put my energy into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3023
02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:54.170
<v Speaker 4>And when you do get criticism from your</v>
<v Speaker 4>articles,</v>

3024
02:29:54.260 --> 02:29:59.260
<v Speaker 4>do you get it in the form of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is really scary email today?</v>

3025
02:29:59.451 --> 02:30:01.130
<v Speaker 4>I get emails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get tweets,</v>

3026
02:30:01.131 --> 02:30:03.620
<v Speaker 4>I get everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything everyone gets.</v>

3027
02:30:03.621 --> 02:30:06.680
<v Speaker 4>I get letters in the mail sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to talk about it?</v>

3028
02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3029
02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:09.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>

3030
02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:11.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can.</v>

3031
02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:13.170
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's so unusual,</v>

3032
02:30:13.171 --> 02:30:14.870
<v Speaker 4>like that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3033
02:30:14.871 --> 02:30:17.630
<v Speaker 4>I write things that people find</v>
<v Speaker 4>provocative.</v>

3034
02:30:17.631 --> 02:30:21.110
<v Speaker 4>I expect to provoke a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay with that.</v>

3035
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:23.360
<v Speaker 4>And when there are things that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>scary,</v>

3036
02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:25.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the New York times is really good about</v>

3037
02:30:25.521 --> 02:30:30.521
<v Speaker 4>monitoring that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way I don't like to be in a</v>

3038
02:30:30.531 --> 02:30:34.190
<v Speaker 4>field that's got getting attacked as an</v>
<v Speaker 4>enemy of the people by the president of</v>

3039
02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:37.910
<v Speaker 4>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're super excited about that.</v>

3040
02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:39.650
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy,</v>

3041
02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:42.620
<v Speaker 4>he's so petty that he calls it like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>failing needed,</v>

3042
02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:47.830
<v Speaker 4>but it's so irresponsible like there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm shocked that there has not been more</v>

3043
02:30:49.281 --> 02:30:51.740
<v Speaker 4>violence perpetrated on members of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>press.</v>

3044
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:52.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really am.</v>

3045
02:30:53.960 --> 02:30:54.980
<v Speaker 4>What do you think happens with him?</v>

3046
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:59.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who can feed us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who can beat him.</v>

3047
02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:00.770
<v Speaker 4>Who do you think can beat him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good question.</v>

3048
02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary can't.</v>

3049
02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:06.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm so worried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so worried.</v>

3050
02:31:06.951 --> 02:31:09.620
<v Speaker 4>She's going to run again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's going to muscle her way to the</v>

3051
02:31:09.621 --> 02:31:13.370
<v Speaker 4>top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who can beat him right now</v>

3052
02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:14.660
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3053
02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:17.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that the question</v>

3054
02:31:17.361 --> 02:31:19.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If things keep going further and further</v>

3055
02:31:19.711 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 4>south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What</v>

3056
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.020
<v Speaker 3>about someone who is a centrist</v>
<v Speaker 3>democrat?</v>

3057
02:31:22.021 --> 02:31:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't that make more sense that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's gonna who's a rational</v>

3058
02:31:25.231 --> 02:31:29.040
<v Speaker 3>person who's on the right is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this person who's maybe</v>

3059
02:31:29.310 --> 02:31:33.510
<v Speaker 3>economically conservative but socially</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal and say this is really where I'm</v>

3060
02:31:33.511 --> 02:31:35.790
<v Speaker 3>leaning towards one on the far left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on,</v>

3061
02:31:35.850 --> 02:31:39.060
<v Speaker 3>on an identity politics platform scares</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3062
02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not going to work well,</v>

3063
02:31:41.690 --> 02:31:44.310
<v Speaker 3>could it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't know because trump's</v>

3064
02:31:44.311 --> 02:31:49.230
<v Speaker 3>whole thing was screw the center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Just need to make my base go ape shit</v>

3065
02:31:49.231 --> 02:31:51.720
<v Speaker 3>crazy for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're still apeshit crazy and no</v>

3066
02:31:51.721 --> 02:31:54.800
<v Speaker 3>matter what he does and I'm worried that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left that the democrats are going to</v>

3067
02:31:54.810 --> 02:31:56.640
<v Speaker 3>try and replicate that strategy and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3068
02:31:56.641 --> 02:32:00.450
<v Speaker 3>we just need to make our base go ape</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit crazy rather than running someone</v>

3069
02:32:00.451 --> 02:32:03.570
<v Speaker 3>that can win the center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see where You're going,</v>

3070
02:32:03.571 --> 02:32:07.740
<v Speaker 3>but I think that this is maybe my</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal bias,</v>

3071
02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:10.890
<v Speaker 3>but I think that people on the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't fall for that the same way</v>

3072
02:32:10.891 --> 02:32:11.820
<v Speaker 3>people in the right word.</v>

3073
02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:17.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people on the left who saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who went ape shit full woke far</v>

3074
02:32:17.401 --> 02:32:19.260
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of people in the</v>

3075
02:32:19.261 --> 02:32:20.010
<v Speaker 3>center and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3076
02:32:20.010 --> 02:32:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just get a vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Libertarian man.</v>

3077
02:32:21.821 --> 02:32:23.640

<v Speaker 3>some shit.</v>

3078
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:24.840

<v Speaker 3>so who's in right now?</v>

3082
02:32:35.140 --> 02:32:37.740
<v Speaker 3>She's in a solid toady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

3083
02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:40.980
<v Speaker 3>She is toady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I use that word correctly.</v>

3084
02:32:40.981 --> 02:32:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you check with toady means like</v>

3086
02:32:44.370 --> 02:32:45.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like a</v>

02:32:48.490 --> 02:32:52.300
<v Speaker 3>t o a d I e.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

3088

<v Speaker 3>So she's in assad,</v>

<v Speaker 3>sycophants that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3094
02:33:11.141 --> 02:33:12.250
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

3095
02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:16.720
<v Speaker 3>known about her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what did she say?</v>

3096
02:33:16.721 --> 02:33:20.020
<v Speaker 3>That I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the details I've read</v>

3097
02:33:20.021 --> 02:33:23.710
<v Speaker 3>it should say that before we say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>about or we should probably read it</v>

3098
02:33:23.711 --> 02:33:25.270
<v Speaker 3>rather well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have read it.</v>

3099
02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Normally we should write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3100
02:33:26.740 --> 02:33:28.600
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so we know what she said.</v>

3101
02:33:30.050 --> 02:33:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed talking to her.</v>

3102
02:33:31.481 --> 02:33:33.160
<v Speaker 3>I like her a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you serious?</v>

3103
02:33:33.161 --> 02:33:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like talking to her.</v>

3104
02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:36.160
<v Speaker 3>A lot of talking to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about.</v>

3105
02:33:36.250 --> 02:33:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I think she's like the mother lode of</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad ideas.</v>

3106
02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty positive about that.</v>

3107
02:33:42.310 --> 02:33:44.860
<v Speaker 3>especially on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe I'm wrong.</v>

3108
02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3109
02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:53.620
<v Speaker 3>my take on her was that I think as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person who's coming from the left who is</v>

3110
02:33:53.621 --> 02:33:57.970
<v Speaker 3>also a veteran and is very articulate</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sensible and a woman,</v>

3111
02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:01.330
<v Speaker 3>and in talking to her and we didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a sod or any of those things,</v>

3112
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:06.740
<v Speaker 3>but talking to her about what she feels</v>
<v Speaker 3>is wrong with the current administration</v>

3113
02:34:06.741 --> 02:34:10.120
<v Speaker 3>and the way things are running in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction she thinks things could go in,</v>

3114
02:34:10.210 --> 02:34:11.800
<v Speaker 3>sheds a very promising ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3115
02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:13.150
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't she?</v>

3116
02:34:13.151 --> 02:34:15.640
<v Speaker 3>also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did she ever apologize for believing in</v>

3117
02:34:15.641 --> 02:34:18.820
<v Speaker 3>conversion therapy for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know she believed in</v>

3118
02:34:18.821 --> 02:34:20.680
<v Speaker 3>conversion therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I crazy?</v>

3119
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:23.230
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost positive.</v>

3120
02:34:23.231 --> 02:34:27.680
<v Speaker 3>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think her father ran a center therapy.</v>

3121
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:28.920
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about gay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3122
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.751
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3123
02:34:29.751 --> 02:34:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard that.</v>

3124
02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I did hear something about when she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>very young.</v>

3125
02:34:34.401 --> 02:34:37.940
<v Speaker 1>She was like 22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had said something about gay</v>

3126
02:34:37.941 --> 02:34:41.090
<v Speaker 1>marriage and civil unions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she apologized for it and said that</v>

3127
02:34:41.091 --> 02:34:44.180
<v Speaker 1>she evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She reveals she met assad In Syria</v>

3128
02:34:44.181 --> 02:34:46.880
<v Speaker 1>without informing top democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>

3129
02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:51.590
<v Speaker 1>She said she went on a fact finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission in supportive piece for syrian</v>

3130
02:34:51.591 --> 02:34:54.590
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but characterize us backed rebels' as</v>

3131
02:34:54.591 --> 02:34:55.424
<v Speaker 1>terrorists.</v>

3132
02:34:57.700 --> 02:34:58.590
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's.</v>

3133
02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:00.913
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

3134
02:35:01.930 --> 02:35:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I can keep looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just.</v>

3135
02:35:03.610 --> 02:35:06.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling me it's time to research</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything all at the same time.</v>

3136
02:35:07.330 --> 02:35:09.210
<v Speaker 3>I can come back on When I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's,</v>

3137
02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:10.780
<v Speaker 3>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do this another time,</v>

3138
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:14.050
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do you think stands out for you as</v>

3139
02:35:14.051 --> 02:35:15.460
<v Speaker 3>someone that would make a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>president?</v>

3140
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:17.650
<v Speaker 3>She wants touted working for an anti gay</v>
<v Speaker 3>group that,</v>

3141
02:35:17.651 --> 02:35:19.060
<v Speaker 3>that conversion therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

3144
02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:29.100

<v Speaker 3>I'm worried as a person who's been</v>

3145
02:35:29.101 --> 02:35:32.190
<v Speaker 3>called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right adjacent worry about labels.</v>

3146
02:35:32.191 --> 02:35:33.024
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>

3147
02:35:33.450 --> 02:35:36.210
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rep tulsi gabbard in the early two</v>

3148
02:35:36.211 --> 02:35:39.690
<v Speaker 3>thousands touted working for her</v>
<v Speaker 3>father's anti gay organization which</v>

3149
02:35:39.691 --> 02:35:43.590
<v Speaker 3>mobilized to pass a measure against same</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex marriage in Hawaii and perverted and</v>

3150
02:35:43.591 --> 02:35:45.570
<v Speaker 3>promoted controversial conversion</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy.</v>

3151
02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:47.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3152
02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Fyi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conversion therapies.</v>

3153
02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:55.100
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest shit of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a an article that I read</v>

3154
02:35:55.940 --> 02:35:57.320
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>

3155
02:35:57.590 --> 02:36:01.310
<v Speaker 1>They were manipulating pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turned out it's.</v>

3156
02:36:01.311 --> 02:36:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started reading it from a study on</v>

3157
02:36:04.041 --> 02:36:07.160
<v Speaker 1>rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did this thing with rats where they</v>

3158
02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:10.460
<v Speaker 1>provided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've figured out a way to give rats</v>

3159
02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:11.294
<v Speaker 1>orgasms.</v>

3160
02:36:11.470 --> 02:36:15.160
<v Speaker 3>I figured out a way to jazz up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasure center of the brain</v>

3161
02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:18.610
<v Speaker 3>and they would do anything to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would,</v>

3162
02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:20.640
<v Speaker 3>they would shock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would run up,</v>

3163
02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:25.300
<v Speaker 3>pass an area that shocked them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they do do anything to get to this</v>

3164
02:36:25.301 --> 02:36:27.940
<v Speaker 3>area where they could have these orgasms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would have them up to 2000</v>

3165
02:36:27.941 --> 02:36:30.700
<v Speaker 3>times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wOuld just not just all day long</v>

3166
02:36:31.690 --> 02:36:36.690
<v Speaker 3>and in reading male and female rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rats,</v>

3167
02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:38.280
<v Speaker 3>just just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

3168
02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:43.270
<v Speaker 3>just rats trying to come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when I was a love that we're in</v>

3169
02:36:43.271 --> 02:36:46.150
<v Speaker 3>our three talking about rat orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3170
02:36:46.151 --> 02:36:48.070
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sorry folks.</v>

3172
02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Mrs. Weiss time to turn away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did it with a gay man while they</v>

3173
02:36:56.901 --> 02:36:59.360
<v Speaker 1>were doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in the 19 seventies.</v>

3174
02:36:59.570 --> 02:37:02.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple different studies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did,</v>

3175
02:37:02.361 --> 02:37:07.040
<v Speaker 1>but one of them they did with this gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy where they tried to stimulate</v>

3176
02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:11.750
<v Speaker 1>certain parts of his brain while they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were showing him heterosexual porn and</v>

3177
02:37:11.751 --> 02:37:15.620
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to convert him into</v>
<v Speaker 1>being heterosexual and apparently they</v>

3178
02:37:15.621 --> 02:37:20.000
<v Speaker 1>had some meager amount of success with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this where he engaged in sexual</v>

3179
02:37:20.001 --> 02:37:24.830
<v Speaker 1>relationships with women and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently even enjoyed it and they did</v>

3180
02:37:24.831 --> 02:37:29.831
<v Speaker 1>something to the literally stimulate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of his brain that would excite</v>

3181
02:37:29.841 --> 02:37:34.841
<v Speaker 1>arousal and tried to connect that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>with heterosexual porn and made him</v>

3182
02:37:38.390 --> 02:37:43.220
<v Speaker 1>orgasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made him masturbate to orgasm while they</v>

3183
02:37:43.221 --> 02:37:46.550
<v Speaker 1>were doing this and showing him straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>porn and the idea was they were going to</v>

3184
02:37:46.551 --> 02:37:47.630
<v Speaker 1>reprogram his mind.</v>

3185
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:49.460
<v Speaker 1>HOw'd that work out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't,</v>

3186
02:37:49.490 --> 02:37:51.890
<v Speaker 1>but It did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did in terms of short term,</v>

3187
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:54.900
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't mean it must have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>just massively confused.</v>

3188
02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Obviously sexuality is not just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes you have an orgasm.</v>

3189
02:37:59.090 --> 02:37:59.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

3190
02:37:59.691 --> 02:38:03.470
<v Speaker 1>It's also incredibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly complex and one of the</v>

3191
02:38:03.471 --> 02:38:08.471
<v Speaker 1>things that happens is you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have gay experiences when you're</v>

3192
02:38:10.791 --> 02:38:13.250
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone does something to you in</v>

3193
02:38:13.290 --> 02:38:17.220
<v Speaker 1>imprints upon you arousal at a young age</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

3194
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:21.080
<v Speaker 1>with gay experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes even heterosexual men will get</v>

3195
02:38:21.081 --> 02:38:26.081
<v Speaker 1>aroused by certain gay images and gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because of their past because of</v>

3196
02:38:26.841 --> 02:38:27.670
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like chris,</v>

3197
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:32.050
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're all on a spectrum of</v>

3198
02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:33.310
<v Speaker 4>sexuality and</v>

3199
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:35.390
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so for sure.</v>

3200
02:38:35.391 --> 02:38:37.490
<v Speaker 1>We all certainly are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also speculative.</v>

3201
02:38:37.491 --> 02:38:42.491
<v Speaker 1>How much of that spectrum is influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>by your environment versus your jeans</v>

3202
02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:45.980
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is very taboo for some people</v>

3203
02:38:46.010 --> 02:38:47.990
<v Speaker 1>discuss even though it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

3204
02:38:48.350 --> 02:38:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Human sexuality is incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating and there's,</v>

3205
02:38:51.260 --> 02:38:56.260
<v Speaker 1>there's some major taboo areas of</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration and when you start looking</v>

3206
02:38:58.461 --> 02:39:01.550
<v Speaker 1>at like what makes a person gay or</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

3207
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:04.700
<v Speaker 1>whether it's nature or nurture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a combination of those</v>

3208
02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:08.150
<v Speaker 1>things where if someone's just radically</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay from the room or whether someone's</v>

3209
02:39:08.151 --> 02:39:10.220
<v Speaker 1>radically straight from the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3210
02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:13.790
<v Speaker 1>these studies where they were trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to turn someone with</v>

3211
02:39:13.791 --> 02:39:16.970
<v Speaker 1>science and they were trying to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone straight.</v>

3212
02:39:17.050 --> 02:39:17.620
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3213
02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:18.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very.</v>

3214
02:39:18.740 --> 02:39:20.960
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't do it today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd never be able to do it today in</v>

3215
02:39:20.961 --> 02:39:21.770
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3216
02:39:21.770 --> 02:39:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was 71.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did it.</v>

3217
02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll send it to you.</v>

3218
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:27.110
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3219
02:39:28.010 --> 02:39:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Widely criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but heavily studied.</v>

3220
02:39:31.130 --> 02:39:33.320
<v Speaker 1>The woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it to a woman to and they.</v>

3221
02:39:33.350 --> 02:39:35.590
<v Speaker 1>They stuck these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman had a problem with pain</v>

3222
02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:39.350
<v Speaker 1>killers and so they figured out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wire her brain.</v>

3223
02:39:39.650 --> 02:39:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Is this like electric shock therapy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucking dental drills,</v>

3224
02:39:44.310 --> 02:39:49.310
<v Speaker 4>but only on their brains</v>
<v Speaker 4>can do whatever they wanted to get high.</v>

3225
02:39:51.250 --> 02:39:54.600
<v Speaker 4>WHen does this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now's the time we break out the elan</v>

3226
02:39:54.601 --> 02:39:55.434
<v Speaker 4>musk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd.</v>

3227
02:39:55.470 --> 02:39:56.820
<v Speaker 4>OH my god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was crazy.</v>

3228
02:39:56.821 --> 02:39:58.470
<v Speaker 4>I watched every minute of it was stop</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3229
02:39:58.590 --> 02:40:01.620
<v Speaker 4>We drank whiskey for two hours for when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say crazy,</v>

3230
02:40:01.621 --> 02:40:05.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean like an amazing get like</v>
<v Speaker 4>journalistically.</v>

3231
02:40:05.101 --> 02:40:06.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was awesome.</v>

3232
02:40:06.350 --> 02:40:07.080
<v Speaker 4>No</v>

3233
02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:11.280
<v Speaker 1>is really cool and I have to thank some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his friends that I'm friends with</v>

3234
02:40:11.281 --> 02:40:13.560
<v Speaker 1>that convinced him to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3235
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:17.550
<v Speaker 1>that was a fascinating conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was nothing.</v>

3236
02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I thought so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We smoked a little pot.</v>

3237
02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally didn't think of it.</v>

3238
02:40:22.380 --> 02:40:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Amy thing he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

3239
02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:28.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't really wanted to talk to him</v>

3240
02:40:28.681 --> 02:40:31.890
<v Speaker 1>about what his thought process like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on.</v>

3241
02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I know something different is going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his head.</v>

3242
02:40:34.231 --> 02:40:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3243
02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you ever talked to someone where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3244
02:40:37.381 --> 02:40:42.260
<v Speaker 1>because I have children and I do like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of people's babies that become,</v>

3245
02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:43.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are,</v>

3246
02:40:44.250 --> 02:40:47.700
<v Speaker 1>see them in front of me right now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this constant state of evolution.</v>

3247
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:51.480
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes I'll run into someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's depressingly stupid where I</v>

3248
02:40:51.481 --> 02:40:52.620
<v Speaker 1>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god damn,</v>

3249
02:40:52.621 --> 02:40:55.560
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got a nine volt brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do.</v>

3250
02:40:55.650 --> 02:40:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Some people just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to admit that.</v>

3251
02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And we're not talking about mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>retardation or any sort of a disease</v>

3252
02:41:01.141 --> 02:41:03.780
<v Speaker 1>down syndrome or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about people that are just</v>

3253
02:41:03.781 --> 02:41:06.030
<v Speaker 1>toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid and they do exist.</v>

3254
02:41:06.031 --> 02:41:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Just like some people have big noses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have little noses.</v>

3255
02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:11.480
<v Speaker 3>So when you were talking to elon musk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you get the sense that you were</v>

3256
02:41:11.481 --> 02:41:14.480
<v Speaker 3>talking to like a genius?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did it feel like?</v>

3257
02:41:14.481 --> 02:41:18.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm a chimp champion here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That firstly.</v>

3258
02:41:18.130 --> 02:41:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exactly what was going to say I</v>

3259
02:41:20.601 --> 02:41:25.601
<v Speaker 3>am that toxically stupid person talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this guy really wants to create</v>

3260
02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:29.960
<v Speaker 3>gigantic power stations in Australia to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix their grid and wants to shoot</v>

3261
02:41:30.020 --> 02:41:33.650
<v Speaker 3>fucking rockets into space and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally let them drill under la.</v>

3262
02:41:33.651 --> 02:41:34.484
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

3263
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:35.780
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to drill holes.</v>

3264
02:41:35.850 --> 02:41:38.360
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are completely fascinated by him</v>

3265
02:41:38.361 --> 02:41:41.300
<v Speaker 3>and they would have watched you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have watched like a silent</v>

3266
02:41:41.301 --> 02:41:44.210
<v Speaker 3>movie with you and him for two hours and</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of people would have watched</v>

3267
02:41:44.211 --> 02:41:45.200
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

3268
02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:47.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to hear him talk for sure,</v>

3269
02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:51.620
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying like anything he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's completely fascinating to people.</v>

3270
02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's</v>

3271
02:41:52.370 --> 02:41:54.710
<v Speaker 1>gitelman super genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legitimate,</v>

3272
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:59.790
<v Speaker 1>like when he's not full of shit is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is his thought process is</v>

3273
02:42:00.561 --> 02:42:03.410
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that was really</v>

3274
02:42:03.411 --> 02:42:07.640
<v Speaker 1>clear from talking to him was that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable that his whole life it's</v>

3275
02:42:07.641 --> 02:42:12.641
<v Speaker 1>been this tornado of ideas is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>against his head and he's like,</v>

3276
02:42:14.571 --> 02:42:18.230
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't want to be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

3277
02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:20.240
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3278
02:42:20.290 --> 02:42:22.190
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never shuts off,</v>

3279
02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:23.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3280
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:24.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wasn't,</v>

3281
02:42:25.310 --> 02:42:26.540
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woe Is me.</v>

3282
02:42:26.810 --> 02:42:28.760
<v Speaker 1>He was being factual and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

3283
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:30.030
<v Speaker 1>it's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3284
02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:31.460
<v Speaker 1>some people have a ringing in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ears.</v>

3285
02:42:31.461 --> 02:42:33.260
<v Speaker 1>They have tinnitus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock concerts,</v>

3286
02:42:33.261 --> 02:42:36.170
<v Speaker 1>too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got a ringing of ideas.</v>

3287
02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:38.390
<v Speaker 1>So while you and I are having this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

3288
02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a fucking</v>

3289
02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:42.730
<v Speaker 3>anything else going on in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing,</v>

3290
02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:46.840
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing else back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just you and I talking and there's</v>

3291
02:42:46.841 --> 02:42:50.740
<v Speaker 3>no fucking grand plans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's like remapping civilization</v>

3292
02:42:50.741 --> 02:42:54.310
<v Speaker 3>and trying to make a better yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking I want a burger.</v>

3293
02:42:54.370 --> 02:42:55.250
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

3294
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:58.560
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

3295
02:42:58.820 --> 02:43:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like shaquille o'neal is eight feet</v>

3296
02:43:02.851 --> 02:43:06.000
<v Speaker 1>tall and some people are four feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3297
02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:08.940
<v Speaker 1>some people just have a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no,</v>

3298
02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:12.130
<v Speaker 1>there's no level playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes to</v>

3299
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:15.820
<v Speaker 3>anything politik performance or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or mental performance.</v>

3300
02:43:16.290 --> 02:43:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Parents are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you were talking about before,</v>

3301
02:43:18.251 --> 02:43:20.740
<v Speaker 3>like I won the lottery when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3302
02:43:21.810 --> 02:43:26.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm so aware of that and everything in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life that made everything possible.</v>

3303
02:43:27.630 --> 02:43:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the real,</v>

3304
02:43:29.350 --> 02:43:34.350
<v Speaker 3>the only saving grace of the concept of</v>
<v Speaker 3>white privilege is that we do have to</v>

3305
02:43:34.391 --> 02:43:38.320
<v Speaker 3>recognize that some people got a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good deal and some people got a really</v>

3306
02:43:38.321 --> 02:43:41.160
<v Speaker 3>terrible deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the only reason why white privileges</v>

3307
02:43:41.170 --> 02:43:43.540
<v Speaker 3>even something to consider Is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>racism is real.</v>

3308
02:43:43.810 --> 02:43:48.810
<v Speaker 3>That white privilege is not if the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>was barry weiss or kinds of privilege.</v>

3309
02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I was going to say is if the</v>

3310
02:43:51.371 --> 02:43:53.260
<v Speaker 3>world was people like you or people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>jamie,</v>

3311
02:43:53.410 --> 02:43:55.930
<v Speaker 3>we would never have to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 3>racism because it wouldn't even be a</v>

3312
02:43:55.931 --> 02:43:58.450
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's on black twitter every day.</v>

3313
02:43:59.010 --> 02:43:59.500
<v Speaker 3>Love jamie.</v>

3314
02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:02.260
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing over there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just been a producer working.</v>

3315
02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

3316
02:44:04.091 --> 02:44:05.770
<v Speaker 3>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was no racism,</v>

3317
02:44:05.980 --> 02:44:09.040
<v Speaker 3>that concept would be totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant.</v>

3318
02:44:09.041 --> 02:44:10.690
<v Speaker 3>And what we would be concentrating on</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3319
02:44:10.990 --> 02:44:13.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's making the best buildings?</v>

3320
02:44:13.451 --> 02:44:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Who's making the best music?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3321
02:44:14.981 --> 02:44:17.020
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were the contributions to culture</v>

3322
02:44:17.021 --> 02:44:21.070
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't care about if they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from asian people or west indian</v>

3323
02:44:21.071 --> 02:44:22.090
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't care,</v>

3324
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:25.840
<v Speaker 3>but I think the contribution of the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make people recognize</v>

3325
02:44:27.870 --> 02:44:30.790
<v Speaker 3>dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege of all kinds,</v>

3326
02:44:31.390 --> 02:44:33.670
<v Speaker 3>that's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually useful to think about</v>

3327
02:44:33.671 --> 02:44:36.850
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is not useful is to say because you</v>

3328
02:44:36.851 --> 02:44:37.391
<v Speaker 3>were x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>y,</v>

3329
02:44:37.391 --> 02:44:40.450
<v Speaker 3>or z thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore you're out.</v>

3330
02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore you have no stake and</v>

3331
02:44:43.001 --> 02:44:46.570
<v Speaker 3>therefore in fact you have sort of less</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a claim on truth and morality.</v>

3332
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:51.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're aware of what happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently with the woman from cnn who was</v>

3333
02:44:51.491 --> 02:44:52.240
<v Speaker 3>on patriot</v>

3334
02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:55.830
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was amazing.</v>

3335
02:44:55.870 --> 02:44:59.400
<v Speaker 1>She accused an african american</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman who she didn't do her</v>

3336
02:44:59.410 --> 02:45:03.580
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She instead of arguing the idea or</v>

3337
02:45:03.610 --> 02:45:07.780
<v Speaker 1>discussing these ideas and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of your white privilege,</v>

3338
02:45:07.781 --> 02:45:10.360
<v Speaker 1>it's blinding you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

3339
02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:11.530
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3340
02:45:11.530 --> 02:45:13.750
<v Speaker 1>he gave her rope to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3341
02:45:13.751 --> 02:45:18.400
<v Speaker 1>to me like as a person does jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lIke gave her a room.</v>

3342
02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:21.310
<v Speaker 1>He gave her room and she went right into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the choke.</v>

3343
02:45:21.311 --> 02:45:24.700
<v Speaker 1>she has sank the choke in herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She explained it even further and he</v>

3344
02:45:24.701 --> 02:45:25.870
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to break it to you,</v>

3345
02:45:25.871 --> 02:45:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but I'm black and she must have just</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt her whole life.</v>

3346
02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:35.340
<v Speaker 1>All of our Intellectual credibility just</v>
<v Speaker 1>go fucking blush flushed down the toilet</v>

3347
02:45:35.681 --> 02:45:36.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3348
02:45:36.851 --> 02:45:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you just got exposed and this is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people love about preposterous thinking.</v>

3349
02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:44.740
<v Speaker 1>It's preposterous thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's given enough time,</v>

3350
02:45:45.010 --> 02:45:47.620
<v Speaker 1>it's eventually gonna slam into a wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we saw.</v>

3351
02:45:47.621 --> 02:45:50.950
<v Speaker 1>We saw a truck with a fucking brick on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accelerator,</v>

3352
02:45:51.130 --> 02:45:55.840
<v Speaker 1>just slammed right into the wall because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thought she had a path that you</v>

3353
02:45:55.841 --> 02:45:59.710
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stop and this is the path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're playing chess,</v>

3354
02:45:59.830 --> 02:46:03.280
<v Speaker 1>but you have one super powerful move</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it works.</v>

3355
02:46:03.310 --> 02:46:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a rook or a queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3356
02:46:05.291 --> 02:46:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it has no rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just king.</v>

3357
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what she did.</v>

3358
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had this super</v>

3359
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:14.870
<v Speaker 3>powerful thing and it didn't work and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't work because this guy was a part</v>

3360
02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:20.020
<v Speaker 3>of the protected class that she was part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of and she tried her thinking of just</v>

3361
02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:24.140
<v Speaker 3>like shortcuts to dismissing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one else could pull that off</v>

3362
02:46:24.141 --> 02:46:26.750
<v Speaker 3>except a black man or black woman if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3363
02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:31.390
<v Speaker 3>because of who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had the checkmate and he's like,</v>

3364
02:46:31.391 --> 02:46:34.190
<v Speaker 3>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the whole world went,</v>

3365
02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:36.440
<v Speaker 3>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we've all seen that,</v>

3366
02:46:36.441 --> 02:46:38.780
<v Speaker 3>but it you can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I.</v>

3367
02:46:38.781 --> 02:46:41.120
<v Speaker 3>If I was having this discussion with her</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she said,</v>

3368
02:46:41.121 --> 02:46:42.740
<v Speaker 3>because of your white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to say,</v>

3369
02:46:42.741 --> 02:46:43.574
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3370
02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:47.450
<v Speaker 3>let's go through the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's unpack that.</v>

3371
02:46:47.451 --> 02:46:50.750
<v Speaker 3>A fucking hate that word unpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate it because it's always brought.</v>

3372
02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:54.200
<v Speaker 3>It's always brought out by people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>really aren't on packing shit.</v>

3373
02:46:54.350 --> 02:46:59.350
<v Speaker 3>They're just explaining to you how their</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology trumps your ideology and it's</v>

3374
02:46:59.481 --> 02:47:03.260
<v Speaker 3>almost always like this preposterous way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of describing things.</v>

3375
02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:05.870
<v Speaker 3>Let me unpack that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck you.</v>

3376
02:47:06.350 --> 02:47:09.940
<v Speaker 3>But</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have to.</v>

3377
02:47:10.010 --> 02:47:11.150
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3378
02:47:11.151 --> 02:47:13.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was the ultimate unpacking.</v>

3379
02:47:13.310 --> 02:47:15.650
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whether he's right or she's right.</v>

3380
02:47:15.651 --> 02:47:18.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like the those words white</v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged.</v>

3381
02:47:18.730 --> 02:47:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3382
02:47:20.010 --> 02:47:22.820
<v Speaker 3>That creates so many fucking headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>

3383
02:47:22.821 --> 02:47:24.390
<v Speaker 3>but you think it's real though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3384
02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:25.670
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

3385
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:29.330
<v Speaker 3>It's real because it's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't target me the way they would</v>

3386
02:47:29.331 --> 02:47:31.430
<v Speaker 3>target a black person that's 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

3387
02:47:31.490 --> 02:47:36.490
<v Speaker 3>It gets used in this sloppy way and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets used to dismiss people and I don't</v>

3388
02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:39.930
<v Speaker 3>think that's useful in the real problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not white privilege.</v>

3389
02:47:39.931 --> 02:47:42.410
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actual racists.</v>

3390
02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:45.020
<v Speaker 3>That's the real problem and if there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>no racist,</v>

3391
02:47:45.050 --> 02:47:46.610
<v Speaker 3>that white privilege wouldn't be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3392
02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:51.350
<v Speaker 3>It's only a thing because of racists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only a thing with racists without</v>

3393
02:47:51.351 --> 02:47:51.820
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

3394
02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:55.490
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with african americans or</v>

3395
02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:59.180
<v Speaker 3>asians or asians as the real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is a weird one,</v>

3396
02:47:59.181 --> 02:48:02.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the harvard thing where asians are</v>

3397
02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:07.810
<v Speaker 3>denied entry into harvard with the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>standards that white people have,</v>

3398
02:48:08.601 --> 02:48:13.601
<v Speaker 3>like if because of racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're good because they study</v>

3399
02:48:14.001 --> 02:48:17.030
<v Speaker 3>so hard and they do too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at that law suit in the</v>

3400
02:48:17.031 --> 02:48:22.031
<v Speaker 3>language that the school use to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>describe them as antisocial and robotic</v>

3401
02:48:22.731 --> 02:48:25.050
<v Speaker 3>and all of these stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So awful.</v>

3402
02:48:25.130 --> 02:48:26.780
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>

3403
02:48:26.781 --> 02:48:30.410
<v Speaker 3>You should read wesley yang on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a really interesting writer about</v>

3404
02:48:30.411 --> 02:48:33.170
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're saying you should have in mind,</v>

3405
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:35.630
<v Speaker 3>I would love to book a book of essays</v>
<v Speaker 3>called.</v>

3406
02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I think it's actually called the souls</v>
<v Speaker 3>of yellow folk this year.</v>

3407
02:48:40.980 --> 02:48:44.630
<v Speaker 3>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to teach taekwondo for a living</v>

3408
02:48:44.690 --> 02:48:47.280
<v Speaker 3>and it was around a lot of korean people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3409
02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:50.510
<v Speaker 3>one when I learned taekwondo from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>korean man,</v>

3410
02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:53.570
<v Speaker 3>when I learned and I was around so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>korean people,</v>

3411
02:48:53.571 --> 02:48:58.030
<v Speaker 3>I was stunned by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the work ethic that exists in these,</v>

3412
02:48:58.050 --> 02:49:02.130
<v Speaker 3>these families and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the humbleness and the,</v>

3413
02:49:03.430 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it was almost expected</v>

3414
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:12.030
<v Speaker 1>that you never brag and that you work</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder than anybody.</v>

3415
02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And I had a friend who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on the u,</v>

3416
02:49:14.811 --> 02:49:18.210
<v Speaker 1>s taekwondo team to compete in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>olympic games.</v>

3417
02:49:18.390 --> 02:49:23.390
<v Speaker 1>He was working on his school work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going through his residency,</v>

3418
02:49:24.481 --> 02:49:29.340
<v Speaker 1>so he's probably working on schoolwork</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 to 12 hours a day in between classes.</v>

3419
02:49:29.341 --> 02:49:32.690
<v Speaker 1>He would put his book bag on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would fill his book bag up with with</v>

3420
02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:36.300
<v Speaker 1>books and run the stairs at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university up and down.</v>

3421
02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:39.660
<v Speaker 1>And then he would come to the gym at</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and train and then he would travel</v>

3422
02:49:40.230 --> 02:49:42.630
<v Speaker 1>to compete with the world team and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

3423
02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:44.370
<v Speaker 1>All the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile he was in his college.</v>

3424
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:46.740
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to medical school.</v>

3425
02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:51.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had bags under his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could stuff christmas trees.</v>

3426
02:49:51.061 --> 02:49:53.490
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was always tired,</v>

3427
02:49:53.790 --> 02:49:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but the work ethic that he had was just.</v>

3428
02:49:56.310 --> 02:49:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have one 10th of that worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>work ethic.</v>

3429
02:49:59.610 --> 02:50:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was impossible to ignore and he was</v>

3430
02:50:02.791 --> 02:50:06.480
<v Speaker 1>so spread then and so tired all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3431
02:50:06.510 --> 02:50:09.360
<v Speaker 1>But he kept working and he would talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about his culture and he would talk</v>

3432
02:50:09.361 --> 02:50:11.610
<v Speaker 1>about his family and what is expected of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3433
02:50:12.210 --> 02:50:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man in my house like that.</v>

3434
02:50:13.921 --> 02:50:15.410
<v Speaker 1>You just fucking did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't.</v>

3435
02:50:15.470 --> 02:50:16.920
<v Speaker 1>You're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not like,</v>

3436
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:17.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel tired today.</v>

3437
02:50:17.911 --> 02:50:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get up,</v>

3438
02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:22.800
<v Speaker 1>go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that attitude has allowed so many</v>

3439
02:50:22.801 --> 02:50:25.770
<v Speaker 1>asian people that discipline and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3440
02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:30.840
<v Speaker 1>and just this culture of performance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of achievement where it's so,</v>

3441
02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:36.250
<v Speaker 1>it's so cherished that is allowed so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many asian people to excel in,</v>

3442
02:50:36.270 --> 02:50:40.080
<v Speaker 1>in academia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that harvard somehow or</v>

3443
02:50:40.081 --> 02:50:41.700
<v Speaker 1>another steps in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warm,</v>

3444
02:50:41.701 --> 02:50:42.301
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>

3445
02:50:42.301 --> 02:50:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Make it more difficult for you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work so hard.</v>

3446
02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:49.550
<v Speaker 1>that is so crazy and so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that they as this.</v>

3447
02:50:51.210 --> 02:50:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about,</v>

3448
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:56.000
<v Speaker 1>if you think about institutions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher learning,</v>

3449
02:50:56.090 --> 02:50:58.820
<v Speaker 1>harvard is the first one you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this number one,</v>

3450
02:50:59.130 --> 02:51:01.140
<v Speaker 1>it's number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call he graduated from harvard.</v>

3451
02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dun dun,</v>

3452
02:51:02.810 --> 02:51:03.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard.</v>

3453
02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:08.060
<v Speaker 1>And to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have them so blinded,</v>

3454
02:51:08.680 --> 02:51:11.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that they will be racist</v>

3455
02:51:11.511 --> 02:51:14.420
<v Speaker 1>against the best performance because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're performing too well and there's</v>

3456
02:51:14.421 --> 02:51:16.850
<v Speaker 1>a disproportionate number of them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

3457
02:51:16.910 --> 02:51:19.310
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna make it harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to raise your standards.</v>

3458
02:51:19.430 --> 02:51:21.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that the actual,</v>

3459
02:51:21.500 --> 02:51:25.620
<v Speaker 4>like the stereotypes and the way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sort of fucking crazy.</v>

3460
02:51:25.621 --> 02:51:26.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3461
02:51:26.091 --> 02:51:27.320
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had them on.</v>

3462
02:51:27.470 --> 02:51:29.180
<v Speaker 4>I would love to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's he out of?</v>

3463
02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Montreal?</v>

3464
02:51:31.100 --> 02:51:33.390

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3465
02:51:33.450 --> 02:51:36.330
<v Speaker 4>I've actually never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think if I've ever met</v>

3466
02:51:36.331 --> 02:51:37.230
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never met him,</v>

3467
02:51:37.231 --> 02:51:39.900
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an interesting writer and he'd be</v>

3468
02:51:39.901 --> 02:51:40.920
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good on this.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Especially because I'm fading.</v>

3470
02:51:43.670 --> 02:51:44.491
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
