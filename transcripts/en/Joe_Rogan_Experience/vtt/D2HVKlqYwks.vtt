<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where are you staying now?</v>

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

21
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

22
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought my way back and just recently</v>

23
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 2>this June,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 2>had another set bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had no other major setback and a heart</v>

25
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 2>attack out of the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought I was a gun,</v>

26
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

27
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

28
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you had a heart attack.</v>

29
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>They fixed your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put in an artificial valve and then</v>

30
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>what happened with the second?</v>

31
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 2>then that lasted for 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had oh five,</v>

33
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I had the surgery to open heart surgery</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually passed away or flatline three</v>

34
00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 2>times during that surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this past June I did the blue.</v>

35
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's not really out of the blue on</v>

36
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of had a few signs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought I,</v>

37
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was that serious.</v>

38
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had another heart attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the counter at home and uh,</v>

39
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was gone for sure man.</v>

40
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's confusing to a lot of people is</v>

41
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously this like intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy guy and you're,</v>

42
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>you're fit and you're lifting weights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking jacked.</v>

43
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Like is it a condition that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>born with a genetic condition?</v>

44
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most definitely hereditary.</v>

45
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 2>My mother and all nine of her siblings</v>
<v Speaker 2>all passed away from heart related</v>

46
00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 2>problems and my mom had the chf lungs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

47
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 2>so many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have pastor 72 are,</v>

48
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 2>my mom died at 63 they all passed away</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I will do now I'm 58.</v>

49
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And so you've gotten through two of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far?</v>

50
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So far.</v>

51
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 2>And what did they do after the second</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attack?</v>

52
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

53
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.620
<v Speaker 2>they the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next thing I had a pacemaker</v>

54
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 2>installed in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the already had metal valve and I</v>

55
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 2>think they'd done just about all we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this or this one.</v>

56
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I got you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they tell him next step is a</v>

57
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:34.234
<v Speaker 2>transplant</v>

58
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>

59
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what,</v>

60
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not so intense for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a,</v>

62
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 2>had bandage to somebody else who might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be getting the news.</v>

64
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the advantage is I've been through</v>

65
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:57.020
<v Speaker 2>so much already man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until,</v>

66
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

67
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 2>and when you three times it ain't too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much else.</v>

68
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Can you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw you for too many loops.</v>

69
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.750
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of faith now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

70
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you in line for transplant now?</v>

71
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Is that how that works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

72
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 2>well it's a really long process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

73
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 2>and get on the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going,</v>

74
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through that process.</v>

75
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.031
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

76
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost through lean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's a really long process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they presented my case to the doctors</v>

78
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 2>who perform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asks for a transplant and they said that</v>

79
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good candidate and everything's</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at right now,</v>

80
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.290
<v Speaker 2>except I may have a little throwback or</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a a cancer biopsy yesterday and if</v>

81
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 2>that's positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's going to hold me up a little</v>

82
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 2>bit for heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

83
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

84
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

85
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 1>it's just crazy because when you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy like you and you know,</v>

86
00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

87
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>especially in you and your prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think there's,</v>

88
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:53.610
<v Speaker 1>nothing's going to stop this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

89
00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

90
00:03:56.911 --> 00:04:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I feel like your muscles are strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your heart's a muscle shit.</v>

91
00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>His heart's got to be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was indestructible.</v>

93
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously I was wrong.</v>

94
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pretty much,</v>

95
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

96
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>but you pretty much became famous from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet right now.</v>

97
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Definitely launched it right there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

100
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:22.350
<v Speaker 1>53 years or when I was world champion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew what gave a fuck about who</v>

101
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>pretty much when I found out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

102
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:26.820
<v Speaker 1>when you first started making youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

103
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 1>that's when I found out about yet I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think someone on twitter sat me,</v>

104

<v Speaker 1>and send it to other people.</v>

108
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And someone sent me some,</v>

<v Speaker 1>UFC welterweight champion.</v>

111
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.080

<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

120
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.330
<v Speaker 1>your light is killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

121
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Keeps lighting your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to talk about it and got to</v>

122
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:17.810
<v Speaker 1>talk about thought that we were really</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset at each other.</v>

123
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the debate was,</v>

124
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:25.401
<v Speaker 1>and this is a constant debate in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether big muscles in enhance you or</v>

125
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:26.130
<v Speaker 1>hurt you.</v>

126
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my take on it is they do both.</v>

127
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.100
<v Speaker 1>My take on it is the bigger the muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more power you have.</v>

128
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:35.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think tyron is a perfect example</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a guy who's figured out how to use</v>

129
00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:38.250
<v Speaker 1>them perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what he does is he conserves as</v>

130
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:40.710
<v Speaker 1>energy and when he sprints you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop him.</v>

131
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.790
<v Speaker 1>So like when he's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the cage and he has these moments of</v>

132
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of horsepower that he can</v>

133
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:51.120
<v Speaker 1>generate in a short period of time is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just above and beyond everybody else in</v>

134
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 1>the division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a terrifying thing for</v>

135
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:56.970
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he can't operate at the same pace</v>

136
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of the guys can't.</v>

137
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Some of the guys who have less muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cane around less mass,</v>

138
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>they have a less oxygen requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can go longer,</v>

139
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>but they just can't generate the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of power.</v>

140
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.170
<v Speaker 1>But what tyrons figured out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty brilliantly is how to conserve</v>

141
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:16.300
<v Speaker 1>his energy into these bursts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

142
00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>and then now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his big criticism earlier in his</v>

143
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>career was that he would gas out as he</v>
<v Speaker 1>got into the later rounds,</v>

144
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>but now he's able to fight five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

145
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>He just fights it at his pace.</v>

146
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not exactly,</v>

147
00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I want to start it with this two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

148
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

149
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.400
<v Speaker 2>for all the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the people said that I would never</v>

150
00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:40.950
<v Speaker 2>be able to sit down across the table</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Joe Rogan.</v>

151
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I want to take a special moment to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck Yo.</v>

152
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Right man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

153
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm here and I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I attacked Joe Rogan on the Internet.</v>

154
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.270
<v Speaker 2>I attacked him and I want to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the opportunity to explain to you,</v>

155
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did attack Joe Rogan and I want,</v>

156
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.610
<v Speaker 2>I have the opportunity to explain to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>why exactly I did that.</v>

157
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want to do that because I don't</v>

158
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.750
<v Speaker 2>want you to think I'm just an asshole.</v>

159
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think you were an asshole at</v>

160
00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:12.400
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't bother me at all.</v>

161
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

162
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't change my feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never attacked you back.</v>

163
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she,</v>

164
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 2>you should did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what you did do too,</v>

165
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 2>but then I couldn't get you to do before</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

166
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.930
<v Speaker 2>you've actually talked to me and tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to me.</v>

167
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to talk to you though that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had people,</v>

168
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm really cool with a lot of UFC</v>

170
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 2>fighters and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

171
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he even knows him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they had people that was especially</v>

172
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 2>set out to keep tagging you until you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were going to get you on the podcast.</v>

173
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 2>So he knows that that shit does not</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

174
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to get on the podcast is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a bunch of people that,</v>

175
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.570

<v Speaker 1>people don't use their account to tweet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Maybe they just check twitter.</v>

236
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I can keep up with all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

237
00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:59.830
<v Speaker 1>So people that try to talk to me and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahold of me,</v>

238
00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:02.680
<v Speaker 1>if you think I'm ignoring you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just I'm ignoring everything.</v>

239
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well man,</v>

240
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel so bad</v>

241
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.790
<v Speaker 2>that was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to kick to or tend to,</v>

242
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to get that.</v>

243
00:10:11.801 --> 00:10:14.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I came out with the attack</v>

244
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

245
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.600
<v Speaker 2>well it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

246
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least you got,</v>

247
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to be nice for as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask.</v>

248
00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:23.210
<v Speaker 2>So then he responded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

249
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.230
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

250
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.360
<v Speaker 2>okay Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>

251
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I jumped over you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I seen the jumped on you like that.</v>

252
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.620
<v Speaker 2>But we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

253
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.980
<v Speaker 2>we do possess a little difference of</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion on the muscle guy.</v>

254
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You deal.</v>

255
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:38.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me what you think.</v>

256
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

257
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to explain that y'all never</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

258
00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:47.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to have known guys like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are naturally,</v>

259
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.910
<v Speaker 2>naturally just more muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

260
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.500
<v Speaker 2>More built and they look like they lift</v>
<v Speaker 2>weights and work out,</v>

261
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.050
<v Speaker 2>but they don't write guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

262
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.640
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Herschel Walker.</v>

264
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outstanding Athlete,</v>

265
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

266
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 2>both Jackson for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

267
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.620
<v Speaker 2>fantastic athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscular,</v>

268
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.360
<v Speaker 2>very Muslim guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you were born,</v>

269
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.800
<v Speaker 2>born muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference in the guy that</v>

270
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:21.110
<v Speaker 2>goes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim and works out three,</v>

271
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.580
<v Speaker 2>four hours a day and adds muscle on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started out,</v>

272
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal guy.</v>

273
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:28.790
<v Speaker 2>But if you were born with that muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you were born with the</v>

274
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 2>cardiovascular system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lungs and what not to support that</v>

275
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:34.580
<v Speaker 2>muscle and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

276
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.490
<v Speaker 2>take it way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back to guys like Jim Thorpe.</v>

277
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

278
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.310
<v Speaker 2>head and shoulders above all the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes of his error because he was</v>

279
00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:45.620
<v Speaker 2>born that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was born.</v>

280
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:49.730
<v Speaker 2>The good Lord gives us the cardio system</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the lungs and everything to,</v>

281
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.713
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:55.810
<v Speaker 2>to go along with that extra they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were born with in some cases,</v>

283
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 2>in some cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

284
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.820
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were making a blanket</v>
<v Speaker 2>statement and it covered a lot of,</v>

285
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the all muscular guys aren't going to</v>

286
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.940
<v Speaker 2>tire out because of the extra muscle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagreed because I think if they were</v>

287
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 2>born with that muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they were born with the support</v>

288
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 2>system to support it.</v>

289
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Demos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of logic to that.</v>

290
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that if you have a</v>

291
00:12:18.961 --> 00:12:23.070
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's just no way you are going</v>

292
00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:24.870
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have the same</v>

293
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:27.810
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular capabilities as someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been like a marathon runner.</v>

294
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marathon runner has.</v>

295
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.450
<v Speaker 1>There's advantages and disadvantages I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think to all sorts of body types,</v>

296
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a big advantage to be in</v>

297
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:39.030
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary look at you look at a guy like</v>

298
00:12:39.031 --> 00:12:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Woodley and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

299
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know you can't stop him like</v>

300
00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:43.980
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's going to stop him</v>

301
00:12:43.981 --> 00:12:46.410
<v Speaker 1>as him getting tired or you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch him when he's coming in.</v>

302
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just faster than you.</v>

303
00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Stronger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

304
00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:50.520
<v Speaker 1>there's benefits to that.</v>

305
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.670
<v Speaker 1>But I think that when it comes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

306
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you never going to see a marathon runner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's built like Woodley.</v>

307
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.210
<v Speaker 1>They just don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though he has the,</v>

308
00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:03.690
<v Speaker 1>the cardiovascular system and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>support system that's designed for that</v>

309
00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:07.260
<v Speaker 1>build that he's born with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he still is never going to be able to</v>

310
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:11.610
<v Speaker 1>compete with like an elite triathlete</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your body has to be smaller.</v>

311
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.130
<v Speaker 1>You have to have less oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 1>requirements,</v>

312
00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:16.530
<v Speaker 1>less weight that you're carrying around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no,</v>

313
00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:18.580
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's benefits there.</v>

314
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real,</v>

315
00:13:19.891 --> 00:13:23.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a real like balancing act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at mma because you have to have</v>

316
00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:25.560
<v Speaker 1>some muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to get guys off you,</v>

317
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.210
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to get up from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

318
00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:30.210
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to explode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to close the</v>

319
00:13:30.211 --> 00:13:32.460
<v Speaker 1>distance quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like real benefits to</v>

320
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:34.080
<v Speaker 1>being powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's,</v>

321
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

322
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

323
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a balancing act,</v>

324
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:38.401
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

325
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.330
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>

326
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

327
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

328
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.940
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just muscle,</v>

329
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see,</v>

330
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon runners did or you know,</v>

331
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.250
<v Speaker 2>250 pounds either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be fat,</v>

332
00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.080
<v Speaker 2>smooth butterball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

333
00:13:57.081 --> 00:13:58.100
<v Speaker 2>and still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.503
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

335
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not because of the muscular</v>
<v Speaker 2>musculature that they,</v>

336
00:14:03.111 --> 00:14:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just bigger guy period would have a hard</v>

337
00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:09.770
<v Speaker 2>time being a marathon runner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the musculature,</v>

338
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.020
<v Speaker 2>that's where we have a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the,</v>

339
00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:15.450
<v Speaker 2>the muscle trip because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>musculature,</v>

340
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.390
<v Speaker 2>if you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're just born more muscular,</v>

341
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.020
<v Speaker 2>and if you can look at little kids in</v>
<v Speaker 2>grade school and you see some of the</v>

342
00:14:24.021 --> 00:14:27.710
<v Speaker 2>kids are going to have a six pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to just be built better</v>

343
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.470
<v Speaker 2>than the other kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

344
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.910
<v Speaker 2>and if fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're at that muscle,</v>

345
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.220
<v Speaker 2>you were born with that muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

346
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

347
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.050
<v Speaker 2>if you were born with that muscle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that musculature,</v>

348
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

349
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.110
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be detrimental in your</v>

350
00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:44.090
<v Speaker 2>system is made for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.440
<v Speaker 2>it's good little major system able to in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit.</v>

352
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.210
<v Speaker 2>But you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't see,</v>

353
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.073
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

354
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 2>anybody built like turn rhyme wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be running in the New York marathon or</v>

355
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 2>winning the New York marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could run it.</v>

356
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 2>But he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you read that Oprah and me</v>

357
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.350

<v Speaker 2>pretty fucking impressive to beat me.</v>

358
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that uh,</v>

359
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a bigger person period is</v>

360
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.310

<v Speaker 2>definition that musculature,</v>

361
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.420

<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't lift weights.</v>

367
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.950

<v Speaker 2>You're proving my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

369
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.870

<v Speaker 2>If you were born that way,</v>

370
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 2>you didn't go in the gym and lift</v>
<v Speaker 2>weights.</v>

371

<v Speaker 2>I don't lift weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it proved my point,</v>

372

<v Speaker 2>the gym and pumping iron and get good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You born that way and so,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well he was born that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but boss also does a tremendous amount</v>

377

<v Speaker 1>It's ferocious and everything he does,</v>

381
00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:11.880
<v Speaker 1>he does like with a thousand percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>

382
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.270
<v Speaker 1>So you know his workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he would tell me that the way he</v>

383
00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:18.840
<v Speaker 1>would work out was when he would prepare</v>
<v Speaker 1>for five minute round.</v>

384
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:24.030
<v Speaker 1>When he would start to get in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would go as hard as he could for like</v>

385
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.990
<v Speaker 1>a minute and then like be exhausted and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he will work himself up to a minute</v>

386
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.400
<v Speaker 1>and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then worked himself up to two minutes</v>

387
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.590
<v Speaker 1>and then by the end of his training</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>

388
00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:33.510
<v Speaker 1>he'd go five minutes full clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

389
00:16:33.511 --> 00:16:37.030
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Method can work.</v>

390
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 1>But in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.990
<v Speaker 1>against that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his boss,</v>

392
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:45.000
<v Speaker 1>his body started to deteriorate because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so God damn tough.</v>

393
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Like he has no cartilage in his knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His knees are completely shot.</v>

394
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.880
<v Speaker 1>He kept shooting cortisone and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his joints.</v>

395
00:16:50.881 --> 00:16:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Like whenever you'd have injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

396
00:16:52.201 --> 00:16:54.810
<v Speaker 1>joints are all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has got tendinitis everywhere.</v>

397
00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just his mind was too strong for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the vehicle that it was carrying</v>

398
00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:00.984
<v Speaker 1>his mind around.</v>

399
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

400
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.193
<v Speaker 2>Roche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dude,</v>

401
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 2>this dude one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.230
<v Speaker 2>The basketball time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

403
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.730
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about Matt Hughes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

404
00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:11.080
<v Speaker 2>I love Matt Hughes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

405
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.160
<v Speaker 2>How's he built like a tank if you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen them.</v>

406
00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:14.994
<v Speaker 2>Gas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

407
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Well now no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know Matt Hughes in his day.</v>

408
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Let me see how to put this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

409
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.700
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not built like a tank.</v>

410
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe the way Woodley's belt is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

411
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more slight than Woodley</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still pretty God damn thick.</v>

412
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also like what he was able to do too</v>

413
00:17:34.391 --> 00:17:37.450
<v Speaker 1>was he was such a good wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was able to dictate where the fight</v>

414
00:17:37.451 --> 00:17:40.240
<v Speaker 1>takes place and a good wrestler can</v>
<v Speaker 1>control situations,</v>

415
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.640
<v Speaker 1>take guys down and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.740
<v Speaker 1>once you're on top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you get a break,</v>

417
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

418
00:17:45.371 --> 00:17:46.680
<v Speaker 1>you could rest and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.700
<v Speaker 1>he would use his ground and pound and</v>
<v Speaker 1>submit.</v>

420
00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Guys was one of the first guys ever too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a high level wrestler that</v>

421
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:53.910
<v Speaker 1>started submitting dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

422
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.013
<v Speaker 1>Submitted George.</v>

423
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

424
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Good friend of mine also built really</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

425
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Like a brick shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one and a cardio is pretty damn</v>

426
00:18:05.081 --> 00:18:06.620
<v Speaker 2>good and I'm bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

427
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.170
<v Speaker 2>You make you make it my point</v>

428
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.990
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think there's a,</v>

429
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.490
<v Speaker 1>there's requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

430
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can get into a physical shape</v>

431
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.350
<v Speaker 1>where you can use those muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

432
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.090
<v Speaker 1>the way you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what you need to do inside</v>

433
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

434
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.250
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously a great benefit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>being Moscow.</v>

435
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

436
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

437
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 2>guys there were naturally born like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say,</v>

438
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I think Saint Pierre and he was both or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

439
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:37.430
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a matter foreign boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I think those guys were born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

441
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

442
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.570
<v Speaker 2>And if you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're born like that,</v>

443
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.780
<v Speaker 2>then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

444
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 2>but the guys are going to gym and put on</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>

445
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.860
<v Speaker 2>They act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the muscles are what they call bill.</v>

446
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.290
<v Speaker 2>I can't build muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

447
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.420
<v Speaker 1>small hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smaller frame.</v>

448
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one he got that built muscle that</v>

449
00:18:58.751 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 2>built muscle tires out real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

450
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:05.020
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with you 100% on a guy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has built most,</v>

451
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.920
<v Speaker 2>so they went into the gym comp time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>guidance muscles that way.</v>

452
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you 100% joey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolute correct.</v>

453
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.680
<v Speaker 2>He's going to tire out those added on</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles,</v>

454
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.830
<v Speaker 2>oxygen's going to suck the winner and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be tired as fucking no</v>

455
00:19:17.831 --> 00:19:18.664
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

456
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were of Francis and Ghana.</v>

457
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting this weekend and Francis</v>

458
00:19:23.481 --> 00:19:28.481
<v Speaker 1>and got just broke the world record for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most power ever shown in a punch.</v>

459
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.340
<v Speaker 1>They have this machine that they use</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide.</v>

460
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a widely accepted that there's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ways to measure a punch.</v>

461
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this large pad and you hit it with</v>

462
00:19:39.231 --> 00:19:44.210
<v Speaker 1>full power and it generates and Frances</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who beat the second place by some,</v>

463
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:46.040
<v Speaker 1>some insane amount of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

464
00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:49.070
<v Speaker 1>he's a ridiculously powerful dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

465
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.690
<v Speaker 1>he scares the shit out of everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

466
00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:52.400
<v Speaker 1>He is ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

467
00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:54.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they show show this is this thing.</v>

468
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It shows what the original world record</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

469
00:19:58.941 --> 00:20:01.820
<v Speaker 1>And then in Gando broke it by like 3000</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

470
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.260
<v Speaker 1>He's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's terrifying.</v>

471
00:20:06.261 --> 00:20:07.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found this dude,</v>

472
00:20:07.221 --> 00:20:09.950
<v Speaker 1>he was a homeless guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he was home,</v>

473
00:20:09.951 --> 00:20:12.290
<v Speaker 1>he was homeless living in France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

474
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.910
<v Speaker 1>he made his way into a gym and I believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to box and when they brought</v>

475
00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:21.770
<v Speaker 1>him in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I guess is see 129,000,</v>

476
00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:25.520
<v Speaker 1>161 units.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The previous one was 114,000.</v>

477
00:20:25.521 --> 00:20:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Like what tyrone spot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's a beast.</v>

478
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.050
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so frances and Gannon,</v>

479
00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:35.300
<v Speaker 1>who's fighting this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is fighting?</v>

480
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Alistair overeem is another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fantastic,</v>

481
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.890
<v Speaker 2>funny predicts chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same Dick Chaos.</v>

482
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Good for dig suit right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

483
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

484
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking,</v>

485
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this on my a Lma</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast that Alistair's been stopped I</v>

486
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 1>think in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA.</v>

487
00:20:55.871 --> 00:21:00.871
<v Speaker 1>He's been stopped at least 11 times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's been stopped three or four</v>

488
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:06.541
<v Speaker 1>times in kickboxing as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like 14 Kaos plus knocked out in</v>

489
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:08.680
<v Speaker 1>his career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either Tko or knocked out.</v>

490
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy that's got to be worried</v>

491
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 1>about getting hit by the guy who got the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world record punch.</v>

492
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

493
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a youth and exuberance</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus the experience craftiness.</v>

494
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

495
00:21:20.091 --> 00:21:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's going to be.</v>

496
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Consequences of allister getting hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>though are so brave and Ghana was so</v>

497
00:21:27.921 --> 00:21:28.550
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

498
00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

499
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It's you thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

500
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be able to use,</v>

501
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.010
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

502
00:21:35.011 --> 00:21:35.850
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>

503
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Ghana was supposed to fight junior dos</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santos at one point,</v>

504
00:21:38.551 --> 00:21:41.790
<v Speaker 1>which was also really interesting fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the Alistair overeem fight</v>

505
00:21:41.791 --> 00:21:44.850
<v Speaker 1>is more dangerous for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it's going to let everybody</v>

506
00:21:44.851 --> 00:21:47.940
<v Speaker 1>know because Alistair's at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heap and the heavyweight division</v>

507
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.140
<v Speaker 1>right in Ghana can get by ouster most</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely he'll get a shot at the title</v>

508
00:21:52.141 --> 00:21:52.790
<v Speaker 1>very soon.</v>

509
00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think his ground game?</v>

510
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know too much about it.</v>

511
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Speaker 1>He submitted one guy in the octagon and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.320
<v Speaker 1>we know that he does have submission</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>

513
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.530
<v Speaker 1>He was one fight by submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Anthony Hamilton.</v>

514
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

515
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's for first of all,</v>

516
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:12.010
<v Speaker 1>every fight starts standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

517
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get through hell to get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy to the gown,</v>

518
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.340
<v Speaker 1>good luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 1>and he's been taken down before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>survived and came back to knock the guy</v>

520
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:19.624
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

521
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.140
<v Speaker 1>and he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 1>still learning and growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

523
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 1>he just started really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pretty much only been doing it for a</v>

524
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:28.540
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's terrifying.</v>

525
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

526
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:31.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

527
00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you know what I think he represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he represents a real world class</v>

528
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:37.890
<v Speaker 1>athlete that's fighting and mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas like,</v>

529
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe that guy would have gone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>football or somewhere else in another</v>

530
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.730
<v Speaker 1>era for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now that MMA is,</v>

531
00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I said the same thing about</v>

532
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones I think could have done</v>

533
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:52.990
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but John Jones got into mma and you see</v>

534
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:55.260
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you see a real world</v>
<v Speaker 1>class half?</v>

535
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dang,</v>

536
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Dang good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

537
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I like John and I got to meet him a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>times and he told me that he listens to</v>

538
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 2>me before he goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

539
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:07.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:12.271
<v Speaker 2>before it goes out and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was a real honor for him to say</v>

541
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

542
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 2>He likes to say I am the one speech that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did and he always used to say it along</v>

543
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Whitney Cpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were staying in there and gail and in</v>

544
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:26.491
<v Speaker 2>his phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes out and kills people like he</v>

545
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:28.870
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a murderer man.</v>

546
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope he,</v>

547
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I hope he sorts all his problems out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's,</v>

548
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.210
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent positive drug test.</v>

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.320
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see.</v>

550
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.030
<v Speaker 2>It seems like the only guy that can beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones.</v>

551
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones used to say about Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

552
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:45.140
<v Speaker 2>It was true.</v>

630
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.083
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

634
00:27:00.581 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 2>pretty much an asshole because the way I</v>

666
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided,</v>

669
00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:56.790

<v Speaker 2>two months off.</v>

671
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 2>So it took longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do two months,</v>

672
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.130
<v Speaker 2>it'll take two months off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two months on two months.</v>

673
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.790

678
00:29:13.261 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 2>but it took longer than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had two months off in</v>

679
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:17.790
<v Speaker 2>between two months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

680
00:29:17.791 --> 00:29:19.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>w what they don't tell you is when you</v>

683
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 2>stop taking it and shit and we just</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped taking it cold Turkey like that</v>

684
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:35.310
<v Speaker 2>every fucking thing that you gained</v>
<v Speaker 2>during that time.</v>

685
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.640
<v Speaker 2>And I gained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

686
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I was ready for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one like little small,</v>

687
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 2>the Boone County,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I thought I was ready for fucking</v>

688
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Mister America after this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

689
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like Oh fuck I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got so much tighter and I had a</v>

690
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 2>more veins and shit than ever and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

691
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great shit.</v>

692
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 2>But when you get off they see everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you came,</v>

693
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.990
<v Speaker 2>you lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some I lost any strength gains</v>

694
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:06.520
<v Speaker 2>that I might've might've gang got from</v>
<v Speaker 2>it or any,</v>

695
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:07.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the harness at me.</v>

696
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I had to start from lower than where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was before I started taking it.</v>

697
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.290
<v Speaker 1>They say you do gain something and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep something once your body</v>

698
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:21.790
<v Speaker 1>normalizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

699
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:24.790
<v Speaker 1>you do have some sort of gains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the arguments that they</v>

700
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:28.870
<v Speaker 1>say about people that have taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids and gotten off of them,</v>

701
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.210
<v Speaker 1>that if you can normalize your</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>

702
00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 1>you're still gonna have an advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people that have never taken it</v>

703
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:34.174
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

704
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how true that is.</v>

705
00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I felt like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

706
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single thing game than I possibly</v>

707
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

708
00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean I felt like I lost ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

709
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I just stopped cold Turkey and I</v>

710
00:30:51.361 --> 00:30:54.680
<v Speaker 2>think I actually lost Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still supposed to wean yourself off</v>

711
00:30:54.681 --> 00:30:56.270
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

712
00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling me when I roll over,</v>

713
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking 21 years old and I thought</v>

714
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.680
<v Speaker 2>that sex every day was the normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

715
00:31:07.681 --> 00:31:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

716
00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.060
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you get married for sex</v>

717
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:12.901
<v Speaker 2>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

718
00:31:12.901 --> 00:31:14.640
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I don't,</v>

719
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.330
<v Speaker 2>if I can't have sex every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know something's wrong.</v>

720
00:31:18.331 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

721
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

722
00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:22.650
<v Speaker 2>so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my normal normal thing.</v>

723
00:31:22.651 --> 00:31:24.550
<v Speaker 2>And I'm probably pretty sure that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>

724
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:26.310
<v Speaker 2>who at the time probably didn't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

725
00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:28.300
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's probably got tired.</v>

726
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:33.320
<v Speaker 2>We this motherfucker that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had a break when the steroid things,</v>

727
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.970
<v Speaker 2>we got a little break for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

728
00:31:35.971 --> 00:31:37.650
<v Speaker 2>you know who was married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

729
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:38.461
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

730
00:31:38.461 --> 00:31:38.941
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

731
00:31:38.941 --> 00:31:40.730
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's going to fuck with that.</v>

732
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.210
<v Speaker 2>But that's what gets people back on it a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

733
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't get psychologically</v>

734
00:31:45.001 --> 00:31:47.190
<v Speaker 2>addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

735
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

736
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.380
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

737
00:31:49.381 --> 00:31:50.250
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

738
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack and I talked about it,</v>

739
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>

740
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I was interviewed and magazine articles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff a few times when I was world</v>

741
00:32:00.241 --> 00:32:03.270
<v Speaker 2>champion back Lena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought it up in the Arctic cause I</v>

742
00:32:03.271 --> 00:32:05.580
<v Speaker 2>never thought it was anything that high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:32:05.581 --> 00:32:06.690
<v Speaker 2>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

744
00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:07.524
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

745
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish that I had never done it.</v>

746
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.420
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could say now we got it from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the were saying,</v>

747
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I can say I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a perfectly clean record.</v>

748
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my training partner,</v>

749
00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Richard Sherman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were for 20.</v>

750
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:23.100
<v Speaker 2>We've trained together for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy,</v>

751
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.920
<v Speaker 2>perfect record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never even tried it.</v>

752
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was stronger than me.</v>

753
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.520
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mind was stronger than my eye.</v>

754
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Peer pressure and wanting to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazines and wanting to make a living,</v>

755
00:32:34.201 --> 00:32:37.350
<v Speaker 2>doing something that I love is did a</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch in the clock every fucking day.</v>

756
00:32:37.351 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 2>That that appeal too great for me as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>young guy for me to pass it up.</v>

757
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do something that I love and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make money at it way back then.</v>

758
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:50.510
<v Speaker 2>But I wind up working at the Post Office</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 28 years.</v>

759
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:51.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

760
00:32:51.821 --> 00:32:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

761
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.850
<v Speaker 1>it definitely makes sense that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>appeal would be so strong.</v>

762
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.580
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

763
00:32:57.581 --> 00:32:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the big reason why people want to</v>

764
00:32:59.741 --> 00:33:02.350
<v Speaker 1>take it out of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if he ever watched that</v>

765
00:33:02.351 --> 00:33:04.450
<v Speaker 1>documentary that's on Netflix called</v>
<v Speaker 1>ICARUS.</v>

766
00:33:04.451 --> 00:33:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

767
00:33:05.681 --> 00:33:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen incremental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ICARES is all about the Russian,</v>

768
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-doping state sponsored program.</v>

769
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.370
<v Speaker 1>The Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

770
00:33:12.371 --> 00:33:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I should say pro doping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

771
00:33:14.291 --> 00:33:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go ahead early.</v>

772
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Give steroids to every single one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their athletes.</v>

773
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy documentary man because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

774
00:33:21.011 --> 00:33:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Bryan Fogel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the director is also,</v>

775
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.470
<v Speaker 1>he's in it because he was an amateur</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyclist and what he wanted to do as an</v>

776
00:33:26.471 --> 00:33:30.400
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he ran it or he cycled this race one</v>

777
00:33:30.401 --> 00:33:31.780
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally clean,</v>

778
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.590
<v Speaker 1>and then the next year he went to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian doctrine,</v>

779
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.450
<v Speaker 1>said just fucking juice me up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gills.</v>

780
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Like let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just shot him up with</v>

781
00:33:39.941 --> 00:33:42.550
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the process of him getting to</v>

782
00:33:42.551 --> 00:33:47.200
<v Speaker 1>know this doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scandal broke out about the Sochi</v>

783
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Russians cheated during the</v>

784
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Sochi Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all documented in this film as</v>

785
00:33:52.841 --> 00:33:55.540
<v Speaker 1>the news is breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy who's the Russian</v>

786
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:58.690
<v Speaker 1>doctor has to flee Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He leaves his family behind,</v>

787
00:33:58.691 --> 00:34:02.020
<v Speaker 1>they take his family's house and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>take all their money and they're</v>

788
00:34:02.021 --> 00:34:05.170
<v Speaker 1>basically making this family homeless to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get him to come back to Russia.</v>

789
00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.750
<v Speaker 1>He's in protective custody and America</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

790
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.810
<v Speaker 1>And he detailed the entire program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was hot.</v>

791
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was on something.</v>

792
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.220
<v Speaker 1>They want 13 g.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's hilarious?</v>

793
00:34:15.221 --> 00:34:18.550
<v Speaker 1>They just took some of the metals away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the metals they took with the most</v>

794
00:34:18.551 --> 00:34:23.551
<v Speaker 1>bullshit metals like gymnastics who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this one.</v>

795
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Like they took like four bullshit metals</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

796
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.070
<v Speaker 1>but they kept the big real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

797
00:34:30.071 --> 00:34:32.140
<v Speaker 1>They kept wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kept all the big ones.</v>

798
00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 2>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed.</v>

799
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I did see big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong fast.</v>

800
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

801
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.470
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take yeah.</v>

802
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're pro steroids.</v>

803
00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

804
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is interesting.</v>

805
00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pro Steroids and a lot of people are,</v>

806
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>

807
00:34:51.851 --> 00:34:53.560
<v Speaker 1>the argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

808
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:53.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

809
00:34:53.921 --> 00:34:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I see it in the terms of fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

810
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I see the argument against it for fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

811
00:34:59.081 --> 00:35:00.490
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

812
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I also see the argument in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

813
00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:07.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be taken amino acids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and creatine and all these different</v>

814
00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:10.750
<v Speaker 1>things that do give you some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>

815
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.060
<v Speaker 1>why don't I take the shit that gives you</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real benefit?</v>

816
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

817
00:35:14.531 --> 00:35:15.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

818
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

819
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find a fault with people who</v>

820
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:25.630
<v Speaker 2>would be side too to take roids because</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

821
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm 21 year old kid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took,</v>

822
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:34.490
<v Speaker 2>so how the fuck can I talk shit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's,</v>

823
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.970
<v Speaker 2>who decides to make the same decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

824
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 2>that many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I be a hypocrite asshole if I was,</v>

826
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:47.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that as long as everybody in the</v>

827
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 2>competition that you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that competition might be,</v>

828
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 2>if you fucking flipping pies or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

829
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tech and grab whatever fuck it is.</v>

830
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.550
<v Speaker 2>If everybody else is doing it then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's a level playing field that,</v>

831
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.940
<v Speaker 2>but when you got guys that are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>compete naturally,</v>

832
00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.000
<v Speaker 2>right against guys that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes unfair.</v>

833
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

834
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:10.950
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

835
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 2>if they have a division and they do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot in these weight lifting contest</v>

836
00:36:15.181 --> 00:36:17.160
<v Speaker 2>and things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they have divisions that are called</v>

837
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:21.240
<v Speaker 2>natural divisions and they actually test</v>
<v Speaker 2>for steroids and stuff like that.</v>

838
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.980
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they should do something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that for the fighters to,</v>

839
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.610
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ain't going to text you guys if you</v>

840
00:36:26.611 --> 00:36:29.340
<v Speaker 2>want fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just come on in here and whatever you</v>

841
00:36:29.341 --> 00:36:30.174
<v Speaker 2>bring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring,</v>

842
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:31.750
<v Speaker 2>bring what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

843
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.190
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of doing that in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

844
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan has an organization called</v>

845
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:40.510
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] where it's essentially an</v>
<v Speaker 1>offshoot of pride or at least some of</v>

846
00:36:40.511 --> 00:36:42.970
<v Speaker 1>the people are involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It that were involved in pride and</v>

847
00:36:42.971 --> 00:36:45.260
<v Speaker 1>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had ensign anyway on the podcast</v>

848
00:36:45.261 --> 00:36:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about his pride</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

849
00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:49.900
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's specifically stated we will not</v>

850
00:36:49.901 --> 00:36:53.170
<v Speaker 1>test you for steroids in all caps and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

851
00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was it a lot of ways and a lot of</v>

852
00:37:00.371 --> 00:37:03.010
<v Speaker 1>people's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the golden age of MMA.</v>

853
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.770
<v Speaker 1>He's just in terms of just sheer</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

854
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta wonder like all those guys</v>

855
00:37:08.621 --> 00:37:11.290
<v Speaker 1>like fader and Cro cop and all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys in their prime,</v>

856
00:37:11.291 --> 00:37:13.330
<v Speaker 1>like how much shit were they on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were they on things?</v>

857
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to talk about it.</v>

858
00:37:14.861 --> 00:37:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

859
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.490
<v Speaker 2>that's in the Goddamn in the contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just back then,</v>

860
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they</v>

861
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.260
<v Speaker 1>possibly we're for half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

862
00:37:23.261 --> 00:37:25.660
<v Speaker 1>when people want to say it like fate or</v>
<v Speaker 1>who most people think is like the</v>

863
00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:28.480
<v Speaker 1>greatest heavyweight of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least it's an argument,</v>

864
00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:29.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

865
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.790
<v Speaker 1>he was real good friends with Putin who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is at the head of the Russian doping</v>

866
00:37:35.951 --> 00:37:38.920
<v Speaker 1>state sponsored doping program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the odds that they just</v>

867
00:37:38.921 --> 00:37:41.710
<v Speaker 1>let him compete clean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the odds that didn't juice</v>

868
00:37:41.711 --> 00:37:43.810
<v Speaker 1>them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not testing you?</v>

869
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

870
00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

871
00:37:46.811 --> 00:37:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a steroid by it though.</v>

872
00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say that,</v>

873
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:51.970
<v Speaker 1>but in the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sure as fuck did.</v>

874
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.651
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

875
00:37:52.651 --> 00:37:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And you pull up that picture of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a fade or with the kettle bells was a</v>

876
00:37:57.281 --> 00:38:00.970
<v Speaker 1>famous picture of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a big proponent of,</v>

877
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't lift weights per se.</v>

878
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.260
<v Speaker 1>He did like Kettlebell exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are weight,</v>

879
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:06.491
<v Speaker 1>not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:38:06.491 --> 00:38:07.370
<v Speaker 1>bench press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

881
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.790
<v Speaker 1>That kind of shit and curls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of,</v>

882
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pliers and a lot of,</v>

883
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:12.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive,</v>

884
00:38:12.911 --> 00:38:15.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength training exercises and things</v>

885
00:38:15.461 --> 00:38:16.270
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

886
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.400
<v Speaker 1>when you still get this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was pretty fucking jacked</v>

887
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.290
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We definitely knock your fucking head.</v>

888
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an animal.</v>

889
00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Looks like a power with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

890
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.960
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was built and then there's early</v>

891
00:38:25.961 --> 00:38:28.690
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very built and then later in his</v>

892
00:38:28.691 --> 00:38:32.410
<v Speaker 1>career there's was a lot of things going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on later in his career.</v>

893
00:38:32.411 --> 00:38:34.420
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like when he came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

894
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the first he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

895
00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 1>if he was ever on anything before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't on it when he came to America</v>

896
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.690
<v Speaker 1>because it looks like you also stopped</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight training and only concentrated on</v>

897
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:47.440
<v Speaker 1>sports specific exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people disagree with.</v>

898
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Some people say that you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of weight training,</v>

899
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 1>you have to have some sort of strength</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conditioning program.</v>

900
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I W I w you know,</v>

901
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.470
<v Speaker 2>of course I'm from that background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say yes.</v>

902
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with that.</v>

903
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you need both.</v>

904
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you certainly need skill.</v>

905
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in order to really highlight that</v>

906
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 1>skill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have that body up to full</v>

907
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:12.570
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be peaking.</v>

908
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.770
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be ready to rock and roll my</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy man,</v>

909
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Maitri Maitri own mountain or those.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause cause it's fuel.</v>

924
00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who wants to do something in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life has ups and downs and we need</v>

925
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:03.350
<v Speaker 1>fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

926
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got some fuel today.</v>

927
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.650
<v Speaker 1>When you were in front of those kids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compton and you were talking to them</v>

928
00:40:09.651 --> 00:40:13.310
<v Speaker 1>about obsession being a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be great at anything,</v>

929
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to shut that fucking tv off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go run the hill.</v>

930
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuel like that is important for people.</v>

931
00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Like seeing someone like you get fired</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and talk about things.</v>

932
00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.900
<v Speaker 1>It energizes the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>

933
00:40:26.901 --> 00:40:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Like every time he put out one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos and a million people</v>

934
00:40:29.631 --> 00:40:33.020
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of those million people engaged</v>

935

1019
00:43:57.591 --> 00:43:59.330
<v Speaker 2>going to have the mental fortitude for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.440
<v Speaker 2>But you are,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Tony.</v>

<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the average guy.</v>

1026
00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1030
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.570
<v Speaker 1>what you were saying to those kids is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>

1031
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of effort and focus that you want</v>

1032
00:44:19.371 --> 00:44:22.910
<v Speaker 1>to put in in order to get yourself fit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and 10 chin ups and normal shit.</v>

1034
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the type of person that's going to</v>

1035
00:44:30.471 --> 00:44:32.320
<v Speaker 1>seek out excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1036
00:44:32.321 --> 00:44:34.810
<v Speaker 1>that person's going to go to a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and go,</v>

1037
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:40.070

<v Speaker 1>want to drain myself on that bench.</v>

<v Speaker 1>rack.</v>

1039
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to have nothing left when I leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1040
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

1041
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.630
<v Speaker 1>most people know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fabricate something right?</v>

1189
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Because I didn't have man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he didn't have anything.</v>

1192
00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:57.620
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1194
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:03.500
<v Speaker 2>but I was ready to stop the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and just make an ass out of</v>

1195
00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:04.670
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 2>that we ever did anything pleasurable</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1199
00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was ready to go off,</v>

1200
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't have any.</v>

1201
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 2>So when he didn't have any fines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1202
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Now that's the same recollection that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

1203
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.890
<v Speaker 2>but I really didn't forgive him until</v>
<v Speaker 2>his last heart attack in June.</v>

1204
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 2>And what happened then when I had the</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attack in June and it seemed like,</v>

1205
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.113
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1206
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 2>a revelation came to me and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1207
00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:34.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not hurting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hurting him at all.</v>

1208
00:51:34.521 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 2>My Dad is 86 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fine,</v>

1209
00:51:37.431 --> 00:51:38.021
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1210
00:51:38.021 --> 00:51:38.621
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1211
00:51:38.621 --> 00:51:39.470
<v Speaker 2>he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1212
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:40.461
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1213
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:42.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he thinks that he has</v>

1214
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.920
<v Speaker 2>anything to be sorry for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he thinks he's,</v>

1215
00:51:45.921 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 2>he's done a fantastic job of raising me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1216
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I was just waiting on a policy that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>never going to come,</v>

1217
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.220
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was still that hate that I had</v>

1218
00:51:55.221 --> 00:51:59.150
<v Speaker 2>for him was eating me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to get that burden off me and I</v>

1219
00:51:59.151 --> 00:52:02.690
<v Speaker 2>think having that last harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to die carrying that</v>

1220
00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:04.670
<v Speaker 2>burden with me of hating my dad.</v>

1221
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my dad and I asked him to</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgive me.</v>

1222
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't want my kids grow up,</v>

1284
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I get,</v>

1285
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.970
<v Speaker 3>so I put four for extra African.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes sure that's,</v>

1286
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:37.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to happen.</v>

1287
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:42.160
<v Speaker 1>So in some sort of way it turned out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be positive because you're such a doting</v>

1288
00:54:42.161 --> 00:54:43.030
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so,</v>

1289
00:54:43.031 --> 00:54:44.230
<v Speaker 1>you're so into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1290
00:54:44.231 --> 00:54:47.030
<v Speaker 1>so obvious that it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1291
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.870
<v Speaker 1>the negative consequences of how your</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad treated you.</v>

1292
00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Like it came out of you the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1293
00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made it,</v>

1294
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I made it up fucking point man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause this is miserable on their kid.</v>

1295
00:54:57.771 --> 00:54:59.080
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also John,</v>

1296
00:54:59.081 --> 00:55:01.130
<v Speaker 3>you know what good came out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1297
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.640
<v Speaker 3>the childhood that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of time that I went through,</v>

1298
00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:09.620
<v Speaker 3>I get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure what I get is just a 10th of</v>

1299
00:55:09.621 --> 00:55:13.300
<v Speaker 3>what you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so many thousand thousand</v>

1300
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:16.430
<v Speaker 3>people that contact me and tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1301
00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.600
<v Speaker 3>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1302
00:55:17.601 --> 00:55:22.580
<v Speaker 3>I had a fucked up childhood and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I see how you were able to come out</v>

1303
00:55:22.581 --> 00:55:25.790
<v Speaker 3>of that or some kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids contact me now that I'm going</v>

1304
00:55:25.791 --> 00:55:30.470
<v Speaker 3>through a fucked up childhood ct and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because you made it because you</v>

1305
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:34.730
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that when I looked back and I used to</v>

1306
00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.920
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did I have to go through this?</v>

1307
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Why did I have to have such a fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

1308
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:46.100
<v Speaker 3>It's because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I can talk about my childhood</v>

1309
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:50.500
<v Speaker 3>and it helps so many other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many other kids in the go.</v>

1310
00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.030
<v Speaker 3>All Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look back on it now and I said it was</v>

1311
00:55:53.031 --> 00:55:55.790
<v Speaker 3>so worth it that it wasn't even finding</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

1312
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:59.510
<v Speaker 3>It's so worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that I had to go through.</v>

1313
00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I wanting to hide every time I heard my</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad's keys in the door,</v>

1314
00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.340
<v Speaker 3>wanting to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1315
00:56:04.341 --> 00:56:07.040
<v Speaker 3>run away from fucking home warranty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hated,</v>

1316
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Speaker 3>hated my child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was so worth it.</v>

1317
00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Everything was so worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just being able to help one kid who</v>

1318
00:56:14.451 --> 00:56:18.140
<v Speaker 3>might be going through the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking worth that counted as a</v>

1319
00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:19.790
<v Speaker 3>blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just the place,</v>

1320
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:20.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1321
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:22.070
<v Speaker 1>That right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attitude.</v>

1322
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:26.260
<v Speaker 1>This is reason why people attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you because you really do like helping</v>

1323
00:56:26.261 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 1>people like you really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're happy that you suffered so that</v>

1324
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:32.350
<v Speaker 1>you can help other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the reasons why people</v>

1325
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 1>are so attracted to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1326
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1327
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.350
<v Speaker 1>but after I tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1328
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:38.711
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1329
00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:43.480
<v Speaker 1>turn me to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to weed out the weak.</v>

1330
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and weed out the payments.</v>

1331
00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Not even the week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the people that aren't willing to</v>

1332
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:49.450
<v Speaker 1>take the leap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't have any excuses.</v>

1333
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:51.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like the excuses are a real problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>

1334
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem because you give</v>

1335
00:56:54.101 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 1>yourself a way out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can fail at things,</v>

1336
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 1>so you could try and not be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1337
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 1>but the excuses for why you can't do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>or why you're going to fail or why you</v>

1338
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:05.740
<v Speaker 1>don't feel up to it today or why you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired or why you have other things on</v>

1339
00:57:05.741 --> 00:57:06.990
<v Speaker 1>your mind while you have others.</v>

1340
00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Things you have to deal with first</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you can start working out.</v>

1341
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:13.140
<v Speaker 1>That's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1342
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1343
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 1>he did tell them they needed to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to hear that shit.</v>

1344
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.410
<v Speaker 1>You need to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they create their own</v>

1345
00:57:20.411 --> 00:57:22.870
<v Speaker 1>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They create their own borders to create</v>

1346
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:25.660
<v Speaker 1>their own obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They create their own things that cannot</v>

1347
00:57:25.661 --> 00:57:26.980
<v Speaker 1>be surpassed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll,</v>

1348
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:29.200
<v Speaker 1>all those things are just products of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind.</v>

1349
00:57:29.201 --> 00:57:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's just the ego protecting you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from failure,</v>

1350
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.130
<v Speaker 1>from protecting you from that horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that you need to experience in</v>

1351
00:57:36.131 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 1>order to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to move forward,</v>

1352
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you got to experience some falls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got it slip,</v>

1353
00:57:40.961 --> 00:57:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you got to fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get back up,</v>

1354
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:44.890
<v Speaker 1>you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to try and fail because if you</v>

1355
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 1>don't fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you weren't trying hard</v>

1356
00:57:46.571 --> 00:57:49.870
<v Speaker 1>enough because nobody just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent in everything all the time.</v>

1357
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:52.150
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

1358
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that one point in your life</v>

1359
00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:56.430

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1361
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

1362
00:58:00.391 --> 00:58:02.320
<v Speaker 1>no one's just great from the womb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1363
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're the Dalai Lama or Buddha</v>

1364
00:58:04.271 --> 00:58:06.640
<v Speaker 1>or some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one is great from the womb at</v>

1365
00:58:06.641 --> 00:58:09.080
<v Speaker 1>anything as correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be 34 yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't even try.</v>

1372
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:26.020

<v Speaker 1>mock that stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting across the table from ct</v>

1511
01:04:17.891 --> 01:04:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Fletcher and after all he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking say,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he'll never,</v>

1514
01:04:22.571 --> 01:04:25.780
<v Speaker 3>you'll never be on everybody who said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never be on this show.</v>

1517
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:33.420
<v Speaker 1>But I could see your point of view and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could see why you'd be upset at my point</v>

1518
01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1519
01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>It didn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1520
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't take things very personally.</v>

1521
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.003
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1522
01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1523
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:42.060
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey joe,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1527
01:04:48.961 --> 01:04:50.220

<v Speaker 3>I felt we had a little difference.</v>

1530
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:58.020
<v Speaker 3>It's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a slight difference because I agree</v>

1531
01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:01.920
<v Speaker 3>with about 90% of what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a slight difference that we</v>

1532
01:05:01.921 --> 01:05:03.610
<v Speaker 3>don't agree on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as you say,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I been,</v>

1551
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I've had a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm working jobs since I was 12</v>

1552
01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.980
<v Speaker 3>years ago and 12 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've worked in a gas station pumping gas</v>

1553
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:52.780
<v Speaker 3>and it was during the fucking gas crisis</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the gas lines are super long.</v>

1554
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.020
<v Speaker 3>But I've always worked for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate asking people going in this</v>

1555
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:59.890
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like asking people to help me,</v>

1556
01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:02.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that I'm not able to travel the</v>

1557
01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:06.190
<v Speaker 3>world or not able to get out there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>promote things like I used to,</v>

1558
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.190
<v Speaker 3>patron is a way that they can support me</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and it's called,</v>

1559
01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>define Dev.</v>

1560
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to call it my last will and</v>
<v Speaker 3>testament because if,</v>

1561
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't,</v>

1562
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.040
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not successful in my fighting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't get a heart transplant,</v>

1563
01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 3>I do get a heart transplant and rejects</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm dead.</v>

01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:27.600

1565
01:06:27.601 --> 01:06:30.550
<v Speaker 3>the best thing to call it because if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose the fight,</v>

1566
01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.110
<v Speaker 3>then people can go back and see and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully get some better.</v>

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.740
<v Speaker 3>They can see how I faced.</v>

1619
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:56.380
<v Speaker 3>a guy who's never been in a fight trying</v>

1630
01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.810
<v Speaker 3>What percentage of people have ever even</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people have successful heart</v>

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:19.970
<v Speaker 3>transplants a year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

1633
01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1634
01:09:20.931 --> 01:09:23.780
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't give you too many numbers</v>

1635
01:09:23.781 --> 01:09:24.510
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>

1636
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the survival rate is 75 for the first,</v>

1637
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:30.920
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's higher.</v>

1638
01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.260
<v Speaker 3>80% for the first year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it was lower,</v>

1639
01:09:33.261 --> 01:09:33.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1640
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:38.840
<v Speaker 3>But now it's up to 80% survive for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first year and they go some pretty</v>

1641
01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 3>intense drugs just to keep your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>from rejecting the organ.</v>

1642
01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:42.201
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

1643
01:09:42.201 --> 01:09:45.040
<v Speaker 3>But I'm taking a shit load of drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now to take.</v>

1644
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Now I got 15 different pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 different drugs,</v>

1645
01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I take every day just to survive.</v>

1646
01:09:51.501 --> 01:09:53.750

<v Speaker 3>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1744
01:13:55.411 --> 01:13:58.440
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't ask if I was writing a movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>script and couldn't be any better.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and it just really made me feel good</v>

1748
01:14:09.601 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 3>that I wasn't the only crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker when the plan,</v>

1749
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>he's</v>

1750
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.050
<v Speaker 1>definitely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the most important figure in the</v>

1751
01:14:14.051 --> 01:14:19.051
<v Speaker 1>history of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His UFC one in 1993 changed the world,</v>

1752
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:23.950
<v Speaker 1>changed the world because people thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had to be like the bigger guy</v>

1753
01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.990
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden he showed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1754
01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this thing called Brazilian</v>

1755
01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and this dude coming out wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>pajamas is just going to fuck all you</v>

1756
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 1>people change the world of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody started training Jujitsu.</v>

1757
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what it was.</v>

1758
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have no idea what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

1759
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:41.080
<v Speaker 1>As soon as it came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1760
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm enrolled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Carlson Gracie,</v>

1761
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I went to Hixon Gracie's first and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Carlson gracie's.</v>

1762
01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is why,</v>

1763
01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:48.851
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in,</v>

1764
01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:49.684
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1765
01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blow some smoke up your butt there,</v>

1766
01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why you said two</v>

1767
01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:57.290
<v Speaker 3>fantastic analyst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why you're the best at</v>

1768
01:14:57.291 --> 01:15:01.730
<v Speaker 3>what you do because you get to ass in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and actually experience it.</v>

1769
01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:02.780
<v Speaker 3>And even when you say</v>

1770
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:06.480
<v Speaker 1>a hold or you see a Omoplata or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1771
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you know what the fuck you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1772
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:10.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think I'm very,</v>

1773
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:13.920
<v Speaker 1>very fortunate that I have a series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs that help each other.</v>

1774
01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that like being a Canadian and being</v>

1775
01:15:16.801 --> 01:15:19.020
<v Speaker 1>able to talk on stage in front of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

1776
01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable in front of a microphone</v>

1777
01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.870
<v Speaker 1>doing a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see and I'm comfortable and</v>

1778
01:15:24.871 --> 01:15:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I love MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

1779
01:15:26.491 --> 01:15:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is good.</v>

1780
01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.090
<v Speaker 1>It's my chance to express myself about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I really enjoy it and I</v>

1781
01:15:33.091 --> 01:15:35.870
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel burdened down by the,</v>

1782
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the moment of like the camera on me</v>
<v Speaker 1>counts.</v>

1783
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:44.500
<v Speaker 3>The performing in front of a live</v>
<v Speaker 3>audience and you're being comedian or,</v>

1785
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:45.970
<v Speaker 3>or what did you do for the,</v>

1786
01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have seats way,</v>

1787
01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.650
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1789
01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:51.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's easy because you</v>

1790
01:15:51.571 --> 01:15:53.460
<v Speaker 1>have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand what you're</v>

1791
01:15:53.461 --> 01:15:56.010
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a lot of information in</v>

1792
01:15:56.011 --> 01:16:00.420
<v Speaker 1>your head and you have to really care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's my job just to represent the</v>

1793
01:16:00.421 --> 01:16:02.100
<v Speaker 1>experience that these guys are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

1794
01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:03.870
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think about commentary,</v>

1795
01:16:03.871 --> 01:16:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about he's these guys been</v>
<v Speaker 1>through months of training camp.</v>

1796
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:08.760
<v Speaker 1>They've dieted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

1797
01:16:08.761 --> 01:16:11.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut weight just to get down to their</v>

1798
01:16:11.101 --> 01:16:13.830
<v Speaker 1>weight class there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rehydrated there's so much emotions and</v>

1799
01:16:13.831 --> 01:16:16.380
<v Speaker 1>intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just my job to honor their</v>

1800
01:16:16.381 --> 01:16:20.290
<v Speaker 1>experience and to do my best to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun for the fans at home and make a</v>

1801
01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:22.380
<v Speaker 1>traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all my job there.</v>

1802
01:16:22.381 --> 01:16:26.490
<v Speaker 1>They have the hard job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My job is just to not fuck up and to try</v>

1803
01:16:26.491 --> 01:16:31.110
<v Speaker 1>to describe it the best way that I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way easy than stand up.</v>

1804
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>

1805
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The live art.</v>

1806
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1807
01:16:36.621 --> 01:16:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm just being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1808
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:40.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I can imagine not going around the</v>

1809
01:16:40.341 --> 01:16:45.341
<v Speaker 3>world giving speeches and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminars in front of live audiences.</v>

1810
01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.920
<v Speaker 3>It's much easier for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm,</v>

1811
01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:53.000
<v Speaker 3>this is a big ass thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's much easier for me to sit</v>

1812
01:16:53.001 --> 01:16:54.770
<v Speaker 3>across the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan and talk to him.</v>

1813
01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Then he used to do his people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1814
01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:58.650
<v Speaker 3>shooting all kinds of questions at me.</v>

1815
01:16:59.060 --> 01:16:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1816
01:16:59.931 --> 01:17:03.150
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be odd for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience this late in life too.</v>

1817
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.530
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1818
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 3>if I had to sit across the table from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joel going to 21 days or I'd be too</v>

1819
01:17:10.161 --> 01:17:14.450
<v Speaker 3>fucking pantry fried to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he would talk and I think you</v>

1820
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:16.280
<v Speaker 3>would loosen up and then you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

1821
01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.260
<v Speaker 3>I'd be choked up for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe fucking two.</v>

1822
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:23.200
<v Speaker 3>I'd be tied to him that wouldn't be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1823
01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.490
<v Speaker 3>once it's just people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people relax.</v>

1824
01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1855
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Your last week I had a cooking show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1856
01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A vegan cooking show.</v>

1857
01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing all the Vegan Diet now,</v>

1858
01:18:53.781 --> 01:18:54.411
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1859
01:18:54.411 --> 01:18:56.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't call myself beacon.</v>

1860
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 3>I call myself plant based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started out seeing I was Vegan and</v>

1861
01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:04.300
<v Speaker 3>then I realized how crazy new Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks in and I said,</v>

1862
01:19:04.301 --> 01:19:07.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking cause I'm not doing it</v>

1863
01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:10.900
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about the animals and</v>

1864
01:19:10.901 --> 01:19:11.511
<v Speaker 3>they're going be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1865
01:19:11.511 --> 01:19:15.170
<v Speaker 3>fuck your ass up out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit is super serious about that.</v>

1866
01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing it for,</v>

1867
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 1>here's a lot of people that are Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are Vegan for the right reasons.</v>

1868
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:25.160
<v Speaker 1>They're Vegan because the conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they want to do it for health</v>

1869
01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:28.700
<v Speaker 1>because they want to have the least</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of impact on the environment</v>

1870
01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:31.430
<v Speaker 1>because they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want animals to die.</v>

1871
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:35.450
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are Vegan that really just belonged to</v>

1872
01:19:35.451 --> 01:19:38.140
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have been scientology or he</v>

1873
01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.070
<v Speaker 1>could have been a moonie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have been any.</v>

1874
01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:45.090
<v Speaker 1>They found that and they ran with it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they are fucking ruthless against</v>

1875
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:47.940
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't in that group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

1876
01:19:47.941 --> 01:19:51.650
<v Speaker 1>they generally give like goodhearted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kindhearted,</v>

1877
01:19:51.651 --> 01:19:52.730
<v Speaker 1>vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad name.</v>

1878
01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:55.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's a small percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of these motherfuckers,</v>

1879
01:19:55.701 --> 01:19:58.720
<v Speaker 1>they have like Vegan in their online</v>
<v Speaker 1>name and there,</v>

1880
01:19:58.721 --> 01:19:59.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they</v>

1881
01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.340
<v Speaker 3>tack like you look at their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like their comments,</v>

1882
01:20:01.341 --> 01:20:03.720
<v Speaker 3>they're all attacking all the old people</v>
<v Speaker 3>at constant.</v>

1883
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:05.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1884
01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Angry people that found reason to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an aggressive person.</v>

1885
01:20:10.081 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you've found a greenlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this person's not vegan.</v>

1886
01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I can attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're the reason why the world,</v>

1887
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:17.370
<v Speaker 1>you're the responsible for the pollution</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the car.</v>

1888
01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that if you were Vegan that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be less suffering and this</v>

1889
01:20:20.281 --> 01:20:21.890
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1890
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.810
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they do the worst job of promoting</v>

1891
01:20:24.811 --> 01:20:27.800
<v Speaker 1>veganism because people see those crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass holes and then they go,</v>

1892
01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:30.660
<v Speaker 1>fuck these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go eat a steak just for</v>

1893
01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to shoot this fucking cow</v>

1894
01:20:33.211 --> 01:20:35.580
<v Speaker 1>right now and I'm going to eat them</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of you.</v>

1895
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:36.893
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1896
01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be associated with</v>

1897
01:20:39.841 --> 01:20:42.840
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that radical part of at all.</v>

1898
01:20:42.841 --> 01:20:45.630
<v Speaker 1>So I stopped saying I'm being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't eat meat.</v>

1899
01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:50.430
<v Speaker 1>I would like to get you connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some real nutrition experts that could</v>

1900
01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:52.720
<v Speaker 1>break down why that might not be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best idea.</v>

1901
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is important in your diet in terms</v>

1902
01:20:55.561 --> 01:20:59.610
<v Speaker 1>of like essential fatty acids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy fats in terms of like,</v>

1903
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:04.470
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people think that refined</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates are the big problem with</v>

1904
01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:07.830
<v Speaker 1>heart disease are fine carbohydrates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar is what contributes to heart</v>

1905
01:21:07.831 --> 01:21:09.450
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the whole thing that came</v>

1906
01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:12.990
<v Speaker 1>out pretty recently in the New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>Times did an expo say about the sugar</v>

1907
01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:17.991
<v Speaker 1>industry having paid off scientists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1950s to put the blame on saturated</v>

1908
01:21:18.781 --> 01:21:23.781
<v Speaker 1>fats and cholesterol instead of sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then yeah,</v>

1909
01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:28.440
<v Speaker 1>is a complete total fabricated</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy by the sugar industry because</v>

1910
01:21:28.441 --> 01:21:30.030
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing these tests and they</v>

1911
01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:31.320
<v Speaker 1>were realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1912
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.320
<v Speaker 1>like sugar fucks people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible for you.</v>

1913
01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And so what they did is they literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>bribed scientists and not that much</v>

1914
01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:39.030
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of crazy.</v>

1915
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.360
<v Speaker 1>In the 1950s they paid them something</v>
<v Speaker 1>around $50,000 and I don't even know if</v>

1916
01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:48.780
<v Speaker 1>it's $50,000 today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the equivalent of $50,000</v>

1917
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:54.150
<v Speaker 1>and these people just fabricated these</v>
<v Speaker 1>reports and got everybody convinced that</v>

1918
01:21:54.151 --> 01:21:56.880
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an essential part of the human</v>

1919
01:21:56.881 --> 01:22:01.110
<v Speaker 1>diet and cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the literally the substrate for</v>

1920
01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.140
<v Speaker 1>hormone production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cholesterol is important for your</v>

1921
01:22:04.141 --> 01:22:08.400
<v Speaker 1>body and that these things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for heart disease and not</v>

1922
01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:12.630
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refined sugar and refined carbohydrates.</v>

1923
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.150
<v Speaker 1>They're completely unnatural in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human body.</v>

1924
01:22:15.151 --> 01:22:18.540
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to be able to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>scoop up a fucking tablespoon full of</v>

1925
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:21.360
<v Speaker 1>sugar and dump it in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not real in the world.</v>

1926
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I give you get sugar in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's attached to an apple.</v>

1927
01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:26.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you get carbohydrates,</v>

1928
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 1>it's in plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fiber you're eating to end.</v>

1929
01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Your body knows how to process that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't know what the fuck to</v>

1930
01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:35.760
<v Speaker 1>do with bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the bread that we eat today</v>

1931
01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:40.860
<v Speaker 1>sprayed down with fucking all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit to prevent pesticide.</v>

1932
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:45.240
<v Speaker 1>All these pesticides and it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they changed the wheat and made it more,</v>

1933
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:48.360
<v Speaker 1>more complex glutens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your body's a hard time processing</v>

1934
01:22:48.361 --> 01:22:50.160
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of bad food.</v>

1935
01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:53.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Vegan,</v>

1936
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:57.180
<v Speaker 1>but I respect the people that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because they're doing it because they</v>

1937
01:22:57.181 --> 01:23:00.120
<v Speaker 1>don't want to cause harm and I respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are doing it that think</v>

1938
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:01.290
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it for their health.</v>

1939
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.530
<v Speaker 1>But I've talked to a lot of vegans that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were formally Vegan,</v>

1940
01:23:04.531 --> 01:23:08.620
<v Speaker 1>especially Chris Kresser who is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual scientist and is one of the</v>

1941
01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:13.210
<v Speaker 1>leading experts on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real issue with the Vegan Diet and</v>

1942
01:23:13.211 --> 01:23:17.290
<v Speaker 1>how it does work for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people with their biological</v>

1943
01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.930
<v Speaker 1>requirements and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their physical requirements in terms of</v>

1944
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:22.990
<v Speaker 1>like what their activity is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They functioned fine on a Vegan Diet.</v>

1945
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.240
<v Speaker 1>As long as they're careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make sure they get enough.</v>

1946
01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.370
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make sure they get their fatty</v>

1947
01:23:27.371 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure they get their essential fatty</v>

1948
01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 1>acids from coconuts and flaxseed oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>get oils for your body,</v>

1951
01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but your body needs that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essential.</v>

<v Speaker 2>preworkouts and pumps and stuff.</v>

1967
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:11.760
<v Speaker 2>But after he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>

1968
01:24:11.761 --> 01:24:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I started another brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1969
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:14.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Odyssey.</v>

1970
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Nutraceuticals is completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our named Odyssey because that's what I</v>

1971
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:21.150
<v Speaker 2>consider my life is this isn't an</v>
<v Speaker 2>artist.</v>

1972
01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:24.220
<v Speaker 2>He can punch a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one hell of a legacy going on.</v>

1973
01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:28.750
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a a plant based protein or is very</v>

1974
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.810
<v Speaker 2>health conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very health conscious entity.</v>

1975
01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.753
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1976
01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of plant based protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1977
01:24:35.001 --> 01:24:37.310
<v Speaker 1>pea protein is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love hemp protein.</v>

1978
01:24:37.311 --> 01:24:39.920
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think hemp protein is very easy for</v>

1979
01:24:39.921 --> 01:24:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you to body digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with a lot of plant</v>

1980
01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:44.570
<v Speaker 1>plant proteins is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1981
01:24:44.571 --> 01:24:47.390
<v Speaker 1>if you just eat just plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially eating whole foods,</v>

1982
01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.200
<v Speaker 1>you're not nest that your body's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking it down the same way your body</v>

1983
01:24:51.201 --> 01:24:54.320
<v Speaker 1>would break down a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say or grass fed beef.</v>

1984
01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to send you a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled my shit.</v>

1985
01:24:57.170 --> 01:25:00.590

<v Speaker 2>And you tell me what you think and uh,</v>

1986

1987
01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:05.890

<v Speaker 2>before Joe King can fuck off.</v>

1988
01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.160

<v Speaker 2>You have a website for nutraceuticals</v>

1989

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it came from my mom.</v>

2024
01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:24.940
<v Speaker 3>My mom was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell you that her now,</v>

2025
01:26:24.941 --> 01:26:27.340
<v Speaker 3>all of his siblings died from a heart</v>
<v Speaker 3>related prom.</v>

2026
01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.000
<v Speaker 3>So she was sick most of her adult life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear.</v>

2027
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I remember mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember very early when I was very</v>

2028
01:26:33.551 --> 01:26:34.780
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom being healthy,</v>

2029
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:38.980
<v Speaker 3>but she was sick most of her adult life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of my memories of my mom when she</v>

2030
01:26:38.981 --> 01:26:41.380
<v Speaker 3>was sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every day,</v>

2031
01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:42.580
<v Speaker 3>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

2032
01:26:42.581 --> 01:26:45.220
<v Speaker 3>she was really sick in and out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>emergency rooms and said,</v>

2033
01:26:45.610 --> 01:26:47.020
<v Speaker 3>if you ask my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2034
01:26:47.021 --> 01:26:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs. Fletcher Hard,</v>

2035
01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.940
<v Speaker 3>she would say I'm blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her standard answer was always blessed.</v>

2036
01:26:54.850 --> 01:26:57.910
<v Speaker 3>And the reason she told me the reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>why she would say that is because I'm</v>

2037
01:26:57.911 --> 01:26:59.680
<v Speaker 3>still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not dead.</v>

2038
01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:01.820
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ha ha,</v>

2039
01:27:01.890 --> 01:27:02.870
<v Speaker 3>I still have life.</v>

2040
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:04.900
<v Speaker 3>If I still can go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still could make a change.</v>

2041
01:27:04.901 --> 01:27:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I still can make it different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2042
01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.960
<v Speaker 3>I got it from her no matter what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

2043
01:27:10.961 --> 01:27:13.830
<v Speaker 3>how bad it may seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how people complain,</v>

<v Speaker 3>alive,</v>

<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm still alive.</v>

2056
01:27:36.611 --> 01:27:37.444
<v Speaker 3>So I'm blessed.</v>

2057
01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome that people need to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2058
01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:43.070
<v Speaker 1>They do need to hear that and they need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear your attitude about excuses.</v>

2059
01:27:43.071 --> 01:27:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Cause both of those things are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

2060
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It's very important for people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

2061
01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:51.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people have like bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns in their mind and these bad</v>

2062
01:27:51.561 --> 01:27:55.040
<v Speaker 1>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they've interacted with the</v>

2063
01:27:55.041 --> 01:27:57.410
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they've approached all sorts of</v>

2064
01:27:57.411 --> 01:27:59.630
<v Speaker 1>different problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have these patterns and they fall</v>

2065
01:27:59.631 --> 01:28:02.720
<v Speaker 1>right into these patterns and maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn these patterns from their family</v>

2066
01:28:02.721 --> 01:28:04.940
<v Speaker 1>member that maybe they learn these</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns from their environment.</v>

2067
01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe these patterns are like defense</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to keep them from challenging</v>

2068
01:28:08.991 --> 01:28:11.420
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to recognize what those are.</v>

2069
01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not you like you're not a lazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2070
01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.340

<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

2073
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.430
<v Speaker 1>You could just decide to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the story of David Goggins,</v>

2083
01:28:46.761 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Chin ups decided he's going to be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this incredible endurance athlete did.</v>

2084
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It just did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just does.</v>

2085
01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:54.710
<v Speaker 1>It just forces his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he has this thing that he says that</v>

2086
01:28:54.711 --> 01:28:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I think about whenever I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2087
01:28:56.481 --> 01:28:57.950
<v Speaker 1>most people quit at 40%</v>

2088
01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believe I believe</v>

2089
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.500
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that most people get a little</v>

2090
01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:05.041
<v Speaker 1>tired and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2092
01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:08.270
<v Speaker 1>but you couldn't go further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go further.</v>

2093
01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just recently read a on and I had</v>

2095
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.360
<v Speaker 1>watched the video of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent it to me.</v>

2096
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:17.680
<v Speaker 1>He's a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's tricked me.</v>

2097
01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Mental savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aw,</v>

2099
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I love those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are important.</v>

2100
01:29:21.691 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 1>You've got to know that those people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and him in particular,</v>

2101
01:29:24.361 --> 01:29:26.790
<v Speaker 1>he's really important because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>super out of shape.</v>

2102
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:31.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he was always this ripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>super athlete like he was like fat and</v>

2103
01:29:31.171 --> 01:29:34.680
<v Speaker 1>terrible diet and poor health and poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

2104
01:29:34.681 --> 01:29:39.210
<v Speaker 1>The whole deal and just tightened it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now he's an animal.</v>

2105
01:29:39.211 --> 01:29:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking beside.</v>

2106
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decided to and anybody can do that.</v>

2107
01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.830
<v Speaker 1>All the people out there that think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're lazy.</v>

2108
01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.890
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been behaving like a lazy person.</v>

2109
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:53.580
<v Speaker 1>You've been following lazy patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just decide tomorrow,</v>

2110
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.410
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you decide tomorrow you're going to</v>

2111
01:29:55.411 --> 01:29:59.760
<v Speaker 1>be a discipline focused person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't expect to have the kind of energy</v>

2112
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.850
<v Speaker 1>that someone who's been disciplined and</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused for years house cause you're not</v>

2113
01:30:02.851 --> 01:30:04.560
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's we're going that your body's not</v>

2114
01:30:04.561 --> 01:30:07.080
<v Speaker 1>going to be conditioned for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mind's not going to be accustomed</v>

2115
01:30:07.081 --> 01:30:09.270
<v Speaker 1>to the strain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can still do it right.</v>

2116
01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:10.140
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to scale,</v>

2117
01:30:10.141 --> 01:30:13.920
<v Speaker 1>you get tired quicker and then hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>by next week you'll have more endurance</v>

2118
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.680
<v Speaker 1>and then by the week after that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>have more and if you keep building six</v>

2119
01:30:16.681 --> 01:30:18.330
<v Speaker 1>months from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be unrecognizable.</v>

2120
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.841
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2121
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:22.290
<v Speaker 1>If you stick with you definitely will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything's got to start from right</v>

2122
01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:25.200
<v Speaker 1>here in important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're important.</v>

2123
01:30:25.201 --> 01:30:28.080
<v Speaker 1>That's why your videos are so important</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your videos,</v>

2124
01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I guaran fucking tee it.</v>

2125
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to say 100,000 people</v>

2126
01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:33.720
<v Speaker 1>probably watch your videos and change</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

2127
01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more than I though.</v>

2128
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I bet you've changed people's entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlook on things.</v>

2129
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:46.500
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's everything in this life.</v>

2130
01:30:46.730 --> 01:30:49.500
<v Speaker 1>This is a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can get information.</v>

2131
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Books are wonderful documentaries and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one full.</v>

2132
01:30:51.991 --> 01:30:56.991
<v Speaker 1>What's really great is inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuel that the little push,</v>

2133
01:30:57.391 --> 01:30:59.980
<v Speaker 1>just a little push just to get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>

2134
01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's all it needs and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know it and then people</v>

2135
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:07.830
<v Speaker 1>like you because you've had a lifetime</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this discipline and dedication and</v>

2136
01:31:07.831 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 1>obsession that that reinforces it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's heads.</v>

2137
01:31:12.151 --> 01:31:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to do what ct does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be like that.</v>

2138
01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I want to have that kind of energy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus.</v>

2139
01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me ever started about thought about</v>

2140
01:31:20.191 --> 01:31:21.660
<v Speaker 1>getting into the octagon yourself?</v>

2141
01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to know I'm too old now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost did at one point in time,</v>

2142
01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:26.210
<v Speaker 1>but not at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2143
01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:27.600
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What earlier?</v>

2144
01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when I was kickboxing man,</v>

2145
01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of fucking headaches and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really worried.</v>

2146
01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came from a real meathead gym and we</v>

2147
01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:40.140
<v Speaker 1>did like hard sparring and I did a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hard spot in this one kid in</v>

2148
01:31:40.141 --> 01:31:43.410
<v Speaker 1>particular who was a really good boxer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'd beat the fuck out of each</v>

2149
01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:44.244
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2150
01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is like I would go home and</v>

2151
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was going on over a few years.</v>

2152
01:31:50.311 --> 01:31:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I would go home and my head would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding,</v>

2153
01:31:52.591 --> 01:31:54.060
<v Speaker 1>just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2154
01:31:54.061 --> 01:31:55.140
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying in bed.</v>

2155
01:31:55.141 --> 01:31:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing myself?</v>

2156
01:31:57.091 --> 01:31:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to be stupid when I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>older?</v>

2157
01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to not know where I am?</v>

2158
01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 1>I going to be stumbling on my words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified to brain damage because</v>

2159
01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a very curious person</v>

2160
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:14.410
<v Speaker 1>and I've always been fascinated by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you can change the way you think</v>

2161
01:32:14.411 --> 01:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>about things and by being in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I'm so excited about</v>

2162
01:32:17.381 --> 01:32:20.320
<v Speaker 1>talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like inspiration and motivation and even</v>

2163
01:32:20.321 --> 01:32:22.420
<v Speaker 1>information like having these things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

2164
01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:25.150
<v Speaker 1>You can forge these things together to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2165
01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.430
<v Speaker 1>to make your mind going a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

2166
01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.980
<v Speaker 1>So the quality of my thoughts has always</v>
<v Speaker 1>been very,</v>

2167
01:32:29.981 --> 01:32:33.820
<v Speaker 1>very important to me because I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what made me successful in all</v>

2168
01:32:33.821 --> 01:32:36.160
<v Speaker 1>the different areas that I've chosen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue.</v>

2169
01:32:36.161 --> 01:32:39.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like the quality of your thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being able to recognize what's good</v>

2170
01:32:39.011 --> 01:32:42.280
<v Speaker 1>and what's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the mind itself,</v>

2171
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:45.820
<v Speaker 1>if the mind itself is compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to be able to do</v>

2172
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:46.930
<v Speaker 1>all those things that you want to do.</v>

2173
01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Gonna be able to appreciate life if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't remember where you are and you</v>

2174
01:32:51.131 --> 01:32:54.430
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to talk anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was around people that I was</v>

2175
01:32:54.431 --> 01:32:58.280
<v Speaker 1>watching their ability to talk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2176
01:32:58.281 --> 01:33:01.660
<v Speaker 1>their cognitive function to k is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting is,</v>

2177
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it's glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you gotta know when to stop.</v>

2178
01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:08.140
<v Speaker 1>You got to know when to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

2179
01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:11.800
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I stopped as 1989 there was no ufc,</v>

2180
01:33:11.801 --> 01:33:14.320
<v Speaker 1>there was no money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no money in kickboxing.</v>

2181
01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Like I think I got offered a fight for</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 bucks and that,</v>

2182
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.980
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing amateur fights and I got</v>

2183
01:33:20.981 --> 01:33:23.710
<v Speaker 1>offered a pro fight for like madmen 400</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

2184
01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how much it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like what I was like,</v>

2185
01:33:27.191 --> 01:33:30.040
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to train for months and</v>

2186
01:33:30.041 --> 01:33:34.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe get my ass kicked and maybe get</v>
<v Speaker 1>head kicked for like 400 bucks.</v>

2187
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:38.110
<v Speaker 1>And I was getting these headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The headaches were bad man.</v>

2188
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just decided early on,</v>

2189
01:33:40.661 --> 01:33:43.630
<v Speaker 1>if the UFC was around back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm most certain I would have pursued</v>

2190
01:33:43.631 --> 01:33:45.700
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But glad it wasn't.</v>

2191
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:50.530
<v Speaker 1>You did a whooper fans ass one time a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>

2192
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Well not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy talking shit.</v>

2193
01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy on fear factor?</v>

2194
01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:56.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just grabbed him.</v>

2195
01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:57.520
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was gonna hit me.</v>

2196
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2197
01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:02.500
<v Speaker 1>he's [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just tied him up.</v>

2198
01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Damn Boy Thai clinch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of choking him,</v>

2199
01:34:05.651 --> 01:34:07.570
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better not choke them because if I</v>

2200
01:34:07.571 --> 01:34:08.670
<v Speaker 1>choke him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2201
01:34:08.770 --> 01:34:10.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe they could sue me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just decided,</v>

2202
01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I decided if I grab a hold of him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab him by the back of the head,</v>

2203
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:19.270
<v Speaker 1>he'll probably realized once I lock on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him that he's pretty helpless and</v>

2204
01:34:19.271 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 1>he'll probably stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he kind of did.</v>

2205
01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 1>He kinda just flailed around a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

2206
01:34:23.051 --> 01:34:23.770
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2207
01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:26.530
<v Speaker 1>when someone grabs your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about controlling</v>

2208
01:34:26.531 --> 01:34:27.850
<v Speaker 1>someone's neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

2209
01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:29.740
<v Speaker 1>it just does not feel good.</v>

2210
01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:34.050
<v Speaker 1>You feel powerless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2211
01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:38.770
<v Speaker 1>that was a guy that he had attacked a</v>
<v Speaker 1>counselor before on another television</v>

2212
01:34:38.771 --> 01:34:42.550
<v Speaker 1>show and he had thrown his girlfriend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground or his wife on another</v>

2213
01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:45.760
<v Speaker 1>television show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had told me about him before he</v>

2214
01:34:45.761 --> 01:34:46.421
<v Speaker 1>did the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2215
01:34:46.421 --> 01:34:49.540
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a series hothead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking about not having him on</v>

2216
01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 1>the show at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we thought it'd be good drama just</v>

2217
01:34:52.301 --> 01:34:56.650
<v Speaker 1>but be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he punched some God or she</v>

2218
01:34:56.651 --> 01:35:01.040
<v Speaker 1>punched some guy on the show and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wife punched the guy who was those</v>

2219
01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:02.810
<v Speaker 1>heckling him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2220
01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't hit someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2221
01:35:04.401 --> 01:35:06.590
<v Speaker 1>just because you hit your husband</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you can hit other people.</v>

2222
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy got in my face and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of it,</v>

2223
01:35:10.041 --> 01:35:11.990
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't on film that they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on tv,</v>

2224
01:35:11.991 --> 01:35:13.220
<v Speaker 1>but I pushed him out of my face.</v>

2225
01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.210
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't touch me.</v>

2226
01:35:14.211 --> 01:35:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what?</v>

2227
01:35:15.141 --> 01:35:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you going to do?</v>

2228
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And he got in my face again and I pushed</v>
<v Speaker 1>him again.</v>

2229
01:35:19.341 --> 01:35:21.080
<v Speaker 1>And then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just two,</v>

2230
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.670
<v Speaker 1>two tents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2231
01:35:22.671 --> 01:35:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to grab this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2232
01:35:24.471 --> 01:35:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause sucker punches happening.</v>

2233
01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not ready to get punched and</v>

2234
01:35:31.611 --> 01:35:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you get punched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get fucked up.</v>

2235
01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you don't think someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to punch you.</v>

2236
01:35:35.391 --> 01:35:36.530
<v Speaker 1>And then they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2237
01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:38.900
<v Speaker 1>So I'm always thinking when someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>raises their voice,</v>

2238
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:41.510
<v Speaker 1>they're ready to punch me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just going to clamp down on this</v>

2239
01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:43.160
<v Speaker 1>dude's neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get ahold of them.</v>

2240
01:35:43.190 --> 01:35:44.690
<v Speaker 1>So I just grabbed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hurt him.</v>

2241
01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always liked to when I was a fucking</v>

2242
01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called the police on me though.</v>

2243
01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.240
<v Speaker 1>The police had to go over the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2244
01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.440
<v Speaker 1>he would claimed I hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He claimed a bunch of shit.</v>

2245
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 1>The police had to go over the videotape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to show all the,</v>

2246
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:01.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the footage from all the different</v>

2247
01:36:01.071 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 1>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2267
01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:51.530

<v Speaker 1>it starts their day off in a bad way and</v>

2268
01:36:51.531 --> 01:36:55.070
<v Speaker 1>they get obsessed with it and they start</v>
<v Speaker 1>going battling back and forth with</v>

2269
01:36:55.071 --> 01:36:56.870
<v Speaker 1>people in the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guilty,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You rang back and forth and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:08.630
<v Speaker 1>so Joe Rogan has got some fucking fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2273
01:37:08.631 --> 01:37:13.070
<v Speaker 1>They wanted their fucking string mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you talk to Joe?</v>

2274
01:37:13.071 --> 01:37:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this between me until the fuck you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to jump in.</v>

2276
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't get killed me and fucking</v>

2277
01:37:20.031 --> 01:37:22.700
<v Speaker 1>assassinate you want to make you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2278
01:37:22.701 --> 01:37:25.430
<v Speaker 1>It's what they really want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to figure out a way that they</v>

2279
01:37:25.431 --> 01:37:29.570
<v Speaker 1>can point out that you're wrong or make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel stupid or they just,</v>

2280
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:33.380
<v Speaker 1>it's almost all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of it is unhealthy people</v>

2281
01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.540
<v Speaker 1>unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2282
01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not bad people who are doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an unhealthy practice to just</v>

2283
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:41.750
<v Speaker 1>lash out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not even people that are really</v>

2284
01:37:41.751 --> 01:37:43.070
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing,</v>

2285
01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:47.120
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a debate about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is where we as human</v>

2286
01:37:47.121 --> 01:37:50.570
<v Speaker 1>beings have to learn how to use social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media better cause there's nothing wrong</v>

2287
01:37:50.571 --> 01:37:53.990
<v Speaker 1>and having discussions about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to figure out a way to do it</v>

2288
01:37:53.991 --> 01:37:56.580
<v Speaker 1>where you're not just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's feelings all the time and</v>

2289
01:37:56.581 --> 01:37:58.500
<v Speaker 1>lashing out because that's what a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2290
01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:02.880
<v Speaker 1>It just bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small minded squabbling.</v>

2291
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're using big words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intent behind it is very small</v>

2292
01:38:06.391 --> 01:38:06.990
<v Speaker 1>minded.</v>

2293
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:11.400
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People see me videos of their work,</v>

2294
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:15.810
<v Speaker 2>their been working out all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2295
01:38:16.710 --> 01:38:19.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are not doing it correctly.</v>

2296
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't criticize people.</v>

2297
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2298
01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.400
<v Speaker 2>because it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most important thing to me is that</v>

2299
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:28.740
<v Speaker 2>they're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually in the of trying to,</v>

2300
01:38:28.741 --> 01:38:31.020
<v Speaker 2>trying to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

2301
01:38:31.021 --> 01:38:34.020
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people don't look at it like that.</v>

2302
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh you're fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing that fucking wrong.</v>

2303
01:38:36.871 --> 01:38:39.030
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking why you don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck.</v>

2304
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.790
<v Speaker 2>They jumped on him immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2305
01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:45.300
<v Speaker 2>that they're trying to discourage them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are at least trying to do</v>

2306
01:38:45.301 --> 01:38:47.430
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've tried to discourage him and he's</v>

2307
01:38:47.431 --> 01:38:52.070
<v Speaker 2>got so many fucking experts out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or are you not doing this correctly?</v>

2308
01:38:52.071 --> 01:38:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Your farm is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2309
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2310
01:38:55.501 --> 01:38:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Why do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2311
01:38:56.401 --> 01:38:59.580
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then direct message to people,</v>

2312
01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:01.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're really trying to help him</v>

2313
01:39:01.051 --> 01:39:02.010
<v Speaker 2>direct message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

2314
01:39:02.011 --> 01:39:04.170
<v Speaker 2>why put it out there so everybody can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it?</v>

2315
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:06.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just trying to draw attention to</v>

2316
01:39:06.031 --> 01:39:07.590
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that.</v>

2317
01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:08.611
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so rod,</v>

2318
01:39:08.611 --> 01:39:11.650
<v Speaker 2>if they just want people to look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to explain what the fuck I'm</v>

2319
01:39:11.651 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them guys I don't like.</v>

2320
01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's what's interesting too about</v>

2321
01:39:15.651 --> 01:39:20.420
<v Speaker 1>exercises is there's some things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are debatable in terms of the way to do</v>

2322
01:39:20.421 --> 01:39:23.120
<v Speaker 1>it and what not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not necessarily always a</v>

2323
01:39:23.121 --> 01:39:25.430
<v Speaker 1>consensus about how someone's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2324
01:39:25.431 --> 01:39:26.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's like,</v>

2325
01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:27.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2326
01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:30.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just a lot of people online that</v>

2327
01:39:30.171 --> 01:39:33.530
<v Speaker 1>are just making a lot of noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to figure out who's right and</v>

2328
01:39:33.531 --> 01:39:34.340
<v Speaker 1>who's wrong.</v>

2329
01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2330
01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's only right and wrong for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2331
01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try.</v>

2332
01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.070
<v Speaker 2>If Joe Rogan tells me I had to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something a certain way and I try it and</v>

2333
01:39:43.071 --> 01:39:44.210
<v Speaker 2>it works for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm fucking,</v>

2334
01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2335
01:39:45.561 --> 01:39:47.720
<v Speaker 2>if it works for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it works for me,</v>

2336
01:39:47.721 --> 01:39:51.170
<v Speaker 2>because we all are so goddamn different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're not,</v>

2337
01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:54.410
<v Speaker 2>nobody's exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when somebody,</v>

2338
01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.393
<v Speaker 2>somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2339
01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:57.770
<v Speaker 2>if now somebody says they got the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect routine,</v>

2340
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:59.330
<v Speaker 2>it's going to work for every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

2341
01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.310
<v Speaker 2>then that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be Lyria,</v>

2342
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 2>he's going shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody has one routine is going</v>

2343
01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.350
<v Speaker 2>to work for every fucking buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just impossible.</v>

2344
01:40:06.351 --> 01:40:07.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2345
01:40:07.491 --> 01:40:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2346
01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I think especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting with mma because</v>

2347
01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:15.730
<v Speaker 1>the fact that hoists gracie bursts on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene in 1990 3000 not that long</v>

2348
01:40:15.731 --> 01:40:16.511
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2349
01:40:16.511 --> 01:40:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really 24 years is not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of prep time.</v>

2350
01:40:20.051 --> 01:40:24.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just too similar or it's too close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's all these different</v>

2351
01:40:24.461 --> 01:40:28.690
<v Speaker 1>methods that have been sort of devised</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way and nobody really,</v>

2352
01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until someone comes along the real,</v>

2353
01:40:30.341 --> 01:40:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's like an Anderson Silva that's</v>

2354
01:40:32.081 --> 01:40:34.630
<v Speaker 1>like super successful doing it one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go,</v>

2355
01:40:34.631 --> 01:40:35.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck is he doing it?</v>

2356
01:40:35.890 --> 01:40:36.790
<v Speaker 1>We've got to do it his way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2357
01:40:36.791 --> 01:40:38.020
<v Speaker 1>But you're not him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2358
01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you started out as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestler,</v>

2359
01:40:39.791 --> 01:40:42.130
<v Speaker 1>whereas he's a Moyie Thai guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it works good for him,</v>

2360
01:40:42.131 --> 01:40:46.210
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you need a different approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody really knows how to do it for</v>

2361
01:40:46.211 --> 01:40:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of figure out your own</v>

2362
01:40:48.191 --> 01:40:52.870
<v Speaker 1>way when you've got to hone it and tweak</v>
<v Speaker 1>it along the way while you're competing.</v>

2363
01:40:52.871 --> 01:40:53.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2364
01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

2365
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:55.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2366
01:40:55.090 --> 01:40:56.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rule,</v>

2367
01:40:56.131 --> 01:40:58.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>innovators that are real guys,</v>

2368
01:40:58.271 --> 01:40:59.140
<v Speaker 3>it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2369
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:02.230
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that they did that.</v>

2370
01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:02.870
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2371
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:04.800
<v Speaker 3>they're not trying to copy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2372
01:41:05.650 --> 01:41:08.440
<v Speaker 3>It's so important to be an original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2373
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:09.850
<v Speaker 3>at Danny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

2374
01:41:09.851 --> 01:41:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was set out to try to beat Joe Rogan.</v>

2375
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.670
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna fail motherfucking cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>April one,</v>

2376
01:41:15.671 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he and so try,</v>

2377
01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I tell him he's got no time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sees me.</v>

2378
01:41:21.821 --> 01:41:24.010
<v Speaker 3>I want to be just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't be just like me,</v>

2379
01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.950
<v Speaker 3>my damn self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2380
01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:28.030
<v Speaker 3>be yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2381
01:41:28.031 --> 01:41:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't try and beat just like Joe Rogan</v>

2382
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.941
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said,</v>

2383
01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:33.100
<v Speaker 3>cause you can't be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to tell</v>

2384
01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:34.300
<v Speaker 1>people that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

2385
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:37.870
<v Speaker 1>if you see someone who inspires you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you admire them and you want to do what</v>

2386
01:41:37.871 --> 01:41:38.740
<v Speaker 1>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2387
01:41:38.741 --> 01:41:41.830
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody starts out in the</v>

2388
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:43.570
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like special in.</v>

2389
01:41:43.571 --> 01:41:45.370
<v Speaker 1>You're a young person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you admire someone,</v>

2390
01:41:45.371 --> 01:41:47.860
<v Speaker 1>you kind of copy a lot of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mannerisms and the way they do it.</v>

2391
01:41:47.861 --> 01:41:49.780
<v Speaker 1>But eventually you've got to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

2392
01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Revive yourself and getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep fighting,</v>

2425
01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:01.774
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2426
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:02.920
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2427
01:43:02.921 --> 01:43:04.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty good.</v>

2428
01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:06.070
<v Speaker 3>I look good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Marshall,</v>

2429
01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:09.160
<v Speaker 3>but my favorite sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think bar none in Nepal or not</v>

2430
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 3>overweight lifting and mma is getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>really close.</v>

2431
01:43:12.461 --> 01:43:14.350
<v Speaker 3>It was really close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's boxing.</v>

2432
01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:16.300
<v Speaker 3>He loved boxing going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2433
01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:18.140
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2434
01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.770
<v Speaker 3>What's your favorite fighter deal face?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh Man.</v>

2435
01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2436
01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.080
<v Speaker 3>that's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2437
01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.390
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2438
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:26.291
<v Speaker 3>a role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>minor,</v>

2439
01:43:26.291 --> 01:43:31.240
<v Speaker 3>I guess a Muhammad Ali would be my</v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite block as a role model,</v>

2440
01:43:31.241 --> 01:43:33.520
<v Speaker 3>but not because of what he did in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ring.</v>

2441
01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.880
<v Speaker 3>It's more so because of what he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside the ring is why I hold him in</v>

2442
01:43:38.891 --> 01:43:42.430
<v Speaker 3>such high regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Roy Jones Jr course,</v>

2443
01:43:42.431 --> 01:43:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Roy Jones.</v>

2444
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:45.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's prime.</v>

2445
01:43:45.671 --> 01:43:47.680
<v Speaker 3>There was nobody like Roy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2446
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:50.530
<v Speaker 3>on a completely different level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't even Javin.</v>

2447
01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:54.400
<v Speaker 3>He was in with a left hook and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>most career too.</v>

2448
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2449
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:59.040
<v Speaker 3>it was weird shaped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His biceps were giant,</v>

2450
01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.370
<v Speaker 3>but he has a small triceps biceps with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack.</v>

2451
01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:04.940
<v Speaker 3>He went all the way up to heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>

2452
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.030
<v Speaker 3>And won beat John Ruiz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The heavyweight title too.</v>

2453
01:44:08.031 --> 01:44:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to talk about boxing.</v>

2454
01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:11.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2455
01:44:11.761 --> 01:44:13.940
<v Speaker 3>Go Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all fucking boxing,</v>

2456
01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:15.770
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2457
01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan of boxing too.</v>

2458
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:19.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though a woman made your number one</v>

2459
01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:20.590
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2460
01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Like mma better because anything can</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

2461
01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.270
<v Speaker 1>You can get head kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He get kicked down,</v>

2462
01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.031
<v Speaker 1>strangled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2463
01:44:28.031 --> 01:44:29.470
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many possibilities that it's</v>

2464
01:44:29.471 --> 01:44:31.610
<v Speaker 1>more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I call him and May I see,</v>

2465
01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll call it high level problem solving</v>
<v Speaker 1>with dire physical consequences.</v>

2466
01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2467
01:44:36.490 --> 01:44:38.020
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>X for days,</v>

2468
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.700
<v Speaker 1>these tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have all these tools.</v>

2469
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:42.980
<v Speaker 1>He has all these tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd go in there and you try to figure</v>

2470
01:44:42.981 --> 01:44:45.770
<v Speaker 1>out who's got the best approach and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be able to use their</v>

2471
01:44:45.771 --> 01:44:47.150
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be able to use their</v>

2472
01:44:47.151 --> 01:44:48.170
<v Speaker 1>talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their skill,</v>

2473
01:44:48.171 --> 01:44:50.390
<v Speaker 1>their dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to be able to figure out a</v>

2474
01:44:50.391 --> 01:44:51.470
<v Speaker 1>way to solve your problem?</v>

2475
01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about nate bees?</v>

2476
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:55.970
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love fucking,</v>

2477
01:44:56.790 --> 01:45:00.130
<v Speaker 3>and I met him at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a fight in UFC fight.</v>

2478
01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:04.510
<v Speaker 3>He was the humblest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so nice.</v>

2479
01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:05.780
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2480
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:08.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fucking Jack like you,</v>

2481
01:45:08.021 --> 01:45:12.330
<v Speaker 3>but I do my pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like fucking you are fucking killer man.</v>

2482
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:14.250
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's another,</v>

2483
01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:15.370
<v Speaker 3>he's another guy.</v>

2484
01:45:15.450 --> 01:45:19.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a perfect example of how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't make everyone trained the same</v>

2485
01:45:19.441 --> 01:45:20.730
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's incredibly successful,</v>

2486
01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:23.250
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of his training is not weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting here.</v>

2487
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:27.480
<v Speaker 3>He does triathlons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does his Jujitsu and it's kickbox</v>

2488
01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:29.070
<v Speaker 1>singing all the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on top of that,</v>

2489
01:45:29.071 --> 01:45:30.960
<v Speaker 1>like he does crazy endurance work.</v>

2490
01:45:31.050 --> 01:45:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nick and nick.</v>

2491
01:45:33.331 --> 01:45:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Amy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love brothers,</v>

2492
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:36.160
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2493
01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.790
<v Speaker 3>I may have to King Mo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2494
01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:42.270
<v Speaker 3>he was real cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys at fights.</v>

2495
01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2496
01:45:44.370 --> 01:45:47.190
<v Speaker 3>the most famous referee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big John McCarthy,</v>

2497
01:45:47.610 --> 01:45:49.320
<v Speaker 3>McCarthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent guy.</v>

2498
01:45:49.730 --> 01:45:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was really friendly.</v>

2499
01:45:51.610 --> 01:45:54.030
<v Speaker 3>I was a very good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to think.</v>

2500
01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:56.970
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't really figure out why the guy</v>

2501
01:45:56.971 --> 01:45:59.130
<v Speaker 3>liked me so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Saint Pierre,</v>

2502
01:45:59.131 --> 01:46:01.410
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to make a special,</v>

2503
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:03.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a video for me before.</v>

2504
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:06.170
<v Speaker 3>It's one of one of his big fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to,</v>

2505
01:46:06.171 --> 01:46:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm spitting all over the mic and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking hardcore.</v>

2506
01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.140
<v Speaker 3>And then he made a video back for me the</v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

2507
01:46:13.141 --> 01:46:16.140
<v Speaker 3>I had his fucking fuck George Saint</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pierre had his fucking phone number,</v>

2508
01:46:16.141 --> 01:46:17.140
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He calls me and says,</v>

2509
01:46:17.141 --> 01:46:17.940
<v Speaker 3>ct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

2510
01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.560
<v Speaker 3>can you do a one arm pull up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2511
01:46:19.561 --> 01:46:20.670
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do what he said,</v>

2512
01:46:20.671 --> 01:46:22.950
<v Speaker 3>I can't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see who could be the first one to</v>

2513
01:46:22.951 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 3>do a one arm pull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say your own George t t.</v>

2514
01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:27.713
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2515
01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2516
01:46:29.250 --> 01:46:31.350
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2517
01:46:31.530 --> 01:46:36.160
<v Speaker 3>understand why fighters like me so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't understand why he didn't like</v>

2518
01:46:36.161 --> 01:46:37.980
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fighters need motivation,</v>

2519
01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:40.200
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess what it is.</v>

2520
01:46:40.201 --> 01:46:41.034
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2521
01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.190
<v Speaker 1>that's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2522
01:46:42.191 --> 01:46:43.930
<v Speaker 1>because you're real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 100% real.</v>

2523
01:46:43.931 --> 01:46:44.950
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are who you are.</v>

2524
01:46:44.951 --> 01:46:49.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't put on any false airs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also inspiration is critical for</v>

2525
01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:50.370
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always tired.</v>

2526
01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:53.510
<v Speaker 1>They're always trying to find the energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep going.</v>

2527
01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:57.000
<v Speaker 1>They're always trying to find that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed to get up and keep going.</v>

2528
01:46:57.270 --> 01:47:01.500
<v Speaker 1>When you're two months into camp and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day is a grind and you're just</v>

2529
01:47:01.501 --> 01:47:03.000
<v Speaker 1>exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2530
01:47:03.001 --> 01:47:05.670
<v Speaker 1>and it's repetitive there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly drilling,</v>

2531
01:47:05.671 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 1>constantly sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and conditioning.</v>

2532
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:08.490
<v Speaker 1>You're swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're running,</v>

2533
01:47:08.491 --> 01:47:09.450
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you doing that,</v>

2534
01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:10.553
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2535
01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:15.030
<v Speaker 1>the impending moment of that fight is</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly looming in the background of</v>

2536
01:47:15.031 --> 01:47:16.830
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no escape from it.</v>

2537
01:47:16.831 --> 01:47:21.180
<v Speaker 1>And like you need like sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need like a ct Fletcher video to get you</v>

2538
01:47:21.181 --> 01:47:21.790
<v Speaker 1>over the hump.</v>

2539
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:23.600
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I,</v>

2540
01:47:23.601 --> 01:47:28.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the utmost respect for fighters,</v>

2541
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:32.830
<v Speaker 3>boxers and or mma guys especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2542
01:47:33.250 --> 01:47:37.630
<v Speaker 3>anybody is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the guy who gets knocked</v>

2543
01:47:37.631 --> 01:47:41.200
<v Speaker 3>out every time he steps in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I respect the fuck out of him because he</v>

2544
01:47:41.201 --> 01:47:45.460
<v Speaker 3>had the testicular fortitude to step</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the fucking gate man and get in</v>

2545
01:47:45.461 --> 01:47:47.740
<v Speaker 3>there and actually do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know Joe?</v>

2546
01:47:47.770 --> 01:47:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2547
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:53.750
<v Speaker 3>but people don't understand how much it</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes to just take that trip down in</v>

2548
01:47:56.590 --> 01:48:00.550
<v Speaker 3>actually getting that cage and face</v>
<v Speaker 3>another man who's trying to take your</v>

2549
01:48:00.551 --> 01:48:03.970
<v Speaker 3>fucking head off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That takes a tremendous,</v>

2550
01:48:04.150 --> 01:48:09.150
<v Speaker 3>I remember how much you took fighting at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the long beach arena and just the crowd</v>

2551
01:48:11.171 --> 01:48:13.540
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know there's nothing compared to</v>

2552
01:48:13.541 --> 01:48:15.700
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He may cry in the half people.</v>

2553
01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.980
<v Speaker 3>That crowd makes a big fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

2554
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:21.040
<v Speaker 3>It makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got so fucking nervous,</v>

2555
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:25.110
<v Speaker 3>everything that I had learned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking forgot.</v>

2556
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:27.370
<v Speaker 3>As soon as it got kicked me upside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

2557
01:48:27.490 --> 01:48:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I forgot her every fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every quarter,</v>

2558
01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.860
<v Speaker 3>all that shit went right out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went and tried to kill,</v>

2559
01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I forgot everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went straight to compton there.</v>

2560
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:38.770
<v Speaker 3>I forgot all my cards and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2561
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:39.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2562
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:43.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a tremendous,</v>

2563
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:48.400
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I respect the guy so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I have an inkling of an idea.</v>

2564
01:48:48.401 --> 01:48:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a real idea cause I ain't</v>
<v Speaker 3>never done this.</v>

2565
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:55.470
<v Speaker 3>But I have an inkling of an idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes to actually get into an octagon</v>

2566
01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:59.720
<v Speaker 3>and before all those downs of people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>put when the millions of people watching</v>

2567
01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:03.140
<v Speaker 3>on TV and perform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2568
01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:07.620
<v Speaker 3>And rise and rise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can sit fucking case</v>

2569
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:12.020
<v Speaker 1>guys actually literally fight better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they train better inside the cage.</v>

2570
01:49:12.021 --> 01:49:15.320
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the rare human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when the chips are down,</v>

2571
01:49:15.321 --> 01:49:18.050
<v Speaker 1>when it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the situation is intense pressure,</v>

2572
01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.190
<v Speaker 1>they shine.</v>

2573
01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Why are at their best?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a problem?</v>

2574
01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think you would have a problem in</v>

2575
01:49:25.131 --> 01:49:28.460
<v Speaker 3>your youth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you got a guy in trouble to pound on</v>

2576
01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:29.294
<v Speaker 3>that guy?</v>

2577
01:49:29.970 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hard if you've been hurt before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing and the guy,</v>

2578
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:34.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of guys get very upset</v>

2579
01:49:34.741 --> 01:49:37.590
<v Speaker 1>when the referee doesn't stop the fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>

2580
01:49:37.650 --> 01:49:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And I think for good reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they'll look at the referee then</v>

2581
01:49:39.871 --> 01:49:40.740
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2582
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 1>How many times you want me to hit this</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude?</v>

2583
01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's barely defending himself.</v>

2584
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he's out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2585
01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:49.980
<v Speaker 1>in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the heat of the battle and you,</v>

2586
01:49:49.981 --> 01:49:51.670
<v Speaker 1>you catch someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smashing him,</v>

2587
01:49:51.671 --> 01:49:52.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2588
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:56.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it also depends on what,</v>

2589
01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:58.810
<v Speaker 1>how you feel about that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the recent fight between,</v>

2590
01:49:58.811 --> 01:49:59.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2591
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Tj dillashaw and cody Garbrandt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had this intense and tense feud.</v>

2592
01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:04.950
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2593
01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:06.820
<v Speaker 1>tj catches him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurts him,</v>

2594
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:08.680
<v Speaker 1>drops of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then puts him out and you could tell</v>

2595
01:50:08.681 --> 01:50:10.960
<v Speaker 1>when he smashed it and when he's out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2596
01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:13.130
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not thinking good things about</v>

2597
01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:14.770
<v Speaker 1>lifting off the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2598
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:17.050
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when cody got up and he was</v>

2599
01:50:17.051 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 1>just still days and t j's in his face</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming in his face,</v>

2600
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:22.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2601
01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.090
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2602
01:50:24.570 --> 01:50:25.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any others</v>

2603
01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2604
01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2605
01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:32.120
<v Speaker 2>talked to a UFC fighter I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not gonna mention his name</v>

2606
01:50:32.761 --> 01:50:33.750
<v Speaker 2>because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2607
01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:36.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he wants me to or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not going to do it.</v>

2608
01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:39.960
<v Speaker 2>But he told me that he goes into some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>

2609
01:50:39.961 --> 01:50:43.680
<v Speaker 2>not all of them having a real fear of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting his opponent.</v>

2610
01:50:44.490 --> 01:50:49.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's really hard to do your</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute best when you have that fear</v>

2611
01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:51.990
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2612
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:53.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing real damage.</v>

2613
01:50:53.761 --> 01:50:55.680
<v Speaker 2>To your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one more element.</v>

2614
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Think this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he would be a champion.</v>

2615
01:50:59.610 --> 01:51:03.870
<v Speaker 2>If you completely get rid of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard.</v>

2616
01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:07.590
<v Speaker 2>But when you're going in the ring</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping,</v>

2617
01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean in your Aco job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

2618
01:51:10.290 --> 01:51:14.580
<v Speaker 2>to stop this guy to stop you up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going in and hoping that</v>

2619
01:51:14.581 --> 01:51:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you don't hurt him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he,</v>

2620
01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can perform to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>utmost capabilities if that's,</v>

2621
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:22.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really,</v>

2622
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:24.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foremost in your mind and I don't want</v>

2623
01:51:24.571 --> 01:51:25.280
<v Speaker 2>to hurt this.</v>

2624
01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think fighters only have a certain</v>

2625
01:51:26.961 --> 01:51:31.160
<v Speaker 1>amount of time they can compete as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the overwhelming reality of what</v>

2626
01:51:31.161 --> 01:51:32.450
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set Tent.</v>

2627
01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're 19 2021,</v>

2628
01:51:35.631 --> 01:51:39.320
<v Speaker 1>they're just fucking full of piss and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vinegar and shit and lightning and</v>

2629
01:51:39.321 --> 01:51:41.790
<v Speaker 1>kicking people in the head and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2630
01:51:42.090 --> 01:51:44.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as time goes on,</v>

2631
01:51:44.511 --> 01:51:46.500
<v Speaker 1>you deal with your own injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2632
01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:51.580
<v Speaker 1>you start to see people just suffer the</v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions of a career in combat</v>

2633
01:51:52.191 --> 01:51:53.990
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as you get older,</v>

2634
01:51:53.991 --> 01:51:56.870
<v Speaker 1>you just realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this is really that you're doing.</v>

2635
01:51:56.970 --> 01:51:59.280
<v Speaker 2>So you think rumble Johnson was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

2636
01:51:59.730 --> 01:52:00.563
<v Speaker 2>I think ramp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

2637
01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:04.590
<v Speaker 1>rumble is the scariest fucking guy at</v>
<v Speaker 1>two oh five pounds.</v>

2638
01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2639
01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:08.310
<v Speaker 1>And then decides after a world title vi</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2640
01:52:08.490 --> 01:52:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hug do's.</v>

2641
01:52:11.281 --> 01:52:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Get hit in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2642
01:52:12.481 --> 01:52:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to,</v>

2643
01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:16.050
<v Speaker 1>as a really good athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm preaching real good at it.</v>

2644
01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Take it easy everybody,</v>

2645
01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:18.363
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2646
01:52:18.570 --> 01:52:22.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to Ron on social media back and</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he's talked about coming back now.</v>

2650
01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2651
01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2652
01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:38.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that some of them is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make him an offer he can't refuse then</v>

2653
01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:40.340
<v Speaker 2>he's very marketable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that.</v>

2654
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do what he can do.</v>

2655
01:52:41.711 --> 01:52:44.800
<v Speaker 2>The people destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GTFO man,</v>

2656
01:52:44.801 --> 01:52:46.760
<v Speaker 2>just fucking be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good,</v>

2657
01:52:46.770 --> 01:52:47.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2658
01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:48.290
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

2659
01:52:48.291 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 1>if someone who cut weight when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have,</v>

2660
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I hate weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the worst thing that</v>

2661
01:52:53.871 --> 01:52:56.140
<v Speaker 1>fighters do to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's even worse than finding</v>

2662
01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.500
<v Speaker 1>these guys that get organ failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman just died in Australia who was</v>

2663
01:53:00.501 --> 01:53:02.450
<v Speaker 1>cutting weight for an amateur kickboxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

2664
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:05.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible practice that people do.</v>

2665
01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:08.360
<v Speaker 1>But he was one of the biggest weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutters ever.</v>

2666
01:53:08.361 --> 01:53:11.000
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well over 200 pounds getting down to one</v>

2667
01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:13.940
<v Speaker 1>70 and when he was at one 70 he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashing people.</v>

2668
01:53:13.941 --> 01:53:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as long as it was quick because you</v>

2669
01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:20.450
<v Speaker 1>write dehydrated himself so bad that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he gets into the third,</v>

2670
01:53:20.451 --> 01:53:22.340
<v Speaker 1>fourth and fifth round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just had nothing left.</v>

2671
01:53:22.341 --> 01:53:25.430
<v Speaker 1>He just was so drained at heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will be fucked.</v>

2672
01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.333
<v Speaker 2>Terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terror,</v>

2673
01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.760
<v Speaker 2>terror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terror.</v>

2674
01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2675
01:53:30.090 --> 01:53:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he really wants to do it,</v>

2676
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:33.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe he just needed a break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean who knows?</v>

2677
01:53:34.110 --> 01:53:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes guys just need to take some</v>
<v Speaker 2>time off and he's gonna offer him,</v>

2678
01:53:37.921 --> 01:53:41.980
<v Speaker 2>cause he's a very marketable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's in the weed business now.</v>

2679
01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I did see a rumble puppies or to</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbing a few things going on.</v>

2680
01:53:50.641 --> 01:53:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a candle.</v>

2681
01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:53:52.561 --> 01:53:53.280
<v Speaker 2>He's involved</v>

2683
01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:57.240
<v Speaker 1>some businesses and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously not damaged like when you</v>

2684
01:53:57.250 --> 01:54:01.200
<v Speaker 1>talked and he's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally there.</v>

2685
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:04.110
<v Speaker 1>He's not suffered the damage that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fighters have suffered.</v>

2686
01:54:04.111 --> 01:54:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So if he did decide to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's at a good place in his life</v>

2687
01:54:08.311 --> 01:54:09.031
<v Speaker 1>where he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2688
01:54:09.031 --> 01:54:12.570
<v Speaker 1>he's accomplished a lot and he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to walk away unscathed.</v>

2689
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as he,</v>

2690
01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can make money doing other shit.</v>

2691
01:54:16.821 --> 01:54:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would just touch people.</v>

2692
01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would see the lights go out.</v>

2693
