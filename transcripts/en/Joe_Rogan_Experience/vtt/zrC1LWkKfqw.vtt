<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

157
00:03:58.501 --> 00:03:59.820
<v Speaker 1>You're your to come up blood brother.</v>

158
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I did the same thing.</v>

159
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:01.854
<v Speaker 1>And like for me,</v>

160
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.593
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

161
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.240
<v Speaker 1>it happens for weeks for me to</v>

162
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.201
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

163
00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:07.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

164
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm just amazed.</v>

165
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm still alive and like the fact that like,</v>

166
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm so self destructive,</v>

168
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.720
<v Speaker 1>like my mother,</v>

169
00:04:12.721 --> 00:04:13.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.130
<v Speaker 1>she's such a sweetheart,</v>

171
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:14.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

172
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like,</v>

174
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.230
<v Speaker 1>we're responsible for her.</v>

175
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's like the only thing that keeps me from like,</v>

176
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.920
<v Speaker 1>crossing that line of like,</v>

177
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:20.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:21.360

180
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.363
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

181
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

182
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:24.871
<v Speaker 1>because honestly,</v>

183
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:25.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>when you're a comic and you're out there balls deep in the road,</v>

185
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

186
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>do you really care?</v>

187
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

188
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:31.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like you just looking for the next fucking wild.</v>

189
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.730
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

190
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It is fun now.</v>

191
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:37.530
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

192
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

193
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.680
<v Speaker 1>now it's fun to have a bunch of shots with some people and kind of do high five</v>

194
00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:44.330
<v Speaker 1>and the problem is the next day.</v>

195
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem.</v>

197
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.580
<v Speaker 1>But then now you get older,</v>

198
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:47.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

199
00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>And like you got a mortgage and you've got to do,</v>

200
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you got kids and everything like that.</v>

202
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

203
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

204
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I just wished blues didn't do any damage.</v>

205
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I wish booze was like weed or you did it.</v>

206
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>You never felt the next day you're fine.</v>

207
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Well because we're American,</v>

208
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>we fucking work hard and we drink hard and we and we,</v>

209
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.261
<v Speaker 1>and we're like,</v>

210
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

211
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.513
<v Speaker 1>We have the right to do it.</v>

212
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.151
<v Speaker 1>Cause your,</v>

213
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>someone could reengineer booze.</v>

214
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

215
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>some scientists need to get on this whole Buddhist thing and figure it out.</v>

216
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Give me the effects of booze,</v>

217
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>make it tastes like booze.</v>

219
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>But figuring out a way where it doesn't wreck your system.</v>

220
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a way to recreate being drunk without,</v>

221
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>without making you just poisoned.</v>

222
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

223
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean really,</v>

224
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>where we're so retarded,</v>

225
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>we go poison each other.</v>

226
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.170
<v Speaker 1>It has like so many good effects for it.</v>

227
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:28.280
<v Speaker 1>But it was never my drug.</v>

228
00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:28.820
<v Speaker 1>But I like,</v>

229
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I totally am like,</v>

230
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>we're all like,</v>

231
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 1>lot of guys don't get him our don't like it.</v>

232
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Rather Stan hope doesn't like it.</v>

233
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

234
00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:35.330
<v Speaker 1>no we were boozing and like,</v>

235
00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you know drug guys,</v>

236
00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:36.710
<v Speaker 1>we weren't going to,</v>

237
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.580
<v Speaker 1>what was it though about the weed that you didn't like?</v>

238
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Well no offense,</v>

239
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.540
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was kind of prissy.</v>

240
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was a sit around and like there's something about weed and</v>

241
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Speaker 1>like sitting on a couch and then all of a sudden there's a guitar there for some</v>

242
00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>reason and then now you're hearing a million parodies.</v>

243
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.210
<v Speaker 1>You're hearing a million fucking ditties and everyone's giggling and then they</v>

244
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.293
<v Speaker 1>even don't.</v>

245
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>But if you're hanging around with the idiots and they get high,</v>

246
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

247
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>You're in for some profound stupidity.</v>

248
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>But I think it facilitates thinking.</v>

249
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

250
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I can show you how a lot of people don't like it cause it makes you paranoid</v>

251
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

252
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>because it can,</v>

253
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>it's if you're not into that,</v>

254
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>if you're not in to looking at yourself,</v>

255
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:13.784
<v Speaker 1>it can fuck with you.</v>
