<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>

9
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 2>It's been fucking up a little bit lately.</v>

10
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.883
<v Speaker 2>How are you man?</v>

11
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me.</v>

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.241
<v Speaker 2>My pleasure.</v>

13
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:18.721
<v Speaker 2>My pleasure.</v>

14
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 2>you brought me a nice conspiracy book.</v>

16
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I want you back.</v>

17
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.253
<v Speaker 2>I want you to</v>

18
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.813
<v Speaker 2>get bored with it.</v>

19
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

20
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I just had a lunch with Eric von,</v>

21
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.344
<v Speaker 2>Danica.</v>

22
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

23
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 2>he's the author of Church of the Gods.</v>

24
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 2>The last two hours we've been talking to ancient aliens.</v>

25
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 2>I was deep when I was like in,</v>

26
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 2>in my late teens.</v>

27
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:44.331
<v Speaker 2>I was deep in Zachariah stitching and Inaki filium I'm pronouncing it wrong.</v>

28
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 2>That lead my thing.</v>

29
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.703
<v Speaker 2>Nephilim,</v>

30
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 2>planet x Nibiru all over.</v>

31
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

32
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of the conversation we had today at lunch.</v>

33
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>

34
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 2>The problem with someone,</v>

35
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

36
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not that he's not a dishonest person,</v>

37
00:00:58.381 --> 00:00:59.071
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>

38
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with anybody that is involved with like a book like this is that</v>

39
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 2>you're so all in,</v>

40
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 2>you're so committed to this idea.</v>

41
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.341
<v Speaker 2>Like I asked him,</v>

42
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:09.091
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I asked him,</v>

43
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:09.301
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

44
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 2>what is the most compelling piece of evidence?</v>

45
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.211
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

46
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:13.044
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

47
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 2>he said the,</v>

48
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 2>the tablet and [inaudible] I don't know if you're aware of that one.</v>

49
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

50
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.863
<v Speaker 2>The one of the,</v>

51
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 2>the Aztec Aztec or a mine I guess the mind guy.</v>

52
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 2>It's mine.</v>

53
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

54
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 2>who's laying back.</v>

55
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

56
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 2>it looks like in some sort of a throne with five below him and he's manipulating</v>

57
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 2>these knobs and shit.</v>

58
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 2>And that means that aliens landed and seeded them with technology.</v>

59
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

60
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 2>They always make a little bit of a jump.</v>

61
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a big one that's like evil Knievel.</v>

62
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of a jump between that bird is really a symbol of a flying</v>

63
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:48.181
<v Speaker 2>saucer.</v>

64
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:48.961
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that too.</v>

65
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that one like that bird.</v>

66
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:51.091
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

67
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:51.211
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

68
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you a question.</v>

69
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't they ask you a flying saucer right into the cave?</v>

70
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.941
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

71
00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:57.171
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

72
00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 2>let you don't know how things work.</v>

73
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 2>The more interesting ones and the art depictions that there's some really</v>

74
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 2>ancient depictions of people that look like they're in these flying saucer type</v>

75
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:08.011
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

76
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 2>like flying through the air and they're in some sort of a like,</v>

77
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

79
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 2>some painting.</v>

80
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.671
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>

82
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.250
<v Speaker 2>those are really interesting cause like what were they trying to say?</v>

83
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Like what were they,</v>

84
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 2>what were they depicting?</v>

85
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:19.704
<v Speaker 2>And those things.</v>

86
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all very interesting,</v>

87
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think you,</v>

88
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:23.300
<v Speaker 2>and you've had Graham Hancock on.</v>

89
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 2>So to me when I heard him,</v>

90
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:25.561
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

91
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:30.561
<v Speaker 2>that makes more sense that we were just a civilization that had reached an apex</v>

92
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 2>and it got wiped out by some cataclysmic event and then we had to rebuild.</v>

93
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 2>But is does he think that we got all of our technology from other worldly</v>

94
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 2>sources or no,</v>

95
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

96
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

97
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

98
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Ram is much more in line with this.</v>

99
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

100
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 2>this theory that doctor Robert Schoch has been putting forth,</v>

101
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the weirder ones that I've had on the podcast.</v>

102
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.101
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

103
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 2>because he's a rock solid geologist,</v>

104
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 2>professor at Boston University,</v>

105
00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:59.310
<v Speaker 2>like really well established.</v>

106
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 2>His credentials are,</v>

107
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.651
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

109
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>they're as good as it gets.</v>

110
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 2>And he was saying that he thinks that there was a mass coronal mass ejection</v>

111
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around 12,000 years ago and it was literally raining lightning all</v>

112
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.021
<v Speaker 2>over the world.</v>

113
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And decimated the population of land mammals and,</v>

114
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 2>and people.</v>

115
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Just what got the dinosaurs?</v>

116
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

117
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.991
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

118
00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

119
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 2>This was way late.</v>

120
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.983
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>

121
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>This is like my bad.</v>

122
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.703
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

123
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 2>they think in the neighborhood of 12,000 years ago.</v>

124
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:31.100
<v Speaker 2>They think this is recent.</v>

125
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

126
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 2>This is what Graham Hancock's work indicates as well.</v>

127
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.101
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

128
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:41.101
<v Speaker 2>Graham Hancock and him were together on the Sphinx because Robert Schoch was the</v>

129
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 2>geologist they brought in to examine the erosion marks on the temple.</v>

130
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 2>That's Sphinx.</v>

131
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And his conclusion was that this is the result of thousands of years of</v>

133
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:52.204
<v Speaker 2>rainfall.</v>

134
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

135
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that was the last time there were significant rainfall in the</v>

136
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Nile Valley was 9,000 BC.</v>

137
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.370
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have to have thousands of years before that to create these deep water</v>

138
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:05.190
<v Speaker 2>based fishers or water created fissures to,</v>

139
00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 2>they're saying the Sphinx was there a lot longer than we imagined.</v>

140
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

141
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 2>So that coincides with a lot of these,</v>

142
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

143
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.241
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

144
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 2>the people that want to push back the dates of civilization,</v>

145
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 2>what they think is that it all points to something big happening at the end of</v>

146
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:19.921
<v Speaker 2>the ice age.</v>

147
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 2>So something big happening between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago.</v>

149
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Why don't mainstream scientists just go now?</v>

150
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a reason for this.</v>

151
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a reason that mainstream thought leaders in any area don't</v>

152
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 2>allow the fringe in why?</v>

153
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.040
<v Speaker 2>What's the big thing here with keeping these guys?</v>

154
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Is it that they would just have to go back and relook at every history book?</v>

155
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

156
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning there was nothing,</v>

157
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.631
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

158
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 2>So when these guys were proposing this,</v>

159
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 2>there was very little evidence,</v>

160
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 2>but now that evidence is stacking up and there's all these ancient structures</v>

161
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.410
<v Speaker 2>that they're finding like go Beckley Tepi yeah.</v>

162
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>If once they found that one and they realize that it was intentionally covered</v>

163
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 2>up 12,000 years ago.</v>

164
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>So this is like,</v>

165
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 2>this is undeniable.</v>

166
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Everyone agrees on it.</v>

167
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 2>And so then they have to say,</v>

169
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:04.721
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

170
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 2>well then hunter gatherers must've made this cause 12,000 years ago.</v>

171
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>That's all we had was a hunter gatherers.</v>

172
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 2>But it's really sophisticated construction and it's very difficult to do.</v>

173
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 2>And they're enormous.</v>

174
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 2>And they have three dimensional animals that are carved into them,</v>

175
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 2>which means they actually had to carve away the outside to create the animal.</v>

176
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Instead of carving the animal into the stone,</v>

177
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>they actually carved the stone out around the animal.</v>

178
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 2>So these animals are like climbing on the outside of these stone columns.</v>

179
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:30.890
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird stuff.</v>

180
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

181
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 2>but who the fuck knows I,</v>

182
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:33.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

183
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:38.911
<v Speaker 2>I lean more towards cataclysmic disaster because there's so many of them that we</v>

184
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 2>know for sure have happened.</v>

185
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

186
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 2>But between the one 65 million years ago in the Yucatan that killed the</v>

187
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs,</v>

188
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.260
<v Speaker 2>just reading about the ARkStorm that's going to hit la,</v>

189
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 2>which he'll just be 60 days of rain Wednesday,</v>

190
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 2>it happens every 200 years.</v>

191
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:54.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

192
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:54.521
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

193
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 2>this is an article I read every 200 years.</v>

195
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>La in the area</v>

196
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 3>gets 60 90 days of rain and everybody has to move and things.</v>

197
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 3>This is supposedly what somebody sang,</v>

198
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 3>somebody with a bunch of panicked comedians who are all thinking about,</v>

199
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 3>they're worried about the ARkStorm now it's fun to think about stupid the best.</v>

200
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:19.110
<v Speaker 3>It's thinking about like conspiracies and big foot.</v>

201
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

202
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Ufo shows and shit like that.</v>

203
00:06:20.761 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 3>It teaches you how to think a little,</v>

204
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 3>like when I was a teenager,</v>

205
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I was smoking weed with my buddies.</v>

206
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Like we would,</v>

207
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to research these things.</v>

208
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to cross reference information.</v>

209
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't just swallow the narrative.</v>

210
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 3>You had to literally go well and then you'd have to use critical thinking to go,</v>

211
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 3>does this make sense?</v>

212
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Would this have happened?</v>

213
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 3>Could maybe could Lee Harvey Oswald at?</v>

214
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.771
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>

215
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:42.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

216
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 3>would he have acted alone?</v>

217
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Hah.</v>

218
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.991
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

219
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 3>you have to think about all these things.</v>

220
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.541
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

221
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:47.701
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

222
00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I do think since Trump got elected,</v>

223
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theorist had been demonized and nobody talks about that.</v>

224
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.441
<v Speaker 3>This is a little bit,</v>

225
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:54.621
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

226
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 3>it was always going on.</v>

227
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 3>It was even before that there were being demonized.</v>

228
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.011
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

229
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

230
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Cause worried about the other groups,</v>

231
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:00.674
<v Speaker 3>which is fair.</v>

232
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.680
<v Speaker 3>I get that there's the people in the cages.</v>

233
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 3>No good.</v>

234
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not for any of that.</v>

235
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 3>People in the cage,</v>

236
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.601
<v Speaker 3>they will.</v>

237
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 3>The kids in the cages is not good.</v>

238
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean the family separation?</v>

239
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

240
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.833
<v Speaker 3>all the course.</v>

241
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.713
<v Speaker 3>Real stop.</v>

242
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 3>But I think that people think that conspiracy theories got Trump elected,</v>

243
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.640
<v Speaker 3>so now it's like cool to hate conspiracy theorists or people that are like,</v>

244
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 3>let's take another look at this.</v>

245
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 3>There's so many factors that got Trump elected,</v>

246
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

247
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 3>And it was a perfect storm of people getting,</v>

248
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 3>getting fed up of political correctness.</v>

249
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Someone coming along that's not a politician.</v>

250
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.671
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

251
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 3>the system is so rigged that after a while you just like Jesus Christ.</v>

252
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 3>How many more of these fake puppets were going to put an office?</v>

253
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

254
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I say this to comics.</v>

255
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:43.761
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

256
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 3>everybody's done a show where everybody goes out and bombs with their material</v>

257
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 3>and then one guy gets up and just goes,</v>

258
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:54.911
<v Speaker 3>fuck this and screams and yells and destroys because that's what the room wanted</v>

259
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.151
<v Speaker 3>the whole night.</v>

260
00:07:56.151 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 3>They wanted somebody to come up and just realize how fucked everything was and</v>

261
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 3>how nobody was having a good time.</v>

262
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of what Trump was.</v>

263
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Trump was the guy that came out and just riffed.</v>

264
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 3>He went out there with no material.</v>

265
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:09.510
<v Speaker 3>He just went out there and rift and he went and,</v>

266
00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

267
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 3>when I heard,</v>

268
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure you've seen this speech where he talks about Ben Carson going after</v>

269
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 3>his mother with a hammer and trying to stab his friend.</v>

270
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 3>This was one of the funniest things.</v>

271
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 3>He was speaking and he was given a stump speech.</v>

272
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where it was.</v>

273
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>

274
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 3>wasn't in I will,</v>

275
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 3>but he was referencing Iowa and he's talking about Ben Carson's book and that</v>

276
00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Ben Carson had admitted to going after his mother with a hammer and trying to</v>

277
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:37.090
<v Speaker 3>stab his friend with an,</v>

278
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:37.401
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

279
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:38.030
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

280
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 3>these are in and Trump is talking about it.</v>

281
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 3>Me and my friend would driving,</v>

282
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

283
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 3>at in New York City.</v>

284
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 3>We were laughing so hard.</v>

285
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:45.944
<v Speaker 3>I said this guys,</v>

286
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.061
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

287
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:47.894
<v Speaker 3>he's going to win.</v>

288
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.321
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

289
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why he's going to win.</v>

290
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 3>I cannot stop watching this.</v>

291
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.763
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

292
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.960
<v Speaker 3>I am so fixated by the idea that there's a guy like this on the national stage</v>

293
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.930
<v Speaker 3>and he sang whatever he won.</v>

294
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 3>There was something intoxicating about that.</v>

295
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of the things you were saying were horrible,</v>

296
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 3>but he was saying them.</v>

297
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 3>And then on the other side you had Hillary Clinton who was just,</v>

298
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 3>they scripted Oh,</v>

299
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 3>careful person.</v>

300
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:18.744
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

301
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 3>it's just boring to me.</v>

302
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm like sometimes he entertaining person wins because you can't take your eyes</v>

303
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.024
<v Speaker 3>off them.</v>

304
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Well in this case for sure,</v>

305
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean in the that it was a perfect,</v>

306
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

307
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 3>polar opposite between him and her,</v>

308
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

309
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 3>no experience versus vast amounts of experience.</v>

310
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 3>No real experience in the real world versus vast amount of experiences.</v>

311
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

312
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a lot going on between the two of them.</v>

313
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:47.281
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

314
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.114
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

315
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:49.430
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

316
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad way to choose</v>

317
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 3>runs really.</v>

318
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 3>It's very bad to look at candidates and go,</v>

319
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 3>who's the most entertaining?</v>

320
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:58.561
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

321
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 3>it's also a bad idea to have one person,</v>

322
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:01.201
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

323
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad idea to have this,</v>

324
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 3>this same system that was in place back when there was fucking,</v>

325
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

326
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.610
<v Speaker 3>a thousand people here.</v>

327
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 3>But I think we've really dealt,</v>

328
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 3>like we have one person that seems like we have one figurehead,</v>

329
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.530
<v Speaker 3>but we have kind of this permanent political class of people.</v>

330
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

331
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.270
<v Speaker 3>a nexus of powerful institutions where you have career politicians,</v>

332
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 3>career diplomats,</v>

333
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 3>career military service people that kind of don't leave.</v>

334
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's one of the reasons that we haven't changed the system is</v>

335
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 3>because one person can't ever do that much.</v>

336
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Even though Trump is wild and crazy and he's done a lot of bad things.</v>

337
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he would be allowed to deviate from many of the policies like</v>

338
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:44.971
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

339
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 3>His predecessors had kind of established,</v>

340
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I think that like the American government,</v>

341
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 3>and that's why this the like the deep state,</v>

342
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 3>which a lot of people ridicule.</v>

343
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 3>It's an undeniably true thing.</v>

344
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.341
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

345
00:10:56.341 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 3>our policies are not just one guy gets into office and he goes,</v>

346
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 3>here's how it is.</v>

347
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

348
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's the result of a lot of,</v>

349
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

350
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 3>private corporations lobbying,</v>

351
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.641
<v Speaker 3>forming,</v>

352
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of forming an agenda and a non democratic way.</v>

353
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

354
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.630
<v Speaker 3>they're not accountable at a lot of these people that work at the CIA or the FBI</v>

355
00:11:16.631 --> 00:11:17.464
<v Speaker 3>or the NSA.</v>

356
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are appointed.</v>

357
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 3>They're not elected.</v>

358
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

359
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 3>We have no oversight.</v>

360
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

361
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>

362
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 22 intelligence agencies now.</v>

363
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.550
<v Speaker 3>It's really that money.</v>

364
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:27.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

365
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Speaker 3>it's something absurd.</v>

366
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 3>How many could you name the FBI?</v>

367
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:31.201
<v Speaker 3>CIA,</v>

368
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 3>NSA?</v>

369
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

370
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 3>probably DEA,</v>

371
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 3>DEA,</v>

372
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:35.603
<v Speaker 3>and intelligence.</v>

373
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.010
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say it's an intelligence that they probably have intelligence</v>

374
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:38.880
<v Speaker 3>capabilities.</v>

375
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>

376
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.501
<v Speaker 3>FBI,</v>

377
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 3>CIA,</v>

378
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.053
<v Speaker 3>NSA,</v>

379
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

380
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 3>there's one and yet the dia,</v>

381
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 3>director of intelligence,</v>

382
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.611
<v Speaker 3>the Pentagon.</v>

383
00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:47.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

384
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's an entire agency,</v>

385
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:49.570
<v Speaker 3>but I think it,</v>

386
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:49.831
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

387
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 3>I think it has the capabilities,</v>

388
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 3>but we have all of these different,</v>

389
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's 22,</v>

390
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lot.</v>

391
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And they're all competing with each other.</v>

392
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 2>They're all competing because they all want money.</v>

393
00:11:58.061 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 2>They want budget.</v>

394
00:11:59.260 --> 00:11:59.981
<v Speaker 2>They all want,</v>

395
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing that people talking about,</v>

396
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 2>the deep state.</v>

397
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like we got them all.</v>

398
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

399
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Look at these guys who they are.</v>

400
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

401
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Here are all the people that are,</v>

402
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:06.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:07.410
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

404
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Listening.</v>

405
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Excited.</v>

406
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

407
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.740
<v Speaker 2>The fucking space troops that we have space that's going to be good and why not?</v>

408
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Why not a space for it will eventually,</v>

409
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:16.451
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

410
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Eventually you're going to have to have it.</v>

411
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

412
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.121
<v Speaker 2>Why not have it?</v>

413
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Now we have,</v>

414
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the national geospatial intelligence thing does.</v>

415
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.000
<v Speaker 2>They can't be any more relevant than space force.</v>

416
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:26.711
<v Speaker 2>Click on that one.</v>

417
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 2>National Geospatial Intelligence Agency shouldn't be any less important than the</v>

418
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:31.954
<v Speaker 2>space force.</v>

419
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows how many people were working on employs 16,000 thousand look</v>

420
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>

421
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Look at their motto.</v>

422
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down a little bit.</v>

423
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down.</v>

424
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.300
<v Speaker 2>No earth show the way.</v>

425
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Understand the world what that's founded in [inaudible] 96 yeah,</v>

426
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Clinton probably did.</v>

427
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 2>It's probably where he keeps his chicks.</v>

428
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>

429
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:50.390
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

430
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

431
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.641
<v Speaker 2>this is what I mean.</v>

432
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Like what the hell are these people doing now?</v>

433
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:54.311
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

434
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 2>16,000 employees with their motto?</v>

435
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.251
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

436
00:12:57.251 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>the earth show the way.</v>

437
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Understand the world.</v>

438
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a year like on a yoga studios,</v>

439
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.250
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

440
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:03.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

441
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:04.181
<v Speaker 2>it's absurd,</v>

442
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:07.360
<v Speaker 2>but they get billions of dollars to do whatever.</v>

443
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.593
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

444
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Speaker 2>put that back up there with the description.</v>

445
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

446
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

447
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.113
<v Speaker 2>It says there,</v>

448
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

449
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 2>it's under the United States Department of Defense and Intelligence Agency of</v>

450
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 2>the United States intelligence community with the primary mission of collecting,</v>

451
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.240
<v Speaker 2>analyzing and distributing geospatial intelligence in support of national</v>

452
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>

453
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.013
<v Speaker 2>which is why,</v>

454
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

455
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 2>What the Hell is geospatial intelligence?</v>

456
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what I mean.</v>

457
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 2>This is insane.</v>

458
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:35.591
<v Speaker 2>And if any,</v>

459
00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 2>if you ask a question,</v>

460
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:36.941
<v Speaker 2>if you go,</v>

461
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:37.031
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

462
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:37.811
<v Speaker 2>what do these guys do?</v>

463
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:39.620
<v Speaker 2>People yell at you and they started with,</v>

464
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

465
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:40.711
<v Speaker 2>you're the,</v>

466
00:13:40.711 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 2>you're a conspiracy theorist and you don't know this.</v>

467
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 2>I just want to know what geospatial intelligence is.</v>

468
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 2>It's probably something simple and now I'm going to look like an idiot.</v>

469
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It says it's intelligence about the human activity on earth derive from the</v>

470
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.820
<v Speaker 2>exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes,</v>

471
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.330
<v Speaker 2>assesses and visually depicts physical features and geographically referenced</v>

472
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:05.020
<v Speaker 2>activities on the Earth.</v>

473
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

474
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I think that's how we would know like that North Korea has a bomb size of</v>

475
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:11.960
<v Speaker 2>satellites.</v>

476
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Satellite Imagery I think.</v>

477
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.201
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

478
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:14.351
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

479
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a satellite agency too.</v>

480
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 2>I think we've uncovered a scam.</v>

481
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 2>I think we've uncovered a pretend agency that nobody in,</v>

482
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:24.370
<v Speaker 2>that there's a guy right now panicked in the table.</v>

483
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Spatial 16,000 other employees going,</v>

484
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:27.941
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

485
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to find a real job.</v>

486
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 2>We would study and shipping docs from space.</v>

487
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:34.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

488
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 2>we just got outed.</v>

489
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:35.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

490
00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:36.514
<v Speaker 2>What did they</v>

491
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.531
<v Speaker 2>just got outed on?</v>

492
00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Rogan is completely [inaudible].</v>

493
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not really there.</v>

494
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:43.990
<v Speaker 2>That was an actress.</v>

495
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.041
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>

496
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 2>That's an actress.</v>

497
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:46.961
<v Speaker 2>But this is what I mean,</v>

498
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:47.321
<v Speaker 2>if you could,</v>

499
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 2>if you look into this stuff,</v>

500
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 2>it starts to get crazy.</v>

501
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>The amount of people that are doing</v>

502
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.281
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

503
00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:53.190
<v Speaker 3>we have no idea what they're,</v>

504
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:53.571

<v Speaker 3>It's like Trump bad,</v>

570
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what the geospatial people are too.</v>

571
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to,</v>

572
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to throw my hat in with geospatial intelligence.</v>

573
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

574

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

576

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

578

<v Speaker 3>But listen again to standup comedians talking about what the world needs.</v>

579
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

580
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not great.</v>

581
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.450

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

583
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

584
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to stress this more than ever because of the fact that I have a</v>

585
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:22.731
<v Speaker 3>microphone.</v>

586
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:23.031
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

587
00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:24.110
<v Speaker 3>And people are listening.</v>

588
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Don't fucking pay attention to me.</v>

589
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

590
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I am not right.</v>

591
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:28.161
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

592
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:28.994
<v Speaker 3>the best thing is,</v>

593
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:29.910
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

594
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.270
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

595
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:30.711
<v Speaker 3>you don't know.</v>

596
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:31.560
<v Speaker 3>You might be right.</v>

597
00:16:31.561 --> 00:16:31.791
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

598
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 3>But I'm definitely not an expert.</v>

599
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Speaker 3>The best thing is if you go on Twitter and a comedian will tweet something</v>

600
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:38.054
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

601
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:38.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

602
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:40.910
<v Speaker 3>it's like we're living in fascism and then again,</v>

603
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.550
<v Speaker 3>like 400,000 likes and then the next tweet,</v>

604
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen this to go?</v>

605
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 3>And while you guys are here,</v>

606
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 3>check out my web series</v>

607
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.411
<v Speaker 3>and he'd go,</v>

608
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:51.771
<v Speaker 3>are we,</v>

609
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 3>are we living in fat?</v>

610
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 3>If we're living in fascism,</v>

611
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.040
<v Speaker 3>you too.</v>

612
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.140
<v Speaker 3>I have a web series.</v>

613
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.970
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a Webster's.</v>

614
00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 3>And do I have the time to luxuriate in your web series or should I start arming</v>

615
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:03.314
<v Speaker 3>myself?</v>

616
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.503
<v Speaker 3>Throw the gun?</v>

617
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.673
<v Speaker 3>What should I,</v>

618
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 3>what should I look at my phone?</v>

619
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:08.091
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

620
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:09.140
<v Speaker 3>which way should I go?</v>

621
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.191
<v Speaker 3>But that's all they do.</v>

622
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:10.611
<v Speaker 3>They go by,</v>

623
00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:10.971
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

624
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:11.804
<v Speaker 3>while you're here,</v>

625
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I have a patriot.</v>

626
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.440
<v Speaker 3>We're doing a project.</v>

627
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I'd like you to throw a few bucks there,</v>

628
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 3>but we're living in fascism and you know,</v>

629
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 3>well the signal to noise ratio in terms of like people tweeting,</v>

630
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.970
<v Speaker 3>it's almost mostly noise.</v>

631
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:26.151
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

632
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 3>it's nice.</v>

633
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.100
<v Speaker 3>There's a few people that are great.</v>

634
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 3>You could fall a few people that are really posting about real news.</v>

635
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:34.160
<v Speaker 3>And for some journalists,</v>

636
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 3>17 of them,</v>

637
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I think journalists are maybe the best people to follow on Twitter right now it</v>

638
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:39.434
<v Speaker 3>seems like.</v>

639
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.300
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is who's a journalist?</v>

640
00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 3>There's very few real journalism takes a long time.</v>

641
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.850
<v Speaker 3>It's expensive.</v>

642
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Like real investigative journalism.</v>

643
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:49.034
<v Speaker 3>And I've had some of these guys,</v>

644
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.681
<v Speaker 3>my podcast,</v>

645
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:50.161
<v Speaker 3>they come on,</v>

646
00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:50.994
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

647
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 3>they've ruined their life.</v>

648
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 3>They spend five years looking into something.</v>

649
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:54.361
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares about it.</v>

650
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 3>They figured out it was true.</v>

651
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:55.381
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

652
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:56.640
<v Speaker 3>and nobody wants to talk to them.</v>

653
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 3>They will have white hair.</v>

654
00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 3>They're families hate them.</v>

655
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.080
<v Speaker 3>They live in a little apartment in New York City.</v>

656
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 3>That's a journalist.</v>

657
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.581
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

658
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.140
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people do journalism,</v>

659
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:04.500
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

660
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.240
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

661
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 3>they do spend a long time working on a project and it's in something like the</v>

662
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 3>New York Times and no one cares.</v>

663
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.001
<v Speaker 3>No one cares.</v>

664
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Like the thing about Trump,</v>

665
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 3>like the report on Trump,</v>

666
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 3>this scathing report,</v>

667
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 3>they thought it was going to bring them down.</v>

668
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Literally it was in and out of the news cycle on a day or two.</v>

669
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:19.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

670
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 3>They don't care.</v>

671
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 3>That guy just pops an extra Adderall and doesn't give up.</v>

672
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care.</v>

673
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

674
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:28.330
<v Speaker 3>He is the only guy that should ever write a motivational HealthSouth hop</v>

675
00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 3>the secret.</v>

676
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

677
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 3>Whenever the secret is,</v>

678
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Speaker 3>he's got it.</v>

679
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.073
<v Speaker 3>I think it's speed.</v>

680
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.460
<v Speaker 3>It's speed.</v>

681
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.270
<v Speaker 3>You think he's really,</v>

682
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

683
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:36.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

684
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:37.340
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

685
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

686
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's speed.</v>

687
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Speaker 3>I think he's on something.</v>

688
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

689
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:44.520
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the only way that it makes sense to me that a 70 plus year old</v>

690
00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:45.630
<v Speaker 3>man has that much energy.</v>

691
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 3>A guy doesn't exercise,</v>

692
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 3>eats fast food,</v>

693
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:53.430
<v Speaker 3>and he's fucking bouncing off the walls and he can campaign for days and days.</v>

694
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

695
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

696
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:54.991
<v Speaker 3>KFC,</v>

697
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 3>double downs and flay a fishes.</v>

698
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 3>And let me ask you this,</v>

699
00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 3>how often,</v>

700
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 3>if he gets his dick sucked and question,</v>

701
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:02.011
<v Speaker 3>who's doing it?</v>

702
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Great question and not asked enough,</v>

703
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:04.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

704
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Probably not that much.</v>

705
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a guy like that is driven by sex.</v>

706
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.661
<v Speaker 3>I don't get that.</v>

707
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he'd be,</v>

708
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 3>but Milania seems to be not into it as much.</v>

709
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 3>It seems a little upset with them.</v>

710
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.520
<v Speaker 3>She seems a bit cold,</v>

711
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 3>but there she Slovenian or something,</v>

712
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.093
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

713
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.933
<v Speaker 3>They're cold.</v>

714
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:21.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

715
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:21.700
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

716
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 3>well that's some of the generalizations.</v>

717
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.821
<v Speaker 3>They're white,</v>

718
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:25.990
<v Speaker 3>so I can generally say what I want about them.</v>

719
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Ciao.</v>

720
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

721
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Let me say what the Hell I want.</v>

722
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 3>And Eastern Europeans.</v>

723
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Can I not have Slovenians you can.</v>

724
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.181
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

725
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:33.980
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

726
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

727
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.123

728
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:35.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

729
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:35.641
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

730
00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 3>I think she's a little annoyed with them,</v>

731
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.141
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

732
00:19:38.141 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 3>She was very humiliating for her.</v>

733
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 3>They had the pest life.</v>

734
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

735
00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Up until he ran for president.</v>

736
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.470
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

737
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.711
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

738
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 3>imagine telling his kids,</v>

739
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:45.031
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

740
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I know you got world billionaires,</v>

741
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 3>you'll party every day.</v>

742
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.710
<v Speaker 3>You do coke with impunity.</v>

743
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:51.260
<v Speaker 3>It's some New York City nightclub.</v>

744
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 3>When you boarded that,</v>

745
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:53.274
<v Speaker 3>you go to Europe,</v>

746
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 3>do it on a boat when you bought it that you go to some origene Athens,</v>

747
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.570
<v Speaker 3>that's all done right.</v>

748
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.650
<v Speaker 3>But we're going to Canton,</v>

749
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Ohio and I'm giving a speech and you can stand there because,</v>

750
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.110
<v Speaker 3>and every camera,</v>

751
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.770
<v Speaker 3>every news reporter is going to watch every move you make the rest of your life</v>

752
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.680
<v Speaker 3>you're going to crawl up your ass with a microscope to and everyone hates you</v>

753
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.380
<v Speaker 3>and some of them might be going to jail.</v>

754
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:13.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

755
00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:13.981
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

756
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:16.860
<v Speaker 3>we really don't know what's going on with this Mueller investigation.</v>

757
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:17.491
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot,</v>

758
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:17.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

759
00:20:17.761 --> 00:20:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be disappointing.</v>

760
00:20:18.931 --> 00:20:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's preparing anything for disappointment.</v>

761
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has prepared us for disappointment.</v>

762
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

763
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 3>CNN is actually was saying that that don't expect much.</v>

764
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you get a report card and you'd tell your parents,</v>

765
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:29.964
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

766
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:30.421
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

767
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:33.680
<v Speaker 3>I've changed but I'm still me still know what I mean.</v>

768
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm still the guy who gets high before he goes into school and was caught</v>

769
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:40.600
<v Speaker 3>smoking by the priests.</v>

770
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to get caught smoking weed by the priest who driving it in my</v>

771
00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Catholic school and he would drive me to the school.</v>

772
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.561
<v Speaker 3>So I would be like,</v>

773
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:46.711
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

774
00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I've made some changes,</v>

775
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.790
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still very much that person that you guys raised.</v>

776
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 3>So that I think is what the Mueller report is going to be like Trump.</v>

777
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about Trump is he's corrupt.</v>

778
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.140
<v Speaker 3>He's a con man,</v>

779
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

780
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:02.290
<v Speaker 3>he said he had this whole wall that there was no wall.</v>

781
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:02.981
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

782
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:03.814
<v Speaker 3>this is not coming.</v>

783
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.663
<v Speaker 3>Little links,</v>

784
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.620
<v Speaker 3>the walls,</v>

785
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 3>not in some wall.</v>

786
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.133
<v Speaker 3>There's no wall.</v>

787
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 3>This is a little signs.</v>

788
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 3>It's a finished the wall.</v>

789
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.411
<v Speaker 3>But this part,</v>

790
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 3>this part of a wall,</v>

791
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.573
<v Speaker 3>there's more,</v>

792
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.230
<v Speaker 3>there's more of a wallet around houses in Belair,</v>

793
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

794
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Then there is at the border.</v>

795
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.681
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

796
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:21.620
<v Speaker 3>it's a smaller area,</v>

797
00:21:21.621 --> 00:21:22.454
<v Speaker 3>a pillar.</v>

798
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:22.781
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

799
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

800
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.120
<v Speaker 3>And there's probably more of a reason to have a wall,</v>

801
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

802
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:28.420
<v Speaker 3>and the people that run bel air or probably more serious.</v>

803
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

804
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

805
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely something that,</v>

806
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:31.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

807
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

808
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

809
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

810
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 3>about this whole wall thing.</v>

811
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.160
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like it was one of those campaigns,</v>

812
00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:39.700
<v Speaker 3>slogans that he got stuck with,</v>

813
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:39.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

814
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 3>build that wall.</v>

815
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Speaker 3>And then once he got in he was like,</v>

816
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:42.971
<v Speaker 3>oh Christ,</v>

817
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 3>I really got to build this fucking thing.</v>

818
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.370
<v Speaker 3>It's his slogan,</v>

819
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 3>someone whispered into his ear,</v>

820
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.360
<v Speaker 3>you think he and culture probably said,</v>

821
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 3>get out there and say build the wall.</v>

822
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:51.311
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

823
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.144
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

824
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 3>And then you just went out there,</v>

825
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 3>build that wall.</v>

826
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 3>I love the,</v>

827
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.010
<v Speaker 3>one of the speeches,</v>

828
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't really build things.</v>

829
00:21:58.361 --> 00:22:00.850
<v Speaker 3>He lent his name to be franchised.</v>

830
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

831
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:02.351
<v Speaker 3>he definitely does that.</v>

832
00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:05.530
<v Speaker 3>He's not a bit like this idea that he's like a bit the things he's built or</v>

833
00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:06.364
<v Speaker 3>disgusting.</v>

834
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 3>If you go to Atlantic city,</v>

835
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 3>what can any building he has built it is to,</v>

836
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Chris Hedges wrote a book,</v>

837
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.320
<v Speaker 3>he's an interesting guy.</v>

838
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a book called America,</v>

839
00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:17.770
<v Speaker 3>the farewell tour and he goes,</v>

840
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:18.350
<v Speaker 3>he went,</v>

841
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 3>he went to Trump tower in Atlantic city.</v>

842
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

843
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.820
<v Speaker 3>there's junkies in the bathrooms,</v>

844
00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:25.690
<v Speaker 3>does like rats running around is falling apart.</v>

845
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:26.231
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

846
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of what you know America will be,</v>

847
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 3>but no anything he's built.</v>

848
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:30.184
<v Speaker 3>He's not nice.</v>

849
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.151
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch it?</v>

850
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:35.160
<v Speaker 3>There was a documentary about an architect called Costas carry on us and he had,</v>

851
00:22:35.161 --> 00:22:39.730
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of the documentary is about him convincing Trump to not make his</v>

852
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:43.910
<v Speaker 3>building gold in New York City and I,</v>

853
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

854
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.380
<v Speaker 3>is it Golden New York City?</v>

855
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 3>But it's Golden Vegas gold a lot of places.</v>

856
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:52.760
<v Speaker 3>But like he was going to ruin the,</v>

857
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.310
<v Speaker 3>the downtown of Manhattan with a gold building.</v>

858
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Why is that ruining it though?</v>

859
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 3>A gold building.</v>

860
00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

861
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.270
<v Speaker 3>You've spent too much time on the west coast,</v>

862
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.200
<v Speaker 3>but why is that bad?</v>

863
00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 3>Why is it bad for it to be one car?</v>

864
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Is it better if it's all black or all white or silver?</v>

865
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:07.871
<v Speaker 3>It's a look.</v>

866
00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 3>It has a feel.</v>

867
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.480
<v Speaker 3>You can't come in with a gold building.</v>

868
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:11.350
<v Speaker 3>It's not Vegas.</v>

869
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:12.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not Atlantic city.</v>

870
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:13.321
<v Speaker 3>This is not right.</v>

871
00:23:13.321 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

872
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:14.890
<v Speaker 3>like Mandalay Bay,</v>

873
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.570
<v Speaker 3>what goes on in a gold building.</v>

874
00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:18.130
<v Speaker 3>I've never looked at a gold building and said,</v>

875
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 3>I bet what goes on there is honest,</v>

876
00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 3>like decent gold buildings should be for doing coke and losing money.</v>

877
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's about.</v>

878
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.870
<v Speaker 3>You don't walk in with a building and get a checkup.</v>

879
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.281
<v Speaker 3>That's good point.</v>

880
00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

881
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

882
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 3>That was a very good point.</v>

883
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.063
<v Speaker 3>Gaudy.</v>

884
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.150
<v Speaker 3>It's disgusting.</v>

885
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

886
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.001
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

887
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:36.761
<v Speaker 3>he is a weird thing,</v>

888
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:37.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

889
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:37.601
<v Speaker 3>Like who's that?</v>

890
00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Who's that good for?</v>

891
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Like when you go to a place and it's got opulent Chandelier's guilded furniture,</v>

892
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.750
<v Speaker 3>sociopaths who sacrifice human beings.</v>

893
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the way they want to lift.</v>

894
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.350
<v Speaker 3>They want to live in a,</v>

895
00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:50.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

896
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 3>a palatial opulent environment.</v>

897
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:54.890
<v Speaker 3>And then just,</v>

898
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

899
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.990
<v Speaker 3>I think Matt,</v>

900
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.391
<v Speaker 3>he be,</v>

901
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:57.224
<v Speaker 3>he said this,</v>

902
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:02.330
<v Speaker 3>he said that Trump is a poor person's idea of a rich person.</v>

903
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:03.164
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

904
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.210
<v Speaker 3>That's what a rich person thinks.</v>

905
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.720
<v Speaker 3>When a poor person thinks about a rich person,</v>

906
00:24:06.721 --> 00:24:07.190
<v Speaker 3>they think,</v>

907
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.371
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

908
00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 3>he's got his name on his jet and he's got his name on his building.</v>

909
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:11.630
<v Speaker 3>And the guys I grew up with in long island,</v>

910
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:12.890
<v Speaker 3>if somebody went to them and said,</v>

911
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

912
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.950
<v Speaker 3>you could own the Miss Universe pageant.</v>

913
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 3>You could have a building with your name on it.</v>

914
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.230
<v Speaker 3>You could be in the WWE,</v>

915
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.850
<v Speaker 3>that would be amazing.</v>

916
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.840
<v Speaker 3>You'd be a winner.</v>

917
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 3>They would be a winner.</v>

918
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Where I grew up in long island,</v>

919
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:27.230
<v Speaker 3>that would be,</v>

920
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.940
<v Speaker 3>that is the highest you can go.</v>

921
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's kind of what it is.</v>

922
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.483
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

923
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

924
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 3>see what's appealing.</v>

925
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 3>That's also what's appealing about them.</v>

926
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.970
<v Speaker 3>What's appealing about him is there is no veneer,</v>

927
00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:38.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

928
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.160
<v Speaker 3>You don't get the idea that you're being played,</v>

929
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 3>you get the idea,</v>

930
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 3>you know you're kind of being played,</v>

931
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:45.080
<v Speaker 3>but you're being played on a level that you accept.</v>

932
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:47.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you go buy a car and you know the salesman,</v>

933
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I used to be in sales,</v>

934
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.030
<v Speaker 3>so like when I'll go to buy something,</v>

935
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:52.970
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I know the salesman needs the sale because I used to.</v>

936
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 3>So like sometimes it'd be like,</v>

937
00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:54.381
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

938
00:24:54.381 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is what it is,</v>

939
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

940
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

941
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.153
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>

942
00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.330
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of with Trump,</v>

943
00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 3>you know you're being sold,</v>

944
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:01.250
<v Speaker 3>but you're okay with it.</v>

945
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.690
<v Speaker 3>You let it happen.</v>

946
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.610
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is going to come after him?</v>

947
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.380
<v Speaker 3>It seems like he's throwing a giant monkey wrench into the gears.</v>

948
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Twitter is any indication,</v>

949
00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:12.650
<v Speaker 3>a prolonged civil conflict,</v>

950
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:13.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

951
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.013
<v Speaker 3>where there will be,</v>

952
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.850
<v Speaker 3>where some will emerge as a few different nation.</v>

953
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:22.790
<v Speaker 3>States will barter with each other.</v>

954
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

955
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

956
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:25.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe Joe Biden and then nothing.</v>

957
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.020
<v Speaker 3>He's got no chance.</v>

958
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.331
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

959
00:25:27.331 --> 00:25:28.200
<v Speaker 3>he's who do you,</v>

960
00:25:28.201 --> 00:25:29.034
<v Speaker 3>who's coming.</v>

961
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 3>She's got no chance.</v>

962
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.731
<v Speaker 3>Bernie.</v>

963

<v Speaker 3>They hate me.</v>

965
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Know a lot of people hate Bernie.</v>

966
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.450
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

967
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.283
<v Speaker 3>I don't know it,</v>

968
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.840
<v Speaker 3>some kind of staff was accused of sexual assault.</v>

969
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:39.651
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They were definitely wrong.</v>

1013
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Boomers were wrong about everything.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the rise of people that think that everyone owes them something.</v>

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1020
00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.371
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1021
00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:46.580
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1022
00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.130
<v Speaker 3>that's the door.</v>

1023
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird one.</v>

1024
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Like we were talking about AOC who,</v>

1025
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1026
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 3>said she seems like a nice girls cause looking woman.</v>

1027
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:54.661
<v Speaker 3>She's young,</v>

1028
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 3>she's got energy,</v>

1029
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:57.330
<v Speaker 3>she wants to do good things.</v>

1030
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 3>She wants to do some good ones.</v>

1031
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 3>But I saw the one thing that said give money to people who are unable or</v>

1032
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:05.070
<v Speaker 3>unwilling to work.</v>

1033
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:05.720
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1035
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 3>I saw that and I'm like,</v>

1036
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to work.</v>

1037
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.981
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not,</v>

1038
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 3>and they pulled that out.</v>

1039
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 3>They pulled that part out.</v>

1040
00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:12.810
<v Speaker 3>The unwilling park in her unable to work makes total sense.</v>

1041
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:13.061
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1042
00:27:13.061 --> 00:27:13.130
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1043
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.980
<v Speaker 3>we as a community,</v>

1044
00:27:13.981 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 3>we should take care of the people.</v>

1045
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Most of the people that are now in comedy or unable to work,</v>

1046
00:27:17.491 --> 00:27:18.120
<v Speaker 3>most of us,</v>

1047
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.881
<v Speaker 3>most of us,</v>

1048
00:27:18.881 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1049
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 3>This is the only thing we can do.</v>

1050
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.990
<v Speaker 3>But her thing was a weird one because that,</v>

1051
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:23.843
<v Speaker 3>that thing,</v>

1052
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 3>unwilling to work.</v>

1053
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1054
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:25.880
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1055
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.713
<v Speaker 3>hey.</v>

1056
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:27.683
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

1057
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.750
<v Speaker 3>he just crossed over into crazy town like this is,</v>

1058
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.350
<v Speaker 3>but that means that crazy town was always in the back.</v>

1059
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 3>You always had that.</v>

1060
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:37.650
<v Speaker 3>When you put that on paper,</v>

1062
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 3>that means this is something that's been discussed,</v>

1063
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.580
<v Speaker 3>like part of the appeal and she just,</v>

1064
00:27:41.581 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how influential she wasn't getting Amazon to drop out in New York,</v>

1065
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.990
<v Speaker 3>but I live in Queens,</v>

1066
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:46.980
<v Speaker 3>so everyone is paranoid.</v>

1067
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Amazon was coming,</v>

1068
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.380
<v Speaker 3>was a Bagel.</v>

1069
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:49.501
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1070
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:50.011
<v Speaker 3>no carbs,</v>

1071
00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:50.311
<v Speaker 3>no good.</v>

1072
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:51.330
<v Speaker 3>But I was in a Bagel shop.</v>

1073
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I gave up dairy two weeks ago.</v>

1074
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.193
<v Speaker 3>I'm turning it around,</v>

1075
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.103
<v Speaker 3>trying to get around.</v>

1076
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.010
<v Speaker 3>I was in a Bagel shop.</v>

1077
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:57.170
<v Speaker 3>It was paranoid about Amazon.</v>

1078
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Amazon is going to come.</v>

1079
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 3>We're all going to get priced out of my little shoebox is it we live in or the,</v>

1080
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 3>some of the people that own those shoe boxes were like,</v>

1081
00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm a millionaire now because Amazon's coming and the,</v>

1082
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.730
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>

1083
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.320
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to have a rational discussion about a co inequality right now because</v>

1084
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 3>in a place like New York City,</v>

1085
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:19.300
<v Speaker 3>it's so expensive to live and the reason for that is that it's a destination for</v>

1086
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.460
<v Speaker 3>foreign capital.</v>

1087
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 3>So essentially a lot of the buildings in New York City,</v>

1088
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.960
<v Speaker 3>foreign people buy apartments.</v>

1089
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:25.794
<v Speaker 3>They don't live in them.</v>

1090
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 3>They use it to like launder money and they buy them not even under their real</v>

1091
00:28:29.821 --> 00:28:30.031
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>

1092
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 3>They buy them under the name of a Shell Corp like an LLC and then they have like</v>

1093
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 3>these investments and it,</v>

1094
00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.790
<v Speaker 3>it really makes everything insanely expensive.</v>

1095
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 3>That's what's making everything.</v>

1096
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what's making a lot of real estate in New York City.</v>

1097
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Expensive.</v>

1098
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 3>What do you what like what if you got to guess what percentage of like expensive</v>

1099
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:46.660
<v Speaker 3>apartments are owned by?</v>

1100
00:28:46.661 --> 00:28:46.981
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

1101
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:51.981
<v Speaker 3>between 2008 and 2014 I think 50% of apartments going into contract were cause I</v>

1102
00:28:52.201 --> 00:28:52.681
<v Speaker 3>do a shell,</v>

1103
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:53.001
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1104
00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I used to be a double decker tour guide in New York City and so I do a show,</v>

1105
00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:58.140
<v Speaker 3>like a funny comedy show where I take,</v>

1106
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.071
<v Speaker 3>I sell tickets,</v>

1107
00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 3>I put people on a tour bus and then we'd go around to these building,</v>

1108
00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:03.510
<v Speaker 3>just scream at these buildings.</v>

1109
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:04.320
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

1110
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.153
<v Speaker 3>It should be illegal,</v>

1111
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's fun and,</v>

1112
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 3>and no one cares because they're not home because there somewhere,</v>

1113
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean it feeling,</v>

1114
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.480
<v Speaker 3>if you look at who owns these buildings,</v>

1115
00:29:12.481 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 3>just a guy who like is maybe a guy who owns a mining company and he poisoned to</v>

1116
00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 3>river in Zambia.</v>

1117
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.430
<v Speaker 3>The a lot of these guys are doing things they shouldn't be doing and they want</v>

1118
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:22.740
<v Speaker 3>to stash their money in real estate.</v>

1119
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:23.990
<v Speaker 3>London is insane.</v>

1120
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 3>It's more expensive than New York because London is all essentially shell</v>

1121
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Speaker 3>corporations.</v>

1122
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.570
<v Speaker 3>You know these phantom buyers buying up real estate in London,</v>

1123
00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:34.140
<v Speaker 3>in New York.</v>

1124
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.020
<v Speaker 3>So you have people in New York that know the system is fucked.</v>

1125
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.600
<v Speaker 3>They know the markets being artificially manipulated.</v>

1126
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Bloomberg thought it was great.</v>

1127
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.471
<v Speaker 3>Bloomberg is,</v>

1128
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:42.760
<v Speaker 3>we want all of the billionaires.</v>

1129
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.361
<v Speaker 3>He said it,</v>

1130
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:44.110
<v Speaker 3>that was his quote.</v>

1131
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.943
<v Speaker 3>We want all the bay.</v>

1132
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like some of those billionaires have done things that would make you would</v>

1133
00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:50.170
<v Speaker 3>keep you up at night.</v>

1134
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 3>They've,</v>

1135
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1136
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 3>numbers like bring them in,</v>

1137
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 3>they eat shrimp and steak,</v>

1138
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.730
<v Speaker 3>they'll go to Peter Luger's.</v>

1139
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.530
<v Speaker 3>We love him as a businessman.</v>

1140
00:29:59.531 --> 00:29:59.711
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1141
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:00.191
<v Speaker 3>That's a thing.</v>

1142
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 3>So people get fed up with death and dude,</v>

1143
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:02.830
<v Speaker 3>and when I was,</v>

1144
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:03.663
<v Speaker 3>had my tour bus,</v>

1145
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.920
<v Speaker 3>people would get on from regular places like Pennsylvania now just point and go</v>

1146
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:07.983
<v Speaker 3>10 million,</v>

1147
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.243
<v Speaker 3>20 million,</v>

1148
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.111
<v Speaker 3>30 minute.</v>

1149
00:30:10.111 --> 00:30:12.190
<v Speaker 3>And these people just shift uncomfortably in their seats.</v>

1150
00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Like what the Hell is going on here?</v>

1151
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:14.771
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

1152
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:15.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1153
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 3>I saw Trump getting elected during those tours because I'm like $100 million and</v>

1154
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:20.704
<v Speaker 3>they're like sitting there like,</v>

1155
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.850
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1156
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I can't afford a knee operation.</v>

1157
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:23.681
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1158
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:26.070
<v Speaker 3>the idea that Trump's not a part of that as he increases,</v>

1159
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 3>listen in his bit,</v>

1160
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 3>his building was a huge destination.</v>

1161
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Russians love his building.</v>

1162
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.511
<v Speaker 3>They love it.</v>

1163
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:32.410
<v Speaker 3>They love a brand name.</v>

1164
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.460
<v Speaker 3>They love the plaza.</v>

1165
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.840
<v Speaker 3>They love his building,</v>

1166
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.110
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of interesting characters lived in Trump tower.</v>

1167
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Didn't they take the Trump tower name off of it in New York?</v>

1168
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't,</v>

1170
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:42.761
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1171
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:43.594
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to else.</v>

1172
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.690
<v Speaker 3>There was one of the buildings where the people that own the co op decided to</v>

1173
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 3>take the name off of it.</v>

1174
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's another,</v>

1175
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.150
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of shitty like Trump nursing homes too,</v>

1176
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.630
<v Speaker 3>as I've been in New York.</v>

1177
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:52.991
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

1178
00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:53.681
<v Speaker 3>Nursing homes,</v>

1179
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 3>you know those elderly people getting beaten.</v>

1180
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:56.254
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say</v>

1181
00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

1182
00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.021
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1183
00:30:59.021 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 3>they're getting fleeced.</v>

1184
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:00.844
<v Speaker 3>The beaten.</v>

1185
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.571
<v Speaker 3>You go by,</v>

1186
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:03.010
<v Speaker 3>you see like Trump pavilion.</v>

1187
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like a Soviet era architecture.</v>

1188
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Horrible like old age home that's been there since the 70s and I'm like,</v>

1189
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:09.341
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1190
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I feel for the people in there,</v>

1191
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.910
<v Speaker 3>the screams,</v>

1192
00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 3>it must other New York condo votes to remove Trump from name.</v>

1193
00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1194
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.440
<v Speaker 3>New York City condominium.</v>

1195
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:21.161
<v Speaker 3>On Thursday,</v>

1196
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 3>we removed president Trump's name from the buildings facade.</v>

1197
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:24.790
<v Speaker 3>The second time at four months,</v>

1198
00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:26.830
<v Speaker 3>his name has been removed from a condo in the city.</v>

1199
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:32.130
<v Speaker 3>55% of Trump plays condo owners at 120 Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan.</v>

1200
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 3>Voted in favor of removing the large sign above the front door,</v>

1201
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.620
<v Speaker 3>the buildings.</v>

1202
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean that crazy.</v>

1203
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

1204
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.500
<v Speaker 3>These are self important people,</v>

1205
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 3>but when care is,</v>

1206
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:43.470
<v Speaker 3>they're worried about their,</v>

1207
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.680
<v Speaker 3>their secure attachment.</v>

1208
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.341
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1209
00:31:45.341 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point.</v>

1210
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1211
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.590
<v Speaker 3>I think if you try to sell it and it's Trump place and you know you're going to</v>

1212
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 3>eliminate 50% of your buyers dictators that are buying those apartments,</v>

1213
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great.</v>

1214
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.120
<v Speaker 3>They die.</v>

1215
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:57.971
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they don't.</v>

1216
00:31:57.971 --> 00:31:58.631
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're like,</v>

1217
00:31:58.631 --> 00:31:59.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1218
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 3>probably we'll probably go down the street to this no name building.</v>

1219
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 3>We'll be better off.</v>

1220
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.950
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of his condos were sold to,</v>

1221
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1222
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Mafia and you know,</v>

1223
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Russian business guys and he's always hide that,</v>

1224
00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:11.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1225
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.891
<v Speaker 3>he did deals.</v>

1226
00:32:11.891 --> 00:32:14.560
<v Speaker 3>It was his firm located in Trump tower called Bay rock financial,</v>

1227
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 3>which was a,</v>

1228
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:16.330
<v Speaker 3>it was headed by this guy,</v>

1229
00:32:16.331 --> 00:32:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Felix Sader.</v>

1230
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Felix Sater was a guy who the FBI,</v>

1231
00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1232
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Speaker 3>convicted in like a Russian pump and dumps stock scam.</v>

1233
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 3>And he worked in Trump tower with Trump.</v>

1234
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Like he worked very closely with Trump and Felix had like informed,</v>

1235
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:32.140
<v Speaker 3>I think on the Russian mob for the feds and the feds kind of let him earn.</v>

1236
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:36.070
<v Speaker 3>And so Trump has had this labyrinth of shady connections forever.</v>

1237
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1238
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.680
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if that means that he's ness.</v>

1239
00:32:38.681 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's an asset or of Putin or anything like that.</v>

1240
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that.</v>

1241
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I think that's kind of just,</v>

1242
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.503
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1243
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.081
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1244
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:46.940
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people would like to believe that,</v>

1245
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 3>but he's a shady guy.</v>

1246
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:53.390
<v Speaker 3>So if you have all these people pouring over his business deals for the last 50</v>

1247
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:53.990
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1248
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.830
<v Speaker 3>it can't be good.</v>

1249
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.620
<v Speaker 3>There could be an amazing movie about him.</v>

1250
00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:57.771
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1251
00:32:57.771 --> 00:32:58.604
<v Speaker 3>there will be.</v>

1252
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 3>And who would play him?</v>

1253
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1254
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.173
<v Speaker 3>good question.</v>

1255
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully not a white man.</v>

1256
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:04.424
<v Speaker 3>Christian Bale.</v>

1257
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1258
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 3>let them get fat.</v>

1259
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Just like he did with Dick Cheney.</v>

1260
00:33:07.311 --> 00:33:07.840
<v Speaker 3>We played Dick.</v>

1261
00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 3>If he could play Dick Cheney,</v>

1262
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:09.880
<v Speaker 3>he can do Trump.</v>

1263
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.790
<v Speaker 3>He can put a truck.</v>

1264
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 3>He was a great Cheney.</v>

1265
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 3>I thought I heard.</v>

1266
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:13.800
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen him yet.</v>

1267
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 3>I heard it was amazing.</v>

1268
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1269
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.970
<v Speaker 3>you know the movie with like a lot of people,</v>

1270
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 3>the movie was good.</v>

1271
00:33:18.231 --> 00:33:19.010
<v Speaker 3>It was not,</v>

1272
00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1273
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like the big short to me was amazing.</v>

1274
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was as good as that,</v>

1275
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:25.790
<v Speaker 3>but Christian Bale is phenomenal.</v>

1276
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:26.840
<v Speaker 3>He's a phenomenal act.</v>

1277
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1278
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 3>to gain that much weight,</v>

1279
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.950
<v Speaker 3>to become another person.</v>

1280
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.220
<v Speaker 3>That's all thing with Jesse Small.</v>

1281
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're all,</v>

1282
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.340
<v Speaker 3>all these actors are sociopaths.</v>

1283
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.390
<v Speaker 3>They're all sociopaths.</v>

1284
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Watches Good Morning America interview and try not to laugh.</v>

1285
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Well now it's,</v>

1286
00:33:41.891 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy what he said.</v>

1287
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.360
<v Speaker 3>He's the gay Tupac like</v>

1288
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.560
<v Speaker 3>85 back and great.</v>

1289
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Those guys like,</v>

1290
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.300
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1291
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 3>crisis PR firm is telling him to do that.</v>

1292
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.290
<v Speaker 3>The Gay Tupac,</v>

1293
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 3>no one's telling them to do that.</v>

1294
00:33:55.581 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 3>This is all so this is Bridget Fetisi said it best.</v>

1295
00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 3>She says she's hilarious.</v>

1296
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:01.101
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

1297
00:34:01.101 --> 00:34:03.080
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens when you let actors write the script.</v>

1298
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.231
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1299
00:34:03.231 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1300
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.390
<v Speaker 3>See the plot twist coming a mile away.</v>

1301
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I had dinner the other night.</v>

1302
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 3>I was in La and an act was at the table and he was talking and I'm like,</v>

00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:39.480
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1369
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.410
<v Speaker 3>we just had a meeting.</v>

1370
00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:40.651
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1371
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:41.484
<v Speaker 3>what'd you do?</v>

1372
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:41.941
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

1373
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:43.320
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about starting a podcast.</v>

1374
00:35:43.321 --> 00:35:43.531
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1375
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:44.370
<v Speaker 3>that's not a meeting.</v>

1376
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.710
<v Speaker 3>You're just friends with someone else.</v>

1377
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.200
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about stuff that's nothing.</v>

1378
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:50.310
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

1379
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:52.920
<v Speaker 3>it does work here and there are people that I know who've made the right friend</v>

1380
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 3>and then their life changes.</v>

1381
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:54.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1382
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:55.800
<v Speaker 3>there's a little of that.</v>

1383
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 3>But those people were super transparent and if you don't have any talent that's</v>

1384
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 3>never going to never work.</v>

1385
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:02.700
<v Speaker 3>And then everybody resents you.</v>

1386
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 3>There's a few of those people that really don't have any talent,</v>

1387
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:08.730
<v Speaker 3>but they made the right friends and they cling on to folks and everybody gets</v>

1388
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 3>real uncomfortable.</v>

1389
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.010
<v Speaker 3>And that was thing,</v>

1390
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I think the first time we spoke is I've written,</v>

1391
00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I think about Louis and after Louise and the whole news,</v>

1392
00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:14.814
<v Speaker 3>but Louie happened,</v>

1393
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.440
<v Speaker 3>you had all this love that piece by the accurate an honest,</v>

1394
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.681
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1395
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:20.461
<v Speaker 3>it was on Facebook,</v>

1396
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:21.950
<v Speaker 3>which where I did a lot of my best work.</v>

1397
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Blame what you were saying.</v>

1398
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] didn't read it after Louis.</v>

1399
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people were rightly criticized and conduct and you know the whole me</v>

1400
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:30.080
<v Speaker 3>too thing.</v>

1401
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.280
<v Speaker 3>That's all valid in short.</v>

1402
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Speaker 3>100% needs to happen.</v>

1403
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 3>But then there were people that were like,</v>

1404
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:34.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1405
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Louie was never funny or Louie was just,</v>

1406
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:37.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1407
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:39.180
<v Speaker 3>of course he got all these things.</v>

1408
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:40.230
<v Speaker 3>He was a white guy or,</v>

1409
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:40.800
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

1410
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.311
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1411
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1412
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:42.331
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

1413
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:42.421
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1414
00:36:42.421 --> 00:36:43.770
<v Speaker 3>he said this word I don't like.</v>

1415
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 3>Well look at this joke and I'm like,</v>

1416
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.070
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

1417
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.410
<v Speaker 3>a week ago he was a comic genius.</v>

1418
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:50.370
<v Speaker 3>We all agreed on that.</v>

1419
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.840
<v Speaker 3>That was a widely held belief.</v>

1420
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Now out of nowhere,</v>

1421
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 3>he's not that funny.</v>

1422
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.160
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1423
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 3>and these people are tweeting this from parking lots where they're performing</v>

1424
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.040
<v Speaker 3>some of these shows in la or in like someone's driveway,</v>

1425
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1426
00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.350
<v Speaker 3>and which is fine.</v>

1427
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:04.861
<v Speaker 3>I do them,</v>

1428
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:05.694
<v Speaker 3>I've no problem with that.</v>

1429
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.880
<v Speaker 3>But they're getting on Twitter and,</v>

1430
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:10.740
<v Speaker 3>and knocking Louis from the back of a parking lot where they're doing a show.</v>

1431
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.840
<v Speaker 3>But what the reason you gave for why,</v>

1432
00:37:12.841 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1433
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.140
<v Speaker 3>because these,</v>

1434
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.910
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1435
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.080
<v Speaker 3>in any industry,</v>

1436
00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:19.800
<v Speaker 3>people are going to get ahead by being agreeable,</v>

1437
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 3>by having the right opinions,</v>

1438
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.520
<v Speaker 3>by crowd sourcing their opinions,</v>

1439
00:37:23.521 --> 00:37:25.350
<v Speaker 3>by taking the temperature of the room and going,</v>

1440
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.820
<v Speaker 3>how does everyone feel?</v>

1441
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 3>And those people are,</v>

1442
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1443
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 3>they're careerists are very good at office politics.</v>

1444
00:37:32.491 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 3>They're very good at having the right friends,</v>

1445
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.710
<v Speaker 3>but their contributions are never really important,</v>

1446
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 3>are long lasting because they never get great because they don't take any risk.</v>

1447
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Because I think greatness is something you have to risk constantly to get to</v>

1448
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:48.504
<v Speaker 3>that level.</v>

1449
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.850
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of these people do very well.</v>

1450
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:51.684
<v Speaker 3>They make money,</v>

1451
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:52.200
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1452
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 3>they're successful,</v>

1453
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 3>but they are careerist and they're looking for comfort.</v>

1454
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.610
<v Speaker 3>And so when it was comfortable and safe to attack Louie and to bring Louie down</v>

1455
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:03.900
<v Speaker 3>and to elevate themselves,</v>

1456
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.973
<v Speaker 3>they did it.</v>

1457
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:09.030
<v Speaker 3>But they didn't do it when it could have hurt their career a week earlier,</v>

1458
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.163
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1459
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.200
<v Speaker 3>So to me it was very disingenuous and the fact that more people weren't calling</v>

1460
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:15.601
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>

1461
00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:15.711
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1462
00:38:15.711 --> 00:38:15.981
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1463
00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:19.620
<v Speaker 3>and I made that point where I said the same thing on the other side of people</v>

1464
00:38:19.621 --> 00:38:20.760
<v Speaker 3>who styled themselves.</v>

1465
00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm a free speech warrior.</v>

1466
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:28.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm this anti PC in their whole entire persona is,</v>

1467
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.030
<v Speaker 3>is that the need to say the n word?</v>

1468
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.841
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1469
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:32.910
<v Speaker 3>I can't do a joke if the punchline isn't fact.</v>

1470
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.541
<v Speaker 3>Like they're like,</v>

1471
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:34.374
<v Speaker 3>we have to.</v>

1472
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 3>So those to me are kind of the same</v>

1473
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.910
<v Speaker 2>people and they're the people that are just trying to arrange the world in a way</v>

1474
00:38:39.911 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 2>that allows them to succeed.</v>

1475
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Those are the types of people.</v>

1476
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Also like you were talking about the actor in the retail,</v>

1477
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.830
<v Speaker 2>you mean they're,</v>

1478
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 2>they're putting on a facade,</v>

1479
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.310
<v Speaker 2>not who they've adopted a predetermined pattern or behavior.</v>

1480
00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:54.430
<v Speaker 2>100% that predetermined pattern of behavior might be,</v>

1481
00:38:54.431 --> 00:38:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guy I drink every night.</v>

1482
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:57.460
<v Speaker 2>We go hard,</v>

1483
00:38:57.461 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1484
00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm an artist,</v>

1485
00:38:58.571 --> 00:38:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I smoked cigarettes,</v>

1486
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1487
00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:01.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1488
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to get on TV.</v>

1489
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:03.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1490
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:06.150
<v Speaker 2>So to me it was like incredibly disingenuous.</v>

1491
00:39:06.151 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 2>He had all these people and a lot of them are angry and they're doing fine.</v>

1492
00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Like some of them were talent.</v>

1493
00:39:11.201 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Like some of these people have their own shows and they're getting angry at</v>

1494
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Louie and angry and I'm like there's,</v>

1495
00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.381
<v Speaker 2>there's a real,</v>

1496
00:39:17.381 --> 00:39:18.101
<v Speaker 2>because here's the thing,</v>

1497
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Ari Shaffir told me something that made a lot of sense once he goes,</v>

1498
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1499
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.390
<v Speaker 2>it can really be a waste to get into this type of business and end up in an</v>

1500
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:30.391
<v Speaker 2>office writing for a show you don't care about in a job you hate punching a</v>

1501
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:31.384
<v Speaker 2>clock.</v>

1502
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 2>And that stuck with me and always take,</v>

1503
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 2>it might be harder to go the other way and to build a fan base and to do what</v>

1504
00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:38.224
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>

1505
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be,</v>

1506
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be better in the end and you're not going to be angry.</v>

1507
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.690
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be resentful.</v>

1508
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:48.910
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of the people that were were again shitting on his comedy,</v>

1509
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.980
<v Speaker 2>not so much his behavior,</v>

1510
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's comedy are people that are,</v>

1511
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 2>would want more in this than they have.</v>

1512
00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:57.390
<v Speaker 2>And they're resentful at guys like Louie because it,</v>

1513
00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair how talented he is.</v>

1514
00:39:59.590 --> 00:39:59.771
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1515
00:39:59.771 --> 00:40:01.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not just how talented he is,</v>

1516
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:02.260
<v Speaker 2>his work ethic,</v>

1517
00:40:02.261 --> 00:40:03.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of the factors,</v>

1518
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.320
<v Speaker 2>the risks that he does take.</v>

1519
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1520
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:06.421
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1521
00:40:06.421 --> 00:40:07.930
<v Speaker 2>he says controversial things.</v>

1522
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:08.651
<v Speaker 2>He always has.</v>

1523
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Whether you agree or not.</v>

1524
00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things about the Parkland thing,</v>

1525
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:12.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1526
00:40:12.481 --> 00:40:13.690
<v Speaker 2>and when he got in trouble about,</v>

1527
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:14.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1528
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1529
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:16.930
<v Speaker 2>saying that all you did was put some fat kid out of the way.</v>

1530
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1531
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 2>That is so consistent with his material.</v>

1532
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1533
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.530
<v Speaker 2>The idea that anybody's saying like,</v>

1534
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.191
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1535
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:25.150
<v Speaker 2>he's punching down.</v>

1536
00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:30.151
<v Speaker 2>Like you need to go review his material again because he said a lot of risky</v>

1537
00:40:32.231 --> 00:40:35.620
<v Speaker 2>shit because it was funny and he had really good points about it.</v>

1538
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1539
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Is that something that I would joke about?</v>

1540
00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

1541
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1542
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 2>but he did.</v>

1543
00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:41.830
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't joke about fat people.</v>

1544
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1545
00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:43.083
<v Speaker 2>yes I would,</v>

1546
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.570
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I would joke about kids getting shot.</v>

1547
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough take.</v>

1548
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:48.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1549
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:49.451
<v Speaker 2>To make funny,</v>

1550
00:40:49.451 --> 00:40:50.090
<v Speaker 2>but that's right.</v>

1551
00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1552
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 2>But I think he could.</v>

1553
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.380
<v Speaker 2>I think honestly we were,</v>

1554
00:40:53.381 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with,</v>

1555
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:54.701
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1556
00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>the embryo of a bit.</v>

1557
00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's really only been doing standup again for a couple of months in</v>

1558
00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan.</v>

1559
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.413
<v Speaker 2>It was even less.</v>

1560
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:06.690
<v Speaker 2>And I think ultimately his idea that bed is that bit rather is that kids today,</v>

1561
00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:11.890
<v Speaker 2>like they want to be a VA and have them when they have a 78 different genders.</v>

1562
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:12.610
<v Speaker 2>And why am I,</v>

1563
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.630
<v Speaker 2>why are you interesting?</v>

1564
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.640
<v Speaker 2>You're interesting because you didn't get shot.</v>

1565
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 2>That is his take on it.</v>

1566
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:21.970
<v Speaker 2>And he probably with overall reaction and anticipation of reaction probably</v>

1567
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:23.960
<v Speaker 2>would have eliminated that part of the bit.</v>

1568
00:41:23.961 --> 00:41:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1569
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:25.151
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I'm saying?</v>

1570
00:41:25.151 --> 00:41:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Like you know how it works.</v>

1571
00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm still shocked.</v>

1572
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it is too,</v>

1573
00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:32.050
<v Speaker 2>I was attracted to comedy because of guys like Bill Hicks or Patricia people</v>

1574
00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 2>that can pick the things that those guys said.</v>

1575
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 2>You could only say on a stage if you were really funny.</v>

1576
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1577
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love about common.</v>

1578
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

1579
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that everyone has to love that.</v>

1580
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 2>There is people that love it for a million different reasons.</v>

1581
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1582
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.400
<v Speaker 2>But I love when Bill Hicks got up and he said I was for the war,</v>

1583
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.690
<v Speaker 2>but against the troops.</v>

1584
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:48.891
<v Speaker 2>That's still,</v>

1585
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:49.191
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1586
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 2>one of the most amazing jokes I've ever heard when he goes,</v>

1587
00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:52.640
<v Speaker 2>we had a war in the states.</v>

1588
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I was in the unenviable position of being for the war,</v>

1589
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:56.323
<v Speaker 2>but against the trip,</v>

1590
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like all those men living together.</v>

1591
00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1592
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like young people or whatever.</v>

1593
00:42:00.341 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 2>He fight.</v>

1594
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:01.821
<v Speaker 2>It's just great.</v>

1595
00:42:01.821 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1596
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.271
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1597
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:05.250
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't say that in a human resources May.</v>

1598
00:42:05.251 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't say that in an office.</v>

1599
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1600
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.611
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't say that.</v>

1601
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 2>If you were out to lunch with a bunch of people,</v>

1602
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:12.350
<v Speaker 2>probably couldn't get away with that unless you were really funny.</v>

1603
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:14.810
<v Speaker 2>But these guys have gotten so funny and they've,</v>

1604
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1605
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 2>perfected their craft to the point where they can get away with these things</v>

1606
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 2>that the goal is to elicit laughter.</v>

1607
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.041
<v Speaker 2>It's not really,</v>

1608
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to change your mind,</v>

1609
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:27.080
<v Speaker 2>but the goal is to make you laugh about something that's dark and horrible.</v>

1610
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:29.000
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love about calm.</v>

1611
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1612
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 2>It's some of my favorite material.</v>

1613
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Some of my favorite material is fucked up.</v>

1614
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.450
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong.</v>

1615
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.940
<v Speaker 2>You probably shouldn't have said it would make me Howell out.</v>

1616
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen Holtzman?</v>

1617
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.070
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1618
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.450
<v Speaker 2>You never seen Brian Holtzman?</v>

1619
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1620
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1621
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Like store.</v>

1622
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1623
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.020
<v Speaker 2>You should check them out.</v>

1624
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 2>How long are you in town for?</v>

1625
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm a temporal of widely early March for wedding.</v>

1626
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1627
00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll call him back like a week.</v>

1628
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:51.164
<v Speaker 2>A month now.</v>

1629
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:51.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1630
00:42:51.741 --> 00:42:52.580
<v Speaker 2>he'll be here.</v>

1631
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's here either Friday or Saturday cause he doesn't really do the</v>

1632
00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

1633
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.650
<v Speaker 2>He mostly just does the store.</v>

1634
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1635
00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he does other clubs.</v>

1636
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.750
<v Speaker 2>I think I lost as a story when I started in 94.</v>

1637
00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:03.650
<v Speaker 2>He was coming up.</v>

1638
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.960
<v Speaker 2>He was there at the store in [inaudible] 94.</v>

1639
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1640
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1641
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.020
<v Speaker 2>he was already there when I got there and I was like,</v>

1642
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:09.321
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1643
00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:10.370
<v Speaker 2>this guy is going to be huge.</v>

1644
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.750
<v Speaker 2>And for whatever reason,</v>

1645
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.613
<v Speaker 2>he never left.</v>

1646
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.640
<v Speaker 2>He just does the store.</v>

1647
00:43:13.641 --> 00:43:14.480
<v Speaker 2>But he's a legend,</v>

1648
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.201
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best room.</v>

1649
00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:15.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1650
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I just did a few guest spots here and I'm like,</v>

1651
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:17.241
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1652
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:18.680
<v Speaker 2>this is the best room in the cut.</v>

1653
00:43:18.681 --> 00:43:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Like I wouldn't leave.</v>

1654
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:19.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1655
00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:20.804
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>

1656
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1657
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta leave.</v>

1658
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm doing the Improv tonight or what?</v>

1659
00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I did the Improv the other night.</v>

1660
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing the Improv tomorrow and I mix it up and I did the ice house last</v>

1661
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

1662
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1663
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I mix it up.</v>

1664
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.191
<v Speaker 2>You got,</v>

1665
00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to,</v>

1666
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best room in the world.</v>

1667
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Is he one of those guys who does this stuff where you're like,</v>

1668
00:43:35.361 --> 00:43:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm laughing.</v>

1669
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 2>When Susan Smith drown her kids.</v>

1670
00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Remember that he got gauge that night.</v>

1671
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 2>He's like laser gentlemen heard.</v>

1672
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Those were bad kids.</v>

1673
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I heard they sat that closer to TV.</v>

1674
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 2>They never put away their blocks.</v>

1675
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.020
<v Speaker 2>They're constantly spelt the fucking milk.</v>

1676
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Those kids would not be missed.</v>

1677
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.901
<v Speaker 2>It's all A's.</v>

1678
00:43:52.901 --> 00:43:53.270
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1679
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1680
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1681
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Mitzi shore would not let him go onstage after nine 11 she would not let him go</v>

1682
00:43:59.851 --> 00:44:02.870
<v Speaker 2>and she told me because she was like,</v>

1683
00:44:02.871 --> 00:44:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you were on the bench and how long?</v>

1684
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Like weeks.</v>

1685
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1686
00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>

1687
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:08.891
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

1688
00:44:08.891 --> 00:44:10.220
<v Speaker 2>don't let him on.</v>

1689
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:13.370
<v Speaker 2>He got benched after nine 11 by Mitzi shore.</v>

1690
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:14.204
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1691
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1692
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Let you get away with fucking anything.</v>

1693
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:18.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a while now.</v>

1694
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.600
<v Speaker 2>And this is pre social media too.</v>

1695
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.370
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't worried about a tweet storm.</v>

1696
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:22.810
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1697
00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:23.643
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1698
00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:24.260
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

1699
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Speaker 2>It can't let him up.</v>

1700
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I love pre-twitter to not let someone up.</v>

1701
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.240
<v Speaker 2>It has to be so gracious.</v>

1702
00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking animal man.</v>

1703
00:44:30.881 --> 00:44:31.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1704
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 2>he's so funny.</v>

1705
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.860
<v Speaker 2>He's so far the things you laughed the heart,</v>

1706
00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:35.640
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're,</v>

1707
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at it as like when I was going through a Taco bell drive through</v>

1708
00:44:37.961 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 2>in 11th grade and we were all stoned.</v>

1709
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 2>The things you would make jokes,</v>

1710
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:43.260
<v Speaker 2>nobody in the car would ever go.</v>

1711
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:44.100
<v Speaker 2>That's too much.</v>

1712
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.660
<v Speaker 2>If they did get rid of them,</v>

1713
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 2>they're done.</v>

1714
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:46.651
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1715
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1716
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.330
<v Speaker 2>no one means that.</v>

1717
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:48.961
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1718
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:51.750
<v Speaker 2>we would let each other's families.</v>

1719
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1720
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 2>my mother's just gets a phrenic.</v>

1721
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 2>We would make fun of my mother,</v>

1722
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:57.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1723
00:44:57.001 --> 00:44:57.541
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1724
00:44:57.541 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 2>it was great.</v>

1725
00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1726
00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.910
<v Speaker 2>I still do.</v>

1727
00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1728
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.980
<v Speaker 2>If you're someone in your family's mental wheel,</v>

1729
00:45:01.981 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 2>you're not making fun of them.</v>

1730
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.121
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

1731
00:45:03.121 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 2>it's your problem because difference is between east coast and west coast</v>

1732
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:07.051
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

1733
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Is it west coast comedy?</v>

1734
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:11.740
<v Speaker 2>They hold that carrot of a Sitcom or uh,</v>

1735
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1736
00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.820
<v Speaker 2>hosting the tonight show or something like that above your head.</v>

1737
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.320
<v Speaker 2>We had health insurance always there.</v>

1738
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 2>East Coast comedy is just be funny,</v>

1739
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.530
<v Speaker 2>be funny till you die and be funny and mean.</v>

1740
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of meanness and there's a lot of holes in the winter.</v>

1741
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.980
<v Speaker 2>It's cold and mean.</v>

1742
00:45:25.981 --> 00:45:26.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's really,</v>

1743
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1744
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:27.230
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

1745
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I like about west coast coming to choose,</v>

1746
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of performing cause he's,</v>

1747
00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:31.203
<v Speaker 2>the rooms are big.</v>

1748
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1749
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 2>And use your big east coast rooms are a little smaller.</v>

1750
00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 2>She have a lot of like writers.</v>

1751
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I love the performing style so I kind of like seeing people in the store with</v>

1752
00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 2>big acts.</v>

1753
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:41.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1754
00:45:41.461 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of room to move.</v>

1755
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're at the stand or the seller,</v>

1756
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.980
<v Speaker 2>something you are a little small.</v>

1757
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:47.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1758
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:48.720
<v Speaker 2>they're tight little rooms.</v>

1759
00:45:48.721 --> 00:45:52.530
<v Speaker 2>You can't use [inaudible] on stage performers in those rooms that rock out in</v>

1760
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:53.290
<v Speaker 2>the stroller.</v>

1761
00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:57.360
<v Speaker 2>But like when I was in the store I was like oh there's huge rooms.</v>

1762
00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Big performers and that's awesome.</v>

1763
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Especially like the main room,</v>

1764
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.830
<v Speaker 2>the main room is amazing.</v>

1765
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Giant stage.</v>

1766
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1767
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting.</v>

1768
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I like those really small intimate rooms in New York.</v>

1769
00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:10.530
<v Speaker 2>They lend themselves a lot to talking to the crowd and being sharp and having</v>

1770
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:12.870
<v Speaker 2>really sharp bits that hit.</v>

1771
00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:14.910
<v Speaker 2>And then I think,</v>

1772
00:46:14.911 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 2>and that's why you get to go everywhere because you need the,</v>

1773
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:17.731
<v Speaker 2>when you go on the road,</v>

1774
00:46:17.731 --> 00:46:18.001
<v Speaker 2>you want to,</v>

1775
00:46:18.001 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 2>you want a little bit of everything,</v>

1776
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you want to be able to perform and you want to have sharp jokes,</v>

1777
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:22.890
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta be able to do crowd work.</v>

1778
00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:23.161
<v Speaker 2>You've got to,</v>

1779
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:23.994
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:24.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1781
00:46:24.361 --> 00:46:26.940
<v Speaker 2>I started on Boston and Boston was always,</v>

1782
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.550
<v Speaker 2>no one has a long attention span.</v>

1783
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to do the jokes quick and if you start bombing,</v>

1784
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.930
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to recover.</v>

1785
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1786
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Nobody recovers in Boston.</v>

1787
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:36.680
<v Speaker 2>It's tough out there.</v>

1788
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 2>And once you start eating shit they've done with Bobby,</v>

1789
00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Kelly would tell me stories about like the rooms he came up to him.</v>

1790
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.660
<v Speaker 2>They are rough rooms.</v>

1791
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:42.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1792
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:43.734
<v Speaker 2>We came up together.</v>

1793
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did a lot of road gigs go.</v>

1794
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:46.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1795
00:46:46.201 --> 00:46:46.421
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1796
00:46:46.421 --> 00:46:46.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1797
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:47.760
<v Speaker 2>We actually lose that.</v>

1798
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Like what area of boss is that?</v>

1799
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Like outside of Boston?</v>

1800
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:50.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1801
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:52.800
<v Speaker 2>we did a lot of the Dick Dardy comedy huts.</v>

1802
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1803
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Out in the middle of fucking nowhere.</v>

1804
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Sounds great to Worcester.</v>

1805
00:46:56.011 --> 00:46:56.731
<v Speaker 2>Other were great.</v>

1806
00:46:56.731 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 2>There were [inaudible] which is like a Polynesian restaurant.</v>

1807
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1808
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And they would have comedy hut.</v>

1809
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:03.241
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

1810
00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:03.661
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

1811
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I did one the 50 minutes Netflix specials.</v>

1812
00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:10.680
<v Speaker 2>I went the next day to two days later I went to a room in Massachusetts outside</v>

1813
00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:12.300
<v Speaker 2>of Boston and I bombed so bad.</v>

1814
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:13.531
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

1815
00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:13.861
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1816
00:47:13.861 --> 00:47:17.040
<v Speaker 2>well this is why the funniest people in the world come from this state.</v>

1817
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.053
<v Speaker 2>Where was it?</v>

1818
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Where was I?</v>

1819
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I forget it was a,</v>

1820
00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1821
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say the actual show who did bucket.</v>

1822
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 2>This guy booked and he knows exactly.</v>

1823
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 2>He would probably tweet me or something.</v>

1824
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 2>But it was in God,</v>

1825
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.281
<v Speaker 2>it was outside.</v>

1826
00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 2>It was like 20 minutes outside.</v>

1827
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:35.081
<v Speaker 2>It was in,</v>

1828
00:47:35.081 --> 00:47:35.690
<v Speaker 2>it was in,</v>

1829
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Hingham,</v>

1830
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

1831
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.470
<v Speaker 2>it was somewhere and it was not good.</v>

1832
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 2>It was just a bar.</v>

1833
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:47.230
<v Speaker 2>It was a circular bar and I got up and then nobody was like w in the middle of</v>

1834
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 2>my set of woman to Trump,</v>

1835
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 2>woman started yelling me and then I yell back at her and then it was okay cause</v>

1836
00:47:52.541 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 2>we yelled at each other for 20 minutes.</v>

1837
00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.250
<v Speaker 2>That was just show.</v>

1838
00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:57.243
<v Speaker 2>What did she yell?</v>

1839
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it was something you have that funny.</v>

1840
00:47:59.951 --> 00:48:04.951
<v Speaker 2>If fat fucks up something that was justified at that moment in the set.</v>

1841
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I went back at her,</v>

1842
00:48:06.311 --> 00:48:06.611
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1843
00:48:06.611 --> 00:48:07.031
<v Speaker 2>listen to me,</v>

1844
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:07.864
<v Speaker 2>you fucking animal.</v>

1845
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.740
<v Speaker 2>And then it was great.</v>

1846
00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:09.220
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>

1847
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.920
<v Speaker 2>they perked right up and then the material worked after that.</v>

1848
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.980
<v Speaker 2>It's always exciting when something like that happens.</v>

1849
00:48:13.981 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like finally that was,</v>

1850
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:15.970
<v Speaker 2>it was the Trump moment,</v>

1851
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.460
<v Speaker 2>this moment where people are like sat up in their chair and they're like,</v>

1852
00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:18.851
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1853
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:19.390
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1854
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:20.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1855
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:20.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1856
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.970
<v Speaker 2>when I was living in Boston,</v>

1857
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.520
<v Speaker 2>you could make a living and not leave.</v>

1858
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1859
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:28.990
<v Speaker 2>You could stay in Boston and you could go 20 minutes here,</v>

1860
00:48:28.991 --> 00:48:30.090
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes there.</v>

1861
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.080
<v Speaker 2>You go to Andover,</v>

1862
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.240
<v Speaker 2>you go to hang them,</v>

1863
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you go to Framingham who go to all these different places and you got two gigs</v>

1864
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.920
<v Speaker 2>and I mean you wouldn't get rich,</v>

1865
00:48:38.921 --> 00:48:41.590
<v Speaker 2>but you could pay your bills and never leave town.</v>

1866
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.230
<v Speaker 2>And so there was so much comedy.</v>

1867
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:45.670
<v Speaker 2>There was so many rooms.</v>

1868
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Like Barry Katz had a bunch of rooms and the common connection had a bunch of</v>

1869
00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:53.350
<v Speaker 2>rooms and Mike Clarke had a bunch of rooms and there were slower.</v>

1870
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what really got you really strong.</v>

1871
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1872
00:48:56.921 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Because you're mostly doing these hell gigs during these hell gigs everywhere.</v>

1873
00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 2>And so when I came to New York,</v>

1874
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:06.400
<v Speaker 2>what got me was that everything was like small.</v>

1875
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.930
<v Speaker 2>There were small crowds,</v>

1876
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 2>small stages,</v>

1877
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:10.990
<v Speaker 2>and you would do a short amount of time.</v>

1878
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:11.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1879
00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:11.920
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1880
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1881
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this that much.</v>

1882
00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I could showcase set like 1510 15 minutes.</v>

1883
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1884
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Because I was doing like middle sets.</v>

1885
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I do a half hour and then I,</v>

1886
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.460
<v Speaker 2>I was headline and I do 45 minutes.</v>

1887
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1888
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.870
<v Speaker 2>so come out to long island.</v>

1889
00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:23.440
<v Speaker 2>We have kind of,</v>

1890
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.520
<v Speaker 2>it's an approximation,</v>

1891
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:25.630

1896
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:30.873
<v Speaker 2>A lot of gigs along.</v>

1897
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.460
<v Speaker 2>They'll tell you the benefit of the doubt is nonexistent.</v>

1898
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:34.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1899
00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:34.811

2042
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of the audiences in the business,</v>

2043
00:52:32.661 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is to this weird entire thing is agents who are like 22 years</v>

2044
00:52:37.011 --> 00:52:37.340
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2046
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.620
<v Speaker 3>They're like embryos to so young.</v>

2047
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:42.890
<v Speaker 3>The agents and agents and managers for the most part,</v>

2048
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>excluding mine who I love by agents and managers,</v>

2049
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.730
<v Speaker 3>they're rich kids who can't do tech or finance.</v>

2050
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's be a lot of them.</v>

2051
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.850
<v Speaker 3>There's quite a few,</v>

2052
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.421
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest,</v>

2053
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:55.790
<v Speaker 3>he's a rich kid whose parents go,</v>

2054
00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.713
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2055
00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:02.000
<v Speaker 3>can you do something because I don't want to look at you anymore and they're not</v>

2056
00:53:02.001 --> 00:53:03.350
<v Speaker 3>going to get a job at jolly bee.</v>

2057
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2058
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:07.700
<v Speaker 3>So they're going to go get a desk at UTA or CAA or WME and most,</v>

2059
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2060
00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:09.680
<v Speaker 3>everyone needs one too.</v>

2061
00:53:09.681 --> 00:53:10.670
<v Speaker 3>That's the other big thing.</v>

2062
00:53:10.671 --> 00:53:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not going to negotiate on your own.</v>

2063
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:13.370
<v Speaker 3>You're going to do a terrible job.</v>

2064
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.830
<v Speaker 3>If you negotiate your own gigs.</v>

2065
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.290
<v Speaker 3>I will take any amount of money to do anything.</v>

2066
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2067
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:20.361
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2068
00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm horrible at negotiating.</v>

2070
00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:24.560
<v Speaker 3>sales didn't work.</v>

2071
00:53:24.561 --> 00:53:25.290
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm here.</v>

2072
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:25.531
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2073
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 3>apparently</v>

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Bill Murray doesn't have an agent or a manager.</v>

2075
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:33.510
<v Speaker 2>He has an answering machine and people call them up and they make them offers to</v>

2076

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean as it gets later,</v>

2158
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:25.284
<v Speaker 2>people get drunker.</v>

2159
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.710
<v Speaker 2>I used to do danger fields that's in there.</v>

2160
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2161
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 2>And we do prom shows.</v>

2162
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2163
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever do the prom show thing?</v>

2164
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a prompt show act.</v>

2165
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:37.140
<v Speaker 2>This is what they do with a bunch of kids are sitting there and I walk out on</v>

2166
00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:37.560
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

2167
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad prom.</v>

2168
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:38.971
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2169
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 2>it's always a bad prom.</v>

2170
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Prom shows a terrible,</v>

2171
00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:43.350
<v Speaker 2>but what they do is they,</v>

2172
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:44.223
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

2173
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.870
<v Speaker 2>and back in the day at least,</v>

2174
00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 2>they didn't change the crowd.</v>

2175
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.093
<v Speaker 2>So you would,</v>

2176
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.210
<v Speaker 2>you would go out,</v>

2177
00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:53.440
<v Speaker 2>like say if there's like four comics on the light up,</v>

2178
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.250
<v Speaker 2>there's an MC and three other comics and then there's the next show,</v>

2179
00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:57.090
<v Speaker 2>it starts all over again.</v>

2180
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.530
<v Speaker 2>We see the same three comics,</v>

2181
00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:00.000
<v Speaker 2>the audiences there.</v>

2182
00:56:00.001 --> 00:56:04.650
<v Speaker 2>So they want you to do the exact same acts so that the kids will leave because</v>

2183
00:56:04.651 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 2>they have no account of the kids.</v>

2184
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:09.300
<v Speaker 2>So that buses pulled up and they're just stuffing these kids in there and</v>

2185
00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 2>they're hoping that if you do the same bits,</v>

2186
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.390
<v Speaker 2>the kids will get bored.</v>

2187
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:14.070
<v Speaker 2>And they got mad at me cause I'm like,</v>

2188
00:56:14.071 --> 00:56:14.370
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2189
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing the same material.</v>

2190
00:56:16.411 --> 00:56:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I see the same faces.</v>

2191
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:18.230
<v Speaker 2>It's boring.</v>

2192
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2193
00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm only doing a 15 minutes set.</v>

2194
00:56:19.771 --> 00:56:20.041
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2195
00:56:20.041 --> 00:56:21.180
<v Speaker 2>I have more material,</v>

2196
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do other,</v>

2197
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:22.943
<v Speaker 2>other bits.</v>

2198
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:23.351
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2199
00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 2>you got to do the same jokes.</v>

2200
00:56:24.461 --> 00:56:25.600
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to get these people out of here.</v>

2201
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.021
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2202
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:26.854
<v Speaker 2>how about just the cast?</v>

2203
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:27.783
<v Speaker 2>Just grab him.</v>

2204
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Just get him Outta here.</v>

2205
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:29.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2206
00:56:29.291 --> 00:56:30.490
<v Speaker 2>just light a fire.</v>

2207
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 2>But we would do them til five o'clock in the morning.</v>

2208
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Dangerfield,</v>

2209
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:35.830
<v Speaker 2>the last time was in danger fields.</v>

2210
00:56:35.831 --> 00:56:36.850
<v Speaker 2>It was four people in a room,</v>

2211
00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.533
<v Speaker 2>two couples,</v>

2212
00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:40.240
<v Speaker 2>waiters about in his mid eighties.</v>

2213
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2214
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 2>it's dark and I'm performing in front of a piano.</v>

2215
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:44.890
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those nights where you go,</v>

2216
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2217
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:49.120
<v Speaker 2>this was a choice I made to get into this business.</v>

2218
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:50.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2219
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 2>but there's something haunting about that room and it was actually fun.</v>

2220
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm just entertaining to couples.</v>

2221
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2222
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.853
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

2223
00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I did one cup of once at the end.</v>

2224
00:56:58.191 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Your fields,</v>

2225
00:56:58.900 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 2>there was no one,</v>

2226
00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.483
<v Speaker 2>there was no show.</v>

2227
00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:01.820
<v Speaker 2>I had a nine o'clock spot,</v>

2228
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:02.560
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2229
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.280
<v Speaker 2>There's never a show.</v>

2230
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I had a nine o'clock spot.</v>

2231
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2232
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I got there at eight 45.</v>

2233
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.810
<v Speaker 2>The comics are sitting around the bar.</v>

2234
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:08.321
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2235
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

2236
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:09.101
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2237
00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:09.934
<v Speaker 2>there's no one here.</v>

2238
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:10.121
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2239
00:57:10.121 --> 00:57:10.954
<v Speaker 2>there's no one here.</v>

2240
00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And then right when I said that,</v>

2241
00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.940
<v Speaker 2>this couple walked up and Bobby,</v>

2242
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.521

2245
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.090
<v Speaker 2>there's this fucking Scottish power lifter guy.</v>

2246
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:22.180
<v Speaker 2>He was like five foot 10 and five foot 10 wide.</v>

2247
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2249
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:27.820
<v Speaker 2>I saw him grab a kid by his neck at one of these prompts shows and pick him up</v>

2250
00:57:27.821 --> 00:57:30.230
<v Speaker 2>by his neck and carry them out of their cheese.</v>

2251
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:30.701
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2252
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:31.960
<v Speaker 2>he was this tank of a man.</v>

2253
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:34.870
<v Speaker 2>He was always fucking hilarious and ruthless on the comedians.</v>

2254
00:57:34.871 --> 00:57:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2255
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2256
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.010
<v Speaker 2>You got to try that bag of Shite.</v>

2257
00:57:37.011 --> 00:57:38.080
<v Speaker 2>You call it a fucking act.</v>

2258
00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2259
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:39.603

2260
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:41.170
<v Speaker 2>these people walk in and he's like,</v>

2261
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.791
<v Speaker 2>ladies,</v>

2262
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:42.100
<v Speaker 2>gentlemen,</v>

2263
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.060
<v Speaker 2>welcome to danger fields.</v>

2264
00:57:43.061 --> 00:57:43.894
<v Speaker 2>Come on right in.</v>

2265
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 2>And he brings him in and these people walked into his empty room and sit down</v>

2266
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:48.611
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

2267
00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:49.590
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on?</v>

2268
00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Like it crazy.</v>

2269
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.970
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden the lights come on and then the MC comes out and they</v>

2270
00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.680
<v Speaker 2>sat through all of us.</v>

2271
00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2272
00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:57.551
<v Speaker 2>Sat through.</v>

2273
00:57:57.551 --> 00:57:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2274
00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:58.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2275
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:00.530
<v Speaker 2>fourth on the lineup or something like that.</v>

2276
00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I did my fucking 15 minutes in front of these two people and they were into it.</v>

2277
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.070
<v Speaker 2>They were great.</v>

2278
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2279
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:06.881
<v Speaker 2>they were great,</v>

2280
00:58:06.881 --> 00:58:07.541
<v Speaker 2>but it was weird.</v>

2281
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:07.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2282
00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:08.460
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

2283
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.790
<v Speaker 2>those shows what's good about those shows build you?</v>

2284
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2285
00:58:11.081 --> 00:58:11.470
<v Speaker 2>they may,</v>

2286
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.280
<v Speaker 2>they let you know what's bullshit and your act because you feel embarrassed</v>

2287
00:58:14.281 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 2>saying it.</v>

2288
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a great point.</v>

2289
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:15.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2290
00:58:15.971 --> 00:58:18.130
<v Speaker 2>You feel it feels clunky coming out of your mouth,</v>

2291
00:58:18.131 --> 00:58:18.431
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2292
00:58:18.431 --> 00:58:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Especially to three people.</v>

2293
00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2294
00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:20.710
<v Speaker 2>there's always,</v>

2295
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.120
<v Speaker 2>things are always clunky,</v>

2296
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:22.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2297
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2298
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.180
<v Speaker 2>and when it's a small crowd,</v>

2299
00:58:25.181 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 2>they're really clunky.</v>

2300
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're working on material,</v>

2301
00:58:27.881 --> 00:58:29.590
<v Speaker 2>every time I have a premise,</v>

2302
00:58:29.591 --> 00:58:31.630
<v Speaker 2>or even if I'm fucking telling a story,</v>

2303
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.471
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times,</v>

2304
00:58:32.471 --> 00:58:34.120
<v Speaker 2>like as I'm starting to tell the story,</v>

2305
00:58:34.121 --> 00:58:37.930
<v Speaker 2>like the beginning part is a little fucking clunky and maybe I'm saying</v>

2306
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 2>something the wrong way and it doesn't make total sense.</v>

2307
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually it catches on.</v>

2308
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:44.140
<v Speaker 2>If you do that in front of two people,</v>

2309
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:46.001
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2310
00:58:46.001 --> 00:58:47.170
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

2311
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2312
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 2>The best story about the age of fields was there was a guy who walked in once I</v>

2313
00:58:50.741 --> 00:58:52.210
<v Speaker 2>was hitting in the bar area,</v>

2314
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:53.590
<v Speaker 2>he had a Rodney Dangerfield,</v>

2315
00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.730
<v Speaker 2>a doll,</v>

2316
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:55.841
<v Speaker 2>and he walked in.</v>

2317
00:58:55.841 --> 00:58:56.081
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2318
00:58:56.081 --> 00:58:56.860
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2319
00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I've had a business for t,</v>

2320
00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2321
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:00.340
<v Speaker 2>for 10 years up the block I,</v>

2322
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.570
<v Speaker 2>we found the stall.</v>

2323
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm moving to,</v>

2324
00:59:02.531 --> 00:59:02.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2325
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 2>wherever he was going.</v>

2326
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:03.910
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2327
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:04.900
<v Speaker 2>we're closing up shop.</v>

2328
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.393
<v Speaker 2>Here you go.</v>

2329
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:07.360
<v Speaker 2>I thought you might like it.</v>

2330
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.070
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy took it,</v>

2331
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:10.120
<v Speaker 2>he said to the owner,</v>

2332
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:11.350
<v Speaker 2>he said he just,</v>

2333
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:12.640
<v Speaker 2>there was no speaking right.</v>

2334
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 2>He just showed him this doll and then the owner just pointed and then the guy</v>

2335
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:19.300
<v Speaker 2>carried this Rodney Dangerfield doll down the stairs and just put it in like</v>

2336
00:59:19.301 --> 00:59:20.134
<v Speaker 2>storage.</v>

2337
00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.240
<v Speaker 2>And it was the darkest moment,</v>

2338
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:26.780
<v Speaker 2>which is such a dark moment to sit there silent.</v>

2339
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Just the owner went and pointed in.</v>

2340
00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:32.050
<v Speaker 2>The guy just took this Dangerfield doll and he walked it down into caught,</v>

2341
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 2>only know the phantom of the opera,</v>

2342
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:35.240
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell goes down under that club.</v>

2343
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.751
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2344
00:59:35.751 --> 00:59:36.231
<v Speaker 2>that's a real,</v>

2345
00:59:36.231 --> 00:59:37.490
<v Speaker 2>that's like the oldest club in the country.</v>

2346
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 2>How's it still open?</v>

2347
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.991
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2348
00:59:38.991 --> 00:59:43.340
<v Speaker 2>that is a great question that the FBI would probably want to look into.</v>

2349
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:44.473
<v Speaker 2>I don't know</v>

2350
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.390
<v Speaker 4>cause everybody's getting the same story.</v>

2351
00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:47.230
<v Speaker 4>People who was there,</v>

2352
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:49.090
<v Speaker 4>people go 25 years ago,</v>

2353
00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:51.290
<v Speaker 4>25 years ago.</v>

2354
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:52.270
<v Speaker 4>There was no one there.</v>

2355
00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:54.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean the fucking show that I'm telling you about,</v>

2356
00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:55.960
<v Speaker 4>that was 25 years ago.</v>

2357
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:57.160
<v Speaker 4>There's never been anyone there.</v>

2358
00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:59.313
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2359
00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Money off those prompts shows though.</v>

2360
01:00:00.971 --> 01:00:01.660
<v Speaker 2>They were packed.</v>

2361
01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like a great joke about like Nanette that my buddy nick Mullane is an</v>

2362
01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:06.220
<v Speaker 2>amazingly funny comedian,</v>

2363
01:00:06.221 --> 01:00:07.120
<v Speaker 2>said he's like in the net.</v>

2364
01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:07.691
<v Speaker 2>No one's seen,</v>

2365
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:10.450
<v Speaker 2>it's just a trailer like no one seemed to net.</v>

2366
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just a trailer and everyone's like,</v>

2367
01:00:11.981 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 2>it's brave.</v>

2368
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.840
<v Speaker 2>It's really amazing.</v>

2369
01:00:13.841 --> 01:00:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It's my number one.</v>

2370
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:15.641
<v Speaker 2>It's just a trailer.</v>

2371
01:00:15.641 --> 01:00:16.540
<v Speaker 2>It literally doesn't exist,</v>

2372
01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:17.021
<v Speaker 2>so maybe,</v>

2373
01:00:17.021 --> 01:00:17.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2374
01:00:17.471 --> 01:00:18.040
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>

2375
01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.840
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those rooms in New York that's kind of haunting.</v>

2376
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:20.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2377
01:00:20.591 --> 01:00:21.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange place.</v>

2378
01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:21.851
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>

2379
01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You ever listen to the day the laughter died?</v>

2380
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:24.880
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2381
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Dice Clay's a double album that he filmed there with no audience.</v>

2382
01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:31.060
<v Speaker 2>No one knew he was coming.</v>

2383
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.890
<v Speaker 2>He had no material.</v>

2384
01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

2385
01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:34.511
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2386
01:00:34.511 --> 01:00:39.160
<v Speaker 2>He just started talking about shit and ad libbing things and he was as big as a</v>

2387
01:00:39.161 --> 01:00:42.970
<v Speaker 2>fucking comedian could be at the time and he called it the day the laughter</v>

2388
01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:43.300
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

2389
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2390
01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Ruben produced it.</v>

2391
01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:45.431
<v Speaker 2>That's no,</v>

2392
01:00:45.431 --> 01:00:46.031
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of it,</v>

2393
01:00:46.031 --> 01:00:50.050
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know it was fucking brilliant and horrible at the same time.</v>

2394
01:00:50.051 --> 01:00:50.411
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2395
01:00:50.411 --> 01:00:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Some guy gets up in the middle of his set,</v>

2396
01:00:51.911 --> 01:00:52.091
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

2397
01:00:52.091 --> 01:00:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you're about as funny as our gloss or milk.</v>

2398
01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2399
01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>What a polite apple.</v>

2400
01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:59.170
<v Speaker 2>What an old fashioned heckle.</v>

2401
01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard that.</v>

2402
01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Usually people are like,</v>

2403
01:01:01.751 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 2>shut up faggot.</v>

2404
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:04.601
<v Speaker 2>You're a baptist.</v>

2405
01:01:04.601 --> 01:01:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Funny as a glass of milk.</v>

2406
01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:06.281
<v Speaker 2>It's lovely.</v>

2407
01:01:06.281 --> 01:01:06.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:01:06.491 --> 01:01:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Some guy from Connecticut or something like that,</v>

2409
01:01:08.681 --> 01:01:09.370
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2410
01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Then he got mad.</v>

2411
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:12.260
<v Speaker 2>He got mad at dice and you know,</v>

2412
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just shitting on him and shit on everything.</v>

2413
01:01:14.831 --> 01:01:16.250
<v Speaker 2>That's probably just destroyed it.</v>

2414
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Well was it was destroying them,</v>

2415
01:01:18.281 --> 01:01:19.061
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you,</v>

2416
01:01:19.061 --> 01:01:20.500
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't even trying.</v>

2417
01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:21.760
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2418
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.760
<v Speaker 2>it was like he was at some crazy place in his career where he just decided to do</v>

2419
01:01:28.391 --> 01:01:29.860
<v Speaker 2>a set or he's bombing.</v>

2420
01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever think of doing something like that?</v>

2421
01:01:31.241 --> 01:01:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

2422
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Never think it just called crazy into it.</v>

2423
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Something completely.</v>

2424
01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to do,</v>

2425
01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:37.893
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2426
01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.450
<v Speaker 2>I would feel bad.</v>

2427
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I can't do something bad on purpose because then people,</v>

2428
01:01:43.781 --> 01:01:44.920
<v Speaker 2>if I do something bad,</v>

2429
01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:46.000
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>

2430
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:46.901
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2431
01:01:46.901 --> 01:01:48.160
<v Speaker 2>if you hear it and it sucks,</v>

2432
01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:49.323
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>

2433
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.140
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2434
01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:50.501
<v Speaker 2>I've made it.</v>

2435
01:01:50.501 --> 01:01:51.131
<v Speaker 2>I made a mistake.</v>

2436
01:01:51.131 --> 01:01:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do it good.</v>

2437
01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2438
01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:52.751
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

2439
01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:53.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2440
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:53.861
<v Speaker 2>didn't put it together.</v>

2441
01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:54.161
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2442
01:01:54.161 --> 01:01:54.260
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

2443
01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.240
<v Speaker 2>it's trial and error.</v>

2444
01:01:55.241 --> 01:01:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's an error.</v>

2445
01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do anything bad on purpose,</v>

2446
01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:02.410
<v Speaker 2>but he was so big and no one had been that big before.</v>

2447
01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:02.611
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2448
01:02:02.611 --> 01:02:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Have to realize no one had done arenas before him.</v>

2449
01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:04.601
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2450
01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:06.040
<v Speaker 2>He was the first arena caught first.</v>

2451
01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2452
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.761

01:02:06.761 --> 01:02:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2454
01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.610
<v Speaker 2>And a fucking hundred of them.</v>

2455
01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:14.640
<v Speaker 2>He would do them all over the country and he just had had enough for whatever</v>

2456
01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:17.580
<v Speaker 2>reason of fucking everybody loving him.</v>

2457
01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:18.461

2461
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:26.460

2462
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Hours of no material.</v>

2463

<v Speaker 2>talking about stuff,</v>

2465
01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 2>punch lines that don't make sense.</v>

2468
01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.171
<v Speaker 2>To this day,</v>

2469
01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 2>it's one of my favorite comedy albums of all time.</v>

2470
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen to it every now and then for like 15 minutes in my car,</v>

2471
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:42.301
<v Speaker 2>I just go,</v>

2472
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:43.520
<v Speaker 2>what the fat to me.</v>

2473
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Is it all at Dangerfield?</v>

2474
01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2475
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 2>All of that.</v>

2476
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.630
<v Speaker 2>All that danger fields.</v>

2477
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:47.730
<v Speaker 2>No one knew he was coming.</v>

2478
01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2479
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.021
<v Speaker 2>And when they saw him,</v>

2480
01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:49.231
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2481
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:49.951
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

2482
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:50.760
<v Speaker 2>it's dice clay.</v>

2483
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.130
<v Speaker 2>It was probably 20 people in the crowd who were so excited.</v>

2484
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.020
<v Speaker 2>They probably did it on a Tuesday or some shit.</v>

2485
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.273
<v Speaker 2>He's an animal.</v>

2486
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:57.220
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing though.</v>

2487
01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2488
01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.270
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

2489
01:02:58.270 --> 01:02:58.651
<v Speaker 2>That to me,</v>

2490
01:02:58.651 --> 01:02:59.311
<v Speaker 2>that type of stuff.</v>

2491
01:02:59.311 --> 01:02:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2492
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I liked that to have to stop because to me it's like,</v>

2493
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:04.080
<v Speaker 2>it's the raw essence of what this is.</v>

2494
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I found out about it from another comedian,</v>

2495
01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:06.211
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2496
01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:07.011
<v Speaker 2>Mike Donovan,</v>

2497
01:03:07.011 --> 01:03:08.490
<v Speaker 2>a hilarious guy from Boston,</v>

2498
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.410
<v Speaker 2>and he was crying,</v>

2499
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:11.010
<v Speaker 2>laughing,</v>

2500
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:16.010
<v Speaker 2>describing it and describing this bit the dice was doing about Nixon eating ass</v>

2501
01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.213
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

2502
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.711
<v Speaker 2>and he was doing,</v>

2503
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy,</v>

2504
01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:24.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2505
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.230
<v Speaker 2>It was so ridiculous.</v>

2506
01:03:25.231 --> 01:03:26.011
<v Speaker 2>But for whatever reason,</v>

2507
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Mike Donovan was,</v>

2508
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 2>tears were coming out of it so he couldn't breathe.</v>

2509
01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 2>He was describing it.</v>

2510
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:30.901
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2511
01:03:30.901 --> 01:03:31.201
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2512

2515
01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:34.170
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2516
01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:35.580
<v Speaker 2>this guy can just talk.</v>

2517
01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2518
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:36.923

2519
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:37.681

2522
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 2>to me he's always represented to me,</v>

2523
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 2>my childhood because when I was like 19 was the first time I listened to his</v>

2524
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:51.950
<v Speaker 2>cassette in my car with my girlfriend and I could,</v>

2525
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 2>we were just crying,</v>

2526
01:03:53.431 --> 01:03:53.850
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>

2527
01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe how funny was.</v>

2528
01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Is that what made you with these?</v>

2529
01:03:56.281 --> 01:03:57.270
<v Speaker 2>He one of the guys what you will like?</v>

2531
01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2532
01:03:59.011 --> 01:03:59.611
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2533
01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:00.780
<v Speaker 2>He was definitely one of them.</v>

2534
01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Him and Kinison him and kittens and prior,</v>

2535
01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 2>but prior was see like I remember watching those guys and then watching prior</v>

2536
01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:08.160
<v Speaker 2>and we're like,</v>

2537
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.590
<v Speaker 2>God prior was so smooth.</v>

2538
01:04:10.591 --> 01:04:14.010
<v Speaker 2>He was so the way he was so personable and vulnerable.</v>

2539
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:16.680
<v Speaker 2>He was something different because he was vulnerable.</v>

2540
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:21.120
<v Speaker 2>He would talk about like his life and his problems and all these different</v>

2541
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 2>things about being addicted to drugs and all these different Indian,</v>

2542
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.760
<v Speaker 2>it was so intelligent,</v>

2543
01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:29.670
<v Speaker 2>but vulnerable and honest and,</v>

2544
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.040
<v Speaker 2>and the timing was so good.</v>

2545
01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:33.240
<v Speaker 2>He was such a master.</v>

2546
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:36.450
<v Speaker 2>I remember we were watching was me and my roommates at the time.</v>

2547
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.470
<v Speaker 2>We watched the Kinison special and then we watched Richard Pryor and my friend</v>

2548
01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>who was never a comedian and everyone thought he goes dot fucking guys the best</v>

2549
01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:45.540
<v Speaker 2>cause he's just the best.</v>

2550
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:46.500
<v Speaker 2>And it was just,</v>

2551
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.850
<v Speaker 2>we were both in agreement like,</v>

2552
01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:48.001
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2553
01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:48.834
<v Speaker 2>he's just better.</v>

2554
01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just the way he did it,</v>

2555
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:52.231
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2556
01:04:52.231 --> 01:04:52.801
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

2557
01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:53.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2558
01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.830
<v Speaker 2>we're talking like 1988 sure.</v>

2559
01:04:55.890 --> 01:05:00.890
<v Speaker 2>So it was still fairly fresh and prior was still alive and it was just</v>

2560
01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:01.800
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

2561
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2562
01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:02.611
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2563
01:05:02.611 --> 01:05:03.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2564
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:04.680
<v Speaker 2>he was like the first,</v>

2565
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously Lenny Bruce was the first really honest comedian like,</v>

2566
01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:14.150
<v Speaker 2>or one of the first honest social commentators and then Carlin,</v>

2567
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:18.570
<v Speaker 2>but prior took it to a weird personal place where you like,</v>

2568
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.200
<v Speaker 2>we're rooting for him.</v>

2569
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:24.100
<v Speaker 2>It was the most personal of all of those guys because the Hex and Collin were</v>

2570
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:25.510
<v Speaker 2>famously like not personal.</v>

2571
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2572
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.160
<v Speaker 2>And prior was personal.</v>

2573
01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2574
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:28.773
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2575
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.613
<v Speaker 2>Personal and,</v>

2576
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:30.820
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2577
01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:31.481
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2578
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:33.970
<v Speaker 2>he would like emphasize humanity.</v>

2579
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2580
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Like you would emphasize like loving each other and being kind to each other.</v>

2581
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.431
<v Speaker 2>Like that was a thing.</v>

2582
01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2583
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:40.570
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2584
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2585
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.063
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2586
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:42.371
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2587
01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2588
01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:43.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2589
01:05:43.331 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I tell my parents took me to see live at the sunset strip and I was a little</v>

2590
01:05:46.421 --> 01:05:46.840
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

2591
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:46.991
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2592
01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:47.591
<v Speaker 2>you saw it,</v>

2593
01:05:47.591 --> 01:05:48.401
<v Speaker 2>the actual none.</v>

2594
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:51.150
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden in the movie theater when a movie theater and that,</v>

2595
01:05:51.151 --> 01:05:53.350
<v Speaker 2>that was probably the big seed.</v>

2596
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:54.131
<v Speaker 2>That was the impact.</v>

2597
01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2598
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2599
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Because I couldn't believe how funny this guy was just talking.</v>

2600
01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 2>I remember looking around the theater and these people were like falling out of</v>

2601
01:06:00.401 --> 01:06:01.720
<v Speaker 2>their chairs laughing and I'm like,</v>

2602
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this guy is just talking.</v>

2603
01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:04.930
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing.</v>

2604
01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:05.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Because all these movies that I'd seen that were really funny.</v>

2606
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2607
01:06:07.641 --> 01:06:11.130
<v Speaker 2>He was a bunch of things happen and explosions and fucking stripes.</v>

2608
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:13.150
<v Speaker 2>But this was not that.</v>

2610
01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:13.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2611
01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:13.931
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

2612
01:06:13.931 --> 01:06:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I sat Eddie Pepitone tape his special a few days ago at a dynasty,</v>

2613
01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 2>a typewriter and he's one of those guys who still funny and so electric that you</v>

2614
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:22.270
<v Speaker 2>have a room full of,</v>

2615
01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2616
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:26.320
<v Speaker 2>the type of people were kind of talking about your more buttoned up,</v>

2617
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:27.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2618
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.110
<v Speaker 2>the more of that kind of alternative crowd.</v>

2619
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:31.540
<v Speaker 2>They were barking and howling.</v>

2620
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.660
<v Speaker 2>And how funny he was and some of the things he said.</v>

2621
01:06:34.661 --> 01:06:35.620
<v Speaker 2>The first thing he does,</v>

2622
01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 2>he grabbed the microphone and he's like,</v>

2623
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm on Molly.</v>

2624
01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>The hall just exploded and he's one of those dudes I watch and I'm like,</v>

2625
01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:47.643
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2626
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.540
<v Speaker 2>intensity.</v>

2627
01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Just raw power.</v>

2628
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.730
<v Speaker 2>He's announced such a nice guy too.</v>

2629
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 2>He's a great too,</v>

2630
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.500
<v Speaker 2>if you know him.</v>

2631
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2632
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Route Forum.</v>

2633
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:59.950
<v Speaker 2>A sweetheart of a car and an odd guy like,</v>

2634
01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any other Eddie Pepitone.</v>

2635
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:01.991
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2636
01:07:01.991 --> 01:07:03.280
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes him so great.</v>

2637
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2638
01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:03.761
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2639
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:04.241
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2640
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:05.800
<v Speaker 2>this is an experience and the beat,</v>

2641
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:06.161
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2642
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:06.851
<v Speaker 2>the best comedy,</v>

2643
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I think is a comedy where you go,</v>

2644
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:08.771
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2645
01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm having an experience now I can't have again.</v>

2646
01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:11.051
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2647
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:11.201
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2648
01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:11.470
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2649
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I can't have this again or especially a live show.</v>

2650
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2651
01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't go down the block and see this.</v>

2652
01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not as a steak house.</v>

2653
01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:18.700
<v Speaker 2>It's the same in every city.</v>

2654
01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:24.540
<v Speaker 2>This is a fucking unique human individual that's having this experience at this</v>

2655
01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:25.510
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>

2656
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:26.590
<v Speaker 2>and I'm lucky to be here with,</v>

2657
01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.173
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2658
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2659
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Live shows,</v>

2660
01:07:29.531 --> 01:07:30.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2661
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.280
<v Speaker 2>There's something about it that it's so hard to translate when you,</v>

2662
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:34.360
<v Speaker 2>when you did your Netflix,</v>

2663
01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:35.860
<v Speaker 2>but if you did one of the 15 minute ones,</v>

2664
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:37.510
<v Speaker 2>how many they're doing a lot of those,</v>

2665
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.830
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a good move.</v>

2666
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Four to 5,000 jobs.</v>

2667
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:41.103
<v Speaker 2>It's a great movie.</v>

2668
01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:44.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a great move to have everyone have a special,</v>

2669
01:07:44.921 --> 01:07:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I think my mother's doing one.</v>

2670
01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:47.290
<v Speaker 2>It's very exciting.</v>

2671
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2672
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.590
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to do comedy and have a special anymore.</v>

2673
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 2>You can just sit in a car and talk.</v>

2674
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:53.890
<v Speaker 2>That's my next admission tape will be me speaking in a,</v>

2675
01:07:53.891 --> 01:07:55.450
<v Speaker 2>in a car going through an in and out,</v>

2676
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2677
01:07:56.110 --> 01:08:00.580
<v Speaker 2>bill burrs videos of him driving around his fucking 40 funnier than just talking</v>

2678
01:08:00.581 --> 01:08:00.711
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2679
01:08:00.711 --> 01:08:01.620
<v Speaker 2>this is the funniest thing.</v>

2680
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Most specials.</v>

2681
01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2682
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:04.991
<v Speaker 2>the Netflix,</v>

2683
01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:05.860
<v Speaker 2>he was a lot of fun,</v>

2684
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.300
<v Speaker 2>but here's the reality.</v>

2685
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I watch it back and I'm like,</v>

2686
01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:09.451
<v Speaker 2>it was fun.</v>

2687
01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:10.284
<v Speaker 2>Or in the room,</v>

2688
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:11.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2689
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:12.370
<v Speaker 2>it's just one of those things,</v>

2690
01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:12.701
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

2691
01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Bring the pain was better in the room even though it's amazing.</v>

2692
01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2693
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:15.261
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2694
01:08:15.261 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 2>You watch that and you're</v>

2695
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.101
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2696
01:08:16.101 --> 01:08:17.930
<v Speaker 3>this is the highest heights of anything.</v>

2697
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:18.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 3>That's why when someone makes you laugh really hard on a special God,</v>

2699
01:08:21.801 --> 01:08:23.420
<v Speaker 3>imagine what it'd been like being there.</v>

2700
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:23.871
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2701
01:08:23.871 --> 01:08:24.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

2702
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:29.270
<v Speaker 3>the comedy is an act I have one of my friends always says comedy should be seen</v>

2703
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.800
<v Speaker 3>live in,</v>

2704
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 3>and listen,</v>

2705
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 3>there's something different about a smaller venue,</v>

2706
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.600
<v Speaker 3>like when people go see what the store,</v>

2707
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.430
<v Speaker 3>there's something different than seeing you in a theater.</v>

2708
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:39.050
<v Speaker 3>The level of intimacy,</v>

2709
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:39.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2710
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:41.090
<v Speaker 3>seen you work stuff out,</v>

2711
01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:41.990
<v Speaker 3>seeing you in,</v>

2712
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2713
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.753
<v Speaker 3>in the moment.</v>

2714
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 3>There's something different about that 100%.</v>

2715
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2716
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2717
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.090
<v Speaker 3>I like 150 to 300 seat room.</v>

2718
01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:50.870
<v Speaker 3>That's what I like.</v>

2719
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:51.400
<v Speaker 3>But I also,</v>

2720
01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I like 11,000 seats too.</v>

2721
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:54.110
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of crazy.</v>

2722
01:08:54.111 --> 01:08:55.190
<v Speaker 3>It's fun in a weird way.</v>

2723
01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:56.001
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2724
01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:59.060
<v Speaker 3>And if you could make those people like feel like it's intimate,</v>

2725
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.400
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

2726
01:08:59.400 --> 01:08:59.721
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2727
01:08:59.721 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2728
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.823
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

2729
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.010
<v Speaker 3>you can treat 11,000 people the same way you treat the main room.</v>

2730
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.250
<v Speaker 3>A hundred seat room that's filled with about 80 people.</v>

2731
01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.113
<v Speaker 3>That's good too.</v>

2732
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:09.760
<v Speaker 3>This is low expectations.</v>

2733
01:09:09.761 --> 01:09:10.281
<v Speaker 3>What I like.</v>

2734
01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 3>I like a big room full of the very small amount of people and they could sit</v>

2735
01:09:14.211 --> 01:09:16.790
<v Speaker 3>back and get really drunk and that were lax.</v>

2736
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:20.090
<v Speaker 3>All the wait staff home shut off most of the lights.</v>

2737
01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:20.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2738
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:21.554
<v Speaker 3>There's something,</v>

2739
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on when you're doing a live performance that no one's</v>

2740
01:09:25.431 --> 01:09:26.660
<v Speaker 3>ever really quantified.</v>

2741
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.430
<v Speaker 3>It's some kind of a mass hypnosis or some energy transfer because I was an actor</v>

2742
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:32.211
<v Speaker 3>for when I was a kid.</v>

2743
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I was six years old to 12.</v>

2744
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:34.874
<v Speaker 3>I was an actor.</v>

2745
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 3>You know your parents' idea.</v>

2746
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh it was my idea,</v>

2747
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Joe and uh,</v>

2748
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.160
<v Speaker 3>like most six year olds or six.</v>

2749
01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:40.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2750
01:09:40.371 --> 01:09:41.000
<v Speaker 3>it was great.</v>

2751
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2752
01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.070
<v Speaker 3>I knew what your cabaret license,</v>

2753
01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.960
<v Speaker 3>it was on sesame street twice.</v>

2754
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.863
<v Speaker 3>We really,</v>

2755
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:47.110
<v Speaker 3>for it to all legit.</v>

2756
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Was It really your idea?</v>

2757
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2758
01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I pointed at the TV and said,</v>

2759
01:09:50.271 --> 01:09:50.481
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2760
01:09:50.481 --> 01:09:54.170
<v Speaker 3>unless my parents are lying cause I don't remember and they are liars.</v>

2761
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:58.010
<v Speaker 3>So they needed muddy all south.</v>

2762
01:09:59.240 --> 01:09:59.751
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

2763
01:09:59.751 --> 01:10:01.910
<v Speaker 3>I pointed to the TV and said I want to be on that.</v>

2764
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.541
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>

2765
01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:02.811
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2766
01:10:02.811 --> 01:10:06.200
<v Speaker 3>and I made them take me on auditions that maybe they were looking over their</v>

2767
01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:09.500
<v Speaker 3>bills and I was a good looking little kid and they said he needs to start</v>

2768
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:12.470
<v Speaker 3>pulling his weight and you know,</v>

2769
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.333
<v Speaker 3>we've got to start taking him up.</v>

2770
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2771
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:14.450
<v Speaker 3>it was on sesame street.</v>

2772
01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I was in a bunch of plays and stuff.</v>

2773
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:17.630
<v Speaker 3>That live performance is different.</v>

2774
01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:18.470
<v Speaker 3>It's still energy,</v>

2775
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:24.070
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing quite like being alone on a stage doing comedy.</v>

2776
01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Well there's all doodle much later.</v>

2777
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.920
<v Speaker 3>It's all your shit.</v>

2778
01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:29.150
<v Speaker 3>You're writing it,</v>

2779
01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:31.310
<v Speaker 3>you're figuring out your per se it,</v>

2780
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:32.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2781
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:33.230
<v Speaker 3>you're crafting it,</v>

2782
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:34.220
<v Speaker 3>putting it together.</v>

2783
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's why the rejection is the deepest.</v>

2784
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.963
<v Speaker 3>How do you write?</v>

2785
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.120
<v Speaker 3>I go on stage with an idea and I've started doing these little videos on</v>

2786
01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Instagram where I actually kind of rant about an issue and if people kind of</v>

2787
01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:47.690
<v Speaker 3>respond positively to them,</v>

2788
01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:51.440
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll take that to the stage and I'll just try to rant about an issue</v>

2789
01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:56.060
<v Speaker 3>and like find a few lines that are keepers that are funny and that's,</v>

2790
01:10:56.061 --> 01:10:59.240
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll sit down and rewrite it and we look at the bit and re,</v>

2791
01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:00.890
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of what I do has to be like,</v>

2792
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 3>how does it sound?</v>

2793
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:02.130
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

2794
01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:03.410
<v Speaker 3>what's the inflection was to pay.</v>

2795
01:11:03.411 --> 01:11:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Saying so like being onstage helps a lot.</v>

2796
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.811
<v Speaker 3>But there are things that I,</v>

2797
01:11:06.811 --> 01:11:10.490
<v Speaker 3>and what's hard for me and what I have to get better about is writing about</v>

2798
01:11:10.491 --> 01:11:12.450
<v Speaker 3>things I don't care about somehow.</v>

2799
01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:13.770
<v Speaker 3>So like if</v>

2800
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.701
<v Speaker 2>like if you said,</v>

2801
01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 2>give me 50 jokes about the Kardashians,</v>

2802
01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:17.111
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2803
01:11:17.111 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I would not want to do that.</v>

2804
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.740
<v Speaker 2>But why would you need to?</v>

2805
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2806
01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:20.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I do,</v>

2807
01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:22.560
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's a skill some people have.</v>

2808
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 2>There's great monologue joke writers and stuff,</v>

2809
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.600
<v Speaker 2>but if I see something that's ridiculous that I'm like perplex by or I think is</v>

2810
01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:31.020
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

2811
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I can devote attention and energy into making that funny.</v>

2812
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2813
01:11:35.731 --> 01:11:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I say just concentrate on that.</v>

2814
01:11:37.111 --> 01:11:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all that other stuff.</v>

2815
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

2816
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.211
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do.</v>

2817
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I am in awe of certain people where you could go,</v>

2818
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:41.860
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2819
01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:42.693
<v Speaker 2>here's a topic.</v>

2820
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Give me 50 jokes.</v>

2821
01:11:43.891 --> 01:11:45.270
<v Speaker 2>And they'll have them and they're good.</v>

2822
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.570
<v Speaker 2>But you notice that those guys usually wind up working as writers and they</v>

2823
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:49.160
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

2824
01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:49.331
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2825
01:11:49.331 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I feel kind of shitty.</v>

2826
01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:51.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of them do.</v>

2827
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:53.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good guy.</v>

2828
01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.000
<v Speaker 2>When you're a great comic and you're working as a writer on a Sitcom,</v>

2829
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2830
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a bad,</v>

2831
01:11:58.500 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 2>and you were talking about it earlier.</v>

2832
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I know a few guys like Owen Smith,</v>

2833
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:02.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2834
01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:02.951
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know him.</v>

2835
01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:03.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2836
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:06.480
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard the name one of the best fucking standups in the country.</v>

2837
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:07.890
<v Speaker 2>He's so good.</v>

2838
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:08.971
<v Speaker 2>He has his bit.</v>

2839
01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to tell you much about it because it's about adopting a white son.</v>

2840
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.320
<v Speaker 2>It is one of the funniest bits I've ever seen in my fucking life.</v>

2841
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.270
<v Speaker 2>It's so good that you're like,</v>

2842
01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:19.650
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

2843
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:20.431
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

2844
01:12:20.431 --> 01:12:22.290
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking twisted.</v>

2845
01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.370
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2846
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:23.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2847
01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:26.000
<v Speaker 2>it's so like you can't believe what he's saying while he's saying,</v>

2848
01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.950
<v Speaker 2>but this is a guy that is,</v>

2849
01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean skill wise,</v>

2850
01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 2>one of the best standup comics in the country.</v>

2851
01:12:32.731 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2852
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:37.740
<v Speaker 2>But he's not known for it as much as he's got a real career as a writer,</v>

2853
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:38.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2854
01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.170
<v Speaker 2>and he's trying to branch out and move away from that.</v>

2855
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:42.930
<v Speaker 2>But God damn that guy murders when he's in the comedy store,</v>

2856
01:12:42.931 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I always sit in the back of the room and watch.</v>

2857
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2858
01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.330
<v Speaker 2>When a lot of people,</v>

2859
01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I guess with families and kids get to make decisions</v>

2860
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.570
<v Speaker 2>that already think stuck with me when it's like you want to be doing something</v>

2861
01:12:51.571 --> 01:12:52.404
<v Speaker 2>you don't care about.</v>

2862
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.401
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>

2863
01:12:53.401 --> 01:12:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I have to write about things that I'm interested in.</v>

2864
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:55.681
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2865
01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:56.461
<v Speaker 2>I think people,</v>

2866
01:12:56.461 --> 01:12:57.990
<v Speaker 2>the people's careers that I wanted,</v>

2867
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:58.833
<v Speaker 2>the people that I envy,</v>

2868
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.620
<v Speaker 2>their careers seem to be led by their interests.</v>

2869
01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2870
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Things that interest them.</v>

2871
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2872
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a better life.</v>

2873
01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2874
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:06.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2875
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:06.601
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2876
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:06.901
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2877
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:07.860
<v Speaker 2>I've done both.</v>

2878
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:08.401
<v Speaker 2>I've done,</v>

2879
01:13:08.401 --> 01:13:09.630
<v Speaker 2>like when I was doing fear factor,</v>

2880
01:13:09.631 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't remotely interested in it other than the paycheck and it was a good</v>

2881
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:13.620
<v Speaker 2>gig.</v>

2882
01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>

2883
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.111
<v Speaker 2>I'm not shitting on,</v>

2884
01:13:15.111 --> 01:13:15.960
<v Speaker 2>it was a great gig.</v>

2885
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I love that I had that job.</v>

2886
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I love being financially stable,</v>

2887
01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2888
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 2>at the time I was like,</v>

2889
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.140
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

2890
01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.940
<v Speaker 2>now I don't have to worry about paying my bills.</v>

2891
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:24.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice thing.</v>

2892
01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.970
<v Speaker 2>It was a great group of people that I work with,</v>

2893
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.710
<v Speaker 2>producers and everybody network.</v>

2894
01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:29.544
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's great.</v>

2895
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:33.030
<v Speaker 2>But there's such a difference between doing that and then doing a podcast.</v>

2896
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2897
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant difference.</v>

2898
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:35.740
<v Speaker 2>But that's the way the,</v>

2899
01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:38.010
<v Speaker 2>the way that I've kind of done my podcast is like,</v>

2900
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:39.450
<v Speaker 2>what do I care about?</v>

2901
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.160
<v Speaker 2>What do I want to know about?</v>

2902
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Who can I feasibly get on to talk about it?</v>

2903
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Those are the things that are interesting to me.</v>

2904
01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Not so much like let's just pick a topic that's in the news that everyone will</v>

2905
01:13:51.841 --> 01:13:52.674
<v Speaker 2>have a take on.</v>

2906
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:54.240
<v Speaker 2>But I mean even even that,</v>

2907
01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:55.470
<v Speaker 2>if that's what you're interested in,</v>

2908
01:13:55.471 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 2>something wrong with that.</v>

2909
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2910
01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:57.421
<v Speaker 2>if you're interested in that.</v>

2911
01:13:57.421 --> 01:13:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2912
01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.880
<v Speaker 2>but it has a comic to have no boss.</v>

2913
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.250
<v Speaker 2>So that's something nice.</v>

2914
01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.800
<v Speaker 2>That's so nice.</v>

2915
01:14:04.801 --> 01:14:05.730
<v Speaker 2>These comics a kit,</v>

2916
01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:10.710
<v Speaker 2>they get pigeonholed and stuck into these gigs where they don't want to fuck up</v>

2917
01:14:10.711 --> 01:14:11.260
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2918
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.480
<v Speaker 2>so they don't want to say anything controversial.</v>

2919
01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:16.900
<v Speaker 2>So their material gets bland and some of them take these big moral stands and</v>

2920
01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:17.230
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2921
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:17.321
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2922
01:14:17.321 --> 01:14:18.850
<v Speaker 2>you're making a crazy amount of money.</v>

2923
01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Like some of them are like,</v>

2924
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I won't work here and I will work.</v>

2925
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 2>If that person is on a lineup,</v>

2926
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:22.481
<v Speaker 2>I won't do it.</v>

2927
01:14:22.481 --> 01:14:22.841
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2928
01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:23.021
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2929
01:14:23.021 --> 01:14:25.320
<v Speaker 2>but you're making a lot of money that,</v>

2930
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.650
<v Speaker 2>that drives me crazy.</v>

2931
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:28.210
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that I'm not going to work with,</v>

2932
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:29.610
<v Speaker 2>unless someone's stealing.</v>

2933
01:14:29.850 --> 01:14:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2934
01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Just stop.</v>

2935
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Unless someone is stealing or they're punching people or there being a rapist or</v>

2936
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:34.190
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2937
01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is something so egregious.</v>

2938
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:36.550
<v Speaker 2>They should probably be in jail.</v>

2939
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:37.623
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2940
01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.010
<v Speaker 2>You got creative differences.</v>

2941
01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.450
<v Speaker 2>You fucking baby,</v>

2942
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.673
<v Speaker 2>get over it.</v>

2943
01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Just get up there.</v>

2944
01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2945
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with a lot of people.</v>

2946
01:14:44.441 --> 01:14:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't enjoy working and I don't have the luxury of light,</v>

2947
01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:47.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2948
01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

2949
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I won't work this venue because this person worked here.</v>

2950
01:14:50.231 --> 01:14:50.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's it.</v>

2951
01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.450
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

2952
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:51.940
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2953
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2954
01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:52.954
<v Speaker 2>I still don't,</v>

2955
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the store that this,</v>

2956
01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm there all the time with people I don't even hardly know.</v>

2957
01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2958
01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.331
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2959
01:14:58.331 --> 01:14:58.541
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2960
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:00.730
<v Speaker 2>you're on a lineup with 1415 people.</v>

2961
01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2962
01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:01.511
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

2963
01:15:01.511 --> 01:15:02.470
<v Speaker 2>but that's good too.</v>

2964
01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:06.440
<v Speaker 2>That's true to half of those people could be rapists more than half.</v>

2965
01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:07.443
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2966
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:10.910
<v Speaker 2>So that sounds like who is definitely,</v>

2967
01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a clip right there.</v>

2968
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Depends on whose definition the actual rape.</v>

2969
01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Right now it's like words,</v>

2970
01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:17.963
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2971
01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.690
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be fucking careful.</v>

2972
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.333
<v Speaker 2>Trill.</v>

2973
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:22.710
<v Speaker 2>That's where we come in.</v>

2974
01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.790
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's very confusing,</v>

2975
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.211
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2976
01:15:25.211 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Because we as comics,</v>

2977
01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:29.560
<v Speaker 2>especially comics like you and I that say fucked up shit,</v>

2978
01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.890
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with things that are really not supposed to be in society</v>

2979
01:15:32.891 --> 01:15:33.490
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2980
01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:36.370
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes people will get up and leave and like it's fine to believe like,</v>

2981
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:36.910
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2982
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm joking.</v>

2983
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Don't you get that?</v>

2984
01:15:39.191 --> 01:15:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm joking.</v>

2985
01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 2>You drunk in a room,</v>

2986
01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:43.730
<v Speaker 2>isn't it 1130 at night,</v>

2987
01:15:43.731 --> 01:15:45.190
<v Speaker 2>eight or your if you perform earlier.</v>

2988
01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:45.761
<v Speaker 2>But with me,</v>

2989
01:15:45.761 --> 01:15:46.031
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2990
01:15:46.031 --> 01:15:48.640
<v Speaker 2>isn't it 4:00 AM what's the problem?</v>

2991
01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:48.971
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2992
01:15:48.971 --> 01:15:51.350
<v Speaker 2>If you can't take this opinion now when you get a tick,</v>

2993
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.001
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2994
01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes it's not good.</v>

2995
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2996
01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the materials,</v>

2997
01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.490
<v Speaker 2>not those Parkland kids had never worked where I said,</v>

2998
01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anyone to get shot,</v>

2999
01:15:59.081 --> 01:15:59.501
<v Speaker 2>but the kids,</v>

3000
01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:00.970
<v Speaker 2>these kids are knowing these five are annoying.</v>

3001
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.571
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3002
01:16:01.571 --> 01:16:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anyone to get shot.</v>

3003
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't want any.</v>

3004
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

3005
01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.810
<v Speaker 2>let's ban guns.</v>

3006
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:06.730
<v Speaker 2>But first we have to shoot these kits.</v>

3007
01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.350
<v Speaker 2>We have to kill the pocket kits.</v>

3008
01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:08.861
<v Speaker 2>These five,</v>

3009
01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:12.640
<v Speaker 2>we have to shoot the phones out of their hands and they're going to be the last,</v>

3010
01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:13.331
<v Speaker 2>and we could explain to them,</v>

3011
01:16:13.331 --> 01:16:13.990
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go,</v>

3012
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.860
<v Speaker 2>we're banning guns.</v>

3013
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:16.180
<v Speaker 2>You'll be less five people to ever die.</v>

3014
01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:17.920
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't work.</v>

3015
01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And people's people were not exactly thrilled with it,</v>

3016
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you should be able to trust,</v>

3017
01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:25.510
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to try.</v>

3018
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 2>You've got to trust sometimes like,</v>

3019
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3020
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:31.120
<v Speaker 2>you were saying you go onstage with a premise and then in the middle of doing</v>

3021
01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:31.631
<v Speaker 2>that premise,</v>

3022
01:16:31.631 --> 01:16:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you'll find the beats.</v>

3023
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you don't find the beats and he think maybe there's something there.</v>

3024
01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.240
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3025
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few bits where I was sure there was something there.</v>

3026
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I've never been offended by a joke.</v>

3027
01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:42.970
<v Speaker 2>That's me personally.</v>

3028
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.991
<v Speaker 2>Like I've never,</v>

3029
01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:45.400
<v Speaker 2>have you ever been offended by a joke?</v>

3030
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.671
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3031
01:16:45.671 --> 01:16:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I've never been offended,</v>

3032
01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but I've been like,</v>

3033
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.160
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3034
01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.300
<v Speaker 2>that one wasn't good.</v>

3035
01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:49.760
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3036
01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.593
<v Speaker 2>but that's normal.</v>

3037
01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3038
01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:52.780
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

3039
01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:53.021
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3040
01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:57.130
<v Speaker 2>the finding the beats on stage in front of a live crowd too.</v>

3041
01:16:57.131 --> 01:17:00.850
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that high wire act that makes your brain go to these</v>

3042
01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:02.890
<v Speaker 2>weird places that comes up with punchlines.</v>

3043
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:05.020
<v Speaker 2>You have to fucking find a punchline.</v>

3044
01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:06.340
<v Speaker 2>You have to find something funny.</v>

3045
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:06.821
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

3046
01:17:06.821 --> 01:17:07.750
<v Speaker 2>these people paid money.</v>

3047
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:08.221
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3048
01:17:08.221 --> 01:17:08.410
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3049
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like waving a steak in front of our junk</v>

3050
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.520
<v Speaker 3>yard dog and you keep tossing them little bits and then eventually like you</v>

3051
01:17:13.521 --> 01:17:17.100
<v Speaker 3>don't have to tromp mistake and sometimes there's no punchline.</v>

3052
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.890
<v Speaker 3>This is part of the fucking Gig.</v>

3053
01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:20.510
<v Speaker 3>Then you got to shit.</v>

3054
01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Trump rally just screaming.</v>

3055
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:23.743
<v Speaker 3>She sent us.</v>

3056
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:26.060
<v Speaker 3>If he doesn't get elected,</v>

3057
01:17:26.061 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 3>do you think he goes and starts a podcast TV network he took?</v>

3058
01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Totally could.</v>

3059
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3060
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.570
<v Speaker 3>He totally could probably be better for him,</v>

3061
01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.110
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>

3062
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what he thought he was gonna do.</v>

3063
01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:35.990
<v Speaker 3>I think before he got elected,</v>

3064
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I think he was having high level meetings with people in the media space to</v>

3065
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:41.300
<v Speaker 3>start something like that.</v>

3066
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.511
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3067
01:17:41.511 --> 01:17:45.560
<v Speaker 3>once NBC fired him and BC fired him while he was running because of the stuff</v>

3068
01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:49.280
<v Speaker 3>that he said about Mexico and the thrill of rape is someone's doing the raping,</v>

3069
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.373
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3070
01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:51.121
<v Speaker 3>To Hey,</v>

3071
01:17:51.121 --> 01:17:51.830
<v Speaker 3>talk to this.</v>

3072
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:55.310
<v Speaker 3>So fucking crazy out of control for a person running for president.</v>

3073
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:56.031
<v Speaker 3>NBC is like,</v>

3074
01:17:56.031 --> 01:17:56.391
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

3075
01:17:56.391 --> 01:17:56.901
<v Speaker 3>We're getting rid of you.</v>

3076
01:17:56.901 --> 01:17:59.420
<v Speaker 3>And then they put Arnold in his place and that was a disaster.</v>

3077
01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:00.231
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>

3078
01:18:00.231 --> 01:18:01.450
<v Speaker 3>People Forgot Arnold,</v>

3079
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.600
<v Speaker 3>the host of the apprentice.</v>

3080
01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.593
<v Speaker 3>You'll fire.</v>

3081
01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3082
01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Was it was horrible.</v>

3083
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:06.104
<v Speaker 3>It was terrible.</v>

3084
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Trump was shitting on them.</v>

3085
01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Did they just scrapped the show after that?</v>

3086
01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:13.793
<v Speaker 3>Here's a question.</v>

3087
01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Does he go back to the apprentice?</v>

3088
01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.151
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3089
01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.980
<v Speaker 3>if NBC has had the presidency,</v>

3090
01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.180
<v Speaker 3>I think he's too toxic.</v>

3091
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:22.063
<v Speaker 3>Toxic,</v>

3092
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.233
<v Speaker 3>toxic.</v>

3093
01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.460
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could come up with something like that for Fox.</v>

3094
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.611
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3095
01:18:25.611 --> 01:18:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Fox is in the scoop him up.</v>

3096
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what's great about Fox.</v>

3097
01:18:28.361 --> 01:18:29.194
<v Speaker 3>They'll play ball,</v>

3098
01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:30.723
<v Speaker 3>play ball.</v>

3099
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.660
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to leave money on the cable.</v>

3100
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:33.471
<v Speaker 3>You know what though?</v>

3101
01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:35.220
<v Speaker 3>They did want Megan Kelly back to like,</v>

3102
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:36.830
<v Speaker 3>well she did a thing.</v>

3103
01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:39.080
<v Speaker 3>I used to do the show red eye on Fox News,</v>

3104
01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:41.050
<v Speaker 3>which was comics would just try to be funny.</v>

3105
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:45.680
<v Speaker 3>It was the air did it like 3:00 AM east coast time and I saw her the week she</v>

3106
01:18:45.681 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 3>was doing that and she was in like the dressing room and she knew she shouldn't</v>

3107
01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:49.850
<v Speaker 3>have left.</v>

3108
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:50.690
<v Speaker 3>She can feel it.</v>

3109
01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.220
<v Speaker 3>She had already made the decision,</v>

3110
01:18:52.221 --> 01:18:56.300
<v Speaker 3>but you could kind of see it in her face that I think she knew that she was</v>

3111
01:18:56.301 --> 01:18:58.700
<v Speaker 3>going to try to be this daytime TV queen and like,</v>

3112
01:18:58.701 --> 01:18:59.750
<v Speaker 3>let's bake cupcakes.</v>

3113
01:18:59.751 --> 01:19:00.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3114
01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I just spent four years on Fox News talking about Santa Fe and white,</v>

3115
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:05.210
<v Speaker 3>but now let's bake cupcakes cause I'm,</v>

3116
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:06.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm America's sweetheart.</v>

3117
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:08.630
<v Speaker 3>That's never going to work.</v>

3118
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:08.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3119
01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:11.750
<v Speaker 3>it's weird when you publicly change your image,</v>

3120
01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:13.483
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>

3121
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:14.960
<v Speaker 3>Publicly changing your image.</v>

3122
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Her shirts or skirts got longer.</v>

3123
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3124
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:19.780
<v Speaker 3>she covered her neck or yeah.</v>

3125
01:19:19.781 --> 01:19:20.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3126
01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:21.200
<v Speaker 3>it was no more cleavage.</v>

3127
01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Every show was about sexual assault.</v>

3128
01:19:22.941 --> 01:19:23.620
<v Speaker 3>She was trying to make,</v>

3129
01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.520
<v Speaker 3>every single show is about sexual assault.</v>

3130
01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.700
<v Speaker 3>I think she was trying to ingratiate herself in with the people that hated her,</v>

3131
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:31.410
<v Speaker 3>which is like the New York media types.</v>

3132
01:19:31.411 --> 01:19:32.570
<v Speaker 3>The people that did not like her.</v>

3133
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:33.404
<v Speaker 3>And then she was like,</v>

3134
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.420
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't even just about sexual assault.</v>

3135
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 3>One of them was a lady who fuck Matt Lauer and she knew she was fucking him and</v>

3136
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:41.540
<v Speaker 3>she was talking about a lot of shit.</v>

3137
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:41.901
<v Speaker 3>Fucked him.</v>

3138
01:19:41.901 --> 01:19:42.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3139
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:43.041
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know any better.</v>

3140
01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:43.880
<v Speaker 3>I was 25</v>

3141
01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.910
<v Speaker 3>25 if fuck the guy,</v>

3143
01:19:48.741 --> 01:19:49.610
<v Speaker 3>It's bad here.</v>

3144
01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3145
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.800
<v Speaker 3>Well he shouldn't have fucked it cause he was married.</v>

3146
01:19:51.801 --> 01:19:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3147
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.053
<v Speaker 3>After that,</v>

3148
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

3149
01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:55.970
<v Speaker 3>What's going on then you just fucked him.</v>

3150
01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.290
<v Speaker 3>But who cares?</v>

3151
01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Why is this a segment of a show?</v>

3152
01:19:59.301 --> 01:20:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Is it because it's scandalous?</v>

3153
01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Get an interview with her.</v>

3154
01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

3155
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:03.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3156
01:20:03.321 --> 01:20:03.721
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

3157
01:20:03.721 --> 01:20:03.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3158
01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:04.611
<v Speaker 3>and she was saying,</v>

3159
01:20:04.611 --> 01:20:04.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3160
01:20:04.821 --> 01:20:06.730
<v Speaker 3>I was young and I was impressionable.</v>

3161
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:08.343
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3162
01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:08.671
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

3163
01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:11.310
<v Speaker 3>It's funny to see them all put nails in each other's coffins.</v>

3164
01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3165
01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.113
<v Speaker 3>He's not great.</v>

3166
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:14.580
<v Speaker 3>Media is like this blood feud.</v>

3167
01:20:14.581 --> 01:20:16.800
<v Speaker 3>There's only a few families that control all of this information.</v>

3168
01:20:16.801 --> 01:20:17.700
<v Speaker 3>They all hate each other.</v>

3169
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.010
<v Speaker 3>That's why succession is such a great show.</v>

3170
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Well I think with Megan it was like that.</v>

3171
01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:26.280
<v Speaker 3>She had been sexually harassed while she was at Fox News going after all those</v>

3172
01:20:26.281 --> 01:20:27.030
<v Speaker 3>two gals.</v>

3173
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3174
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.360
<v Speaker 3>So she was going after and I think bill O'Reilly too.</v>

3175
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I think there was some something he paid 38 million.</v>

3176
01:20:33.421 --> 01:20:34.254
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

3177
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.910
<v Speaker 3>what did he do?</v>

3178
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:42.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 32 32 and 38 guy and my grants,</v>

3179
01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 3>my grandfather still hasn't bill O'Reilly patriots welcome doormat.</v>

3183
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:52.050
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant amount of money.</v>

3184
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:55.500
<v Speaker 3>It's the amount of money where what he did should be,</v>

3185
01:20:55.501 --> 01:20:56.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like it's an,</v>

3186
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:58.110
<v Speaker 3>it could be a Netflix documentary.</v>

3246
01:22:27.241 --> 01:22:28.860
<v Speaker 3>It's fashionable to wear it.</v>

3247
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:29.873
<v Speaker 3>They wear it.</v>

3248
01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.753
<v Speaker 3>They know</v>

3249
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:32.933
<v Speaker 3>Trump does.</v>

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.230
<v Speaker 3>He gets out and he goes,</v>

3251
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:35.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Christian.</v>

3252
01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.390
<v Speaker 3>I may not be the best Christian,</v>

3253
01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:39.150
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a Christian leadership quality enough.</v>

3254
01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.193
<v Speaker 3>It's good enough.</v>

3255
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:40.920

3257
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.740
<v Speaker 3>You're a thrice married guy who owns gambling and a Miss Universe pageant.</v>

3258
01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:54.870
<v Speaker 3>You're a biblical fig that's like a biblical figure that would be like a Roman</v>

3259
01:22:54.871 --> 01:22:59.100
<v Speaker 3>king that everybody was warned about like gay in terms of like,</v>

3260
01:22:59.101 --> 01:22:59.934
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3261
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:01.470
<v Speaker 3>I want him to shave his head.</v>

3262
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:02.940
<v Speaker 3>What do you think that will do?</v>

3263
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:04.440
<v Speaker 3>I just freedom.</v>

3264
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I think it would funny if you shaved it like somebody had a cancer issue and he</v>

3265
01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:09.730
<v Speaker 3>just shaved it with them to be a good guy.</v>

3266
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:10.061
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3267
01:23:10.061 --> 01:23:11.170
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look good.</v>

3268
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what's confusing to me.</v>

3269
01:23:12.401 --> 01:23:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Like when I realized as a style,</v>

3270
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:16.000
<v Speaker 3>when my hair wasn't looking good,</v>

3271
01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:16.730
<v Speaker 3>you got rid of,</v>

3272
01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:18.010
<v Speaker 3>it was impossible to look good.</v>

3273
01:23:18.011 --> 01:23:19.270
<v Speaker 3>It was fallen out to the point where like,</v>

3274
01:23:19.271 --> 01:23:20.380
<v Speaker 3>this is just a mess.</v>

3275
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Then I went and buzzed it,</v>

3276
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.961
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

3277
01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:23.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3278
01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.600
<v Speaker 3>I just can't this to my generation,</v>

3279
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:26.730
<v Speaker 3>I always remembered she would like the,</v>

3280
01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:28.250
<v Speaker 3>just the herald virile.</v>

3281
01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3282
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:29.950
<v Speaker 3>It's nice.</v>

3283
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>

3284
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I've been like this for a long time.</v>

3285
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3286
01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:33.071
<v Speaker 3>I'm solid.</v>

3287
01:23:33.071 --> 01:23:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Eight plus years bald.</v>

3288
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:37.780
<v Speaker 3>You want Trump to just go,</v>

3289
01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.370
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

3290
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:40.690
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be better off.</v>

3291
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.620
<v Speaker 3>It'd be easier.</v>

3292
01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Like he's not good looking.</v>

3293
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:45.460
<v Speaker 3>He was know that he would,</v>

3294
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.860
<v Speaker 3>that would complete his transformation into a supervillain,</v>

3295
01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.200
<v Speaker 3>I guess like a Lex Luthor type Gal.</v>

3296
01:23:50.201 --> 01:23:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3297
01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:52.240
<v Speaker 3>but it just like,</v>

3298
01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:53.074
<v Speaker 3>I just</v>

3299
01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.740
<v Speaker 3>gotta be so much work to put that hair together.</v>

3300
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I think someone does it from,</v>

3301
01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:01.030
<v Speaker 3>but even then you've got to talk to them while they're putting it together.</v>

3302
01:24:01.031 --> 01:24:02.380
<v Speaker 3>I bet you he hasn't talked to them.</v>

3303
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:02.741
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

3304
01:24:02.741 --> 01:24:03.820
<v Speaker 3>He does just tweets angry.</v>

3305
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I bet he's not concerned with the human relations with his staff.</v>

3306
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:07.970
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3307
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Let's just get that vibe.</v>

3308
01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Five.</v>

3309
01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:10.961
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

3310
01:24:10.961 --> 01:24:11.201
<v Speaker 3>Five,</v>

3311
01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:13.900
<v Speaker 3>the person who's in charge of the hair just does the hair.</v>

3312
01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.420
<v Speaker 3>I hope he retired when he retires or when he's done.</v>

3313
01:24:16.421 --> 01:24:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I hope he goes right into podcasting.</v>

3314
01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Would you have them on right now?</v>

3315
01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3316
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:21.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3317
01:24:21.101 --> 01:24:21.491
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

3318
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:21.970
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

3319
01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:22.510
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

3320
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3321
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:23.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3322
01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:23.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3323
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3324
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3325
01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3326
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:25.811
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

3327
01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't he come on a three hours hours?</v>

3328
01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:31.660
<v Speaker 3>He's busy and I had some jokes about them.</v>

3329
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:33.910
<v Speaker 3>He's petty.</v>

3330
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:34.900
<v Speaker 3>He hates comedy.</v>

3331
01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.000
<v Speaker 3>He does not like to be made fun of.</v>

3332
01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:38.530
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like to be made fun of.</v>

3333
01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:43.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure Michelle Wolf got him on Twitter a few times of correspondence center</v>

3334
01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:44.110
<v Speaker 3>and he went after her,</v>

3335
01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:45.830
<v Speaker 3>but she can't write back at him and shit.</v>

3336
01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I bet you'd be on my side if I killed the journalist.</v>

3337
01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:49.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3338
01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3339
01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Michelle is a kill shot.</v>

3340
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Kill Shot.</v>

3341
01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:53.533
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to win.</v>

3342
01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:54.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3343
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:54.611
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

3344
01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:57.460
<v Speaker 3>she's snuffed him out and she'll just forget it.</v>

3345
01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 3>He just dropped off the face of the earth without always duck out and it was</v>

3346
01:25:00.431 --> 01:25:01.264
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

3347
01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:03.580
<v Speaker 3>She neutered him one tweet.</v>

3348
01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Neutered.</v>

3349
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:04.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3350
01:25:04.661 --> 01:25:08.140
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that go after him though and it doesn't work and he doesn't</v>

3351
01:25:08.141 --> 01:25:09.730
<v Speaker 3>respond that it looks so weird.</v>

3352
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 3>It's weird when I see my aunt tweeting at him,</v>

3353
01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:12.483
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3354
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:16.240
<v Speaker 3>what do you think this is going to do?</v>

3355
01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.760
<v Speaker 3>My aunt with 43 followers,</v>

3356
01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.713
<v Speaker 3>she say,</v>

3357
01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:21.363
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3358
01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:24.120
<v Speaker 3>you were disgusting representation of this country.</v>

3359
01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:27.370
<v Speaker 3>She'll tweet this and then I have another hand who's the other side that'll be</v>

3360
01:25:27.371 --> 01:25:28.060
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3361
01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I believe in you keep going.</v>

3362
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:33.640
<v Speaker 3>And I just imagined him scrolling through these messages and reading this.</v>

3363
01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:34.441
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he looked,</v>

3364
01:25:34.441 --> 01:25:35.310
<v Speaker 3>looks at and he,</v>

3365
01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I think he only looks at verified accounts.</v>

3366
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.561
<v Speaker 3>I think he's got,</v>

3367
01:25:38.561 --> 01:25:40.780
<v Speaker 3>like if you're thinking about how many people he follows on Twitter,</v>

3368
01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:41.950
<v Speaker 3>I think if he's wise,</v>

3369
01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.390
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't see the mentioned.</v>

3370
01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:44.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you right now,</v>

01:27:25.251 --> 01:27:26.420
<v Speaker 2>It will just kill their people.</v>

3439
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:28.010
<v Speaker 2>We don't fuck with their social media.</v>

3440
01:27:28.011 --> 01:27:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I think we fuck with her social media.</v>

3441
01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we do.</v>

3442
01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:31.161
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's,</v>

3443
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:34.310
<v Speaker 2>like I wrote off a lot of that Russian stuff is like people's wishful thinking,</v>

3444
01:27:34.311 --> 01:27:35.450
<v Speaker 2>but the more and more I read about it,</v>

3445
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:39.830
<v Speaker 2>the more there is like a coordinated attempt seemingly to institute this social</v>

3446
01:27:39.831 --> 01:27:40.880
<v Speaker 2>media and so this girl,</v>

3447
01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:41.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3448
01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:41.661
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3449
01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:45.350
<v Speaker 2>there's 100% a real thing going on because this woman documented it and two,</v>

3450
01:27:45.351 --> 01:27:48.350
<v Speaker 2>it was also really funny like she was talking about how many of the memes that</v>

3451
01:27:48.351 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 2>they created that were really funny.</v>

3452
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.151
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3453
01:27:50.151 --> 01:27:50.984
<v Speaker 2>they're hilarious.</v>

3454
01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.310
<v Speaker 2>And they came out of Russia.</v>

3455
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:57.170
<v Speaker 2>So there's a bunch of guys in a room in Moscow creating memes and it's so funny.</v>

3456
01:27:57.171 --> 01:28:00.860
<v Speaker 2>This is like they went to KGB training or whatever it is now FSP,</v>

3457
01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:04.220
<v Speaker 2>and this is where they ended up just hiring people.</v>

3458
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.490
<v Speaker 2>This is the frontier of the war against the United States.</v>

3459
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.570
<v Speaker 2>The thing is though,</v>

3460
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:13.190
<v Speaker 2>if they can do that and get people really upset if they really can't do it,</v>

3461
01:28:13.191 --> 01:28:15.020
<v Speaker 2>that's a really effective strategy.</v>

3462
01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:15.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a great strategy.</v>

3463
01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Can make things happen now cause it's just sewing internal discord and we're</v>

3464
01:28:19.131 --> 01:28:20.420
<v Speaker 2>going to collapse her own system.</v>

3465
01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Like I wonder how many of these Jesse Small lay a is that I see his name,</v>

3466
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Jesse smell A's,</v>

3467
01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.341
<v Speaker 2>Russian.</v>

3468
01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:26.310
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is rushing.</v>

3469
01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Not even real thing is rushing.</v>

3470
01:28:28.631 --> 01:28:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Jessie Smollett doesn't exist.</v>

3471
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many of the memes were created by Russians to try to get people</v>

3472
01:28:34.191 --> 01:28:34.581
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

3473
01:28:34.581 --> 01:28:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I bet there's bunch.</v>

3474
01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I bet there's more people stirring things up then just Temaze Americans that are</v>

3475
01:28:39.591 --> 01:28:40.011
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

3476
01:28:40.011 --> 01:28:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

3477
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's people that are,</v>

3478
01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:44.690
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also just a lot of Americans that hate each other.</v>

3479
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Does that?</v>

3480
01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3481
01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:46.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3482
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:47.420
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>

3483
01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.200
<v Speaker 2>But then you also,</v>

3484
01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.400
<v Speaker 2>what do you think happens with Jesse?</v>

3485
01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Small light his empire because ABC got rid of Roseanne for tweet.</v>

3486
01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.770
<v Speaker 2>You got to get rid of this guy.</v>

3487
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was getting canceled.</v>

3488
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:57.530
<v Speaker 2>He was getting written out rather.</v>

3489
01:28:58.650 --> 01:28:59.481
<v Speaker 2>Did I read today?</v>

3490
01:28:59.481 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3491
01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3492
01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was getting written out before and this is one of the reasons why</v>

3493
01:29:03.601 --> 01:29:04.170
<v Speaker 2>he did it.</v>

3494
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:04.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3495
01:29:04.291 --> 01:29:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I support him if that's the case,</v>

3496
01:29:05.461 --> 01:29:06.600
<v Speaker 2>cause he's a very hard business.</v>

3497
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:10.110
<v Speaker 2>This is a very tough business.</v>

3498
01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.273
<v Speaker 2>It is hard.</v>

3499
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:12.240
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to make it.</v>

3500
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I loved that they had to plan that out and he said to the two guys,</v>

3501
01:29:14.521 --> 01:29:14.731
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3502
01:29:14.731 --> 01:29:15.564
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3503
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:16.880
<v Speaker 2>get a noose.</v>

3504
01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3505
01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:17.531
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

3506
01:29:17.531 --> 01:29:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Get rope and doing this.</v>

3507
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:20.640
<v Speaker 2>All a lot of these hate crimes,</v>

3508
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:21.300
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3509
01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:21.631
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3510
01:29:21.631 --> 01:29:22.950
<v Speaker 2>I hate crimes happen and they're horrible.</v>

3511
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 2>But some of these things are fic.</v>

3512
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you know he showed up at the hotel with the new still around his neck holding</v>

3513
01:29:28.891 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 2>a subway sandwich.</v>

3514
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Just that alone,</v>

3515
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>

3516
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:34.170
<v Speaker 2>the people at the hotel should have been like,</v>

3517
01:29:34.171 --> 01:29:35.004
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3518
01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.173
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

3519
01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:37.163
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

3520
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3521
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:38.663
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

3522
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Why Sandwich juice?</v>

3523
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 2>It's still at the sandwich.</v>

3524
01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.210
<v Speaker 2>And why are you eating at subway or you're not sick to your stomach or on</v>

3525
01:29:45.211 --> 01:29:46.044
<v Speaker 2>empire?</v>

3526
01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:47.310
<v Speaker 2>What the Hell's wrong with you?</v>

3527
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.751
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] so,</v>

3528
01:29:47.751 --> 01:29:49.080
<v Speaker 2>but the subway subway's not good.</v>

3529
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:50.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not bad if you're hungry.</v>

3530
01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3531
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I've clearly hating it,</v>

3532
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.453
<v Speaker 2>but it ain't great.</v>

3533
01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:55.590
<v Speaker 2>But if it's like two o'clock in the morning,</v>

3534
01:29:55.591 --> 01:29:56.700
<v Speaker 2>it's the only thing open.</v>

3535
01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Why is he open to 2:00 AM that's a great place.</v>

3536
01:29:59.401 --> 01:30:00.170
<v Speaker 2>It's open.</v>

3537
01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:02.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a good move to be open when nothing else is open.</v>

3538
01:30:02.131 --> 01:30:02.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>

3539
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:03.830
<v Speaker 2>You get a nice Italian.</v>

3540
01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:04.800
<v Speaker 2>So I would double meat.</v>

3541
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I like to have the oil and vinegar,</v>

3542
01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:09.180
<v Speaker 2>salt and pepper ball with the Mozzarella,</v>

3543
01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:09.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3544
01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.250
<v Speaker 2>And then you don't toast it.</v>

3545
01:30:11.251 --> 01:30:13.680
<v Speaker 2>You let the hot and meatballs melt the cheese.</v>

3546
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3547
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:14.671
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

3548
01:30:14.671 --> 01:30:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3549
01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:15.923
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>

3550
01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.093
<v Speaker 2>And he posts up.</v>

3551
01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:18.140
<v Speaker 2>It's always a good mark.</v>

3552
01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Especially after faking a hate crime</v>

3553
01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.970
<v Speaker 2>after he was the hate crime.</v>

3554
01:30:23.971 --> 01:30:24.661
<v Speaker 2>I meet both.</v>

3555
01:30:24.661 --> 01:30:26.460
<v Speaker 2>How nervous you after you do that?</v>

3556
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm such a pussy.</v>

3557
01:30:28.171 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I could never go.</v>

3558
01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I could never do what.</v>

3559
01:30:30.211 --> 01:30:31.760
<v Speaker 2>He did some level associates,</v>

3560
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.870
<v Speaker 2>but then I saw that act right dinner with the other night and I went,</v>

3561
01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:34.980
<v Speaker 2>oh he could do that.</v>

3562
01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3563
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh these people can do it cause they were on another level.</v>

3564
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:42.630
<v Speaker 2>Well the other thing is that people say who would want to be a victim?</v>

3565
01:30:42.631 --> 01:30:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Who'd want to fake being a victim?</v>

3566
01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I heard that during the cabin off hearing.</v>

3567
01:30:45.781 --> 01:30:46.614
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3568
01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.960
<v Speaker 2>that is a ridiculous thing to say.</v>

3569
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's a lot of currency in our business,</v>

3570
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.620
<v Speaker 2>in our business.</v>

3571
01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:54.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of conflict.</v>

3572
01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

3573
01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:56.483
<v Speaker 2>In the world.</v>

3574
01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Like people like praise victims for showing out and they support them.</v>

3575
01:31:00.361 --> 01:31:01.800
<v Speaker 2>You get a tremendous amount of love,</v>

3576
01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.500
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a legit victim.</v>

3577
01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Something of course,</v>

3578
01:31:04.471 --> 01:31:04.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3581
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.120
<v Speaker 2>The idea that no one would do that is so there's so against it.</v>

3582
01:31:10.121 --> 01:31:11.460
<v Speaker 2>So contrary to human nature,</v>

3583
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:12.660
<v Speaker 2>everyone would do it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to do it.</v>

3695
01:33:45.401 --> 01:33:46.900

3701
01:33:49.601 --> 01:33:50.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3702
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:52.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think how this conference a whole deal.</v>

3703
01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a Halaal guy would attack me in New York City,</v>

3704
01:33:56.171 --> 01:34:01.000
<v Speaker 3>like a Halaal guy would attack me because he views me as a symbol of imperialism</v>

3705
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:01.834
<v Speaker 3>and oppression.</v>

3706
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:02.970
<v Speaker 3>There'll be good,</v>

3707
01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:03.370
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3708
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Even though I patronize his stand all the time,</v>

3709
01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.180
<v Speaker 3>he still feels the need to attack.</v>

3710
01:34:07.210 --> 01:34:07.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3711
01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3712
01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I could never do that.</v>

3713
01:34:09.370 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3714
01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of those people who would get,</v>

3715
01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:12.550
<v Speaker 3>and I wouldn't get caught.</v>

3716
01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:13.391
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3717
01:34:13.391 --> 01:34:14.920
<v Speaker 3>this would never think I'd get away with it.</v>

3718
01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Wanting everyone to think you're a victim when nothing really happened is</v>

3719
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:20.110
<v Speaker 3>insanely selfish thing.</v>

3720
01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3721
01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:23.410
<v Speaker 3>That's an insane like faking physical crime.</v>

3722
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Ikea to have someone punch him already hit himself.</v>

3723
01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3724
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:29.980
<v Speaker 3>These marketers face maggot hat wearing gangs and everyone's talking about in</v>

3725
01:34:29.981 --> 01:34:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Chicago and La and New York do not exist.</v>

3726
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.660
<v Speaker 3>If you have a maggot hat on at 2:00 AM in New York,</v>

3727
01:34:34.661 --> 01:34:36.200
<v Speaker 3>you're getting bleached poured on you.</v>

3728
01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3729
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Probably reality will also like just,</v>

3730
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:45.310
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that he like punched him back and he fought back and I love how he</v>

3731
01:34:45.311 --> 01:34:45.880
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

3732
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.460
<v Speaker 3>first of all he was on camera for everything except one minute.</v>

3733
01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:49.930
<v Speaker 3>So they ask them to good morning America.</v>

3734
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:50.620
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

3735
01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.241
<v Speaker 3>how long was this?</v>

3736
01:34:51.241 --> 01:34:52.074
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3737
01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:53.470
<v Speaker 3>it felt like several minutes,</v>

3738
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:55.210
<v Speaker 3>but it could have been 30 seconds.</v>

3739
01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Like he's covering the span of time in his,</v>

3740
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 3>in his lie,</v>

3741
01:34:58.551 --> 01:34:59.384
<v Speaker 3>he's going,</v>

3742
01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:02.570
<v Speaker 3>I got to say it's less than a minute cause I'm only off camera for a minute.</v>

3743
01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you heard about a guy like kills his wife and blames a black guy.</v>

3744
01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3745
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:07.881
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3746
01:35:07.881 --> 01:35:09.110
<v Speaker 3>there's been a bunch of those,</v>

3747
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:09.291
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3748
01:35:09.291 --> 01:35:10.124
<v Speaker 3>It's been a ton of,</v>

3749
01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 3>and then you see the Energy Simpson for example.</v>

3750
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Did he blame something?</v>

3751
01:35:13.971 --> 01:35:14.661
<v Speaker 3>What do you know?</v>

3752
01:35:14.661 --> 01:35:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Somebody probably blamed him,</v>

3753
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:16.690
<v Speaker 3>you think?</v>

3754
01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

3755
01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>

3756
01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.010
<v Speaker 3>I remember there was a recent one,</v>

3757
01:35:19.011 --> 01:35:20.330
<v Speaker 3>people were saying that his son did it.</v>

3758
01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3759
01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:20.811
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3760
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:20.961
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3761
01:35:20.961 --> 01:35:21.980
<v Speaker 3>My mother always believed that.</v>

3762
01:35:21.981 --> 01:35:22.370
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

3763
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:24.680
<v Speaker 3>that's so fractured conspiracy theory though.</v>

3764
01:35:24.681 --> 01:35:24.921
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3765
01:35:24.921 --> 01:35:26.510
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I don't really get into,</v>

3766
01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't want,</v>

3767
01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:28.130

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.930
<v Speaker 3>those are the ones that are out there.</v>

3770
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't really get into that.</v>

3771
01:35:30.801 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't get any of the moon.</v>

3772
01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't go near a,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3810
01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:26.541
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

3811
01:36:26.541 --> 01:36:27.650
<v Speaker 3>you had to really look at it.</v>

3812
01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:28.250

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't go with the rest of my life with that.</v>

3816
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Well they look for it and everything.</v>

3817
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Everything's a conspiracy.</v>

3818
01:36:35.061 --> 01:36:38.270
<v Speaker 3>And then when it comes back to you and they say,</v>

3819
01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:38.631
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3820
01:36:38.631 --> 01:36:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Tim is involved in this,</v>

3821
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3822
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 3>And then you go,</v>

3823
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:41.211
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3824
01:36:41.211 --> 01:36:42.140
<v Speaker 3>I see how this works.</v>

3825
01:36:42.170 --> 01:36:43.220
<v Speaker 3>You don't just make shit up.</v>

3826
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3827
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:44.630
<v Speaker 3>And then they believe it.</v>

3828
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3829
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:47.630
<v Speaker 3>The CIA is now getting involved in podcasting.</v>

3830
01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.111
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3831
01:36:48.111 --> 01:36:48.651
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys,</v>

3832
01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:49.610
<v Speaker 3>you're their first shelf,</v>

3833
01:36:49.611 --> 01:36:52.050
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to get a few others on the deeply involved in.</v>

3834
01:36:52.051 --> 01:36:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Steve started the rush and Troy,</v>

3835
01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I love the idea of the CIA going and watching PSATs and be like,</v>

3836
01:37:00.351 --> 01:37:02.420
<v Speaker 3>who's getting passed at the store?</v>

3837
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:02.781
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3838
01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:03.590
<v Speaker 3>you don't know.</v>

3839
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:08.590
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend of mine who thinks that the CIA started Jim Morrison and Jimi</v>

3840
01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Hendrix.</v>

3841
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:13.400
<v Speaker 3>There's a book about that called Weird scenes inside the canyon written by a guy</v>

3842
01:37:13.401 --> 01:37:15.530
<v Speaker 3>named Dave McGowan and I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

3843
01:37:15.531 --> 01:37:15.771
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

3844
01:37:15.771 --> 01:37:16.610
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of interesting.</v>

3845
01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:18.051
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you,</v>

3846
01:37:18.051 --> 01:37:19.340
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of interesting.</v>

3847
01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:22.070
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of shit going on in Laurel Canyon,</v>

3848
01:37:22.071 --> 01:37:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure probably about pussy.</v>

3849
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:25.060
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of weird shit going on.</v>

3850
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.581
<v Speaker 3>The CIA,</v>

3851
01:37:25.581 --> 01:37:27.350
<v Speaker 3>the Rand Corp was all over there.</v>

3852
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:29.330
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot of shit happening.</v>

3853
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3854
01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there was a lot of shit happening,</v>

3855
01:37:32.031 --> 01:37:36.830
<v Speaker 3>but there is not a fucking intelligence agency in the world that can create a</v>

3856
01:37:36.831 --> 01:37:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Jimi Hendrix of course,</v>

3857
01:37:38.001 --> 01:37:39.080
<v Speaker 3>and they're not sitting there.</v>

3858
01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.310
<v Speaker 3>That book was like that.</v>

3859
01:37:40.311 --> 01:37:41.630
<v Speaker 3>They were managing the birds.</v>

3860
01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 3>The CIA was like,</v>

3861
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:43.491
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

3862
01:37:43.491 --> 01:37:43.671
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3863
01:37:43.671 --> 01:37:47.650
<v Speaker 3>it's mister tambourine was like a CIA guy to be like it had marine men's.</v>

3864
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Imagine being in that time in the country when everything was just falling apart</v>

3865
01:37:57.361 --> 01:37:58.770
<v Speaker 3>left and right around us.</v>

3866
01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam war,</v>

3867
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Kent State,</v>

3868
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.780
<v Speaker 3>just fucking Nixon's the president and it's just chaos left and right.</v>

3869
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:08.010
<v Speaker 3>There's no internet.</v>

3870
01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3871
01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.840
<v Speaker 3>everyone's doing drugs.</v>

3872
01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:11.670
<v Speaker 3>It must have been wild.</v>

3873
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:12.570
<v Speaker 3>It must've been amazing.</v>

3874
01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:13.351
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3875
01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I always think about that hunters Thompson quote about,</v>

3876
01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:16.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3877
01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:16.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3878
01:38:16.650 --> 01:38:20.850
<v Speaker 3>like we talked about the sixties and that in the 70s it was almost like the wave</v>

3879
01:38:20.851 --> 01:38:24.040
<v Speaker 3>crested and then just it's crashed act from fear and loathing in Las gas.</v>

3880
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3881
01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3882
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:26.011
<v Speaker 3>But I'm a big,</v>

3883
01:38:26.011 --> 01:38:27.450
<v Speaker 3>like I'm a Kennedy Guy.</v>

3884
01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something really shady with that.</v>

3885
01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:29.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3886
01:38:29.491 --> 01:38:29.971
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3887
01:38:29.971 --> 01:38:30.541
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

3888
01:38:30.541 --> 01:38:30.901
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

3889
01:38:30.901 --> 01:38:33.810
<v Speaker 3>And in that book is some amazing stuff about this book that you gave me.</v>

3890
01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:35.970
<v Speaker 3>His family of secrets is a guy,</v>

3891
01:38:35.971 --> 01:38:36.481
<v Speaker 3>Russ Baker,</v>

3892

<v Speaker 3>who's a legit journalist and it's,</v>

3893
01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:39.850
<v Speaker 3>it's been praised by like Dan Rather and Bill Moyers,</v>

3894
01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get you in this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This will get you in.</v>

3897
01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:44.163
<v Speaker 3>He went,</v>

3898
01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:45.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't have that kind of time.</v>

3899
01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:46.520
<v Speaker 3>George h did you know the choice?</v>

3900
01:38:46.521 --> 01:38:50.760
<v Speaker 3>H W Bush called the FBI and said that he thought he knew who the killer of JFK</v>

3901
01:38:50.761 --> 01:38:51.594
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

3902
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that?</v>

3903
01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.273
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3904
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:53.970
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3905
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:54.930
<v Speaker 3>He called the FBI.</v>

3906
01:38:54.931 --> 01:38:56.160
<v Speaker 3>The in Houston.</v>

3907
01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3908
01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:57.301
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

3909
01:38:57.301 --> 01:38:58.620
<v Speaker 3>It's George George Bush.</v>

3910
01:38:58.621 --> 01:38:59.281
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Tyler,</v>

3911
01:38:59.281 --> 01:39:03.690
<v Speaker 3>Texas and I think I know who the killer is and he informs on this Guy James</v>

3912
01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:03.691
<v Speaker 3>Parrot.</v>

3913
01:39:03.691 --> 01:39:06.600
<v Speaker 3>And James Parrot ended up being like one of his staffers.</v>

3914
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It was this weird cover story.</v>

3915
01:39:08.041 --> 01:39:12.240
<v Speaker 3>He kind of planted and that came out in a memo and there was another mental,</v>

3916
01:39:12.241 --> 01:39:13.740
<v Speaker 3>these are declassified FBI memos,</v>

3917
01:39:13.741 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 3>freedom of Information Act.</v>

3918
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:17.790
<v Speaker 3>There was another memo that said after the assassination,</v>

3919
01:39:17.791 --> 01:39:18.630
<v Speaker 3>j Edgar Hoover,</v>

3920
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Pre George Bush and the CIA.</v>

3921
01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:23.820
<v Speaker 3>The problem was George Bush should not have been working for the CIA at that</v>

3922
01:39:23.821 --> 01:39:24.450
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

3923
01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:26.010
<v Speaker 3>He should have been just a private citizen.</v>

3924
01:39:26.011 --> 01:39:30.180
<v Speaker 3>So it was suggested he was working for the agency for a very long time and he</v>

3925
01:39:30.181 --> 01:39:30.860
<v Speaker 3>was made the,</v>

3926
01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:31.041
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3927
01:39:31.041 --> 01:39:34.860
<v Speaker 3>the director of the agency for one year after the family jewels came out,</v>

3928
01:39:34.861 --> 01:39:36.510
<v Speaker 3>which was this whole thing with the CIA,</v>

3929
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:39.390
<v Speaker 3>went to Congress and they admitted that they had done all these things from,</v>

3930
01:39:39.690 --> 01:39:40.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3931
01:39:40.051 --> 01:39:45.051
<v Speaker 3>coups and the fomenting revolutions and countries and they made him the director</v>

3932
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:51.770
<v Speaker 3>for one year after that happened to break to make a clean break from all of the</v>

3933
01:39:52.321 --> 01:39:54.510
<v Speaker 3>nefarious activities that the agency had been involved with.</v>

3934
01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:58.890
<v Speaker 3>But if you take that memo to mean that he had had an existing relationship with</v>

3935
01:39:58.891 --> 01:39:59.520
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

3936
01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.570
<v Speaker 3>he was actually just becoming the cause.</v>

3937
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.720
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3938
01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:02.760
<v Speaker 3>it made no sense to anyone.</v>

3939
01:40:02.761 --> 01:40:03.031
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

3940
01:40:03.031 --> 01:40:05.730
<v Speaker 3>why is this guy that everyone called the lightweight becoming the head of the</v>

3941
01:40:05.731 --> 01:40:09.870
<v Speaker 3>CIA after the CIA just admitted to all of these horrible things.</v>

3942
01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:10.860
<v Speaker 3>They call him a lightweight.</v>

3943
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:11.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3944
01:40:11.161 --> 01:40:11.580
<v Speaker 3>they called.</v>

3945
01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:11.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3946
01:40:11.761 --> 01:40:12.181
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

3947
01:40:12.181 --> 01:40:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I think Kissinger had said to Nixon to kissed her,</v>

3948
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:15.200
<v Speaker 3>said to Nixon,</v>

3949
01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:15.891
<v Speaker 3>he's a lightweight,</v>

3950
01:40:15.891 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 3>commit him ambassador to China.</v>

3951
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.180
<v Speaker 3>He was never a guy that had a serious political capital and he was made the head</v>

3952
01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:23.500
<v Speaker 3>of the CIA and then after that memo was on earth,</v>

3953
01:40:23.501 --> 01:40:24.334
<v Speaker 3>people were saying,</v>

3954
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:25.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3955
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:26.363
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>

3956
01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.900
<v Speaker 3>this was an extension of the coverup.</v>

3957
01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:29.460
<v Speaker 3>He was being made,</v>

3958
01:40:29.461 --> 01:40:33.510
<v Speaker 3>the director at this very interesting time in history because he actually had</v>

3959
01:40:33.511 --> 01:40:36.780
<v Speaker 3>worked with the agency forever and he was not at all a lightweight.</v>

3960
01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.250
<v Speaker 3>He was a serious operator and he was going in there to kind of clean up and</v>

3961
01:40:41.251 --> 01:40:43.200
<v Speaker 3>transition them into a new era.</v>

3962
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.710
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3963
01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:44.191
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:02.140
<v Speaker 2>There is a thriving space is fake community.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well this is an extension of flat earth.</v>

4024
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:16.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like for people to think the flat earth is too conservative.</v>

4025
01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:17.230
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

4026
01:42:17.230 --> 01:42:17.921
<v Speaker 2>they go deeper.</v>

4027
01:42:17.921 --> 01:42:18.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not stupid.</v>

4028
01:42:19.110 --> 01:42:19.560
<v Speaker 2>They go deep.</v>

4029
01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Those flat Earth Cox,</v>

4030
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:22.060
<v Speaker 2>they want to move into space.</v>

4031
01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:25.820
<v Speaker 2>They want to go to s spaces bank.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You want to know what's really up spaces face basis.</v>

4034

01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:30.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4036
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

4037
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:31.151
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

4038
01:42:31.151 --> 01:42:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4039
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I think there are hundreds of thousands of people that think that the earth is</v>

4040
01:42:34.511 --> 01:42:35.230
<v Speaker 2>flat.</v>

4041
01:42:35.230 --> 01:42:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of thousands educated western American human beings that think the</v>

4042
01:42:40.631 --> 01:42:41.464
<v Speaker 2>earth is flat.</v>

4043
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:42.700
<v Speaker 2>That is wild.</v>

4044
01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.620
<v Speaker 2>It is fucking crazy.</v>

4045
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.310
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

4046
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:47.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people that just get educated from youtube.</v>

4047
01:42:47.621 --> 01:42:49.180
<v Speaker 2>The Guardian actually had an article about it.</v>

4048
01:42:49.181 --> 01:42:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I sent it to Eddie and Eddie's laughed at me.</v>

4049
01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:52.031
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

4050
01:42:52.031 --> 01:42:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I think Eddie's kind of rational and a lot of ways,</v>

4051
01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:58.360
<v Speaker 2>because I had conspiracy talks with him about what about,</v>

4052
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.811
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4053
01:42:58.811 --> 01:42:59.051
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4054
01:42:59.051 --> 01:42:59.291
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4055
01:42:59.291 --> 01:43:04.180
<v Speaker 2>the one that we had wasn't saying a little government was attacking Malibu.</v>

4056
01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4057
01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.130
<v Speaker 2>he's the one that we're talking about that they were using direct energy weapons</v>

4058
01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:09.671
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

4059
01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is tacky Malibu with what?</v>

4060
01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:11.921
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4061
01:43:11.921 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 2>why would they attack mallet with of the fires?</v>

4062
01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:14.561
<v Speaker 2>But I'm like,</v>

4063
01:43:14.561 --> 01:43:14.950
<v Speaker 2>they're rich.</v>

4064
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Why would they attack mal boats to rich people?</v>

4065
01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:17.651
<v Speaker 2>Fire started here.</v>

4066
01:43:17.651 --> 01:43:18.520
<v Speaker 2>My fucking house.</v>

4067
01:43:18.521 --> 01:43:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Did he start a mal?</v>

4068
01:43:19.551 --> 01:43:20.770
<v Speaker 2>But they flew through the air.</v>

4069
01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.080
<v Speaker 2>You know I was one of the first evacuated.</v>

4074
01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4075
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 2>A fire hits and the winds are going.</v>

4076
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Co Did they make the wind?</v>

4077
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.721
<v Speaker 2>They made the wine.</v>

4078
01:43:32.721 --> 01:43:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you always made the wind.</v>

4079
01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:37.150
<v Speaker 2>The wind is always been the CIA.</v>

4080
01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>They've always made the wind.</v>

4081
01:43:38.290 --> 01:43:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:43:41.801 --> 01:43:42.640
<v Speaker 2>There's no peace.</v>

4086
01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:43.930
<v Speaker 2>There's no living in the moment.</v>

4087
01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:45.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like a certain point.</v>

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.120
<v Speaker 3>like the war shit going on right now?</v>

4093
01:43:53.150 --> 01:43:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Human trafficking is very bad,</v>

4094
01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:55.250
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

4095
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:55.820
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

4096
01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.290
<v Speaker 3>and really dollar industry.</v>

4097
01:43:57.620 --> 01:43:59.120
<v Speaker 3>That's not subway sandwich.</v>

4098
01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Artists are paying for that.</v>

4099
01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4100
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Rich people.</v>

4101
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are involved in some very bad things and they're,</v>

4102
01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:08.090
<v Speaker 3>it's their attraction be they're covering their own tracks.</v>

4103
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4104
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:09.351
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

4105
01:44:09.351 --> 01:44:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey Epstein and stuff.</v>

4106
01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Dude that the Clinton visited the least got to.</v>

4107
01:44:13.771 --> 01:44:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I've got some hire anyone with an island</v>

4108
01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:19.370
<v Speaker 3>and hanging out with Bill Clinton.</v>

4109
01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 3>If you have an island and you're hanging out with Bill Clinton,</v>

4110
01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:24.013
<v Speaker 3>there's a problem.</v>

4111
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Where's the Mataz?</v>

4112
01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4113
01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:29.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a crazy,</v>

4114
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:32.330
<v Speaker 3>all of that stuff is very disturbing and he got a sweetheart deal cause he</v>

4115
01:44:32.331 --> 01:44:35.690
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't inform on anyone that was on his plane and now they're low justice</v>

4116
01:44:35.691 --> 01:44:36.980
<v Speaker 3>department's looking at that again.</v>

4117
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:38.480
<v Speaker 3>It'll probably be fine.</v>

4118
01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:39.590
<v Speaker 3>They'll probably just let it,</v>

4119
01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:40.910
<v Speaker 3>you know with a guy like that,</v>

4120
01:44:40.911 --> 01:44:42.610
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

4121
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:43.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4122
01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.570
<v Speaker 3>how much does he know?</v>

4123
01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:48.300
<v Speaker 3>How does it knows every day alive because it's good the,</v>

4124
01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.220
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to say anything.</v>

4125
01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.673
<v Speaker 3>Not going to talk.</v>

4126
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:54.100
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't trust him if he,</v>

4127
01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:56.420
<v Speaker 3>I was on that plane.</v>

4128
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the other thing about see the aversion of conspiracies as you go.</v>

4129
01:44:59.121 --> 01:45:00.560
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody would,</v>

4130
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:01.790
<v Speaker 3>people would talk.</v>

4131
01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:05.750
<v Speaker 3>The reality is people wouldn't talk if you were from a prominent family.</v>

4132
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:08.180
<v Speaker 3>If it had been like a religion to stay silent.</v>

4133
01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:10.640
<v Speaker 3>If you had had CIA training,</v>

4134
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.570
<v Speaker 3>if you would,</v>

4135
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:15.580
<v Speaker 3>these people don't talk and we know that there been plots that have gone unknown</v>

4136
01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.480
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time.</v>

4137
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Clearly coup in Iran.</v>

4138
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4139
01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:18.590
<v Speaker 3>So garlic,</v>

4140
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey Epstein is so involved,</v>

4141
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:21.583
<v Speaker 3>so deep,</v>

4142
01:45:21.710 --> 01:45:22.790
<v Speaker 3>he knows he'll get killed.</v>

4143
01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 3>He won't say anything.</v>

4144
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4145
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:25.760
<v Speaker 3>he's not gonna say anything.</v>

4146
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Plus he doesn't want to go to jail.</v>

4147
01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.290
<v Speaker 3>He just want to go to jail.</v>

4148
01:45:28.290 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want to say anything.</v>

4149
01:45:29.151 --> 01:45:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Middle of the things that he did.</v>

4150
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4151
01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.380
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

4152
01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:32.531
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4153
01:45:32.531 --> 01:45:35.260
<v Speaker 3>the child thing is the creepiest of all gross.</v>

4154
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:36.480
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately it's,</v>

4155
01:45:36.610 --> 01:45:37.370
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

4156
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:38.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a real thing.</v>

4157
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.860
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

4158
01:45:39.861 --> 01:45:40.940
<v Speaker 3>people you could talk about,</v>

4159
01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:43.640
<v Speaker 3>there's the conspiratorial angles,</v>

4160
01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:44.330
<v Speaker 3>the bullshit.</v>

4161
01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:46.010
<v Speaker 3>But then there's the real fathers.</v>

4162
01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:46.853
<v Speaker 3>Sandusky,</v>

4165
01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:49.493
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent.</v>

4166
01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.690
<v Speaker 3>The people that are in love with conspiracies never care about private prisons</v>

4167
01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:54.831
<v Speaker 3>or the Catholic Church.</v>

4168
01:45:54.831 --> 01:45:55.101
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

4169
01:45:55.101 --> 01:45:55.341
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

4170
01:45:55.341 --> 01:45:56.390
<v Speaker 3>this is not even debatable.</v>

4171
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:57.583
<v Speaker 3>We're not even debating,</v>

4172
01:45:57.630 --> 01:45:58.100
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4173
01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Private prisons are ruined.</v>

4174
01:45:59.150 --> 01:46:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Kids are being sold into slavery.</v>

4175
01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:02.061
<v Speaker 3>Ryan Ababa,</v>

4176
01:46:02.061 --> 01:46:02.420

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:04.070
<v Speaker 3>The judge in Pennsylvania.</v>

4178
01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

4179
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Taking an underage kids and just giving them sentence ridiculous sentences for</v>

4180
01:46:09.321 --> 01:46:09.680
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

4181
01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.241
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

4182
01:46:10.241 --> 01:46:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Exchange for money.</v>

4183
01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.140
<v Speaker 3>That's not right.</v>

4184
01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:12.973
<v Speaker 3>And now he's in jail.</v>

4185
01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:13.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4186
01:46:13.581 --> 01:46:14.300
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

4187
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 3>there's some darkness in the world.</v>

4188
01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:17.180
<v Speaker 3>It's undeniable.</v>

4189
01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.070
<v Speaker 3>And when something like San Dusky,</v>

4190
01:46:19.071 --> 01:46:21.710
<v Speaker 3>when that Penn state thing comes out and you're like,</v>

4191
01:46:21.711 --> 01:46:22.131
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

4192
01:46:22.131 --> 01:46:23.630
<v Speaker 3>how long was this going on for?</v>

4193
01:46:23.670 --> 01:46:25.150
<v Speaker 3>And how many people knew?</v>

4194
01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knew.</v>

4195
01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:27.350
<v Speaker 3>How does everyone know?</v>

4196
01:46:27.730 --> 01:46:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4197
01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:28.850
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

4198
01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:30.860
<v Speaker 3>It turned out just he died quick,</v>

4199
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:35.690
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I'm course but doesn't mean he destroyed.</v>

4200
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:39.230
<v Speaker 3>This is what I mean about people where it's like you tube's gonna like central</v>

4201
01:46:39.231 --> 01:46:40.490
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory type stuff.</v>

4202
01:46:40.491 --> 01:46:40.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4203
01:46:40.731 --> 01:46:43.670
<v Speaker 3>all of those things would have been called conspiracy theories at one point.</v>

4204
01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:44.953
<v Speaker 3>Catholic church,</v>

4205
01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:46.830
<v Speaker 3>San Dusky blue grade,</v>

4206
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:48.230
<v Speaker 3>they said it was a few bad apples.</v>

4207
01:46:48.231 --> 01:46:49.064
<v Speaker 3>It was a labyrinth.</v>

4208
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 3>Torture prisoners.</v>

4209
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.750
<v Speaker 2>It was a program designed by the Pentagon.</v>

4210
01:46:51.810 --> 01:46:52.291
<v Speaker 2>CIA.</v>

4211
01:46:52.291 --> 01:46:52.950
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

4212
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:55.290
<v Speaker 2>What is the youtube going to do?</v>

4213
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:57.630
<v Speaker 2>They're going to censor recommending.</v>

4214
01:46:57.631 --> 01:47:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I think they were stopped recommending conspiracy videos from what I've heard.</v>

4215
01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.810
<v Speaker 2>But I was reading that thing that you were telling me about Jamie,</v>

4216
01:47:03.811 --> 01:47:08.811
<v Speaker 2>this whole like porn or child porn or pedophile network,</v>

4217
01:47:09.970 --> 01:47:11.490
<v Speaker 2>you're sending an account of what is this?</v>

4218
01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:12.301
<v Speaker 2>A pedophile youtube,</v>

4219
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:14.340
<v Speaker 2>what's going to a communication network.</v>

4220
01:47:14.341 --> 01:47:17.820
<v Speaker 2>They were communicating with each other and youtube comments responded yesterday</v>

4221
01:47:17.821 --> 01:47:19.800
<v Speaker 2>and they said that they uh,</v>

4222
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:25.100
<v Speaker 2>disabled comments on tens of millions of videos and deleted a lot of accounts</v>

4223
01:47:28.530 --> 01:47:29.363
<v Speaker 2>that were,</v>

4224
01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:33.420
<v Speaker 2>they were communicating in the comment section of like a little kid's</v>

4225
01:47:33.421 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 2>cheerleading and whatnot.</v>

4226
01:47:34.710 --> 01:47:39.710
<v Speaker 2>How were they communicating to try to s to share child porn or were they a</v>

4227
01:47:40.021 --> 01:47:41.700
<v Speaker 2>communicating to molest?</v>

4228
01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Don't know in the way pedophiles communicate and their network.</v>

4229
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:45.683
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

4230
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I'd like you to do a little bit more work.</v>

4231
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Pull up an article on due diligence on the pedophile.</v>

4232
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I want you to go and eat under the dark web burner computer for that download</v>

4233
01:47:57.210 --> 01:48:00.180
<v Speaker 2>tor and let's get moving cause we got to figure shit out.</v>

4234
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:04.650
<v Speaker 2>You got to get a VPN or there that's the FBI will take over child points had on</v>

4235
01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:06.660
<v Speaker 2>tour and then Ronnie for a year on the talk.</v>

4236
01:48:07.210 --> 01:48:08.043
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

4237
01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:09.360
<v Speaker 2>What's going on.</v>

4238
01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I imagine what they see too.</v>

4239
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>

4240
01:48:14.010 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 2>It is a problem because you're causing,</v>

4241
01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.240
<v Speaker 2>that happens at our Kelly Case.</v>

4242
01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:21.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of him doing something with an underage girl and like I think</v>

4243
01:48:21.781 --> 01:48:22.890
<v Speaker 2>some people at CNN,</v>

4244
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:24.450
<v Speaker 2>it's like we've seen it but,</v>

4245
01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:25.920
<v Speaker 2>and that's led to him going and it's like,</v>

4246
01:48:25.921 --> 01:48:28.860
<v Speaker 2>well what did you watch and is that legal?</v>

4247
01:48:28.861 --> 01:48:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Probably illegal because you're watching it under the guise of Oh,</v>

4248
01:48:31.450 --> 01:48:32.283
<v Speaker 2>journey out of</v>

4249
01:48:35.730 --> 01:48:36.563
<v Speaker 2>rough.</v>

4250
01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4251
01:48:37.050 --> 01:48:39.210
<v Speaker 2>That kind of Shit is real.</v>

4252
01:48:39.690 --> 01:48:44.690
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that there's these networks of people that are trying to,</v>

4253
01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4254
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:48.090
<v Speaker 2>cultivate these experiences.</v>

4255
01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:48.990
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy man.</v>

4256
01:48:48.991 --> 01:48:50.100
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a rich person,</v>

4257
01:48:50.101 --> 01:48:51.810
<v Speaker 2>you have that sick predilection,</v>

4258
01:48:52.170 --> 01:48:54.660
<v Speaker 2>you're going to find a way to think of what they're doing.</v>

4259
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>

4260
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 2>the post her remarks that praise the girls ask whether they were wearing</v>

4261
01:48:59.851 --> 01:49:03.420
<v Speaker 2>underwear or simply carried a string of sexually suggestive emojis.</v>

4262
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:04.531
<v Speaker 2>Bout two years ago,</v>

4263
01:49:04.531 --> 01:49:08.550
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of companies pulled money from Youtube over concerns about ads showing</v>

4264
01:49:08.551 --> 01:49:13.320
<v Speaker 2>up next to problematic content from terror or hate groups and videos a seem to</v>

4265
01:49:13.321 --> 01:49:14.790
<v Speaker 2>endanger exploit children.</v>

4266
01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:15.541
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4267
01:49:15.541 --> 01:49:16.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4268
01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.750
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about this before with youtube with the issues that we've had with</v>

4269
01:49:18.751 --> 01:49:19.050
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

4270
01:49:19.050 --> 01:49:19.550
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4271
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:24.360
<v Speaker 2>they have way too much content and way too few people.</v>

4272
01:49:24.710 --> 01:49:26.460
<v Speaker 2>There's no way they can watch all of it.</v>

4273
01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:29.220
<v Speaker 2>And when Shit like this where people were doing things in the comments,</v>

4274
01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:31.170
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to check.</v>

4275
01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4276
01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:32.543
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

4277
01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:37.780
<v Speaker 2>cause they're youtube comments are one of the rare free range sort of like</v>

4278
01:49:37.890 --> 01:49:41.130
<v Speaker 2>unchecked message boards in the world.</v>

4279
01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I'll find out later.</v>

4280
01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:44.593
<v Speaker 2>Read it.</v>

4281
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Don't read it Bro.</v>

4282

<v Speaker 2>Who is this fat fuck?</v>

4283
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.390

4284
01:49:48.391 --> 01:49:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4285
01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:49.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4286
01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.613
<v Speaker 2>Why is he here?</v>

4287
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Who is that dope?</v>

4288
01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Read it.</v>

4289
01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4291
01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:54.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4292
01:49:54.150 --> 01:49:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4293
01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there's ever going to be a time where that is impossible,</v>

4294
01:49:57.941 --> 01:50:01.000
<v Speaker 2>where like these child pedophile rings,</v>

4295
01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:03.790
<v Speaker 2>they can figure out a way to snuff all that out.</v>

4296
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4297
01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm harder now than ever before.</v>

4298
01:50:05.711 --> 01:50:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm imagining.</v>

4299
01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:11.480
<v Speaker 2>It's very tough and it's tough I think because so few people want to believe</v>

4300
01:50:12.431 --> 01:50:14.830
<v Speaker 2>that it's a problem in the way that it is,</v>

4301
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:15.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4302
01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Because there's good people in the world that don't think these things are</v>

4303
01:50:17.951 --> 01:50:18.784
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

4304
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:22.510
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's the political will isn't there because people don't,</v>

4305
01:50:22.511 --> 01:50:24.010
<v Speaker 2>aren't really,</v>

4306
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:25.240
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand that it's,</v>

4307
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4308
01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:28.600
<v Speaker 2>and then the people that are doing these things are very wealthy,</v>

4309
01:50:28.601 --> 01:50:29.381
<v Speaker 2>powerful people,</v>

4310
01:50:29.381 --> 01:50:32.140
<v Speaker 2>and they have a lot of control and they can kind of cover their tracks.</v>

4311
01:50:32.141 --> 01:50:34.450
<v Speaker 2>If they're were all wealthy on all empower,</v>

4312
01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:35.440
<v Speaker 2>poor pedophile,</v>

4313
01:50:35.441 --> 01:50:36.760
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to a ring.</v>

4314
01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:37.540
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

4315
01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:39.040
<v Speaker 2>You snatching some kid,</v>

4316
01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:39.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4317
01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I know it's bad.</v>

4318
01:50:40.691 --> 01:50:41.321
<v Speaker 2>But if you're rich,</v>

4319
01:50:41.321 --> 01:50:42.040
<v Speaker 2>pedophile,</v>

4320
01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:43.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a nicer experience.</v>

4321
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like you go on vacation versus me going on vacation,</v>

4322
01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:47.140
<v Speaker 2>you go on vacation.</v>

4323
01:50:47.141 --> 01:50:47.951
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice experience.</v>

4324
01:50:47.951 --> 01:50:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I go on vacation,</v>

4325
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4326
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:50.501
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

4327
01:50:50.501 --> 01:50:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Sandals in The Bahamas,</v>

4328
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:57.250
<v Speaker 2>not even no sales where you go in the cabin or something in the forest.</v>

4329
01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:02.770
<v Speaker 2>You know what's crazy about all of us when you're talking about like child</v>

4330
01:51:02.771 --> 01:51:03.790
<v Speaker 2>molesters and stuff like that,</v>

4331
01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:08.820
<v Speaker 2>which crazy is the Catholic church is still around and still they're catching</v>

4332
01:51:10.301 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 2>people left and right when it's known for it.</v>

4333
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:14.170
<v Speaker 2>There's no more,</v>

4334
01:51:14.290 --> 01:51:14.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4335
01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:17.530
<v Speaker 2>nothing is more synonymous with child molesting.</v>

4336
01:51:18.010 --> 01:51:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Then the Catholic church.</v>

4337
01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:20.260
<v Speaker 2>That is the number one thing.</v>

4338
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:21.670
<v Speaker 2>You were raised Catholic.</v>

4339
01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:22.451
<v Speaker 2>I was raised Catholic.</v>

4340
01:51:22.451 --> 01:51:23.201
<v Speaker 2>I was never molested.</v>

4341
01:51:23.201 --> 01:51:24.370
<v Speaker 2>I was raised Catholic.</v>

4342
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4343
01:51:24.930 --> 01:51:25.451
<v Speaker 2>you got lucky,</v>

4344
01:51:25.451 --> 01:51:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

4345
01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky.</v>

4346
01:51:26.530 --> 01:51:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I was fake chem labs Kat.</v>

4347
01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:28.811
<v Speaker 2>We're all fit.</v>

4348
01:51:28.811 --> 01:51:30.550
<v Speaker 2>This Catholic is fake.</v>

4349
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.750
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4350
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:33.070
<v Speaker 2>it's stuffed shells.</v>

4351
01:51:33.071 --> 01:51:34.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice dinner.</v>

4352
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.520
<v Speaker 2>It's five fishes once a year.</v>

4353
01:51:36.521 --> 01:51:38.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like no one cares.</v>

4354
01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:40.210
<v Speaker 2>No one in a Catholic church cares.</v>

4355
01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:42.100
<v Speaker 2>If you turn around to the guy next to you though,</v>

4356
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:43.121
<v Speaker 2>is this bull shit.</v>

4357
01:51:43.121 --> 01:51:43.850
<v Speaker 2>They'll go shut up.</v>

4358
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:44.920
<v Speaker 2>I said I'm a bit about it.</v>

4359
01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the suicide bombers cause I was raised Catholic.</v>

4360
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4361
01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:52.540
<v Speaker 2>And no one is in the Catholic Church believes in it that much.</v>

4362
01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:53.920
<v Speaker 2>We like nice buildings,</v>

4363
01:51:53.921 --> 01:51:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Catholic suicide bombers,</v>

4364
01:51:54.971 --> 01:51:55.271

01:52:01.601 --> 01:52:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Nice architecture.</v>

4377
01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.280
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

4378
01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:03.761
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

4379
01:52:03.761 --> 01:52:04.460
<v Speaker 2>It's nice.</v>

4380
01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:05.970
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

4381
01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on in them.</v>

4382
01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:09.280
<v Speaker 2>There's incense going around.</v>

4383
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:11.720
<v Speaker 2>This is the mystery of faith.</v>

4384
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>

4385
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I was talking with Bob about this recently about church has some good qualities</v>

4386
01:52:16.241 --> 01:52:18.790
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that it has is it makes you feel like,</v>

4387
01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:19.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4388
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like a community thing.</v>

4389
01:52:20.771 --> 01:52:25.080
<v Speaker 2>You sit down and you get a chance to assess yourself and your life and sort of</v>

4390
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:28.240
<v Speaker 2>reaffirm your moral guidance in your moral compass.</v>

4391
01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:28.720
<v Speaker 2>And there's some,</v>

4392
01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:29.553
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>

4393
01:52:29.610 --> 01:52:33.700
<v Speaker 2>there's some positive things to a good church and that's how those rock and roll</v>

4394
01:52:33.701 --> 01:52:37.240
<v Speaker 2>culty Super Hollywood churches get started because people say,</v>

4395
01:52:37.241 --> 01:52:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I want a church.</v>

4396
01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:40.120
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want a traditional church.</v>

4397
01:52:40.150 --> 01:52:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I want something spiritual and funds and killing.</v>

4398
01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:43.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the church.</v>

4399
01:52:43.811 --> 01:52:44.321
<v Speaker 2>When I grew up,</v>

4400
01:52:44.321 --> 01:52:44.891
<v Speaker 2>I said to my dad,</v>

4401
01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:45.940
<v Speaker 2>why do we go here every Sunday?</v>

4402
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:46.191
<v Speaker 2>He went,</v>

4403
01:52:46.191 --> 01:52:47.024
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>

4404
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:48.830
<v Speaker 2>That was the answer because it was like,</v>

4405
01:52:48.831 --> 01:52:49.520
<v Speaker 2>we just go,</v>

4406

4411
01:52:56.691 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 2>They want it to speak to them.</v>

4412
01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:58.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

4434
01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:27.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4435
01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4436
01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.760
<v Speaker 2>She was one of those gals.</v>

4437
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:31.100
<v Speaker 2>She'd just have a couple of pops and then off to the races.</v>

4438
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.761
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

4439
01:53:31.761 --> 01:53:32.840
<v Speaker 2>you live lunch,</v>

4440
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:33.561
<v Speaker 2>you live.</v>

4441
01:53:33.561 --> 01:53:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Once she was on,</v>

4442
01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:35.451
<v Speaker 2>she was attractive.</v>

4443
01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:36.410
<v Speaker 2>She was having a good time.</v>

4444
01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4445
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the problem.</v>

4446
01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.820
<v Speaker 2>What church did she go to?</v>

4447
01:53:38.821 --> 01:53:39.531
<v Speaker 2>This one of them cracked.</v>

4448
01:53:39.531 --> 01:53:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>

4449
01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:41.150
<v Speaker 2>this is decades ago,</v>

4450
01:53:41.151 --> 01:53:41.750
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of them.</v>

4451
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Crazy rock and roll type churches.</v>

4452
01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4453
01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:44.150
<v Speaker 2>that's so funny.</v>

4454
01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:45.590
<v Speaker 2>You know the Catholic I,</v>

4455
01:53:45.850 --> 01:53:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting that people that joined the Catholic religion now,</v>

4456
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.651
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4457
01:53:48.651 --> 01:53:49.484
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

4458
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Who's joining it now?</v>

4459
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4460
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Who's going in and going,</v>

4461
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:53.323
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

4462
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>

4463
01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:54.853
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who did it.</v>

4464
01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:58.010
<v Speaker 2>You know Glenn Beck joined the Mormons as a grown man.</v>

4465
01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:58.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4466
01:53:58.251 --> 01:53:59.084
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

4467
01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:00.500
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

4468
01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4469
01:54:01.410 --> 01:54:02.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a little off.</v>

4470
01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Maybe one the nine whys.</v>

4471
01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:03.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4472
01:54:03.861 --> 01:54:05.400
<v Speaker 2>It's probably why you're sort of course did.</v>

4473
01:54:05.401 --> 01:54:06.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's a huge benefit.</v>

4474
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.281
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the,</v>

4475
01:54:07.281 --> 01:54:08.510
<v Speaker 2>the whole Mitt Romney store?</v>

4476
01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:09.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4477
01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't know?</v>

4478
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4479
01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:14.900
<v Speaker 2>So I have my cousin married a Mormon who they excommunicated from the church</v>

4480
01:54:14.901 --> 01:54:19.250
<v Speaker 2>when he was like 17 Mitt Romney's family all moved to Mexico.</v>

4481
01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.210
<v Speaker 2>That's why Mitt Romney's dad could never be president because meant Romney's dad</v>

4482
01:54:23.211 --> 01:54:27.800
<v Speaker 2>was born in Mexico because when they passed the law making polygamy illegal in</v>

4483
01:54:27.801 --> 01:54:28.850
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

4484
01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:31.730
<v Speaker 2>they all packed up their shit and went to Mexico.</v>

4485
01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.151
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

4486
01:54:32.151 --> 01:54:32.481
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4487
01:54:32.481 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Because in the 18 hundreds it didn't fucking matter if you were in Mexico or the</v>

4488
01:54:35.931 --> 01:54:36.501
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>

4489
01:54:36.501 --> 01:54:37.161
<v Speaker 2>it was all the same.</v>

4490
01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:38.430
<v Speaker 2>You're riding a horse everywhere.</v>

4491
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

4492
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:41.150
<v Speaker 2>They're like that could have nine wives over here.</v>

4493
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:42.410
<v Speaker 2>So they have these compounds.</v>

4494
01:54:42.411 --> 01:54:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Vice did a whole series.</v>

4495
01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Now they have compounds down there with the armed guards.</v>

4496
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:46.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4497
01:54:46.641 --> 01:54:49.250
<v Speaker 2>because the cartel was fucking kidnapping them and shit.</v>

4498
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:50.001
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4499
01:54:50.001 --> 01:54:51.230
<v Speaker 2>So Mitt Romney's dad was like,</v>

4500
01:54:51.231 --> 01:54:53.430
<v Speaker 2>you can't take nice fucking guys.</v>

4501
01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:55.460
<v Speaker 2>They still have a fucking,</v>

4502
01:54:55.461 --> 01:54:59.390
<v Speaker 2>they still have a compound down there in the Smithsonian magazine,</v>

4503
01:54:59.770 --> 01:55:02.780
<v Speaker 2>but is that the smithsonian.com au has a story on it?</v>

4504
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:03.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4505
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:05.600
<v Speaker 2>the Romney's Mexican history.</v>

4506
01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4507
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:07.550
<v Speaker 2>the whole family.</v>

4508
01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:08.990
<v Speaker 2>That's what I meant from Mexico.</v>

4509
01:55:08.991 --> 01:55:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

4510
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:10.191
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

4511
01:55:10.191 --> 01:55:10.851
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

4512
01:55:10.851 --> 01:55:11.610
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

4513
01:55:11.610 --> 01:55:12.443
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4514
01:55:12.710 --> 01:55:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I know they went down there because they couldn't do what they wanted to do in</v>

4515
01:55:17.211 --> 01:55:17.811
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

4516
01:55:17.811 --> 01:55:19.520
<v Speaker 2>There was no polygamy in the u s anymore.</v>

4517
01:55:19.521 --> 01:55:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Anyone?</v>

4518
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:20.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4519
01:55:20.250 --> 01:55:21.300
<v Speaker 2>that's legal interest.</v>

4520
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:22.143
<v Speaker 2>It's just hilarious.</v>

4521
01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:22.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4522
01:55:22.311 --> 01:55:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Let it happen.</v>

4523
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Because here's the thing,</v>

4524
01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.350
<v Speaker 2>you could have like nine girlfriends.</v>

4525
01:55:26.370 --> 01:55:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4526
01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.460
<v Speaker 2>And I'll live together and no one could say shit,</v>

4527
01:55:28.461 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you write it down,</v>

4528
01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a prop you up and put you in jail.</v>

4529
01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.710
<v Speaker 2>There was a show called like sister wives or something.</v>

4530
01:55:33.711 --> 01:55:35.030
<v Speaker 2>It was about people that,</v>

4531
01:55:35.031 --> 01:55:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I think they were living in the state and then like multiple wives.</v>

4532
01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>

4533
01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4534
01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:40.040
<v Speaker 2>it's probably bullshit.</v>

4535
01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:40.701
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4536
01:55:40.701 --> 01:55:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think polygamy Google it.</v>

4537
01:55:42.471 --> 01:55:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's like legal in like</v>

4538
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Nebraska or some shit.</v>

4539
01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:46.373
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Nebraska.</v>

4540
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:47.221
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>

4541
01:55:47.221 --> 01:55:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Then Brasco would be just a place to go.</v>

4542
01:55:48.931 --> 01:55:49.590
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

4543
01:55:49.590 --> 01:55:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Let live and let live live and let live.</v>

4544
01:55:51.410 --> 01:55:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Live Rask is like,</v>

4545
01:55:52.411 --> 01:55:55.170
<v Speaker 3>we're having a hard time keeping people here so you can just fuck anything.</v>

4546
01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Anyone you want Mary,</v>

4547
01:55:56.461 --> 01:55:57.001
<v Speaker 3>your dog,</v>

4548
01:55:57.001 --> 01:55:57.301
<v Speaker 3>Mary,</v>

4549
01:55:57.301 --> 01:55:59.370
<v Speaker 3>everything is polygamy nationwide,</v>

4550
01:55:59.371 --> 01:56:00.630
<v Speaker 3>federally illegal.</v>

4551
01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:02.581
<v Speaker 3>It is illegal.</v>

4552
01:56:02.581 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>But I know what you're talking about where there is TV shows where people are</v>

4553
01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:06.180
<v Speaker 3>still doing it.</v>

4554
01:56:06.181 --> 01:56:11.181
<v Speaker 3>So also have you successfully infiltrated a pedophile youtube group yet waiting</v>

4555
01:56:11.341 --> 01:56:11.781
<v Speaker 3>for the tweet.</v>

4556
01:56:11.781 --> 01:56:12.630
<v Speaker 3>So Lazy.</v>

4557
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:16.680
<v Speaker 3>But it is crazy that his family was like,</v>

4558
01:56:16.681 --> 01:56:17.191
<v Speaker 3>well fuck it.</v>

4559
01:56:17.191 --> 01:56:19.500
<v Speaker 3>We'll just move to Mexico and he made a great point.</v>

4560
01:56:19.501 --> 01:56:20.221
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>

4561
01:56:20.221 --> 01:56:21.480
<v Speaker 3>You're on a horse back then.</v>

4562
01:56:21.481 --> 01:56:21.661
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4563
01:56:21.661 --> 01:56:22.470
<v Speaker 3>To Rio Grande.</v>

4564
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4565
01:56:22.681 --> 01:56:26.700
<v Speaker 3>because I think when they made it illegal in the 18 hundreds look at us as a</v>

4566
01:56:26.701 --> 01:56:28.500
<v Speaker 3>polygamous community crumbles.</v>

4567
01:56:28.590 --> 01:56:29.101
<v Speaker 3>Sister.</v>

4568
01:56:29.101 --> 01:56:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Wives are forced from homes.</v>

4569
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:31.980
<v Speaker 3>This is the caliber of life.</v>

4570
01:56:31.981 --> 01:56:32.641
<v Speaker 3>This is interesting.</v>

4571
01:56:32.641 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Saw you get bro.</v>

4572
01:56:33.481 --> 01:56:34.420
<v Speaker 3>If you want nine of them,</v>

4573
01:56:34.421 --> 01:56:35.540
<v Speaker 3>you don't get nine good ones.</v>

4574
01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:37.620
<v Speaker 3>You need to get one 10 or not in ones.</v>

4575
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:38.970
<v Speaker 3>This is a lot of,</v>

4576
01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:40.060
<v Speaker 3>you know this is,</v>

4577
01:56:40.230 --> 01:56:41.950
<v Speaker 3>you don't think of nine shitty wives.</v>

4578
01:56:41.970 --> 01:56:42.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4579
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:44.280
<v Speaker 3>you don't think of nine horrible wives,</v>

4580
01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.110
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is you could have those wives.</v>

4581
01:56:46.111 --> 01:56:48.150
<v Speaker 3>You just can't have them legally let you.</v>

4582
01:56:48.151 --> 01:56:49.770
<v Speaker 3>They can't be legally your wife,</v>

4583
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:53.580
<v Speaker 3>but you could do like a whole like roots jump over the broom.</v>

4584
01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:54.420
<v Speaker 3>You know you could,</v>

4585
01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:55.160
<v Speaker 3>you could.</v>

4586
01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:57.600
<v Speaker 3>You can make your own ceremony.</v>

4587
01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:59.970
<v Speaker 3>Of course he just can't register in the courthouse,</v>

4588
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.650
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious to me.</v>

4589
01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Like who the fuck are you to tell someone that can,</v>

4590
01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:04.250
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

4591
01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:06.120
<v Speaker 3>How about a woman that has five husbands?</v>

4592
01:57:06.121 --> 01:57:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Can we do that?</v>

4593
01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:07.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4594

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Power.</v>

4596
01:57:09.330 --> 01:57:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Power for ground for it.</v>

4597
01:57:10.561 --> 01:57:11.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm for polygamy.</v>

4598
01:57:11.370 --> 01:57:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

4599
01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I want to come out short on this show.</v>

4600
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:14.850
<v Speaker 3>Five cucs and one woman.</v>

4601
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.591
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

4602
01:57:15.591 --> 01:57:18.960
<v Speaker 3>I'll sit around stroking their half our dicks waiting their turn crying.</v>

4603
01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

4604
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:23.760
<v Speaker 3>That is a perfect representation of 2019 America.</v>

4605
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Who would vote that out?</v>

4606
01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Who would say no to sick people?</v>

4607
01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Someone was a communist.</v>

4608
01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:30.840
<v Speaker 3>We need more people getting the youtube pedophile cults out.</v>

4609
01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4610
01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:32.530
<v Speaker 3>And putting the polygamous sin.</v>

4611
01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:33.840
<v Speaker 3>We need priorities.</v>

4612
01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:38.930
<v Speaker 3>I feel like if you want to marry a guy with 18 year friends who gives a shit.</v>

4613
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4614
01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 3>I guess the problem is the divorce.</v>

4615
01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:43.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4616
01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the issue of money for you?</v>

4617
01:57:45.271 --> 01:57:46.104
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

4618
01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:47.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm splitting it up 18 ways.</v>

4619
01:57:47.881 --> 01:57:48.750
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get a lot,</v>

4620
01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:49.021
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4621
01:57:49.021 --> 01:57:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Anyone with 18 of anything?</v>

4622
01:57:50.491 --> 01:57:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're like assaulting,</v>

4623
01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you probably don't have a ton anyway.</v>

4624
01:57:53.070 --> 01:57:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Unless you Jeff Bezos.</v>

4625
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4626
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:56.640
<v Speaker 3>Well that was a kid.</v>

4627
01:57:56.730 --> 01:57:59.370
<v Speaker 3>He could marry a hundred chicks and give them all a billion.</v>

4628
01:57:59.410 --> 01:57:59.721
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>

01:57:59.721 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 3>How sill that 50 leftover.</v>

4630
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:02.580
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

4631
01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:02.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

01:58:02.761 --> 01:58:03.594
<v Speaker 3>he's doing good.</v>

4633
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:04.703
<v Speaker 3>He's doing good.</v>

4634
01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.360
<v Speaker 3>But that whole thing with him,</v>

4635
01:58:06.630 --> 01:58:07.830
<v Speaker 3>that was an interesting thing.</v>

4636
01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:08.670
<v Speaker 3>The uh,</v>

4637
01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:11.940
<v Speaker 3>the pictures being leaked and it turns out it's the brother that leaked the</v>

4638
01:58:11.941 --> 01:58:12.660
<v Speaker 3>pictures.</v>

4639
01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:14.010
<v Speaker 3>I love the brother immediately.</v>

4640
01:58:14.011 --> 01:58:15.120
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I read the article,</v>

4641
01:58:15.150 --> 01:58:15.571
<v Speaker 3>because I'm like,</v>

4642
01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:16.820
<v Speaker 3>this is Trump supporter.</v>

4643
01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Not only is your Trump supporter,</v>

4644
01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:21.990
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy who tried to leverage himself forever and he found out his history</v>

4645
01:58:21.991 --> 01:58:22.980
<v Speaker 3>was fucking Jeff Bezos.</v>

4646
01:58:23.010 --> 01:58:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine the night he found that out?</v>

4647
01:58:25.230 --> 01:58:26.340
<v Speaker 3>The night he found that out.</v>

4648
01:58:26.341 --> 01:58:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Where was he?</v>

4649
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:28.650
<v Speaker 3>What was he doing?</v>

4650
01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:30.870
<v Speaker 3>He was somewhere thinking,</v>

4651
01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:31.853
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

4652
01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:33.181
<v Speaker 3>She's fucked.</v>

4653
01:58:33.181 --> 01:58:35.670
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people that are good now.</v>

4654
01:58:35.671 --> 01:58:36.810
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking basis now.</v>

4655
01:58:36.810 --> 01:58:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Some cash in now it's time to think of something good.</v>

4656
01:58:39.241 --> 01:58:40.074
<v Speaker 3>How do we do it?</v>

4657
01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:41.590
<v Speaker 3>This is a plot guy.</v>

4658
01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:42.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4659
01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what the enquirer gave him.</v>

4660
01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:46.630
<v Speaker 3>How much money you get for something like that?</v>

4661
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Half a mil.</v>

4662
01:58:47.650 --> 01:58:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Bayzos Dick.</v>

4663
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:49.420
<v Speaker 3>I want more.</v>

4664
01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I want a solid mill.</v>

4665
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.401
<v Speaker 3>Solid male.</v>

4666
01:58:51.401 --> 01:58:52.630
<v Speaker 3>You think your life,</v>

4667
01:58:52.631 --> 01:58:53.464
<v Speaker 3>he's going to kill you.</v>

4668
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:54.633
<v Speaker 3>You think he will?</v>

4669
01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:55.751
<v Speaker 3>If he doesn't,</v>

4670
01:58:55.751 --> 01:58:56.531
<v Speaker 3>I'll be disappointed.</v>

4671
01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:57.364
<v Speaker 3>It's a good point.</v>

4672
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Make it look like an accident.</v>

4673
01:58:58.601 --> 01:58:59.470
<v Speaker 3>If you're a fucking,</v>

4674
01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:00.723
<v Speaker 3>you know</v>

01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:04.630
<v Speaker 3>he's like daddy Warbucks.</v>

4677
01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4678
01:59:05.110 --> 01:59:05.860
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy.</v>

4679
01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:06.693
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy.</v>

4680
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:08.290
<v Speaker 3>He's got a hundred automated,</v>

4681
01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:13.420
<v Speaker 3>automated everything and Amazon's like notoriously like he's an alien.</v>

4682
01:59:13.421 --> 01:59:15.100
<v Speaker 3>He looks like he's artificial intelligence.</v>

4683
01:59:15.101 --> 01:59:15.790
<v Speaker 3>He's Ai.</v>

4684

4686
01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:19.480
<v Speaker 3>He's super smart and he's going to play it real slow.</v>

4687
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4691
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he already has.</v>

4721
02:00:08.231 --> 02:00:08.561
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>

4722
02:00:08.561 --> 02:00:09.760
<v Speaker 3>in it was millions.</v>

4723
02:00:09.761 --> 02:00:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't think it was billions,</v>

4724
02:00:10.631 --> 02:00:11.800
<v Speaker 3>but in our time it's about,</v>

4725
02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.240
<v Speaker 3>it's the over 300 million.</v>

4726
02:00:13.241 --> 02:00:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Both of them.</v>

4727
02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:15.740
<v Speaker 3>These were the first generation of B,</v>

4728
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:16.750
<v Speaker 3>B.</v>

4729
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:17.080
<v Speaker 3>B.</v>

4730
02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:19.060
<v Speaker 3>This was the first generation of Robert Bat.</v>

4731
02:00:19.061 --> 02:00:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Like the first generation of entrepreneurs,</v>

4732
02:00:21.670 --> 02:00:21.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4733
02:00:21.911 --> 02:00:22.960
<v Speaker 3>the country was new,</v>

4734
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:25.780
<v Speaker 3>all of these industries would just emerging and these guys took it over.</v>

4735
02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Bayzos tech is,</v>

4736
02:00:28.271 --> 02:00:28.811
<v Speaker 3>and somebody said,</v>

4737
02:00:28.811 --> 02:00:29.770
<v Speaker 3>it's on my podcast recently.</v>

4738
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Tech is the closest thing we have now to that where you have these,</v>

4739
02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:34.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4740
02:00:34.630 --> 02:00:37.360
<v Speaker 3>masters of the universe that are going to be,</v>

4741
02:00:37.361 --> 02:00:38.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean those guys would be,</v>

4742
02:00:38.351 --> 02:00:40.030
<v Speaker 3>JP Morgan was like bailing the government out.</v>

4743
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:42.220
<v Speaker 3>These guys had an insane amount of power.</v>

4744
02:00:42.610 --> 02:00:43.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4745
02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:44.013
<v Speaker 3>they what's really,</v>

4746
02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:45.310
<v Speaker 3>really interesting figures.</v>

4747
02:00:45.311 --> 02:00:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4748
02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

4749
02:00:46.210 --> 02:00:47.350
<v Speaker 3>when I told you I was doing this,</v>

4750
02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:52.090
<v Speaker 3>chariots of the gods lunch today with a bunch of very influential people and one</v>

4751
02:00:52.091 --> 02:00:52.661
<v Speaker 3>of them said,</v>

4752
02:00:52.661 --> 02:00:57.661
<v Speaker 3>it's really ironic that apple used to be think different and that was the whole</v>

4753
02:00:57.671 --> 02:00:59.890
<v Speaker 3>thing about silicon valley.</v>

4754
02:00:59.891 --> 02:01:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Think different now.</v>

4755
02:01:01.121 --> 02:01:03.700
<v Speaker 3>It's don't think different right now.</v>

4756
02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Now let's streamline everybody into one acceptable thing.</v>

4757
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:06.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4758
02:01:06.941 --> 02:01:11.770
<v Speaker 3>Now it's literally you have to think the way everyone else is thinking.</v>

4759
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:13.720
<v Speaker 3>You have to believe what everyone else believes,</v>

4760
02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:15.130
<v Speaker 3>even if it's ridiculous.</v>

4761
02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:17.950
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of that is they want to just make money and sell things and they</v>

4762
02:01:17.951 --> 02:01:19.210
<v Speaker 3>don't want any discord.</v>

4763
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:20.440
<v Speaker 3>They just want to sell,</v>

4764
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:21.250
<v Speaker 3>make money,</v>

4765
02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:22.001
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

4766
02:01:22.001 --> 02:01:23.070
<v Speaker 3>But it seems like,</v>

4767
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:24.071
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

4768
02:01:24.071 --> 02:01:26.930
<v Speaker 3>cause they don't band people after they do the things they banned him after</v>

4769
02:01:26.931 --> 02:01:28.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a public outcry.</v>

4770
02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:29.500
<v Speaker 3>So to me they're not,</v>

4771
02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:31.240
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any real values.</v>

4772
02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Their values are tangible and the values are influenced by public opinion and</v>

4773
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:37.240
<v Speaker 3>where media is.</v>

4774
02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 3>The values aren't like when somebody says</v>

4775
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

4776
02:01:40.610 --> 02:01:42.590
<v Speaker 2>let's ban him right now this goes against our thing.</v>

4777
02:01:42.710 --> 02:01:46.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is if you wait until there's enough dust kicked up,</v>

4778
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:47.600
<v Speaker 2>then they will ban somebody.</v>

4779
02:01:47.650 --> 02:01:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4780
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:49.010
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

4781
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:49.843
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>

4782
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I get in arguments with friends when they were like their ideological,</v>

4783
02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm like they have an ideological bent certainly,</v>

4784
02:01:55.190 --> 02:01:59.300
<v Speaker 2>but their profit seeking enterprises that just want everyone to be happy.</v>

4785
02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I think if it was up to Twitter,</v>

4786
02:02:00.621 --> 02:02:02.600
<v Speaker 2>every tweet would be some type of branded ad.</v>

4787
02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:04.130
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that,</v>

4788
02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:09.160
<v Speaker 2>now the ideology is skewing and leaning in that direction in terms of like tech</v>

4789
02:02:09.801 --> 02:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>and sure,</v>

4790
02:02:10.731 --> 02:02:11.690
<v Speaker 2>there's money in that.</v>

4791
02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:15.590
<v Speaker 2>There's money in holding that line and those guys are the ones that are as</v>

4792
02:02:15.591 --> 02:02:19.300
<v Speaker 2>powerful as Rockefeller and Carnegie and JP.</v>

4793
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Like all of those guys,</v>

4794
02:02:20.451 --> 02:02:24.800
<v Speaker 2>they are the next generation of people who will,</v>

4795
02:02:24.801 --> 02:02:28.170
<v Speaker 2>their amount of powers is unmatched anywhere in society they're,</v>

4796
02:02:28.171 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 2>they're getting,</v>

4797
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:30.890
<v Speaker 2>they're branching out more and more.</v>

4798
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Like the Amazon is now going to have a,</v>

4799
02:02:32.491 --> 02:02:33.590
<v Speaker 2>an electric car.</v>

4800
02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.540
<v Speaker 2>They're investing in that new,</v>

4801
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:36.351
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>

4802
02:02:36.351 --> 02:02:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Rivan ravion some new electric car company that's that uh,</v>

4803
02:02:41.090 --> 02:02:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Bayzos is investing in.</v>

4804
02:02:42.411 --> 02:02:44.420
<v Speaker 2>They're investing in space travel.</v>

4805
02:02:44.421 --> 02:02:45.740
<v Speaker 2>They're investing in all these different,</v>

4806
02:02:45.741 --> 02:02:45.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4807
02:02:45.921 --> 02:02:49.730
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to get poorer and more and more rich.</v>

4808
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:50.241
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4809
02:02:50.241 --> 02:02:51.530
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna take over everything.</v>

4810
02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:51.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4811
02:02:51.861 --> 02:02:52.870
<v Speaker 2>these luck we have,</v>

4812
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:53.900
<v Speaker 2>you cannot doubt,</v>

4813
02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:56.120
<v Speaker 2>you can't opt out of these systems.</v>

4814
02:02:56.150 --> 02:02:58.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to be involved to live a normal life.</v>

4815
02:02:59.090 --> 02:03:00.200
<v Speaker 2>You have to be online.</v>

4816
02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Did you see how someone tried to use to go online,</v>

4817
02:03:05.451 --> 02:03:07.010
<v Speaker 2>live their life without Google?</v>

4818
02:03:07.011 --> 02:03:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Amazon,</v>

4819
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.511
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

4820
02:03:08.511 --> 02:03:09.470
<v Speaker 2>A few other things.</v>

4821
02:03:09.471 --> 02:03:11.300
<v Speaker 2>And apple and they said they couldn't do it.</v>

4822
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Now are you should fear is the only one who can do it with a flip phone.</v>

4823
02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 2>He's barely doing it.</v>

4824
02:03:14.811 --> 02:03:17.720
<v Speaker 2>He's on his iPad using his friend I messages.</v>

4825
02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>He messages me all the time,</v>

4826
02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:22.250
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>

4827
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:23.323
<v Speaker 2>pretend these.</v>

4828
02:03:23.490 --> 02:03:24.620
<v Speaker 2>But I think I give them that.</v>

4829
02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:26.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm impressed that he still has a flip phone.</v>

4830
02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.673
<v Speaker 2>Well he,</v>

4831
02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.140
<v Speaker 2>he knows that he's an addict,</v>

4832
02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4833
02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:33.050
<v Speaker 2>he knows and he's an honest man,</v>

4834
02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:33.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4835
02:03:33.891 --> 02:03:34.341
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

4836
02:03:34.341 --> 02:03:35.180
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

4837
02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:36.560
<v Speaker 2>this is just too much of my life.</v>

4838
02:03:36.561 --> 02:03:37.100
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>

4839
02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:39.230
<v Speaker 2>He'd be checking social media constantly and,</v>

4840
02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:40.400
<v Speaker 2>and also if you're,</v>

4841
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4842
02:03:40.851 --> 02:03:42.260
<v Speaker 2>your controversial like he is,</v>

4843
02:03:42.261 --> 02:03:44.690
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are talking shit to him and that would hurt his feelings and</v>

4844
02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:45.830
<v Speaker 2>saying mean things to him.</v>

4845
02:03:45.831 --> 02:03:49.220
<v Speaker 2>And social media has gotten to the point where I'm on it all day and I'm like,</v>

4846
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not having any fun.</v>

4847
02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:50.990
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4848
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:52.400
<v Speaker 2>It's really gotten to the point where,</v>

4849
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:53.690
<v Speaker 2>what does this experience,</v>

4850
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Facebook is a nightmare.</v>

4851
02:03:55.731 --> 02:03:57.380
<v Speaker 2>It's elderly people screaming at each other.</v>

4852
02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:00.740
<v Speaker 2>This was a website where kids were trying to get laid in college.</v>

4853
02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:03.650
<v Speaker 2>This is elderly people screaming and complaining.</v>

4854
02:04:03.651 --> 02:04:06.740
<v Speaker 2>They can't afford knee operations and I'm just going like this all day.</v>

4855
02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4856
02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:08.510
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4857
02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:09.290
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

4858
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:10.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't get a lot of bang for your buck.</v>

4859
02:04:11.300 --> 02:04:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I've dropped off radically over the last six months.</v>

4860
02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.480
<v Speaker 2>The last six months I've made a giant giant shift away from a reading things and</v>

02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:27.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4866
02:04:27.311 --> 02:04:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm more engaged.</v>

4867
02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm too fucking busy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And so what I'm trying to figure out ways to better optimize my time.</v>

4870
02:04:32.811 --> 02:04:33.760
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the first ones.</v>

4871
02:04:33.761 --> 02:04:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Stopped reading comments,</v>

4872
02:04:34.671 --> 02:04:35.840
<v Speaker 2>stop reading posts,</v>

4873
02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:40.800
<v Speaker 2>don't just it mindlessly c shift through Instagram pictures,</v>

4874
02:04:40.801 --> 02:04:42.690
<v Speaker 2>looking for something that strikes me as interesting.</v>

4875
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I just stopped doing that and it made a big difference in my productivity.</v>

4876
02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4877
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:47.720
<v Speaker 2>huge difference.</v>

4878
02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4879
02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know when the,</v>

4880
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:51.600
<v Speaker 2>when I phone real recently they started putting that thing on your phone.</v>

4881
02:04:51.601 --> 02:04:53.730
<v Speaker 2>We see how much screen time you had.</v>

4882
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:54.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4883
02:04:54.101 --> 02:04:54.720
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

4884
02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:55.411
<v Speaker 2>You look at it,</v>

4885
02:04:55.411 --> 02:04:55.621
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4886
02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:55.801
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

4887
02:04:55.801 --> 02:04:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Five hours?</v>

4888
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I now is 46 minutes.</v>

4889
02:04:58.191 --> 02:04:59.610
<v Speaker 2>That's five hours of nothing.</v>

4890
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4891
02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:00.600
<v Speaker 2>What did I do?</v>

4892
02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I get a little out of it.</v>

4893
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4894
02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll go find new stories that can talk about,</v>

4895
02:05:04.801 --> 02:05:06.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's like finding,</v>

4896
02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I found that like finding the perfect blend seems to be letting the stories get</v>

4897
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 2>so big that they get to you anyway.</v>

4898
02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:14.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4899
02:05:14.490 --> 02:05:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I've got the fringe stories to like the Jesse Small age.</v>

4900
02:05:17.490 --> 02:05:19.500
<v Speaker 2>It gets so big you can't hear about it.</v>

4901
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4902
02:05:19.890 --> 02:05:20.491
<v Speaker 2>And then you hear,</v>

4903
02:05:20.491 --> 02:05:25.290
<v Speaker 2>and I love the day that the day when we all found out it was social media is</v>

4904
02:05:25.291 --> 02:05:28.710
<v Speaker 2>great today that we all found out he was full of shit because then anyone could</v>

4905
02:05:28.711 --> 02:05:29.544
<v Speaker 2>make jokes.</v>

4906
02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:30.810
<v Speaker 2>But the three days before that,</v>

4907
02:05:30.811 --> 02:05:31.710
<v Speaker 2>everyone is posturing.</v>

4908
02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4909
02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:33.600
<v Speaker 2>so thought out.</v>

4910
02:05:33.601 --> 02:05:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4911
02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:35.820
<v Speaker 2>But then when it came out that it was all bullshit,</v>

4912
02:05:35.821 --> 02:05:36.630
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>

4913
02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:36.781
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4914
02:05:36.781 --> 02:05:37.950
<v Speaker 2>let's just have fun.</v>

4915
02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:39.420
<v Speaker 2>And even though it's,</v>

4916
02:05:39.930 --> 02:05:40.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4917
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that people aren't getting attacked and things aren't bad,</v>

4918
02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:46.470
<v Speaker 2>but this particular thing,</v>

4919
02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:47.130
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4920
02:05:47.130 --> 02:05:48.750
<v Speaker 2>If you can't make a joke about this,</v>

4921
02:05:48.930 --> 02:05:50.310
<v Speaker 2>what can you make a joke about?</v>

4922
02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:51.480
<v Speaker 2>If you can't make a Joseph,</v>

4923
02:05:51.630 --> 02:05:53.730
<v Speaker 2>if you think someone shouldn't joke about this,</v>

4924
02:05:53.731 --> 02:05:54.450
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4931
02:05:57.421 --> 02:06:00.510
<v Speaker 2>This is one of those things that it's fucking ridiculous.</v>

4932
02:06:00.511 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>

4933
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Holding the subway with the fucking news.</v>

4934
02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.180
<v Speaker 2>He pled not guilty in court.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes he did.</v>

4938
02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:07.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4939
02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:08.191

02:06:08.191 --> 02:06:09.420
<v Speaker 2>he pled not guilty on everything.</v>

4941
02:06:09.421 --> 02:06:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4942
02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:10.860
<v Speaker 2>He denied all charges.</v>

4943
02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:12.053
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

4944
02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:14.280
<v Speaker 2>denied all charges.</v>

4945
02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:16.020
<v Speaker 2>He's going to take his own life.</v>

4946
02:06:16.050 --> 02:06:17.190
<v Speaker 2>I believe they have the check.</v>

4947
02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:18.023
<v Speaker 2>He wrote to them.</v>

4948
02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Check 35 hunch.</v>

4949
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:20.971
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

4950
02:06:20.971 --> 02:06:21.990
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a check already.</v>

4951
02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:23.850
<v Speaker 2>$500 in cash.</v>

4952
02:06:24.090 --> 02:06:25.650
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a check that she has.</v>

4953
02:06:25.651 --> 02:06:28.140
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I could get punched in five minutes for free.</v>

4954
02:06:29.610 --> 02:06:31.170
<v Speaker 2>I could get beat up so easily.</v>

4955
02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Why is this guy spending $3,500 well,</v>

4956
02:06:33.301 --> 02:06:33.931
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

4957
02:06:33.931 --> 02:06:35.010
<v Speaker 2>why do you write a check?</v>

4958
02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you have no friends?</v>

4959
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.560
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

4960
02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:40.350
<v Speaker 2>he just didn't think this through even a little bit.</v>

4961
02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4962
02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:42.210
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

4963
02:06:42.330 --> 02:06:43.163
<v Speaker 2>It's disappointing.</v>

4964
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:44.220
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny though.</v>

4965
02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:46.140
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing funnier right now.</v>

4966
02:06:46.230 --> 02:06:46.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4967
02:06:46.561 --> 02:06:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I think this is what we need.</v>

4968
02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:48.511
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4969
02:06:48.511 --> 02:06:52.080
<v Speaker 2>we need to understand the outrage machine a little bit better and one of the</v>

4970
02:06:52.081 --> 02:06:54.570
<v Speaker 2>best ways to see it as see manufactured outrage.</v>

4971
02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:55.121
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

4972
02:06:55.121 --> 02:06:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And then you go,</v>

4973
02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:57.120
<v Speaker 2>oh okay this is a hustle.</v>

4974
02:06:57.150 --> 02:07:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Well the cup and thing was great because people like wishing death on 15 year</v>

4975
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:04.260
<v Speaker 2>old kids and it's like the video comes out exonerates them and then people are</v>

4976
02:07:04.261 --> 02:07:04.890
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4977
02:07:04.890 --> 02:07:05.723
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4978
02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:05.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4979
02:07:05.981 --> 02:07:06.840
<v Speaker 2>people were doubling down.</v>

4980
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:08.960
<v Speaker 2>People like you can't deny what my eyes saw.</v>

4981
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4982
02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:10.140
<v Speaker 2>oh yo nuts.</v>

4983
02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:13.320
<v Speaker 2>And then I was afraid cause I'm like tweeting things that supported the kids.</v>

4984
02:07:13.321 --> 02:07:13.920
<v Speaker 2>But I'm like,</v>

4985
02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:15.030
<v Speaker 2>what if the next video,</v>

4986
02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:19.540
<v Speaker 2>it's just the kids in Klan outfits like this and just dancing around with,</v>

4987
02:07:19.541 --> 02:07:20.950
<v Speaker 2>with torches like Charlottesville.</v>

4988
02:07:20.951 --> 02:07:21.271
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

4989
02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:22.650
<v Speaker 2>well then now I look like an idiot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to tell them.</v>

4993
02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:26.550
<v Speaker 2>You're better off being an observer.</v>

4994
02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:27.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4995
02:07:27.061 --> 02:07:28.860
<v Speaker 2>just split it up into the fray.</v>

02:07:31.741 --> 02:07:32.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like a gang fight.</v>

5000
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:35.070
<v Speaker 2>You better upstairs standing back and going,</v>

5003
02:07:36.281 --> 02:07:36.641
<v Speaker 2>And every,</v>

5005
02:07:37.361 --> 02:07:38.081
<v Speaker 2>every hour.</v>

5006
02:07:38.081 --> 02:07:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Another vantage point of that thing was like,</v>

5007
02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:40.091
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5008
02:07:40.091 --> 02:07:40.271
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5009
02:07:40.271 --> 02:07:41.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe they are guilty.</v>

5010
02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5011
02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:42.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5012
02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:43.241
<v Speaker 2>I saw that thing.</v>

5013
02:07:43.241 --> 02:07:44.500
<v Speaker 2>It was like a white kid.</v>

5014
02:07:44.530 --> 02:07:44.981
<v Speaker 2>I slept,</v>

5015
02:07:44.981 --> 02:07:48.130
<v Speaker 2>they encircled the native American guy who was banging the drum.</v>

5016
02:07:48.131 --> 02:07:48.401
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

5017
02:07:48.401 --> 02:07:49.234
<v Speaker 2>fuck these kids.</v>

5018
02:07:49.810 --> 02:07:50.643
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>

5019
02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:52.030
<v Speaker 2>When you see the first image and you know,</v>

5020
02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:52.661
<v Speaker 2>the first image,</v>

5021
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:53.530
<v Speaker 2>which is even crazier,</v>

5022
02:07:53.531 --> 02:07:55.270
<v Speaker 2>was put up by a troll account.</v>

5023
02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:55.871
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5024
02:07:55.871 --> 02:07:56.704
<v Speaker 2>Russians,</v>

5025
02:07:57.070 --> 02:07:58.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who the fuck it was,</v>

5026
02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 2>what they know all the problems.</v>

5027
02:07:59.981 --> 02:08:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Russian planes that came out of Brazil because I saw something yesterday,</v>

5028
02:08:04.270 --> 02:08:09.270
<v Speaker 2>a few shady social media posts fed a viral firestorm over coving and Catholic.</v>

5029
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:09.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

5030
02:08:09.911 --> 02:08:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Why it will happen again.</v>

5031
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5032
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:12.610
<v Speaker 2>These co the,</v>

5033
02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:14.830
<v Speaker 2>they're doing this on purpose,</v>

5034
02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:15.141
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5035
02:08:15.141 --> 02:08:18.820
<v Speaker 2>they took that screenshot to try to get people angry and it worked.</v>

5036
02:08:19.210 --> 02:08:22.540
<v Speaker 2>And then they Twitter found out that it was a bullshit account and banned the</v>

5037
02:08:22.541 --> 02:08:23.374
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>

5038
02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:25.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's very possible that account was some troll.</v>

5039
02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:26.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

5040
02:08:26.121 --> 02:08:27.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a troll farm.</v>

5041
02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5042
02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5043
02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:29.460
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they'd say.</v>

5044
02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:32.770
<v Speaker 2>We're being manipulated now on a level that is like unbelievable.</v>

5045
02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable,</v>

5046
02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:34.270
