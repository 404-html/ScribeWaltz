00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.820
<v Speaker 1>The other,</v>

3
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>another experience I had,</v>

4
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I've had in recent years,</v>

5
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>it led me to not want to engage in this is,</v>

6
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>is walking around various events in sort of breakout things,</v>

7
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>see people who,</v>

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.750
<v Speaker 1>we need people I've admired in the past all saying things like you,</v>

10
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you see that as you see I flamed x on Twitter.</v>

11
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I do you see what I tweeted about that person?</v>

12
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

13
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I think these used to be serious people and these used to be serious people</v>

14
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:36.801
<v Speaker 1>engaged in serious things and here they are engaged in these full flailing fist</v>

15
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>fights and often,</v>

16
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>often let's face it on things,</v>

17
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>which if you didn't do it like that,</v>

18
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>seeking out the fight are the sort of thing that would allow for normal human</v>

19
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

20
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many disagreements that we have with people in our personal lives all</v>

21
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

22
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>If we wanted to,</v>

23
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>you didn't vote this way that way.</v>

25
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people would mind about that.</v>

26
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:58.261
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

27
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

28
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.051
<v Speaker 1>I know you've,</v>

29
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you think slightly differently from me on this particular issue.</v>

30
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

31
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't say let's have that out now once and for all you,</v>

32
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.441
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

34
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>you find ways to live with,</v>

35
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>with difference and different opinions and you know,</v>

36
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

37
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get everyone exactly in line.</v>

38
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

39
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>we all knew that before the age of social media and now it seems to be the only</v>

40
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:20.304
<v Speaker 1>aim.</v>

41
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that is?</v>

42
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

43
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean think it's what we were discussing earlier,</v>

44
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>that it's idea sport and then you just get caught up and like someone volleyed</v>

45
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>your way and so you have to smash that tennis ball back there where it is.</v>

46
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

47
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

49
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I haven't felt the vicarious pleasure of some of that myself,</v>

50
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>so that old Chinese proverb about sitting by the river,</v>

52
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>watching the bodies of your enemies float by.</v>

53
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.733
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a big sense of that the other day when somebody I deeply disliked came</v>

55
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>across her on social media at the same time as somebody else I deeply dislike</v>

56
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>was being held by the French police on serious charges.</v>

57
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:55.794
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was a,</v>

58
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the Chinese proverb.</v>

59
00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.993
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

60
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

61
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

62
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I can see why people feel it.</v>

63
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

64
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>and of course people who they could never normally get to who they've got to.</v>

66
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

67
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

68
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the big,</v>

69
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.904
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>the big thing of,</v>

71
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.951
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

73
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I poked that.</v>

74
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.013
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

75
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

76
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>they never engage on social media for precisely that reason,</v>

77
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>that reason of my others that you would never,</v>

78
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>I would never want somebody to know they could get to me,</v>

79
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.451
<v Speaker 1>even if they,</v>

80
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>even if you just block them,</v>

81
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>there's many people who take pride even in their heading,</v>

82
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.941
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

83
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I am blocked on Twitter by all these people.</v>

84
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

85
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>and actually I do sometimes read what people say,</v>

86
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.593
<v Speaker 1>send to me.</v>

87
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>and I've never blocked anyone because I sort of think you should mind,</v>

89
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>is that if you put your ideas out there,</v>

90
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be as open as possible to receiving them back.</v>

91
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Some time ago when I got into a vow with,</v>

92
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>with the Turkish president about,</v>

94
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>about something,</v>

95
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I got all these Turkish,</v>

97
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>a sort of accounts sending me stuff.</v>

98
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.881
<v Speaker 1>There was one guy,</v>

99
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>he just repeated these sent me,</v>

100
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>pornography of animals</v>

102
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.850
<v Speaker 1>having sex with,</v>

103
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.141
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know,</v>

104
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

105
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.981
<v Speaker 1>it was very,</v>

106
00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:06.230
<v Speaker 1>it was very hard core and um,</v>

107
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and so I used to go down the feet.</v>

108
00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Now that gun,</v>

109
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even block him actually because I sort of thought,</v>

110
00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:11.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.010
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in Turkey,</v>

112
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.620
<v Speaker 1>he's a really angry man,</v>

113
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.420
<v Speaker 1>desperately finding horse pornography send,</v>

114
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.263
<v Speaker 1>sending to me.</v>

115
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And in a way I felt so sorry for him that that was how his life had Karma,</v>

116
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.071
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

117
00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.630
<v Speaker 1>his life and come to at this stage that I,</v>

118
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even block him.</v>

119
00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And also he'd be like,</v>

120
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm the donkey porn guy who got blocked by dog.</v>

121
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.850
<v Speaker 1>He'd get a certain fame.</v>

122
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that they're just caught up in this sexy thing?</v>

123
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

124
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is sensationalism.</v>

125
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 2>It's also what the public is really focused on right now.</v>

126
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's something that gathers ratings.</v>

127
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I think they're driving it.</v>

128
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's driven from the top down,</v>

129
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>from the establishment media Dow,</v>

130
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 2>from the Democrats down.</v>

131
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Because again,</v>

132
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to regular people,</v>

133
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking hurting,</v>

134
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

135
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>We just have been stagnant since 1980 there's 30 million people that don't have</v>

136
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 2>healthcare in Trump's first year in office,</v>

137
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 2>3 million more people lost healthcare because he did all these executive orders</v>

138
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>that basically took a hatchet to Obamacare.</v>

139
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 2>So you have all these people who are really hurting their,</v>

140
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>they care about their wages.</v>

141
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 2>They care about,</v>

142
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>not being saddled with over a trillion dollars in student loan debt.</v>

144
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 2>This is the shit regular people care about.</v>

145
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>So if when they turn on CNN and they see Russia,</v>

146
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:23.201
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

147
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:24.034
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

148
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't like Trump,</v>

149
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I despise Trump with every fiber of my fucking mean.</v>

150
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.181
<v Speaker 2>But when I see this,</v>

151
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 2>I wrote my fucking eyes and then they have the nerve to say,</v>

152
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.121
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

153
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Trump won't shut up about Russia.</v>

154
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 2>You were talking about her all day and he responded to it and because he</v>

155
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>responds it to it,</v>

156
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:37.871
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

157
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

158
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 2>there he goes again with Russia.</v>

159
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

160
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be interesting to see how this all plays out.</v>

161
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm really fascinated and I'm fascinated to see if he can make it out of four</v>

162
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

163
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Well not only,</v>

164
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 2>well I think he's going to,</v>

165
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 2>do you think he's gonna run my thing?</v>

166
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna run again and he's going to win again.</v>

167
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 2>He has a chance.</v>

168
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 2>He has a fucking chance because the Democrats,</v>

169
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 2>if the Democrats run Kamala Harris,</v>

170
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 2>if they run Cory booker or any of the other corporatists he can win because he's</v>

171
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 2>going to go right back into his tap dance about being a populous and helping</v>

172
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

173
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.261
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

174
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 2>In the first few years of his tax bill,</v>

175
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 2>regular people did get a tax cut.</v>

176
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.191
<v Speaker 2>So he's going to say,</v>

177
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:09.350
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

178
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 2>you look at your tax bill.</v>

179
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I just gave you an extra thousand dollars this year.</v>

180
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:13.624
<v Speaker 2>Who you want to vote for?</v>

181
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 2>And so there is an argument that he's going to make to the people.</v>

182
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.990
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have somebody like Bernie Sanders or Bernie Sanders talking</v>

183
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 2>about the issues that matter to people will then of course he can fucking win</v>

184
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

185
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Listen there,</v>

186
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

187
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I was laughed at when I said,</v>

188
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 2>if it's Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,</v>

189
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.513
<v Speaker 2>he can win.</v>

190
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.353
<v Speaker 2>People laughed at me.</v>

191
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>We have a soft life now.</v>

192
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 2>So there's Gunna be a lot of people that are ridiculous.</v>

193
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.063
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

194
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 2>there's always been those people that are weak willed and they want the world to</v>

195
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 2>be nerved up and of course pad their feelings.</v>

196
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.501
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

197
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have that.</v>

198
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>But there's also more people that have an understanding of like,</v>

199
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 2>that's not a happy,</v>

200
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 2>healthy way to live your life.</v>

201
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that like reality at some point will always supersede nerf</v>

202
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.350
<v Speaker 2>padding.</v>

203
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.731
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

204
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be a push back on that where you go look like,</v>

205
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to offend anybody,</v>

206
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

207
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 2>and I do agree that like there's a movement by the left that really does push,</v>

209
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

211
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.861
<v Speaker 2>I did a thing,</v>

212
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

213
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this a charity event,</v>

214
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.673

220
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.950

221
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 2>He's a really funny comic black dude and we went to meet with the guys for this</v>

222
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 2>charity and they were telling us that,</v>

223
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:34.064
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like any charity event,</v>

227
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

228
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 2>An auctioneer comes out and they all try to auction off and raise a lot of money</v>

229
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 2>from rich people to help the program.</v>

230
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a very basically 99.9% of every charity event I've ever been involved.</v>

231
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 2>This has an auction segment in the dinner.</v>

232
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.953
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

233
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we're going to have that,</v>

235
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 2>but we can't use the word auction.</v>

236
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.381

<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you can't use the word auction?</v>

239
00:06:56.671 --> 00:06:57.504
<v Speaker 2>Don't like,</v>

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like kids head office six flood.</v>

246
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.550

252
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

253
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>but aren't you hiring a guy from Southerby's?</v>

254
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.293

256
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to pretend that's not what he's called.</v>

257
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.491
<v Speaker 2>And they were just like,</v>

265
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.513

266
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.570

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
