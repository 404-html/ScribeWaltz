<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were man,</v>

21
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>our little home base up there.</v>

22
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking hoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

23
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a work on everything there and</v>

24
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>then venture forth right spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've driven that,</v>

25
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just got this big quandary now,</v>

26
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>whether it even do another special or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it would do for me and you know,</v>

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Netflix is offering me money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not offering me be,</v>

28
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge money.</v>

29
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>They're offering me regular money trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out if you want to.</v>

30
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it takes me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like some comics.</v>

32
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Some comics will spit out of our year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

33
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I did takes me three years to write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new record,</v>

35
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good,</v>

36
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

37
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>But it takes me forever to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just not that prolific.</v>

38
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the big debate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>

39
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Like how much time should you wait?</v>

40
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>papa and I were just talking about it </v>

41
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.791
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked about with burn with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis Ck and a bunch of different guys </v>

42
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>and lily's doing like one a year for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

43
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:43.281
<v Speaker 1>But he stopped doing that and I think he</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of agrees now that when you do one </v>

44
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like,</v>

45
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a special full of like a adolescent</v>

46
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>premises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

47
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've always found it.</v>

48
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>My stuff ripens well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>on the vine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I leave it there,</v>

50
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Speaker 1>if I pick it too early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>used to do a bit that was on my last </v>
<v Speaker 1>album and the punchline is not even on </v>

52
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>the album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The punchline I wrote later,</v>

53
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:09.261
<v Speaker 1>which was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about my wife buy me a bicycle </v>

54
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>thing and I might ride it for health </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and it is for sale and if you're</v>

55
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>looking for a bicycle is a great deal.</v>

56
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It's got 750 yards on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a demo when I bought it at 350 </v>

57
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.381
<v Speaker 1>yards already on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I put the other 400 yards on it </v>

58
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:21.381
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole joke.</v>

59
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the punchline and if you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to buy the bicycle,</v>

60
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>just go to my house in Beverly Hills and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 400 yards from there.</v>

61
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.190
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't even have the punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know what I thought was </v>

62
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.190
<v Speaker 1>funny about the other part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I went back and listened to it,</v>

63
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.991
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could start doing that bit again </v>

64
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:38.991
<v Speaker 1>because they still don't know how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

65
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>If I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitch Hedberg did that.</v>

66
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>He had a bit on his album and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a bit from my old album,</v>

67
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>and he does a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

68
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>this is the part I left out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the punchline.</v>

69
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.110
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

70
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

71
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:58.761
<v Speaker 1>development of material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're the only one who really </v>

73
00:02:58.761 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>knows when it's done and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have something.</v>

74
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I've had bits that I didn't put it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>specials that I was doing.</v>

75
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing is not just,</v>

76
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe two specials later,</v>

77
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll stick it in somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>

79
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Netflix wants an hour.</v>

80
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that fluke spatial should</v>

81
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>be 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

82
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I really do because I would do a 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute special and that and that burnout</v>

83
00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>in our material on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

84
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go back,</v>

86
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I want shoes the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was great.</v>

87
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

88
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I watched the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali wongs special and it was just long,</v>

90
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just long an hour's a long time,</v>

91
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.951
<v Speaker 1>special and that as much as I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressed by Allie and I still am </v>

94
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.230
<v Speaker 1>impressed by Allie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.270
<v Speaker 1>but I've been impressed with what I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the club when I go back and watch </v>

96
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.270
<v Speaker 1>your special.</v>

97
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I see what kind of confidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader,</v>

98
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that success of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made her a better comic.</v>

99
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she now she really has a great,</v>

100
00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be even better presence on stage and </v>

102
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.890
<v Speaker 1>works even slower and more commanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can,</v>

103
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I learned from watching it </v>

104
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.010
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.691
<v Speaker 1>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of success makes you better </v>

106
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:12.691
<v Speaker 1>for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

107
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>she sort of emerging right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's one of those people that,</v>

108
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people started to talk about.</v>

109
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>She's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>

110
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 1>She's really cool to really nice person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just nasty and funny on stage </v>

111
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>is vicious and I don't know her because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got a kid so soon as she gets off </v>

112
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out of there.</v>

113
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to her on stage a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times when she was bringing me.</v>

114
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

115
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah man.</v>

116
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>like an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good hour special,</v>

117
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe just don't want to have cheap.</v>

118
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>It's don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do the work,</v>

119
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so daunting to put it.</v>

120
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:51.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my last bedroom was an hour and 20 </v>

121
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:51.061
<v Speaker 1>minutes and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just,</v>

122
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.640
<v Speaker 1>cause that's how long it was and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

123
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>when I sold it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

124
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:58.981
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go ahead and let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know as I worked like that you can </v>

125
00:04:58.981 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>have the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm standing there naked,</v>

126
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could've gotten away with 48 minutes.</v>

127
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>because it was on television and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw it on tv because it was on cmt.</v>

129
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants his fucking cmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nobody's even heard the last album.</v>

130
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And I don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>country music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

132
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that real popular was called </v>
<v Speaker 1>country music television anymore.</v>

133
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.970
<v Speaker 1>They just call it cmt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.690
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

135
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it still stands for country </v>

136
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.481
<v Speaker 1>music television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to do a bunch of </v>

137
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:27.481
<v Speaker 1>other shit now too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

138
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:27.481
<v Speaker 1>They try to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:28.280
<v Speaker 1>they did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

140
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I had a special with them once a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would do then I would just have to</v>

141
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 1>come up with 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

142
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>which was doable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that,</v>

144
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>that I could actually put on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it you shouldn't even put on TV.</v>

145
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.220
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was great.</v>

146
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>It was a salute to the troops thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise money and awareness for good </v>

147
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.980
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they quit doing it and uh,</v>

148
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.710
<v Speaker 1>somehow bought my special and a put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

149
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.630
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>if I do a bit from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kills.</v>

152
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody's heard it.</v>

153
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 1>So I really don't think anybody really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt it.</v>

154
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Only sold 12 copies of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that.</v>

156
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:09.521
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea how many we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that before the show about like </v>

157
00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>buying things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nobody buys comedy albums anymore.</v>

158
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't make any money,</v>

159
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like none.</v>

160
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

161
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I just started watching stuff on Netflix</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day because I just wanted to </v>

162
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.871
<v Speaker 1>watch some of the specials at some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people I knew up there to see what </v>

163
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:25.871
<v Speaker 1>they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:25.960
<v Speaker 1>what they're working on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

165
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

166
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>now why would you buy a fucking record?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just flip it over to Netflix and</v>

167
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like listening to shit in my car.</v>

168
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I like when people release things on </v>
<v Speaker 1>itunes.</v>

169
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.580
<v Speaker 1>He had did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

170
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:37.240
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

171
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my best.</v>

172
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:43.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedy album store story and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't mean this to be mean or anything </v>

173
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

174
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a,</v>

175
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the record sales because my records were</v>

176
00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:54.651
<v Speaker 1>selling and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Dane Cook comes in and he just </v>

177
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:55.560
<v Speaker 1>blows by me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is this guy?</v>

178
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm an la guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a road guy,</v>

179
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what's going on out here,</v>

180
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:03.700
<v Speaker 1>nor do we give a shit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought well it must be.</v>

181
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>So I was at a bookstore and I saw it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

182
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>well I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to buy it and see what,</v>

183
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.040
<v Speaker 1>see what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So literally I'll listen to it on the </v>

184
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.040
<v Speaker 1>way home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I got home I pulled it out,</v>

185
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 1>throw it in the trash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not not to be mean,</v>

186
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>but just because I don't keep things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't use,</v>

187
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>but I knew I wouldn't listen to it again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wasn't going to give it to </v>

188
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>somebody else to listen to.</v>

189
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't need it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

190
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 1>it we've run our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 1>run our thing and not to say anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad about Dang because that been plenty </v>

192
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>of bad things have been said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

193
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but I just went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so unintuitive that I'm like,</v>

194
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.200
<v Speaker 1>if that's what they're doing out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're getting away with murder </v>

195
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>because that was our punchlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to tell you,</v>

196
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 1>that was a weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He locked into some weird thing where he</v>

197
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:52.420
<v Speaker 1>sort of appealed to young girls like he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did comedy girls.</v>

198
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

199
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>that's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not me either.</v>

200
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

201
00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:01.841
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us leg had fascinating stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence too and you know,</v>

202
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.380
<v Speaker 1>just really walk on stage and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>command of anything,</v>

203
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he can still do it,</v>

204
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 1>but at one time I'd watch him and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

205
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you're lacking or not.</v>

206
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 1>If you're a comic you could probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn something from watching him.</v>

207
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>It was a young comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>just walk up there and start doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stare him down.</v>

209
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't be timid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>when he was a great stage presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the content I was like,</v>

211
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

212
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't get it.</v>

213
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

214
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>and now it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's turned around on him.</v>

215
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

216
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Well it turned around on him when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole Louis ck plagiarism thing came out</v>

217
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to have sold something.</v>

218
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Stole something from Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

219
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

220
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.220
<v Speaker 1>before Louis was famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

221
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's when it's easy.</v>

222
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

223
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Lilly was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

224
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>They're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lose wasn't young.</v>

225
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 1>He was older than him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lilly,</v>

226
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>he made it first.</v>

227
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.110
<v Speaker 1>He broke through first and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became a giant controversy.</v>

228
00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Like Louis could even addressed it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his television show.</v>

229
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Like he had Dane on as a guest on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and they kind of went over it.</v>

230
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 1>It was very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Louis,</v>

231
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 1>he's so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way he handled it was so nice.</v>

232
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Like he wasn't mean about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

233
00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 1>They not like you as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a difference there.</v>

234
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:28.131
<v Speaker 1>Was this the best thing ever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was that where you had every comic </v>

235
00:09:28.131 --> 00:09:28.250
<v Speaker 1>in the country just cheering her fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>

241
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 1>That was the worst I've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

242
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I've seen.</v>

243
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I've seen plagiarist before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen guys get away with stealing </v>

244
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 1>people's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've never seen someone that </v>

245
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 1>blatant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a bully about it.</v>

246
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.961
<v Speaker 1>Like he would do your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go on in front of you and do </v>

247
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:56.451
<v Speaker 1>your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he would bring you up at the store </v>

248
00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 1>into your closing bit before we brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up,</v>

249
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

250
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of those things like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>serial killer wants to get caught.</v>

251
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's what it is.</v>

252
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

253
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

254
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

256
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that matters to me really</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

257
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the thing I'm most proud of is that </v>

258
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm respected by my peers that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get here in some fucking cheap way.</v>

259
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I did my fucking 30 years and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mad million clubs and 12,000</v>

260
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:24.390
<v Speaker 1>shows and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I didn't have that,</v>

261
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'd be able to show my </v>
<v Speaker 1>face around here.</v>

262
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all there is.</v>

263
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for people like us,</v>

264
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the most important thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's so few of us.</v>

265
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:40.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a thousand working comedians </v>

266
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:40.101
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even a thousand?</v>

267
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might not even be a thousand.</v>

268
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tiny,</v>

269
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 1>tiny subculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiny and none of that subculture.</v>

270
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 300 of them I want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.630

<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

272
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.410

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

273
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:56.070

282
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.941
<v Speaker 1>drank it with you and then I'd been out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I had to go get that range rover </v>

<v Speaker 1>Tequila.</v>

285
00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that you sell your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tequila.</v>

288
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.761
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't sell it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we just passed her up because we </v>

<v Speaker 1>couldn't buy it.</v>

351
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to venture forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the weird sections,</v>

352
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in a video store back in </v>

353
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.181
<v Speaker 1>the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to go through those beads </v>

354
00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:53.090
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember though it was a saloon </v>

355
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.090
<v Speaker 1>doors or beads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

356
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:57.511
<v Speaker 1>We had to go into the section of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video store that had the porn and you </v>

357
00:13:57.511 --> 00:13:57.990
<v Speaker 1>always felt so full of shame when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were wandering.</v>

358
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Affordable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a horrible man.</v>

359
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does this but me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now you know,</v>

360
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.730
<v Speaker 1>but at least back then no one had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone with a camera.</v>

361
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>So you couldn't like take a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

362
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching Ron white go to the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty section.</v>

363
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.710
<v Speaker 1>What I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's looking at the gag stuff.</v>

364
00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:18.140
<v Speaker 1>He likes people to gag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

365
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing now it's like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go to any one of those websites and </v>

366
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>have the porn on it and you can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep scrolling like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>worry about seeing something I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see,</v>

373
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a raging heterosexual and I,</v>

374
00:14:39.691 --> 00:14:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I tried one time I was in a hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had gay porn,</v>

375
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.850
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to have watched them gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn.</v>

376
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.140
<v Speaker 1>See if it does anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click nothing.</v>

377
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Not a damn thing.</v>

380
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.810

<v Speaker 1>but I've come close a gang of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've dodged the bullet.</v>

412
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had to dodge the bullet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tongue is a tongue and a tooth is the </v>

415
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:47.651
<v Speaker 1>tooth because you can't tell man man </v>
<v Speaker 1>from woman mouth.</v>

416
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Now if it would have been a hand job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been going,</v>

417

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

421
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:01.721

<v Speaker 1>has a deck probably knows how to work </v>

<v Speaker 1>But what's worse than that?</v>

467
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I wonder nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems a little exaggerating.</v>

468
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember playing Red Rover,</v>

469
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relax,</v>

470
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 1>holding our national defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It weren't even at Warren 75.</v>

471
00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't the tail end of the Vietnam War.</v>

472
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

473
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Did you join or did you get drafted now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no draft.</v>

474
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:23.550
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father drafted me.</v>

475
00:19:23.551 --> 00:19:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked out of high school and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they weren't going to put me back in</v>

476
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:30.340
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was 17.</v>

477
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I kind of had my life mapped out because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that worked washing dishes at this,</v>

478
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:39.900
<v Speaker 1>a huge restaurant called Lynchburg </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossing in a close to Pasadena,</v>

479
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Texas and right on the channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic place,</v>

480
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:48.351
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable and served family style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of seafood and chicken and </v>

481
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:48.351
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

482
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It was really popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have,</v>

483
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 1>they didn't go hire people to wash </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishes.</v>

484
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:58.941
<v Speaker 1>They would go buy all these drunks out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of jail and they had bunk houses in the </v>

485
00:19:58.941 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 1>back and the dishwashers asleep back </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

486
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 1>They'd drink all the half drinks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came back and crash there.</v>

487
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:06.810
<v Speaker 1>So I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 17 years old I was thinking,</v>

488
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:08.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

489
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm 17,</v>

490
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I joined the 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I joined the merchant marines at 17,</v>

491
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.840
<v Speaker 1>which was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

492
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:20.841
<v Speaker 1>and then I worked there until I retired </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I go wash dishes until a dine </v>

493
00:20:20.841 --> 00:20:25.220
<v Speaker 1>that bog house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He liked the old drug that used to roll </v>

494
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.040
<v Speaker 1>his joint so we couldn't roll joints </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>

495
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:27.930
<v Speaker 1>And this guy could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we came in there one day.</v>

496
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Just data that you be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny when he was dead,</v>

497
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.070
<v Speaker 1>that will have cirrhosis a problem.</v>

498
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.830
<v Speaker 1>These guys were bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean bad booze hound,</v>

499
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.250
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good dishwashers.</v>

500
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny when you look back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and getting kicked out of high</v>

501
00:20:43.161 --> 00:20:48.161
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the trouble you were in getting </v>

502
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of the navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting bombed by a bunch of dudes.</v>

503
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:53.281
<v Speaker 1>Accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the recipes or being a great </v>

504
00:20:53.281 --> 00:20:53.281
<v Speaker 1>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody ever looks at it that way.</v>

505
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't have some of that stuff are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

506
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.290
<v Speaker 1>What are you getting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to ride around?</v>

507
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>He needs almost like you have to come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to everybody who is a fuck up and go,</v>

508
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not fitting in here,</v>

509
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's a place where you do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place to sit.</v>

510
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking whole clan of us just </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

511
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You've got to figure out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

512
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Joe's first time I walked on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

513
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I went to myself.</v>

514
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking comedian.</v>

515
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't somebody tell me I could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoided a bunch of that other stuff and </v>

516
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.210
<v Speaker 1>just started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 29 when I figured it out.</v>

517
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Twenty one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same feeling right after I did it.</v>

518
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

519
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I found it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

520
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.420
<v Speaker 1>This is the one that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

521
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it wasn't good.</v>

522
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of work to be done,</v>

523
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.770
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could be my job.</v>

524
00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:43.771
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I'd ever do it </v>

525
00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:43.771
<v Speaker 1>professionally or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just knew I was a comic,</v>

00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that knew I was a comedian and.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fortune shit coming.</v>

528
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really sat around asking the </v>

529
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:54.420
<v Speaker 1>universe for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought it would happen.</v>

530
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Even though I watched it happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Foxworthy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right next to me,</v>

534
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:09.190

<v Speaker 1>thought that it would happen to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The cable guy ever call my pain Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

583
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:24.530

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

586
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:30.131
<v Speaker 1>I never knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never saw the act that it wasn't all </v>

587
00:24:30.131 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Larry the cable guy and I know it used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

588
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.740
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the funniest things I ever saw </v>

589
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:35.740
<v Speaker 1>was that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be this tape and uh,</v>

590
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:41.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the South County funnybone in St Louis </v>

591
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.840
<v Speaker 1>and the condo where they literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty little apartment they put us in </v>

592
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.560
<v Speaker 1>and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was called bovine women from </v>

593
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and it was about huge fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls and uh,</v>

594
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.830
<v Speaker 1>and he had stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a copy.</v>

595
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It had been around for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the condo.</v>

596
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 1>So we play it for people as a joke when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they came over and,</v>

597
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a vhs camera and because that was</v>

598
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:05.411
<v Speaker 1>a copy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he edited himself into the movie and it </v>

599
00:25:05.411 --> 00:25:07.970
<v Speaker 1>was fucking outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really funny.</v>

600
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 1>So was it a porn that was a yarn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

601
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And so somebody be fucking her from </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>

602
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:16.180
<v Speaker 1>And then it turned the camera around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his day and just work.</v>

603
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.050
<v Speaker 1>This can be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marty,</v>

604
00:25:18.051 --> 00:25:21.050
<v Speaker 1>the manager of the club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was very,</v>

605
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe me,</v>

606
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.120
<v Speaker 1>somebody stole it after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to steal it before it was </v>

607
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:27.120
<v Speaker 1>edited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody took it after that.</v>

608
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

609
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.750
<v Speaker 1>That was back when you need to edit </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

610
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:33.140
<v Speaker 1>You used to have to have two vcrs </v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas to have a little bit of this and</v>

611
00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:35.270
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of that and go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth and back and forth.</v>

612
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those vhs cameras at the end,</v>

613
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had one too.</v>

614
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I used to type nearly everything I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

615
00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:44.380
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

616
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

617
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>if it didn't have a tab broken off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

618
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just record right over </v>

619
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 1>whatever little part of it you wanted it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

620
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Tab.</v>

621
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.790
<v Speaker 1>If it had a tab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't do it.</v>

622
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you did for your wedding </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

623
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that tab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you took the tab off then nobody</v>

624
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:04.430
<v Speaker 1>could record on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still there.</v>

625
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And this one was still there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he just,</v>

626
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.400
<v Speaker 1>he just punched himself right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is this big old 500 </v>

627
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 1>pounder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's opening the refrigerator door.</v>

628
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:18.971
<v Speaker 1>So the reveal is the light of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frigerator through her thighs and in </v>

629
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.750
<v Speaker 1>gigantic and it's a cutaway to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking a glass of milk,</v>

630
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>going real slap sticky stuff.</v>

631
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.280
<v Speaker 1>But if you're working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't see a covenant,</v>

632
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:29.010
<v Speaker 1>it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

633
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:34.060
<v Speaker 1>it was a big laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a video of him doing standup as </v>

634
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Dan Whitney and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

635
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:35.950
<v Speaker 1>this is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

636
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.610
<v Speaker 1>So he had no shirt tucked in his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had like a polo shirt on,</v>

637
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:41.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole deal.</v>

638
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really smart.</v>

639
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he did.</v>

640
00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

641
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day,</v>

642
00:26:47.271 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 1>one time Larry was just a character that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did in the act.</v>

643
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the billingsley Larry took over.</v>

644
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 2>That's like the dice man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

645
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:59.110
<v Speaker 2>same thing because he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a character that he did in the </v>

646
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.110
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

647
00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.621
<v Speaker 2>he was Andrew Silverstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would go on stage as Andrew </v>

648
00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:02.621
<v Speaker 2>Silverstein and he had a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>impressions that he would do.</v>

649
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.650
<v Speaker 2>He'd do an impression of Travolta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would do an Alpha Chino impression,</v>

650
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.590
<v Speaker 2>and then at the end of his act he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the iceman.</v>

651
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:15.430
<v Speaker 2>The iceman was essentially aversion his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his take on Jerry Lewis and the nutty </v>

652
00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:21.371
<v Speaker 2>professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when Jerry Lewis and the nutty </v>

653
00:27:21.371 --> 00:27:23.291
<v Speaker 2>professor and he was like this nerdy guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he'd drink some fucking potion and </v>

654
00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:23.780
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden it becomes this really </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool guy.</v>

655
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Like that was what Andrew did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had just become this dice Mande </v>

656
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.580
<v Speaker 2>character and you put the leather jacket</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

657
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the rhymes and all that shit.</v>

658
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his act was so unique because he was</v>

659
00:27:37.251 --> 00:27:41.080
<v Speaker 2>the first guy where you could repeat the</v>
<v Speaker 2>punchlines pack and everybody liked it.</v>

660
00:27:41.081 --> 00:27:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a song,</v>

661
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone's singing a song,</v>

662
00:27:44.961 --> 00:27:49.010
<v Speaker 2>you like to sing along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if for comedy that.</v>

663
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no such thing as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit joke,</v>

664
00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a popular bid,</v>

665
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but there's no such thing as a hit job </v>
<v Speaker 1>or want to hear to get,</v>

666
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke,</v>

667
00:27:57.841 --> 00:28:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you know the joke and fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:28:00.091 --> 00:28:05.091
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bitch at me because I won't do </v>

669
00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:05.091
<v Speaker 1>anything that's old and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

670
00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 1>they want me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to hear me do tater salad and </v>

671
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 1>they want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do some of that stuff.</v>

672
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.801
<v Speaker 1>But there are long bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are long stories they already </v>

673
00:28:12.801 --> 00:28:12.801
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I start one,</v>

674
00:28:12.801 --> 00:28:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I did it in Madison Square Garden last </v>
<v Speaker 1>time I was there,</v>

675
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I opened with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

676
00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:21.591
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't done in 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go back and listen to it 10 </v>

677
00:28:21.591 --> 00:28:21.591
<v Speaker 1>times because there's a complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of comedy.</v>

678
00:28:21.591 --> 00:28:23.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

679
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:28.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still pays rhythm and timing all the </v>

680
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:28.980
<v Speaker 1>way through this eight minute long joke </v>
<v Speaker 1>or story.</v>

681
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And so I did it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started it,</v>

682
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.570
<v Speaker 1>you thought I was one of the Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would just went absolutely nuts.</v>

683
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 1>But then I got to drag them through an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight minute long piece.</v>

684
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 1>They already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they're not,</v>

685
00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the response I used to get that</v>

686
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I love to get from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I don't get what I want,</v>

687
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.390
<v Speaker 1>then you don't get what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

688
00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.770
<v Speaker 1>But it was fun to do that one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that I just won't go back.</v>

689
00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaffigan is a prisoner to hot pockets or</v>

690
00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 1>he's in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good prison to be in.</v>

691
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a great president being it's funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

692
00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 1>but he has to do that bit like a Fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>foxworthy has to do the,</v>

693
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:06.570
<v Speaker 1>you might be a redneck buddies also got </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

694
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:08.160
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

695
00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:08.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different.</v>

696
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:13.881

<v Speaker 1>years that he hasn't hardly done any of </v>

698
00:29:17.091 --> 00:29:17.640
<v Speaker 1>that and that's what he was always known</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

699
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was just a great idea for a bit </v>

<v Speaker 1>He figured out like this perfect </v>

703
00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:33.770
<v Speaker 1>formula.</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

705
00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Foxworthy does not get the credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>he deserved.</v>

706
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:37.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

707
00:29:37.351 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 1>He's probably the most prolific a writer</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know</v>

708
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 3>and I also just owe him fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

713
00:29:56.441 --> 00:30:01.441
<v Speaker 3>very straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a little wilder when he was in </v>

714
00:30:01.441 --> 00:30:01.441
<v Speaker 3>the club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

715
00:30:01.441 --> 00:30:01.700
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the way he was raised in.</v>

716
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of what he went back to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does he live?</v>

717
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.520
<v Speaker 3>In Georgia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Atlanta.</v>

718
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.820
<v Speaker 3>While we had a house the size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What college.</v>

719
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:14.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'm not talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>University of Phoenix shit either.</v>

720
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about.</v>

721
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

722
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.090
<v Speaker 4>you kind of have to buy one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get that rich.</v>

723
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.110
<v Speaker 3>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just a,</v>

725
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 3>he's just the real deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

726
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:28.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're right.</v>

727
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.110
<v Speaker 3>If people of randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I hear you got other comics,</v>

728
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they'll rag on the blue collar</v>

729
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.680
<v Speaker 3>tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

730
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.740
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people didn't like Dan and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>

731
00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:41.280
<v Speaker 3>but it was all comics and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 3>performed for comics once in my life and</v>

732
00:30:41.281 --> 00:30:43.500
<v Speaker 3>I tell the comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the worst thing you can do,</v>

733
00:30:43.501 --> 00:30:48.501
<v Speaker 3>perform for those comics in the back </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's not whoever's going to </v>

734
00:30:48.501 --> 00:30:49.230
<v Speaker 3>come up with I see you or pay money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't perform for them,</v>

735
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.050
<v Speaker 3>but for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those people in the seats and so you</v>

736
00:30:52.051 --> 00:30:54.080
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it it and whatever it was,</v>

737
00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:59.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he just got popular and if it </v>

738
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.090
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have been for that huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity,</v>

739
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.090
<v Speaker 3>nobody would have given a shit.</v>

740
00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.810
<v Speaker 4>That thing that happens when something </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes really popular is that people </v>

741
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.480
<v Speaker 4>decided to shit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though it doesn't mean like there's</v>

742
00:31:05.481 --> 00:31:07.640
<v Speaker 4>nothing wrong with Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Cable Guy's act.</v>

743
00:31:07.641 --> 00:31:10.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a funny act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a funny guy and he's a paced rhythm</v>

744
00:31:10.431 --> 00:31:12.350
<v Speaker 4>and timing comic and he's really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>at.</v>

745
00:31:12.351 --> 00:31:15.440
<v Speaker 4>He's very good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember when he was huge,</v>

746
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.520
<v Speaker 4>when he still is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it was all happening when it </v>

747
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.290
<v Speaker 4>was first happening and he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking football arenas,</v>

748
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 4>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a David Cross wrote some fucking </v>

749
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 4>letter to Larry the cable guy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

750
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.790
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this doesn't make any sense.</v>

751
00:31:28.791 --> 00:31:29.960
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is he doing wrong?</v>

752
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.550
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand.</v>

753
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.470
<v Speaker 4>What are you trying to say that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>character,</v>

754
00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:37.610
<v Speaker 4>this ridiculous over the top character </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing isn't funny or racist or</v>

755
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.860
<v Speaker 3>people that really took issue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just this,</v>

756
00:31:40.861 --> 00:31:42.330
<v Speaker 3>just comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't lack it,</v>

757
00:31:42.331 --> 00:31:43.450
<v Speaker 3>listen to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

758
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.900
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the end of the long and the short</v>

759
00:31:45.901 --> 00:31:46.610
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

760
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:47.300
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

761
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:52.370
<v Speaker 3>it's not exactly my cup of tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know how good he is still a,</v>

762
00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.710
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

763
00:31:54.711 --> 00:31:55.280
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

764
00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I would go out of my way to see jeff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably wouldn't go out of my way to </v>

765
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 3>see him just to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

766
00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:01.980
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

767
00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.490
<v Speaker 3>but that his style is not exactly my cup</v>
<v Speaker 3>of tea,</v>

768
00:32:05.491 --> 00:32:10.491
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I can still see how good he is at </v>

769
00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:14.121
<v Speaker 3>it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and saw what he did and the impact that </v>

770
00:32:14.121 --> 00:32:14.730
<v Speaker 3>he had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also the addition.</v>

771
00:32:14.731 --> 00:32:16.980
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't one of the original guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other,</v>

772
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:21.150
<v Speaker 3>there was another guy and then jeff got </v>
<v Speaker 3>a got rid of him.</v>

773
00:32:21.151 --> 00:32:24.420
<v Speaker 3>And who's the other guy you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember?</v>

774
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>can't remember his name,</v>

778
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.590
<v Speaker 3>but he's the last beetle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's that last beetle,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was a good comic and,</v>

782
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:49.530
<v Speaker 1>but he was on some kind of medication </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made him just getting Jeff's face </v>

<v Speaker 1>Doesn't like that.</v>

784
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.450
<v Speaker 1>And Jeff's like,</v>

800
00:33:27.491 --> 00:33:28.810
<v Speaker 1>involved to the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

801
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 1>we'd audition for the same part in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

802
00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the not too long ago.</v>

803
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So I saw him at this audition and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a,</v>

804
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the name of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was supposed to a huge cast.</v>

805
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Really big people in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're all sucked and I mean,</v>

806
00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:48.701
<v Speaker 1>they're always just nothing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I got sideways with the people </v>

807
00:33:48.701 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 1>doing the interview because they said it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a reading,</v>

808
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:52.040
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't memorize the script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

809
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:55.700
<v Speaker 1>and I came in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

812
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:00.220
<v Speaker 1>can you take off the glasses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're too modern for this,</v>

813
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 1>this piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

814
00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:04.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want me to read it,</v>

815
00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 1>the glasses are not for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just happened to be yellow.</v>

816
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.130
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whoever's watching it,</v>

817
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.020
<v Speaker 1>have them close their eyes and imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me with shitty glasses on,</v>

818
00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:16.760
<v Speaker 1>if that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to take them off.</v>

819
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.890
<v Speaker 1>And then she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

820
00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get this role,</v>

821
00:34:21.321 --> 00:34:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you'll cancel your lab schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

822
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:23.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>

823
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:25.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>

824
00:34:25.071 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 1>That was cleared with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

825
00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you got to where if I'm going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to do it around my schedule.</v>

826
00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not canceling any days for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

827
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:35.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to fight at the casting </v>

828
00:34:35.831 --> 00:34:35.831
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That probably not going to get this.</v>

829
00:34:35.831 --> 00:34:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd just come off the roadies and then I</v>

830
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:40.300
<v Speaker 1>was kind of disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fucking weird</v>

831
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.510
<v Speaker 4>businessman and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

832
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 4>that inner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The interaction that you have with the </v>

833
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 4>casting director is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had some good ones are really,</v>

834
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.350
<v Speaker 4>really nice conversation.</v>

835
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:52.610
<v Speaker 1>People want me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gail have been his boot cast me for </v>

836
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.191
<v Speaker 1>Brodis and she's wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of them that are </v>

837
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:56.040
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of them that are not.</v>

838
00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.410
<v Speaker 1>These two chicks were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were snobs.</v>

839
00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

840
00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 1>they really were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 1>they were really talking to me like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had not accomplished a single thing in </v>

842
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 1>my life and maybe if this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

843
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd be able to call myself a man or.</v>

844
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.260
<v Speaker 4>Well that's their rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's their position,</v>

845
00:35:14.261 --> 00:35:16.570
<v Speaker 4>their positions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why actors are</v>

846
00:35:16.571 --> 00:35:20.020
<v Speaker 4>so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because you walk into this room and</v>

847
00:35:20.021 --> 00:35:23.320
<v Speaker 4>your life depends on whether or not this</v>
<v Speaker 4>person puts a check next to your name,</v>

848
00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:28.321
<v Speaker 4>whether they gave you the green light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you go in there and you have to </v>

849
00:35:28.321 --> 00:35:30.640
<v Speaker 4>memorize some bullshit that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really care about most of the time.</v>

850
00:35:30.641 --> 00:35:35.641
<v Speaker 4>Some nonsense Sitcom or some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid rail and a movie and you gotta </v>

851
00:35:35.641 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 4>it's half charming them half doing</v>

852
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:43.070
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell Brian to this day that they have </v>

853
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:43.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking ruined them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go ruined them.</v>

854
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know how to disagree with </v>

855
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

856
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Brian Cowen will go into Rodney's </v>
<v Speaker 2>charms.</v>

857
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in the building because he's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at an audition.</v>

858
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fucking ruined you.</v>

859
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to like figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this person is not for you.</v>

860
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:56.640
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

862
00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I just turned 60 and on a Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

863
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 3>if I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I signed up for a TV show,</v>

864
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:08.530
<v Speaker 3>I'd be signed on until I was 66 or 67.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

865
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:13.540
<v Speaker 3>in my day that if 51.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that seems like an awful long </v>

866
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if it,</v>

867
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it happened to be someone I really </v>

868
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:21.100
<v Speaker 3>liked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

869
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.350
<v Speaker 3>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Jay Mcgraw was producing it,</v>

870
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:27.470
<v Speaker 3>I would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably would do it just so I could </v>

871
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.470
<v Speaker 3>hang out with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would have to really,</v>

872
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 3>really like somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

873
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:32.010
<v Speaker 3>that I was going to be hanging with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time because I couldn't just</v>

874
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.850
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever guest is Dr.</v>

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:50.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

906
00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.290
<v Speaker 3>j Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay's just a great guy,</v>

908
00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:58.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an unbelievably solid dude when he </v>

909
00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.020
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just brought me back a three boxes of</v>

910
00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.720
<v Speaker 3>killer cigars from Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how can you not like it?</v>

911
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just went to Cuba.</v>

912
00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 2>You can bring those back now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

913
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

914
00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was on his plane or </v>

915
00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.140
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

916
00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of bring them back sorta.</v>

917
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 2>You can get like a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

918
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:19.521
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is that you can get $200 </v>

919
00:38:19.521 --> 00:38:22.851
<v Speaker 2>worth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people that customers have no </v>

920
00:38:22.851 --> 00:38:24.411
<v Speaker 2>idea how expensive they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can just say this was $185 worth </v>

921
00:38:24.691 --> 00:38:25.630
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

922
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.110
<v Speaker 2>that's expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really $1,500</v>

923
00:38:28.111 --> 00:38:29.400
<v Speaker 2>worth of cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

924
00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you pay them in American </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

925
00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:32.970
<v Speaker 2>it probably is 150 bucks worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

926
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I can probably pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

927
00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>they probably</v>

928

<v Speaker 4>There's this one area of Cuba where they</v>

948
00:39:18.261 --> 00:39:21.440
<v Speaker 4>grow most of their tobacco and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

949
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.250
<v Speaker 4>it's not even that big of a place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like that many acres,</v>

950
00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just this unbelievable soil.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like what is it that much different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you will like a sore or are you </v>

952
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.790
<v Speaker 4>like a Sim?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All,</v>

953
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:34.490
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of Cigar,</v>

954
00:39:34.491 --> 00:39:35.060
<v Speaker 4>sort of.</v>

955
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

956
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.550
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

957
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

958
00:39:39.081 --> 00:39:41.530
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that the smart guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:39:41.531 --> 00:39:46.531
<v Speaker 1>Davidoff Davidoff cigars and because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw that he saw it all coming.</v>

960
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so before it all happened,</v>

961
00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 1>he moved his rollers and his factory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything over the Dominican Republic.</v>

962
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:59.340
<v Speaker 1>So whenever they came in and took the </v>
<v Speaker 1>land from those people that started </v>

963
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:04.081
<v Speaker 1>these iconic brands and they just kicked</v>
<v Speaker 1>him out of the country with nothing,</v>

964
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 1>will they all had seed so they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow that same tobacco if they stayed in</v>

965
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:13.501
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same parallel like Dominican </v>

966
00:40:13.501 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Republic or even over to Ecuador.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

967
00:40:14.591 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 1>that was still perfect conditions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing these,</v>

968
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.010
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these plants.</v>

969
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.940
<v Speaker 1>But what they didn't have was rollers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

970
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.420
<v Speaker 1>these cigars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

971
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.610
<v Speaker 1>these handmade cigars are rolled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts.</v>

972
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people in Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spend their whole lives.</v>

973
00:40:27.941 --> 00:40:32.941
<v Speaker 1>It's a good job and they have these huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>role in rooms and these people just </v>

974
00:40:32.941 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 1>rollies perfect cigars and somebody sits</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the front of the room and read them </v>

975
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.250
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really read some books.</v>

976

<v Speaker 1>If somebody is actually up there with </v>

978
00:40:46.171 --> 00:40:46.171
<v Speaker 1>the reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come in and shifts and,</v>

979
00:40:46.171 --> 00:40:48.340
<v Speaker 1>and read to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sit there and listen to the stories</v>

980
00:40:48.341 --> 00:40:49.280
<v Speaker 1>and roll cigars.</v>

985
00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the whole thing is just,</v>

986
00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:07.320
<v Speaker 4>it's got such a weird sort of romance to</v>

00:43:27.421 --> 00:43:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I won't do colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't do anything either.</v>

1045
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld bitching about the political </v>

1046
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.540
<v Speaker 2>correctness of a college students these </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1047
00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go perform for people your</v>

1048
00:43:37.131 --> 00:43:38.950
<v Speaker 2>own age?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's.</v>

1049
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe.</v>

1050
00:43:41.141 --> 00:43:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1051
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not your people and they're super </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive and they're just,</v>

1052
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 2>they're finally disconnected from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents that are looking to call </v>

1053
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.491
<v Speaker 2>bullshit on everybody there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing about college kids is </v>

1054
00:43:54.491 --> 00:43:57.520
<v Speaker 2>they're looking to be right and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking to establish what you can and </v>

1055
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 2>can't say and they're looking to control</v>
<v Speaker 2>people because they have.</v>

1056
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 2>They're just free for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever themselves.</v>

1057
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably would have done the same </v>

1058
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.510
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.840

<v Speaker 2>I've never owned a notebook.</v>

1063

1191
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:32.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Weed's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron White.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know you're happy about that.</v>

1257
00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been treating it like it was </v>

1258
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.661
<v Speaker 3>illegal for about 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had know it's going to have that </v>

1259
00:52:20.661 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Speaker 3>much difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1260
00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:24.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had medical marijuana here anyway.</v>

1261
00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:26.260
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1262
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:32.020
<v Speaker 3>and I was actually using medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana to get off of regular </v>

1263
00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.791
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and that works like a charm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like Jesus came from heaven </v>

1264
00:52:34.791 --> 00:52:39.741
<v Speaker 3>and healed me of this regular marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem that's been haunting me since I </v>

1265
00:52:39.741 --> 00:52:43.881
<v Speaker 3>was 13 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now that they've legalized </v>

1266
00:52:43.881 --> 00:52:47.151
<v Speaker 3>recreational marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to use that to wean myself </v>

1267
00:52:47.151 --> 00:52:48.120
<v Speaker 3>from medical marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nine.</v>

1268
00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:53.130
<v Speaker 3>I've got a plan that's like methadone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1269
00:52:53.131 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.320
<v Speaker 3>it's so it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it came,</v>

1271
00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:59.840
<v Speaker 3>it took so long to get here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1272
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:00.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1273
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:02.540
<v Speaker 3>to even this little seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1274
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 3>We have seven states now that are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>

1275
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.760
<v Speaker 2>how many states?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1276
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.920
<v Speaker 2>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational.</v>

1277
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.600
<v Speaker 3>That was recreational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then a bunch of,</v>

1278
00:53:12.601 --> 00:53:14.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1279
00:53:14.131 --> 00:53:16.920
<v Speaker 3>in Vegas there they're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreational.</v>

1280
00:53:16.921 --> 00:53:19.170
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that they have medical,</v>

1281
00:53:19.171 --> 00:53:22.140
<v Speaker 3>if you have a card from anywhere you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and,</v>

1282
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:24.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the vegas a dispensary,</v>

1283
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 3>what's up is there's so</v>

1284
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.940
<v Speaker 2>many people that are in jail for life in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas from the seventies,</v>

1285
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For life,</v>

1286
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:37.040
<v Speaker 2>for like getting caught with a dime bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas used to be the worst place in the </v>

1287
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 2>world when it came to pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1288
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I guess they were trying to discourage </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1289
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:46.000
<v Speaker 3>This is what it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got legalized prostitution,</v>

1290
00:53:46.001 --> 00:53:47.710
<v Speaker 3>legalized gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open carry,</v>

1291
00:53:47.711 --> 00:53:52.711
<v Speaker 3>handguns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liquor available 24 hours a day on the </v>

1292
00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:52.711
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can actually walk out onto the strip</v>

1293
00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:53.470
<v Speaker 3>at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning,</v>

1294
00:53:53.471 --> 00:53:56.080
<v Speaker 3>crack open a beer and bad on the camel </v>
<v Speaker 3>toe races.</v>

1295
00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:59.950
<v Speaker 3>But don't you dare out of joint because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's children here.</v>

1296
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were just trying to </v>

1297
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:09.721
<v Speaker 2>discourage people from getting high </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it probably cut it on the </v>

1298
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 2>profits when you assume that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1299
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:12.070
<v Speaker 2>the last thing I want to do and I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>high as gamble.</v>

1300
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I want to look at buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1301
00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.880
<v Speaker 2>look how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much money this building cost.</v>

1302
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Where are they getting their money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must be for people like me,</v>

1303
00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:23.930
<v Speaker 2>like me that don't smoke in here to </v>
<v Speaker 2>always feel like I never had the urge to</v>

1304
00:54:28.451 --> 00:54:33.451
<v Speaker 2>gamble when I'm high ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I was drunk and I walked into a </v>

1305
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:34.450
<v Speaker 2>casino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

1306
00:54:34.451 --> 00:54:37.080
<v Speaker 2>let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1307
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1308
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.630
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not much of a gambler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

1309
00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:43.060
<v Speaker 2>You're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not much of a gambler.</v>

1310
00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:43.980
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1311
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:50.580
<v Speaker 3>played a lot of cards when I first </v>
<v Speaker 3>started working in Vegas and then I got </v>

1312
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.110
<v Speaker 3>hit a couple of times and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1313
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:54.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally.</v>

1314
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna,</v>

1315
00:54:55.291 --> 00:55:00.291
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna bet 300 bucks a hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better have a half million bucks </v>

1316
00:55:00.291 --> 00:55:01.870
<v Speaker 3>sitting there or you'll get beat because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hit.</v>

1317
00:55:01.871 --> 00:55:06.871
<v Speaker 3>It just accelerates so high off of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>three grand off at a $300 bet.</v>

1318
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.020
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're not ready to really bet</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1319
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.100
<v Speaker 3>you should just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have a,</v>

1320
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:18.620
<v Speaker 3>if you can't stay there until it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycles back through a in case you start </v>

1321
00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:22.710
<v Speaker 3>on the wrong side of it been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'll go my mother.</v>

1322
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:25.410
<v Speaker 3>My mother's 81,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she likes to get hammered and gamble.</v>

1323
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.920
<v Speaker 3>She does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's always in Vegas.</v>

1324
00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:33.530
<v Speaker 3>I was there two weeks ago and I looked </v>
<v Speaker 3>over on the side of the stage and my </v>

1325
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.530
<v Speaker 3>mother was there.</v>

1326
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea she was coming all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>from cocoa and she was just over there </v>

1327
00:55:36.721 --> 00:55:38.160
<v Speaker 3>waving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

1328
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:39.530
<v Speaker 3>And she gets hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gambles.</v>

1329
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She plays blackjack,</v>

1330
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold him.</v>

1331
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.920
<v Speaker 3>And she was one of those harder mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1332
00:55:44.921 --> 00:55:46.270
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jen,</v>

1333
00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:51.310
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that Jim can't be skill all </v>

1334
00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 3>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anytime I play my mother in Jen,</v>

1335
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes one car and lays them down.</v>

1336
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.370
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1337
00:55:54.371 --> 00:55:59.371
<v Speaker 3>how can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't be good and just draw those </v>

1338
00:55:59.371 --> 00:55:59.371
<v Speaker 3>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

1339
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:00.800
<v Speaker 3>In my grandmother was worse than her </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1340
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.880
<v Speaker 3>So she plays serious poker but not with </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious money and uh,</v>

1341
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 3>more than she used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1342
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:08.790
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1343
00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:10.650
<v Speaker 3>and then my son loves to play Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold 'em.</v>

1344
00:56:10.651 --> 00:56:13.860
<v Speaker 3>So if he comes out to vegas then I'll go</v>
<v Speaker 3>play with him.</v>

1345
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.640
<v Speaker 3>I have a bunch of friends and gamble </v>
<v Speaker 3>really high and I don't have that gene.</v>

1346
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:22.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm missing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one not to have because </v>

1347
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.730
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1348
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:24.900
<v Speaker 3>you can really feel stupid the next day </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're going accurate,</v>

1349
00:56:24.901 --> 00:56:26.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten well.</v>

1350
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 3>One of them at least a moderate late </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1351
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Ford escort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1352
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:34.840

<v Speaker 3>are several escorts.</v>

1353
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:38.700
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get something out of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead.</v>

1354
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I got absolutely nothing except free </v>
<v Speaker 3>booze.</v>

1355
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:44.970
<v Speaker 4>So my friend Dana white is lost as much </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a million dollars in a night.</v>

1356
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:46.950
<v Speaker 4>It lowered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1357
00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.720
<v Speaker 4>But he won like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it say one seven?</v>

1358
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.130
<v Speaker 4>I think he said he wants seven one </v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

1359
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

1360
00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.220
<v Speaker 4>He's got it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>

1361
00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:54.610
<v Speaker 4>he's got better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1362
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.980
<v Speaker 4>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's also,</v>

1363
00:56:55.981 --> 00:56:56.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1364
00:56:56.561 --> 00:56:57.510
<v Speaker 4>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>

1365
00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.600
<v Speaker 4>a big thing with people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>punched a lot.</v>

1366
00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Like he was a boxer for a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of MMA fighters,</v>

1367
00:57:05.161 --> 00:57:08.160
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people that have had </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced a lot of head trauma.</v>

1368
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.130
<v Speaker 4>They like to gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a weird correlation there.</v>

1369
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.300
<v Speaker 4>They don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

1370
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.790
<v Speaker 4>wonder if John Daly ever got hit in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

1371
00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure somebody punched that guy for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1372
00:57:18.121 --> 00:57:19.380
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who didn't punch that guy?</v>

1373
00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:22.530
<v Speaker 4>He's a big dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still somebody probably punched him.</v>

1374
00:57:22.531 --> 00:57:23.610
<v Speaker 4>He's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1375
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:24.300
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1376
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:26.320
<v Speaker 3>baby boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just has a gambling problem.</v>

1377
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.230
<v Speaker 3>He's finding he was sober for five years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a buddy of mine.</v>

1378
00:57:29.231 --> 00:57:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to say he's a buddy of mine.</v>

1379
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Whenever the masters comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1380
00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:35.410

<v Speaker 3>avis genius because he's the only </v>

<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number one.</v>

00:57:42.491 --> 00:57:47.491
<v Speaker 3>He's the most famous golfer in the city </v>
<v Speaker 3>at that time is John Daly more famous </v>

1385
00:57:47.491 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 3>than anybody playing in that tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's accessible.</v>

1386

01:03:24.821 --> 01:03:24.860
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1522
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:29.940
<v Speaker 5>while he was on the fucking stretcher </v>
<v Speaker 5>putting him in the ambulance and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>gangs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

1526
01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:44.090
<v Speaker 5>but he got a laugh on the way out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>door and people were saying,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when we all agree with that </v>

1535
01:04:04.961 --> 01:04:04.961
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it is too,</v>

1536
01:04:04.961 --> 01:04:05.240
<v Speaker 5>when he looks back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he doesn't already,</v>

<v Speaker 2>People dying.</v>

1539
01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a real touchy and it's also a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>touching.</v>

1540
01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Like what we think is gonna happen after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that right now.</v>

1541
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.640
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like real,</v>

1542
01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:24.850
<v Speaker 2>real sensitive about what they think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen and whether it's </v>

1543
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:28.151
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are like convinced it's </v>

1544
01:04:28.151 --> 01:04:30.311
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say to you with such fucking </v>

1545
01:04:30.311 --> 01:04:30.311
<v Speaker 2>conviction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1546
01:04:30.311 --> 01:04:31.250
<v Speaker 2>when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing.</v>

1547
01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:32.360
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it goes dark.</v>

1548
01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:37.450
<v Speaker 5>I know for a fact that's not true </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I lived in a haunted house and </v>

1549
01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:40.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's a haunted house,</v>

1550
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.230
<v Speaker 5>then somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is an afterlife if,</v>

1551
01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.210
<v Speaker 5>because we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was definitely a haunted house.</v>

1552
01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.740
<v Speaker 5>Where did you live?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>

1553
01:04:45.741 --> 01:04:49.260
<v Speaker 5>it was a Lake House that side of Austin </v>
<v Speaker 5>and on Lake Lbj and Kingsland,</v>

1554
01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:54.310
<v Speaker 5>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we had to sign documents at closing </v>

1555
01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:55.190
<v Speaker 5>saying that it had been told to us that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a haunted house.</v>

1556
01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:59.310
<v Speaker 5>You have to do that in Texas a and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd had a,</v>

1557
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:04.830
<v Speaker 5>they had two mediums that I'm an extra </v>
<v Speaker 5>large and said the same exact thing.</v>

1558
01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:08.630
<v Speaker 5>It's the ghost name is Whitey Sour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1559
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:11.810
<v Speaker 5>And he was the barber for the town and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1560
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:16.990
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they couldn't tell why it was still </v>

1561
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:16.990
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was obviously there.</v>

1562
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.030
<v Speaker 5>He could,</v>

1563
01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 3>he would do these things in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1564
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:26.010
<v Speaker 3>You could put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a pot of water right out of the </v>

1565
01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:26.010
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it on the stove,</v>

1566
01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:28.000
<v Speaker 3>stove turned off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just sit there and wait.</v>

1567
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:33.660
<v Speaker 3>And it starts to vibrate and that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrate to where the waves came in from </v>

1568
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.890
<v Speaker 3>the center to the middle and then bounce</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the middle.</v>

1569
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:41.400
<v Speaker 3>And then you could get a hold of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're obviously stronger than </v>

1570
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.581
<v Speaker 3>the ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can sell it back down and let go of </v>

1571
01:05:44.581 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1572
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would do it again.</v>

1573
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:47.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1574
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:48.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1575
01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:54.140
<v Speaker 3>and I know that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I happened to just know that to </v>

1576
01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 3>be a fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1577
01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I lived in a haunted house</v>

1578
01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:00.780
<v Speaker 4>was how many people do you think have </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually lived in a haunted house and </v>

1579
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.630
<v Speaker 4>how many people are just fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's the problem if you really</v>

1580
01:06:02.631 --> 01:06:04.340
<v Speaker 4>did live in a haunted house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I believe he did,</v>

1581
01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:10.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that some people who've told similar </v>

1582
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:10.240
<v Speaker 4>stories are just fucking crazy and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be the problem.</v>

1583
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 4>The problem is trying to differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 4>between real unusual experiences which </v>

1584
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:19.601
<v Speaker 4>may or not be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can happen to anybody just because </v>

1585
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:20.150
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't happened to you or it hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to me.</v>

1586
01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm walking through life assuming that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bullshit.</v>

1587
01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:24.440
<v Speaker 4>But if it did happen right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1588
01:06:24.441 --> 01:06:25.970
<v Speaker 4>you'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy shit.</v>

1589
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:31.150
<v Speaker 4>How am I going to describe what this is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people are pretending things </v>

1590
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.150
<v Speaker 4>like that are happening now?</v>

1591
01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just something that I've always</v>

1592
01:06:34.731 --> 01:06:39.731
<v Speaker 3>been able to say what after I've lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that I know for a fact that the </v>

1593
01:06:39.731 --> 01:06:41.040
<v Speaker 3>somethings happens afterwards in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1594
01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:46.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a talk with a yet I bought the </v>

1595
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:48.911
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was still making payments to his </v>

1596
01:06:48.911 --> 01:06:49.610
<v Speaker 3>daughter and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever we first moved there,</v>

1597
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:52.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend at the time,</v>

<v Speaker 3>there and they had a bunk bed set up in </v>

1599
01:06:57.341 --> 01:07:01.301
<v Speaker 3>my son's room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't want him at a mattress </v>

1600
01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:01.640
<v Speaker 3>on the bottom and along the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he put his shoes up there and during</v>

1601
01:07:01.641 --> 01:07:06.641
<v Speaker 3>the night for no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shoes got pushed off and fell and </v>

1602
01:07:06.641 --> 01:07:08.290
<v Speaker 3>hit him in the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was totally whining and a,</v>

1603
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:12.020
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the next day,</v>

1604
01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1610
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:26.840
<v Speaker 3>his chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>

1615
01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.730
<v Speaker 3>I saw her every month when I made the </v>
<v Speaker 3>payment.</v>

1616
01:07:37.731 --> 01:07:39.780
<v Speaker 3>So if he was going to Jack with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>little kid,</v>

1617
01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.660
<v Speaker 3>fucking punch them teeth and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to punch his,</v>

1618
01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.450
<v Speaker 3>his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really,</v>

1619
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:47.750
<v Speaker 3>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's rent to coast to coast.</v>

1620
01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:49.300
<v Speaker 3>That's so gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1621
01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:51.800
<v Speaker 3>went in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never,</v>

1622
01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:56.801
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever saw any activity in that room </v>

1623
01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:56.801
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1624
01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:59.710
<v Speaker 4>My grandparents had a guy died in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and they always claim that they </v>

1625
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:00.680
<v Speaker 4>saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like a,</v>

1626
01:08:00.681 --> 01:08:05.681
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy who rented a room in their attic </v>

1627
01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.770
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he died and my grandmother always would </v>

1628
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:10.130
<v Speaker 4>swear that she could hear him walking </v>
<v Speaker 4>around up there and he'd be there.</v>

1629
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.900
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there is,</v>

1630
01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:14.380
<v Speaker 4>we know that this is like most people </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1631
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 4>ghost stories and you'll get the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of here.</v>

1632
01:08:16.191 --> 01:08:19.040
<v Speaker 4>It's because so many ghost shows me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many times can you watch a person go</v>

1633
01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:23.900
<v Speaker 4>into a basement with a windows night </v>
<v Speaker 4>vision screens on and look at?</v>

1634
01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Nothing and go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you hear that?</v>

1635
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.470
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1636
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:33.470
<v Speaker 3>Television shows dedicated to one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an egg will move in inch over a </v>

1637
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.780
<v Speaker 3>year or something.</v>

1638
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:39.030
<v Speaker 4>I think it would be super arrogant to </v>
<v Speaker 4>assume that it's not possible to go </v>

1639
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:40.810
<v Speaker 4>surreal that you just haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced them yet.</v>

1640
01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.680
<v Speaker 4>Most people haven't experienced them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if there's all sorts of types of</v>

1641
01:08:44.681 --> 01:08:45.220
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1642
01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:50.221
<v Speaker 4>There's people that are born with birth </v>
<v Speaker 4>defects that make them tiny and other </v>

1643
01:08:50.221 --> 01:08:53.230
<v Speaker 4>people are born with gigantism and deaf </v>
<v Speaker 4>is this and life itself is not like this</v>

1644
01:08:53.231 --> 01:08:58.231
<v Speaker 4>perfect mathematical science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's filled with all sorts of mistakes </v>

1645
01:08:58.231 --> 01:09:02.311
<v Speaker 4>and errors and weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's a transition between this </v>

1646
01:09:02.311 --> 01:09:03.550
<v Speaker 4>stage of life and the next stage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

1647
01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.710
<v Speaker 4>would we assume that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect?</v>

1648
01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.080
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

1649
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.430
<v Speaker 4>We assume if there is a spirit or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a soul in people,</v>

1650
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 4>we would assume that that transition </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes misses and sometimes you get </v>

1651
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.600
<v Speaker 4>caught in the howling in between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>worlds and he just ricocheted back and </v>

1652
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.810
<v Speaker 4>forth off of both places.</v>

1653
01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't unsmoked that joint can.</v>

1654
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.520

1656
01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:29.560
<v Speaker 3>an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1657
01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.920
<v Speaker 3>my uncle who was a preacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a southern Baptist preacher,</v>

1658
01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:35.910
<v Speaker 3>a brilliant man who's age three </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctorates in psychology,</v>

1659
01:09:35.911 --> 01:09:36.990
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>theology,</v>

<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a fun,</v>

1661

<v Speaker 3>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun,</v>

1662
01:09:39.631 --> 01:09:44.631
<v Speaker 3>fun guy to talk to and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was at one time the president of the </v>

1663
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Southern Baptist Convention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Charles [inaudible] is his name and </v>

1664
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very,</v>

1665
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.661
<v Speaker 3>very powerful position to have in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>south to be the president of that </v>

1666
01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:53.661
<v Speaker 3>convention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1667
01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.880
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was talking to him,</v>

1668
01:09:56.881 --> 01:10:01.140
<v Speaker 3>he was a long time ago and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of disagreement.</v>

1669
01:10:01.141 --> 01:10:06.141
<v Speaker 3>He kind of had a nervous breakdown and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he showed up at my grandmother's </v>

1670
01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:08.220
<v Speaker 3>birthday party and he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1671
01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.370
<v Speaker 3>riding a harley with no shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he went down.</v>

1672
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:16.230
<v Speaker 3>He taught Gus Gospel according to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie for a while.</v>

1673
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.520
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1674
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.600
<v Speaker 3>this is what he took because we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>just talking about this exact thing.</v>

1675
01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:24.210
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes to that well,</v>

1676
01:10:24.211 --> 01:10:27.480
<v Speaker 3>run a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I believe.</v>

1677
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:31.920
<v Speaker 3>I believe that when we die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be surprised.</v>

1678
01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 3>That's all he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all you got after all these </v>

1679
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:39.120
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these years of Vietnam,</v>

1680
01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.300
<v Speaker 3>that's all he's got his fucking gun.</v>

1681
01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.880
<v Speaker 4>When I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was real dismissive of religion </v>

1682
01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.630
<v Speaker 4>because I was real religious at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>point when I was real young.</v>

1683
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.810
<v Speaker 4>I went to Catholic school and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was really,</v>

1684
01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:57.110
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a good experience because it was </v>

1685
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:58.851
<v Speaker 4>a bad experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I realized that these are like these </v>

1686
01:10:58.851 --> 01:11:01.311
<v Speaker 4>mean flawed people that are teaching </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they think is supposedly God's </v>

1687
01:11:01.311 --> 01:11:05.481
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I became like a very anti religious </v>

1688
01:11:05.481 --> 01:11:08.391
<v Speaker 4>person for a long time where I thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>of religion as being like an ideology </v>

1689
01:11:08.391 --> 01:11:10.560
<v Speaker 4>that controls your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as I've gotten older,</v>

1690
01:11:10.561 --> 01:11:15.561
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking more and more is that although </v>

1691
01:11:15.561 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 4>the Bible's definitely been altered by a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of different people,</v>

1692
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:23.331
<v Speaker 4>there's a difference between the Old </v>
<v Speaker 4>Testament in the new testament and even </v>

1693
01:11:23.331 --> 01:11:25.230
<v Speaker 4>the translations of the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to say something.</v>

1694
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.680
<v Speaker 4>They would try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wrote this fucking thing down and </v>

1695
01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.321
<v Speaker 4>passed it down more than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the Bible's almost like the story </v>

1696
01:11:33.321 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 4>of life because if you go that far back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no other stories.</v>

1697
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.270
<v Speaker 4>You go far</v>

1698
01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:42.050
<v Speaker 3>back in the old testament stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no,</v>

1699
01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:47.140
<v Speaker 3>there are no books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to go to other cultures that </v>

1700
01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:47.270
<v Speaker 3>had similar stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1701
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.270
<v Speaker 4>And that there were all the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the epic of Gilgamesh.</v>

1702
01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.430
<v Speaker 4>So similar to like know when the art is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these cool,</v>

1703
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.600
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got all these similarities were </v>

1704
01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:58.600
<v Speaker 3>trying to tell us about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1705
01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:02.120
<v Speaker 3>And most of it was be a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1706
01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was Christ message.</v>

1707
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:07.940
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in the watching my uncle </v>
<v Speaker 3>preach.</v>

1708
01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.000
<v Speaker 3>And so when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved church.</v>

1709
01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:12.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it,</v>

1710
01:12:12.171 --> 01:12:13.760
<v Speaker 3>loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to go watch him preach.</v>

1711
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I'd go watch him preach on Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday night and go watch him preach on </v>

1712
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Wednesday and a charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>

1713
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1714
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.630
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1715
01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.650
<v Speaker 3>and he comes from nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His mother was a hooker and uh,</v>

1716
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.070
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1717
01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.900
<v Speaker 3>all of the self made man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1718
01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>so I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we moved and I went to a </v>

1719
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.221
<v Speaker 3>regular Baptist church and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking get me out of this </v>

1720
01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:41.440
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker now where's the youth </v>
<v Speaker 3>group?</v>

1721
01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:47.650
<v Speaker 3>He used to have these youth groups that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were more fun than I've had anywhere </v>

1722
01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:47.650
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

1723
01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:49.970
<v Speaker 3>We had went on a choir tour where we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised money for it,</v>

1724
01:12:49.971 --> 01:12:54.971
<v Speaker 3>own pins or whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we all piled on a shitty bus </v>

1725
01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:56.870
<v Speaker 3>and took off saying it in churches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1726
01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:59.510
<v Speaker 3>and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was freedom.</v>

1727
01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:01.670
<v Speaker 3>It was total freedom because I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy,</v>

1728

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1923
01:21:27.251 --> 01:21:32.251
<v Speaker 2>And in the amazing pressure that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>face and being I in a lot of ways,</v>

1924
01:21:33.641 --> 01:21:37.480
<v Speaker 2>the voice of a comedic generation when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing chappelle show,</v>

1925
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:41.320
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of the defining show of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>

1926
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:46.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's really no parallel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does like what two seasons did he do </v>

1927
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:50.371
<v Speaker 2>two seasons seasons and then he had a </v>

<v Speaker 2>showed up in Africa or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what happened,</v>

1929
01:21:52.511 --> 01:21:55.860
<v Speaker 2>but had some of the best sketches ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one,</v>

1930
01:21:55.930 --> 01:22:00.930
<v Speaker 2>the blind guy who didn't know that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was black and he was a white </v>

1931
01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:01.570
<v Speaker 2>supremacist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1932
01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was in the KKK and he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that he was black because he was </v>

1933
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:07.140
<v Speaker 2>blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't.</v>

1934
01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:10.210
<v Speaker 2>One of the funniest bits the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe has ever seen.</v>

1935
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:16.100
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it for two years and it sorta </v>

1936
01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.870
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they tried to change his show and </v>

1937
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.870
<v Speaker 2>he just walked away,</v>

1938
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:19.810
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

1939
01:22:19.811 --> 01:22:21.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anybody tried to change his</v>
<v Speaker 5>show at.</v>

1940
01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:24.030
<v Speaker 5>I know they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do?</v>

1941
01:22:24.031 --> 01:22:25.890
<v Speaker 5>Okay then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I,</v>

1942
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:31.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he couldn't go into stand up </v>

1943
01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:32.010
<v Speaker 5>because they wouldn't leave them alone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1944
01:22:32.011 --> 01:22:36.300
<v Speaker 5>we couldn't start going because right </v>
<v Speaker 5>then he was ripe to play every major,</v>

1945
01:22:36.301 --> 01:22:38.310
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever he wanted to sell,</v>

1946
01:22:38.311 --> 01:22:39.980
<v Speaker 5>he could sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>still can.</v>

1947
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:42.450
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they would rick,</v>

1948
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:43.530
<v Speaker 5>James,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bitch,</v>

1949
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.760
<v Speaker 5>they would just scream at him the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>time and it,</v>

1950
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:48.210
<v Speaker 5>and I can only imagine how frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be.</v>

1951
01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.090
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1952
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:51.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that happened for a little while.</v>

1953
01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:55.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's security heavy.</v>

1954
01:22:55.530 --> 01:23:00.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to get thrown out of his </v>

1955
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:02.151
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a good chance you will because </v>

1956
01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:02.250
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of big guys walking </v>
<v Speaker 5>around and then they're,</v>

1957
01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they try to stay pretty low.</v>

1958
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 5>But if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think it's gonna be about you and</v>

1959
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Chappelle exchanging pleasantries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>urop,</v>

1960
01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:13.470
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be shut up and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>found out and set.</v>

1961
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.270
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll have somebody throwing out on one </v>

1963
01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:19.450
<v Speaker 3>of my shows and in two seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1964
01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:20.600

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:22.140
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw Christa,</v>

1966
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Leah's instagramming instagram the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was some,</v>

1967
01:23:24.171 --> 01:23:29.060
<v Speaker 4>a couple that was leaving and apparently</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were just really rude to him during</v>

1968
01:23:29.061 --> 01:23:31.310
<v Speaker 4>the show and they were yelling out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a loser and all this shit.</v>

1969
01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.270
<v Speaker 4>And he and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1970
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.050
<v Speaker 4>is so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's on.</v>

1971
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Chris is so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's on stage.</v>

1972
01:23:38.301 --> 01:23:39.930
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucking idiots.</v>

1973
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:41.120
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1974
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.950
<v Speaker 4>he's laughing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1975
01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:45.290
<v Speaker 4>one more thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one more thing by you fucking idiots.</v>

1976
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:47.870
<v Speaker 4>And the whole crowd starts cheering and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1977
01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:50.660
<v Speaker 4>it's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this a couple.</v>

1978
01:23:50.661 --> 01:23:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they just wouldn't stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>heckling him.</v>

1979
01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:58.060
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't stop calling him a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like managing pain and go see somebody </v>

1980
01:23:58.060 --> 01:23:58.060
<v Speaker 4>and then calling him a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1981
01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:01.070
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1982
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:02.600
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>

1983
01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:04.130
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's,</v>

1984
01:24:04.131 --> 01:24:05.840
<v Speaker 4>who needs a hug?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who needs a hug first?</v>

1985
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:07.480
<v Speaker 3>I got a pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

1986
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Pretty zero tolerance policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1987
01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:12.380
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not going to banter with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

1988
01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask you to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't do that then I'm going </v>

1989
01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:21.371
<v Speaker 3>to tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things have been set in motion that I </v>

1990
01:24:21.371 --> 01:24:24.161
<v Speaker 3>cannot stop because you didn't listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I said last time and I can't </v>

1991
01:24:24.161 --> 01:24:28.601
<v Speaker 3>because if I do that somebody is already</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking over and they're going to get </v>

1992
01:24:28.601 --> 01:24:28.601
<v Speaker 3>thrown out.</v>

1993
01:24:28.601 --> 01:24:29.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about some fucking mortal </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kombat.</v>

1994
01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.150
<v Speaker 4>Goddamn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:33.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people see this.</v>

1996
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:35.410
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1997
01:24:35.411 --> 01:24:38.020
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them just don't get it.</v>

1998
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:41.110
<v Speaker 4>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just too frustrating to interact</v>

1999
01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:43.390
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just want to make it about them and</v>

2000
01:24:43.391 --> 01:24:46.900
<v Speaker 4>scream out interruptive show for </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason,</v>

2001
01:24:46.901 --> 01:24:49.240
<v Speaker 4>and it's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's the way they were raised.</v>

2002
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:51.360
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's the fucking genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were handed down.</v>

2003
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Don't go to the theater a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things.</v>

2004
01:24:53.711 --> 01:24:55.510
<v Speaker 4>They might be drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might be fucked up.</v>

2005
01:24:55.511 --> 01:24:57.460
<v Speaker 4>They might have anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

2006
01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.680
<v Speaker 4>I think sometimes they think it helped </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that to give the comedian </v>

2007
01:25:02.841 --> 01:25:04.090
<v Speaker 4>something to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2008
01:25:04.091 --> 01:25:05.530
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they think it helps.</v>

2009
01:25:05.531 --> 01:25:10.531
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're trying to stump </v>
<v Speaker 4>the comic most of the time because me or</v>

2010
01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:11.680
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

2011
01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:15.740
<v Speaker 3>handling a hacker hacked hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a.</v>

2012
01:25:15.930 --> 01:25:18.350
<v Speaker 3>it's like playing ping pong with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken.</v>

2013
01:25:19.190 --> 01:25:21.410
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2014
01:25:21.411 --> 01:25:23.360
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just don't want to do it.</v>

2015
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:28.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to spend any time doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent all my time entertaining these </v>

2016
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:28.630
<v Speaker 3>other bunch of people.</v>

2017
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:30.560
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But occasionally I will.</v>

2018
01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.660
<v Speaker 4>I will open to the fact that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird exchange between a comedian and an</v>

2019
01:25:35.661 --> 01:25:36.800
<v Speaker 4>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So weird exchange.</v>

2020
01:25:36.801 --> 01:25:40.910
<v Speaker 4>And occasionally people say Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking funny.</v>

2021
01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.110
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is unfortunately,</v>

2022
01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:44.870
<v Speaker 4>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be more like that.</v>

2023
01:25:44.871 --> 01:25:46.370
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

2024
01:25:46.371 --> 01:25:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so fucking humorless.</v>

2025
01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.410
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

2026
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:51.520
<v Speaker 4>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2027
01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:53.770
<v Speaker 4>I bounced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughs off the laugh.</v>

2028
01:25:53.771 --> 01:25:56.240
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I'd do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd pace rhythm,</v>

2029
01:25:56.241 --> 01:25:56.930
<v Speaker 4>timing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

2030
01:25:56.931 --> 01:25:57.380
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to start you here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to dribble you to be slamming </v>

2032
01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.230
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you stopped,</v>

2033
01:26:04.650 --> 01:26:06.540
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2034
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:11.590
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm going to start dribbling down </v>

2035
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.590
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'll get there quick.</v>

2036
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:12.090

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2037
01:26:12.091 --> 01:26:17.091
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it always makes me mad and it shouldn't </v>

2038
01:26:17.091 --> 01:26:17.780
<v Speaker 5>make me mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shouldn't be the reaction,</v>

2039
01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:19.190
<v Speaker 5>but it does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes me mad.</v>

2040
01:26:19.191 --> 01:26:21.680
<v Speaker 5>It makes me mad because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have what I want.</v>

2041
01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:23.990
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're fucking it up.</v>

2042
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:25.430
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2043
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.900
<v Speaker 2>that definitely does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happens too.</v>

2044
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I just think every now and then someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>says some funny shit.</v>

2045
01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>

2046
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I should like the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking comedian.</v>

2047
01:26:39.490 --> 01:26:44.490
<v Speaker 2>One joke is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one time one of the best hackles </v>

2048
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:44.490
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in New Jersey.</v>

2049
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a theater in Jersey and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had this one joke,</v>

2050
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:50.500
<v Speaker 2>we're about a Kim Kardashian meeting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>

2051
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:51.430
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2052
01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.650
<v Speaker 2>who do you think is the most famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman in the world?</v>

01:26:54.130 --> 01:26:59.130
<v Speaker 2>And this guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mother and is the way said it was </v>

2054
01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:00.550
<v Speaker 2>perfect timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe he might've said,</v>

2055
01:27:00.551 --> 01:27:01.720
<v Speaker 2>your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mom.</v>

2056
01:27:01.721 --> 01:27:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I think you said your mom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking hilarious.</v>

2057
01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Your mind anytime you can say your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he wrong?</v>

2058
01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:12.810
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's 80 percent of the banter </v>

2059
01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:13.240
<v Speaker 2>that already should fear and I have with</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

2060
01:27:13.241 --> 01:27:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Was it your mom that sucked all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>dicks?</v>

2061

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2062
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:23.790
<v Speaker 2>The guy never handled again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the one hackle in one show where </v>

2063
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.790
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

2064
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:25.870
<v Speaker 2>He went in like a Ninja.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He dropped a nuclear bomb.</v>

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:31.640
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you tell him that?</v>

2068
01:27:31.641 --> 01:27:34.300
<v Speaker 5>Don't try it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The admitted.</v>

2069
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:36.830
<v Speaker 5>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever you can say that,</v>

2070
01:27:36.831 --> 01:27:38.720
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to get why I can't do that,</v>

2071
01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:41.060
<v Speaker 5>but I sure can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just makes me,</v>

2072
01:27:41.061 --> 01:27:43.880
<v Speaker 5>it just pisses me off sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

2073
01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.220
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a heckler supporter,</v>

2074
01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.740
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying just like this is what a</v>

2075
01:27:51.741 --> 01:27:54.860
<v Speaker 5>live show is really some weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>interaction.</v>

2076
01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:59.861
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think people like to know that </v>

2077
01:27:59.861 --> 01:27:59.861
<v Speaker 5>you're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2078
01:27:59.861 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 5>when I'd been doing standup for for six </v>
<v Speaker 5>years and I was headlining comedy clubs,</v>

2079
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:07.450
<v Speaker 5>I prayed to God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody would heckle me because I </v>

2080
01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:07.940
<v Speaker 5>couldn't get to 45 minutes without it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2081
01:28:08.170 --> 01:28:13.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I needed to about four or five minutes </v>

2082
01:28:13.170 --> 01:28:15.090
<v Speaker 5>of Jabber and I asked him how he sees </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they're from and,</v>

2083
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:15.660
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2084
01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:20.830
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is pure third grade comedy and uh,</v>

2085
01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.570
<v Speaker 5>and I'm clearly a fourth grader.</v>

2086
01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:31.170
<v Speaker 2>How long is it before someone does a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hologram show where you go to a theater </v>

2087
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.670
<v Speaker 2>and the holograms are so good that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like it's already there,</v>

2088
01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:38.770
<v Speaker 2>but you are running on another side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet,</v>

2089
01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.060
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's already there.</v>

2090
01:28:40.061 --> 01:28:40.810
<v Speaker 5>Do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.931
<v Speaker 5>drive that are doing the most amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is it's still needs to evolve,</v>

2096

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2099
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:58.750
<v Speaker 5>well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it still needs to evolve.</v>

2100
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.290
<v Speaker 5>See</v>

2101
01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.260
<v Speaker 2>when they did it on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when used,</v>

2102
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:06.290
<v Speaker 2>they used it for the elections one year </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had like Wolf Blitzer in the </v>

2103
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Hologram.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that about?</v>

2105
01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:11.730

<v Speaker 2>this is freaking people the fuck out.</v>

2106
01:29:11.731 --> 01:29:15.220

<v Speaker 2>That's what the fuck is wolf blitzer do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in a hologram.</v>

2108
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Can you just put a camera on them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wherever the fuck he is.</v>

2109
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Why do you have to show me a Hologram?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on here?</v>

2110
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.640
<v Speaker 2>People just read right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2111
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's now they just can't do it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as they want to.</v>

2112
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.300
<v Speaker 2>So without it costing a gillion dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they eventually,</v>

2113
01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you can do it on your fucking phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can project an image of something </v>

2114
01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking right there in front of </v>

2144
01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Jones here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that looks crazy.</v>

2145
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long before people started doing </v>

2146
01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:10.000
<v Speaker 2>standup like that where the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>will heckle but it won't work because </v>

2147
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.091
<v Speaker 2>you're not really there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it only works if everybody shut the </v>

2148
01:31:14.091 --> 01:31:15.320
<v Speaker 2>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just keep on moving us through.</v>

2149
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what they'll do is they'll film you</v>

2150
01:31:18.691 --> 01:31:23.160
<v Speaker 2>doing us set somewhere in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd with this hologram thing,</v>

2151
01:31:23.161 --> 01:31:24.210
<v Speaker 2>projecting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there'll be.</v>

2152
01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:27.430
<v Speaker 2>You'll do a live show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the live show is only going to be,</v>

2153
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:33.590
<v Speaker 2>it'll be something that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could be in your living room at </v>

2154
01:31:33.871 --> 01:31:35.950
<v Speaker 2>some point that I,</v>

2155
01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:39.310
<v Speaker 3>for a limited amount of</v>

2156
01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.540
<v Speaker 2>dates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2157
01:31:41.010 --> 01:31:45.270
<v Speaker 2>still can if you have a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But eventually,</v>

2158
01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

2159
01:31:47.011 --> 01:31:48.580
<v Speaker 2>where does it stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does it stop?</v>

2160
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:53.600
<v Speaker 2>If you can do that right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then eventually you will be able to do </v>

2161
01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:53.600
<v Speaker 2>it on a small scale.</v>

2162
01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.130
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2163
01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:06.100
<v Speaker 2>is a drone now that will follow you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take pictures of you or have you seen </v>

2166
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:06.130
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it floats,</v>

2167
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.350
<v Speaker 2>floats above you and films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>films,</v>

2168
01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:10.690
<v Speaker 2>pictures of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't like film stuff?</v>

2169
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 2>I have one.</v>

2170
01:32:12.690 --> 01:32:13.450
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with it?</v>

2171
01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lately,</v>

2172
01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:18.310
<v Speaker 3>now that I live at the montage in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Beverly Hills,</v>

2173
01:32:18.311 --> 01:32:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and take a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just take footage of it and turn it </v>

2175
01:32:27.611 --> 01:32:32.611
<v Speaker 3>around snapshots and show up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is I used to live off of </v>

2177
01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:37.030
<v Speaker 3>So if it crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just going to go into the canyon.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about it every once in awhile that it is</v>

<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2198
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:46.830
<v Speaker 2>This pose looks like bull shit.</v>

2199
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:47.610
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

2200
01:33:47.611 --> 01:33:52.611
<v Speaker 2>a guy that was on the ski slopes and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in some sort of Olympic competition </v>

2201
01:33:52.611 --> 01:33:54.750
<v Speaker 2>or something and the drone fell behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2202
01:33:55.050 --> 01:33:56.260
<v Speaker 2>like right behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2203
01:33:56.790 --> 01:34:01.580
<v Speaker 3>barely mentioned was a big drone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Drum with a movie camera on.</v>

2210
01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:16.350
<v Speaker 2>It probably would have fucked him up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2211
01:34:16.351 --> 01:34:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Look at this with this thing and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen it in high speed.</v>

2212
01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

<v Speaker 2>look at that watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2214

<v Speaker 2>And it looks like it's hard to tell.</v>

2215
01:34:25.531 --> 01:34:30.531
<v Speaker 2>We got back to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looks like just to get to about a</v>

2216
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.460
<v Speaker 2>billion pieces that would have fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt,</v>

2217
01:34:32.461 --> 01:34:36.360
<v Speaker 2>like hell that hit him.</v>

01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:30.690
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy goes,</v>

2303
01:38:30.970 --> 01:38:35.970
<v Speaker 5>he's anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could get a picture of me while I'm </v>

2304
01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:35.970
<v Speaker 5>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what?</v>

2305
01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:41.740
<v Speaker 4>So those are their drones that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>navigate around trees and things.</v>

2306
01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:47.400
<v Speaker 5>These won't hit a wall if come near.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2307
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 5>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have that.</v>

2308
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:52.760
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ron White,</v>

2309
01:38:52.761 --> 01:38:57.200
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck are we allowing these </v>
<v Speaker 4>flying robots to be?</v>

2310
01:38:57.370 --> 01:38:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Was that big</v>

2311
01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:03.090
<v Speaker 5>case in Texas?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My son was telling me about it where </v>

2312
01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:05.281
<v Speaker 5>this guy was a flu is drone into another</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy's yard and he shot it with a shotgun</v>

2313
01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.540
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2314
01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:09.440
<v Speaker 5>you're filming my family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2315
01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:12.310
<v Speaker 5>and so now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2316
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:14.800
<v Speaker 5>who's at fault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't own that airspace.</v>

2317
01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.860
<v Speaker 5>I may send,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seems like you don't,</v>

2318
01:39:16.890 --> 01:39:18.400
<v Speaker 5>a foot or two of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2319
01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.840
<v Speaker 5>of your own airspace.</v>

2320
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:25.490
<v Speaker 4>Totally new dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's one more piece of technology </v>

2321
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 4>that brings us like weirdly more </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected,</v>

2322
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:29.070
<v Speaker 4>some sort of strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost forced way.</v>

2323
01:39:29.071 --> 01:39:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Like now we thought the only way to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>around was essentially by being on foot.</v>

2324
01:39:33.811 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 4>So you can put up a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now if you can fly in three d space,</v>

2325
01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:39.270
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2326
01:39:39.271 --> 01:39:41.600
<v Speaker 4>where am I allowed to go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where am I not allowed to go?</v>

2327
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:46.810
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I owe you allowed to fly over anybody's </v>

2328
01:39:46.810 --> 01:39:46.810
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does that work?</v>

2329
01:39:46.810 --> 01:39:50.841
<v Speaker 4>And as technology gets closer and closer</v>
<v Speaker 4>and closer and closer to whatever the </v>

2330
01:39:50.841 --> 01:39:55.071
<v Speaker 4>fuck the singularity is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to probably physically be </v>

2331
01:39:55.071 --> 01:39:55.380
<v Speaker 4>able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what?</v>

2332
01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now,</v>

2333
01:39:56.191 --> 01:40:01.191
<v Speaker 4>we can't physically fly around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too difficult to have some sort of </v>

2334
01:40:01.191 --> 01:40:01.191
<v Speaker 4>a jet pack</v>

2335
01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.740
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

2336
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:06.980
<v Speaker 5>those empty promises rang hollow years </v>
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>

2337
01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:08.990
<v Speaker 5>The jet packs</v>

2338
01:40:09.190 --> 01:40:11.380
<v Speaker 4>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as technology improves,</v>

2339
01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.800
<v Speaker 4>there's a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a possibility within our </v>

2340
01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:16.800
<v Speaker 4>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have some,</v>

2341
01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.120
<v Speaker 4>some sort of propulsion system that </v>
<v Speaker 4>works on some sort of a vast that you </v>

2342
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:21.120
<v Speaker 4>would wear.</v>

2343
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.270
<v Speaker 5>It's totally yours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All you gotta do to see what's gonna </v>

2344
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.450
<v Speaker 5>happen the next hundred years is look at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last hundred years.</v>

2345
01:40:25.451 --> 01:40:26.460
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

2346
01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:30.970
<v Speaker 5>and that kind of momentum is going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>continue straight on until this,</v>

2347
01:40:30.971 --> 01:40:35.971
<v Speaker 5>it looks like an antique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why did they ever do it this way?</v>

2348
01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:39.760
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything we're doing is stupid.</v>

2349
01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:45.090
<v Speaker 5>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Ron gotten a car and drove and they </v>

2350
01:40:47.381 --> 01:40:49.200
<v Speaker 5>did what they meant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2351
01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:52.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah man,</v>

2352
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like the</v>

2353
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.940
<v Speaker 2>strangest times ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really feel like every day it feels so</v>

2354
01:40:57.941 --> 01:41:00.570
<v Speaker 2>strange like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2355
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.490
<v Speaker 2>the fact that Donald Trump is really the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

2356
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feels so strange.</v>

2357
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2358
01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:08.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

2359
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:11.640
<v Speaker 3>I didn't vote for the president elect </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2360
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did get my tax estimates two days </v>

2361
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.880
<v Speaker 3>ago and when I looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2362
01:41:17.881 --> 01:41:22.881
<v Speaker 3>go trump now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to say that I agree with </v>

2363
01:41:22.881 --> 01:41:24.210
<v Speaker 3>anything he's ever said to live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2364
01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:26.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how these,</v>

2365
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:32.030
<v Speaker 3>how these really risk either getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>away with paying three percent and I </v>

2366
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:34.080
<v Speaker 3>play paid 34 percent tax on this money </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2367
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:35.710
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2368
01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

2369
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:37.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2370
01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.790
<v Speaker 3>he did get elected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2371
01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:44.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going to get the benefits of those </v>

2372
01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:44.240
<v Speaker 3>tax breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't trade my country for it,</v>

2373
01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:44.900
<v Speaker 3>but I'll take them.</v>

2374
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:49.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just fascinating because he's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first truly famous,</v>

2375
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:53.030
<v Speaker 2>like super famous guy who ran for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president and one,</v>

2376
01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:58.060
<v Speaker 2>no Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Reagan can fuck trump and </v>

2377
01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:59.120
<v Speaker 2>the super famous to park on Reagan with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a movie star Dude.</v>

2378
01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:04.450
<v Speaker 2>There was a movie star and back when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had televisions that when I was,</v>

2379
01:42:04.730 --> 01:42:05.070
<v Speaker 2>that was</v>

2380
01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:10.430
<v Speaker 3>six or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

2381
01:42:10.431 --> 01:42:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember</v>

2382
01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.280
<v Speaker 2>that was either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember I was not good with </v>

2383
01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.391
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely wasn't voting age during </v>

2384
01:42:18.391 --> 01:42:20.400
<v Speaker 2>their deed administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Reagan was as big a star as </v>

2385
01:42:20.471 --> 01:42:25.471
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that apprentice celebrity apprentice </v>

2386
01:42:25.471 --> 01:42:25.710
<v Speaker 2>show that was a big world</v>

2387
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.860
<v Speaker 3>wide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2388
01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2389
01:42:28.451 --> 01:42:30.030
<v Speaker 3>but us wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2390
01:42:30.031 --> 01:42:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I am absolutely every bit as famous and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2391
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:35.090
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it was a source of anger,</v>

2392
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.340
<v Speaker 2>swartz for short of sorts and ran for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

2393
01:42:38.341 --> 01:42:40.620
<v Speaker 2>He was allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not allowed to because he's born in</v>

2394
01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Austria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd went fucking when I think it went,</v>

2395
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if trump can win for short </v>

2396
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.390
<v Speaker 2>swartz Nigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think he does.</v>

2397
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Todd is very important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2398
01:42:52.111 --> 01:42:52.530
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2399
01:42:52.531 --> 01:42:54.510
<v Speaker 3>that I think changed the lives of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

2400
01:42:54.511 --> 01:42:59.511
<v Speaker 3>You can unfuck the babysitter can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a babysitter,</v>

2401
01:43:00.930 --> 01:43:05.930
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what it Adele fuck the babysitter </v>

2402
01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:05.930
<v Speaker 3>is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what can happen,</v>

2403
01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:07.170
<v Speaker 2>but people still love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know what he is.</v>

2404
01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:08.980
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2405
01:43:09.210 --> 01:43:10.650
<v Speaker 3>that's all he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2406
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:15.830
<v Speaker 3>he smokes cigars at this place where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke cigars sometimes as I'm walking </v>

2407
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:16.270
<v Speaker 3>out of a building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2408
01:43:16.271 --> 01:43:18.350
<v Speaker 3>hey governor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't say anything</v>

2409
01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:21.720
<v Speaker 2>when you still call him governor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2410
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I would call them whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

2411
01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:26.350
<v Speaker 2>I met him once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I probably called him brother.</v>

2412
01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Everybody brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2413
01:43:29.410 --> 01:43:31.030

<v Speaker 2>he was super cool.</v>

2414
01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I met him at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Why was there never a moment that you </v>

2522
01:48:19.061 --> 01:48:24.061
<v Speaker 7>thought it might be time to retire?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You would want to come from?</v>

<v Speaker 7>older and I think of Bob Hope.</v>

<v Speaker 7>and then to want to keep working because</v>

2528
01:48:48.970 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 7>we do it well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And how about um,</v>

<v Speaker 7>how is it different for you?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I kind of see his point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see both of them.</v>

2535
01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:12.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's pointing to Jerry's point.</v>

2536
01:49:13.150 --> 01:49:18.150
<v Speaker 5>This guy's asking ridiculously stupid </v>
<v Speaker 5>questions to one of the most famous </v>

2537
01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:22.480
<v Speaker 5>comedians are convenient for certainly </v>
<v Speaker 5>the best comedic actor,</v>

2538
01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.670
<v Speaker 5>one of the best comedic actors that ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>lived.</v>

2539
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:30.300
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why aren't you more like your dead </v>

2540
01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:30.300
<v Speaker 5>friends?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2541
01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:30.790
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2542
01:49:30.970 --> 01:49:32.860
<v Speaker 7>because I'm not fucking dead.</v>

2543
01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2544
01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I think with a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to have a conversation </v>

2545
01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:45.171
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have to be like in a </v>

2546
01:49:45.171 --> 01:49:47.190
<v Speaker 2>podcast form and it's going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be with someone who really respects,</v>

2547
01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:49.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2548
01:49:49.151 --> 01:49:54.151
<v Speaker 2>someone who's going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation that at this point in his </v>

2549
01:49:54.151 --> 01:49:57.151
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after all the movies and all the stuff </v>

2550
01:49:57.151 --> 01:49:57.151
<v Speaker 2>that guy's done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably doesn't want.</v>

2551
01:49:57.151 --> 01:49:58.810
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to deal with any </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit anymore.</v>

2552
01:49:59.030 --> 01:50:02.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like to him it was like,</v>

2553
01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:03.700
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck am I doing?</v>

2554
01:50:03.701 --> 01:50:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Why am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feels uninspired.</v>

2555
01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:08.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I did the other day,</v>

2556
01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.870
<v Speaker 3>this was the worst decision I ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the worst,</v>

2557
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:18.170
<v Speaker 3>but it be really bad when mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom's in town and we're staying at </v>

2558
01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:20.430
<v Speaker 3>the montage because the house got </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed.</v>

2559
01:50:20.431 --> 01:50:21.690
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2565
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:33.240
<v Speaker 3>that's Kinda like a puddle of mud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2566

<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>buses and uh,</v>

01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:48.380
<v Speaker 3>take you in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we go on the TMZ bus cause I saw the </v>

2571
01:50:50.071 --> 01:50:53.820
<v Speaker 3>TMZ is the big double decker things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not their bus.</v>

2572
01:50:54.150 --> 01:50:57.660
<v Speaker 3>They advertised for TMZ on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those buses,</v>

2573
01:50:57.661 --> 01:51:02.661
<v Speaker 3>but their buses are little buses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a big bunch of television </v>

2574
01:51:02.701 --> 01:51:06.860
<v Speaker 3>screens and they just blast all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>footage of uh,</v>

2575
01:51:06.861 --> 01:51:07.320
<v Speaker 3>of the.</v>

2576
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:10.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened in there?</v>

2577

<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2579
01:51:16.651 --> 01:51:19.200
<v Speaker 3>really annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like Mama,</v>

2580
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I because we thought we were going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>really passive,</v>

2581
01:51:23.761 --> 01:51:24.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2582
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:27.630
<v Speaker 3>and that's where Jerry Lewis live for 45</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2583
01:51:27.631 --> 01:51:30.670
<v Speaker 3>And right there is where there's George </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlin with the house and there,</v>

2584
01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:31.890
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

2585
01:51:31.891 --> 01:51:34.080
<v Speaker 3>it was in your face loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2586
01:51:34.081 --> 01:51:39.081
<v Speaker 3>you were just forced to watch an episode</v>
<v Speaker 3>to TMZ and they,</v>

2587
01:51:40.650 --> 01:51:45.650
<v Speaker 3>somebody tied you to a fucking chair and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't let you go and just turned it </v>

2588
01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:50.280
<v Speaker 3>the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how fucking annoying it was.</v>

2589
01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:51.780
<v Speaker 3>And it just horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

2590
01:51:51.781 --> 01:51:53.350
<v Speaker 3>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2591
01:51:53.490 --> 01:51:57.450
<v Speaker 3>so at one point in the tour they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll be passing the montage hotel.</v>

2592
01:51:57.451 --> 01:51:58.230
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2593
01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.960
<v Speaker 3>let's get off mom and she would get out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of here.</v>

2594
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:03.090
<v Speaker 3>So we scooted off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>

2595
01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.290
<v Speaker 3>it was nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>

2596
01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:07.380
<v Speaker 3>And I liked those guys at TMZ when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're friends of mine.</v>

2597
01:52:07.381 --> 01:52:08.150
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2598
01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:12.210
<v Speaker 3>would you please fucking turn it down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother brought,</v>

2599
01:52:12.211 --> 01:52:15.120
<v Speaker 3>my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought my mom.</v>

2600
01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for the guy that was asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the questions to Jerry Lewis too because</v>

2601
01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:20.570
<v Speaker 2>he probably thought he would get to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nice,</v>

2602
01:52:20.571 --> 01:52:23.980
<v Speaker 2>friendly conversation with a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably totally intimidated.</v>

2603
01:52:23.981 --> 01:52:27.540
<v Speaker 2>He's in Jerry Lewis's house having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with them and he,</v>

2604
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:30.320
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to that one answer.</v>

2605
01:52:30.321 --> 01:52:32.270
<v Speaker 2>One word answer place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2606
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that that was when he starts </v>

2607
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.510
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're in verbal combat,</v>

2608
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:40.720
<v Speaker 2>but listen to what the questions were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions guys,</v>

2609
01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:45.820
<v Speaker 2>90 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about why aren't you more </v>

2610
01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:45.820
<v Speaker 2>like dead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2611
01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:48.140
<v Speaker 2>That's what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you answer that question?</v>

2612
01:52:48.230 --> 01:52:51.590
<v Speaker 2>It was a poorly designed conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>

2613
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:56.620
<v Speaker 2>horribly designed conversation and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was obviously that's how Jerry Lewis </v>

2614
01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:00.371
<v Speaker 2>felt and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could tell the guy who was </v>

2615
01:53:00.371 --> 01:53:00.371
<v Speaker 2>asking a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of,</v>

2616
01:53:00.371 --> 01:53:01.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was treading on water,</v>

2617
01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 2>is trying to figure out how to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck through this while he's talking,</v>

2618
01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:05.720
<v Speaker 2>living in and figure it out.</v>

2619
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:06.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>

2620
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.760
<v Speaker 2>He didn't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought he should have met.</v>

2621
01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably meant well and just ran into</v>

2622
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:15.700
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preparedness.</v>

2623
01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Unpreparedness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2624
01:53:17.050 --> 01:53:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird Gig to the,</v>

2625
01:53:19.741 --> 01:53:24.741
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to ad Lib and ask questions </v>

2626
01:53:24.741 --> 01:53:27.281
<v Speaker 2>to some living legend like Jerry Lewis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just not realize while you're doing </v>

2627
01:53:27.281 --> 01:53:31.391
<v Speaker 2>it in your narrative that you set up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head as probably disrespectful to </v>

2628
01:53:31.391 --> 01:53:35.201
<v Speaker 2>him because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're comparing him to all these dead </v>

2629
01:53:35.201 --> 01:53:35.201
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why are you still working?</v>

2630
01:53:35.201 --> 01:53:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Why you're essentially saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catch that.</v>

2631
01:53:37.130 --> 01:53:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Abby that catch that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be fucking why?</v>

2632
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:45.560
<v Speaker 2>You almost have to wonder why he decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

2633
01:53:45.561 --> 01:53:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just the Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporter.</v>

2634
01:53:47.121 --> 01:53:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal,</v>

2635
01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.500
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2636
01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:52.270
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2637
01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2638
01:53:52.761 --> 01:53:55.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he still sell tickets?</v>

2639
01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:56.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that he works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he?</v>

2640
01:53:56.901 --> 01:54:01.901
<v Speaker 2>Does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what the guy was talking </v>

2641
01:54:01.901 --> 01:54:03.551
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if Jerry Lewis still has standup </v>

2642
01:54:03.551 --> 01:54:03.551
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had just got done.</v>

2646
01:54:07.410 --> 01:54:07.880
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2650
01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:19.220
<v Speaker 2>one of us flaked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what happened,</v>

2651
01:54:19.221 --> 01:54:21.650
<v Speaker 2>but bill wound up going when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in California,</v>

2652
01:54:21.651 --> 01:54:26.651
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make a separate trip to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegas just to see a bill cosby and </v>

2653
01:54:26.651 --> 01:54:27.220
<v Speaker 2>burst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said he was fucking amazing.</v>

2654
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Said he was fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the scandal broke afterwards.</v>

2655
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:36.270
<v Speaker 2>This touring stopped and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just became a totally different </v>

2656
01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:36.270
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2657
01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:40.060
<v Speaker 2>we have that VIP company that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>promoted,</v>

2658
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:42.460
<v Speaker 2>we do other people's be api stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>besides my head,</v>

2659
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:47.470
<v Speaker 2>we do other peoples and we had just had </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosby this stuff breaks and he wouldn't </v>

2660
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:48.590
<v Speaker 2>be the perfect client for it because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2661
01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.710
<v Speaker 2>he's looking for trim anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2662
01:54:51.711 --> 01:54:52.640
<v Speaker 2>after the show.</v>

2663
01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.820
<v Speaker 2>So he was going to want to hang and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it would've been a great.</v>

2664
01:54:55.821 --> 01:55:00.821
<v Speaker 2>Probably would have been our best client</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Aa still solved a lot of tickets </v>

2665
01:55:00.821 --> 01:55:03.350
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this and even with Jerry Lewis,</v>

2666
01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>November twelfth,</v>

2667
01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:07.160
<v Speaker 2>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So real recent.</v>

2668
01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.530
<v Speaker 2>The last shot could find listed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2669
01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:14.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a really recent chair of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where was that international film </v>

2670
01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:17.360
<v Speaker 2>festival?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was probably him talking about,</v>

2671
01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:20.480
<v Speaker 2>which still would be fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2672
01:55:20.481 --> 01:55:23.100
<v Speaker 2>that would be fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm pretty sure he does stand up.</v>

2673
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure Jerry Lewis still does </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a standup show.</v>

2674
01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:30.650
<v Speaker 2>I think he had to show it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said that at the South Point and Vegas.</v>

2675
01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any recent shows listed or</v>

2676
01:55:33.401 --> 01:55:33.830
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2677
01:55:33.831 --> 01:55:35.300

<v Speaker 2>When was the last show?</v>

2678
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:40.330
<v Speaker 2>There was a article from September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so have some shows at the end of the </v>

2679
01:55:40.330 --> 01:55:40.330
<v Speaker 2>pretty recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2680
01:55:40.330 --> 01:55:42.050
<v Speaker 2>So within the last year he's still </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

2681
01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

2682
01:55:45.630 --> 01:55:46.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

2683
01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.000
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you go back and watch like the</v>

2684
01:55:51.001 --> 01:55:54.990
<v Speaker 4>nutty professor like we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about and how that influence dice,</v>

2685
01:55:55.340 --> 01:56:00.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go back and watch that and just </v>

2686
01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:00.340
<v Speaker 4>realize there had been nothing before </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2687
01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:05.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was Charlie Chapman and there's </v>

2688
01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:06.630
<v Speaker 4>a few chaplain wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

2689
01:56:06.631 --> 01:56:08.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't listen to me.</v>

2690
01:56:08.221 --> 01:56:11.760
<v Speaker 4>I'll stop now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But three stooges,</v>

2691
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:13.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some fucking great shit,</v>

2692
01:56:15.570 --> 01:56:18.690
<v Speaker 4>but God damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

2693
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:21.390
<v Speaker 4>those guys were like real pioneers </v>
<v Speaker 4>account.</v>

2694
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:25.920
<v Speaker 4>How many decades ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie comedy been around back when Jerry</v>

2695
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:26.970
<v Speaker 4>Lewis was doing those movies?</v>

2696
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2697
01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:31.090
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can look at it.</v>

2698
01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2699
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:37.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some comics build bridges and most </v>

2700
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:42.201
<v Speaker 3>comics walk across those bridges after </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've already been built and it's </v>

2701
01:56:42.201 --> 01:56:45.800
<v Speaker 3>substantially and set in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Louis certainly built a bridge that </v>

2702
01:56:47.371 --> 01:56:52.371
<v Speaker 3>Jim Carrey walked across in Ballerina </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes and he knows it in and uh,</v>

2703
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:57.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because that extraordinary,</v>

2704
01:56:58.350 --> 01:57:02.900
<v Speaker 3>a comedic talent that comes out of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>two people are view,</v>

2705
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:06.030
<v Speaker 3>so identifiable and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2706
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:10.100
<v Speaker 3>I think that Pat Paul's and were built a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bridge that uh,</v>

2707
01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Steven Wright walked across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean steven didn't do </v>

2708
01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:16.800
<v Speaker 3>it better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't invent it.</v>

2709
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:21.390
<v Speaker 4>But don't you think all of us are in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in essence,</v>

2710
01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:22.270
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2711
01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:27.220
<v Speaker 4>in a way some sort of a group thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're all kinds of lily.</v>

2712
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:28.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

2713
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:32.850
<v Speaker 4>We're all kind of influenced by each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other standards and what you appreciate,</v>

2714
01:57:32.851 --> 01:57:35.460
<v Speaker 4>like as a comic has been doing it for as</v>
<v Speaker 4>many years as you have.</v>

2715
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:36.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2716
01:57:36.601 --> 01:57:38.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm just two years after you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a.</v>

2717
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:42.870
<v Speaker 4>well why don't I start August 27th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1988.</v>

2718
01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.340
<v Speaker 4>So it's about two years after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

2719
01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:51.740
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means we basically started the </v>

2720

<v Speaker 3>same day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

2722
01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:54.080
<v Speaker 4>I started like literally a week apart </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Greg Fitzsimmons.</v>

2723
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Greg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know him well,</v>

2724
01:57:57.231 --> 01:58:00.110
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we worked together somewhere and uh,</v>

2725
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:02.780
<v Speaker 3>and he's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking hilarious.</v>

2726
01:58:02.781 --> 01:58:04.510
<v Speaker 3>He's a smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell you what,</v>

2727
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:06.440
<v Speaker 3>I tell people all the time and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2728
01:58:06.441 --> 01:58:11.441
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the comedy store and make a </v>

2729
01:58:11.441 --> 01:58:14.411
<v Speaker 3>vacation around it and it goes it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there because people are going to come </v>

2730
01:58:14.411 --> 01:58:16.480
<v Speaker 3>in and that room rattles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rattles and you,</v>

2731
01:58:16.481 --> 01:58:21.481
<v Speaker 3>you better be prepared to do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>or that you're not going to follow some </v>

2732
01:58:21.481 --> 01:58:22.210
<v Speaker 3>of these fucking guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2733
01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:23.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2734
01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:25.990
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really strong and,</v>

2735
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:31.310
<v Speaker 3>and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes it so much fucking </v>

2736
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.760
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pirate ship fill with murderers.</v>

2737
01:58:34.150 --> 01:58:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Kayla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kayla</v>

2738
01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:39.080
<v Speaker 4>water fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going on after savages.</v>

2739
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:44.910
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody's riding the wave of </v>

2740
01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:45.880
<v Speaker 4>everybody else and it's an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>supportive place.</v>

2741
01:58:46.410 --> 01:58:51.410
<v Speaker 4>We stop and think about how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>comradery and friendship there is </v>

2742
01:58:51.410 --> 01:58:54.451
<v Speaker 4>between the convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would think if you get all these </v>

2743
01:58:54.451 --> 01:58:54.451
<v Speaker 4>national comedians at tour all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

2744
01:58:54.451 --> 01:58:55.110
<v Speaker 4>you put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2745
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:58.120
<v Speaker 4>ego battles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be weird that it's a total</v>

2746
01:58:58.121 --> 01:59:00.520
<v Speaker 4>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That places a love fest.</v>

2747
01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.010
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's hugging everybody and high </v>
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>

2748
01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:04.060
<v Speaker 4>And then having drinks,</v>

2749
01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:06.730
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of fucking me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go on,</v>

2750
01:59:06.731 --> 01:59:11.731

<v Speaker 3>right in the fucking mail and a and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's what I like to do is hit </v>

2752

<v Speaker 3>him right in the fucking mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2753
01:59:20.110 --> 01:59:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And then I guarantee you if somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just got through it and him in the </v>

2754
01:59:25.110 --> 01:59:25.110
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's still.</v>

2755
01:59:25.110 --> 01:59:27.280
<v Speaker 3>I've been bled off their face when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

2756
01:59:27.281 --> 01:59:29.500
<v Speaker 3>as my attorney did have in the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll hit him in the mouth anyway.</v>

2757
01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:30.780
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a,</v>

2758
01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:34.630
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crowds that you get a hold of are so</v>

2759
01:59:34.631 --> 01:59:39.631
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's lots of swordfish on the </v>

2760
01:59:39.631 --> 01:59:41.680
<v Speaker 3>end of a fucking line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just vibrates,</v>

2761
01:59:41.681 --> 01:59:42.940
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey</v>

2762

<v Speaker 4>in the O,</v>

2763
01:59:46.710 --> 01:59:50.050
<v Speaker 4>r that I felt like I was having a </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious experience.</v>

2764

2766
02:00:01.511 --> 02:00:04.540
<v Speaker 4>I was laughing so hard.</v>

<v Speaker 4>this is a special place,</v>

02:00:08.110 --> 02:00:12.880
<v Speaker 4>like this is a rare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rare little jewel in the universe of all</v>

2769
02:00:12.881 --> 02:00:15.310
<v Speaker 4>the different performing arts at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>one place.</v>

2770
02:00:15.311 --> 02:00:18.220
<v Speaker 4>It's just sort of fucking cracked down </v>
<v Speaker 4>the focus.</v>

2771
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>going to pay those guys to put a show on</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you that you just saw tonight.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a ticket.</v>

2782
02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:47.000
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is.</v>

2783
02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:48.350
<v Speaker 3>It is expensive.</v>

2784
02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.500
<v Speaker 4>It's also like a really like honestly </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical place to shoot.</v>

2785
02:00:52.770 --> 02:00:55.350
<v Speaker 4>If your new stuff sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll let you know.</v>

2786
02:00:55.410 --> 02:00:55.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2787
02:00:58.470 --> 02:01:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first started here,</v>

2788
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I really had a great little burst of </v>
<v Speaker 3>material that I really like and,</v>

2789
02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:10.290
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's all the front end of my show </v>

2790
02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:12.641
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about 20 minutes long or that I </v>

2791
02:01:12.641 --> 02:01:13.340
<v Speaker 3>want for the front end of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want.</v>

2792
02:01:13.341 --> 02:01:15.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm doing now in the front </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of my live show.</v>

2793
02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:19.180
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's.</v>

2794
02:01:21.110 --> 02:01:25.110
<v Speaker 3>But now it seems like I'm just playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>around with the order that stuff to just</v>

2795
02:01:25.170 --> 02:01:30.170
<v Speaker 3>see where it works the best and just how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just fucking really slap him in the </v>

2796
02:01:30.170 --> 02:01:30.380
<v Speaker 3>face with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2797
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:35.440
<v Speaker 3>because eventually over time your act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get into a place where it does </v>

2798
02:01:36.051 --> 02:01:40.340
<v Speaker 3>drift into the spot it needs to be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't have that kind of time.</v>

2799
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:45.080
<v Speaker 5>So I need to look at it and do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>different ways and see where it needs to</v>

2800
02:01:45.081 --> 02:01:50.081
<v Speaker 5>be a to just slap the fuck out of which </v>
<v Speaker 5>is my only go is the slap the fuck out </v>

2801
02:01:53.061 --> 02:01:54.860
<v Speaker 5>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2802
02:01:55.210 --> 02:02:00.210
<v Speaker 5>and when I can't do that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll keep doing it for a little couple </v>

2803
02:02:00.210 --> 02:02:01.370
<v Speaker 5>of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He slapped the fuck out of him and I,</v>

2804
02:02:01.371 --> 02:02:03.470
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy watching you slap the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of him,</v>

2805
02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:05.600

<v Speaker 5>out of.</v>

2884
02:04:55.140 --> 02:05:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Facetime is a another level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment other than texting with </v>

2885
02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:00.630
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start facetiming friends,</v>

02:05:00.631 --> 02:05:01.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2890
02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:09.570
<v Speaker 3>because I don't want to prove where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

2891
02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They can't communicate with each other.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get yourself an android phone and she's </v>

2895
02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:20.580
<v Speaker 2>listening to this skyping from the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the movie.</v>

2896
02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there's like some sort of a </v>

2897
02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>setting that you can have on you.</v>

2903
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:36.310
<v Speaker 2>People have these goggles where they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>stream.</v>

2904
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:41.550
<v Speaker 2>They can stream video from their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyeglasses like anyway they want </v>

<v Speaker 2>I could show what I'm seeing.</v>

2908
02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:51.400
<v Speaker 2>I could look over and see James Show it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

2909
02:05:51.401 --> 02:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>How do I see it though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People could watch it online.</v>

02:05:54.890 --> 02:05:56.830
<v Speaker 2>They can check it out online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are these.</v>

2911
02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

2912
02:05:58.151 --> 02:05:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2913
02:05:58.661 --> 02:06:03.661
<v Speaker 2>we're experiencing some next level </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological innovation shit that's </v>

2914
02:06:04.151 --> 02:06:05.710
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some new,</v>

2915
02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:10.870
<v Speaker 2>like even more invasive internet sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2916
02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:14.470
<v Speaker 2>This is the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next level is you can literally show</v>

2917
02:06:14.471 --> 02:06:15.910
<v Speaker 2>the whole world what you see.</v>

2918
02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:17.650
<v Speaker 3>So is this a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2919
02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:20.960
<v Speaker 3>because I do periscope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is highly drunk on the bus</v>

2920
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:23.850
<v Speaker 2>essentially a lot like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to hold onto it.</v>

2921
02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:26.750
<v Speaker 2>It's on your glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

2922
02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:30.720
<v Speaker 2>it's similar and there's a live </v>
<v Speaker 2>streaming 32nd clips at a time too,</v>

2923
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:32.100
<v Speaker 2>which that's all the little show.</v>

2924
02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2925
02:06:32.900 --> 02:06:35.700
<v Speaker 3>But do I stay on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2926
02:06:35.710 --> 02:06:36.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a blast.</v>

2927
02:06:36.491 --> 02:06:40.000
<v Speaker 3>We have this thing because I got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend that does my vip stuff on the bus</v>

2928
02:06:40.001 --> 02:06:40.960
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2929
02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:43.540
<v Speaker 3>he was also at that first show that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

2930
02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:46.930
<v Speaker 3>So for years and Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2931
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:51.510
<v Speaker 3>and so his name's Dave and we do the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>where to go down the road.</v>

2932
02:06:51.511 --> 02:06:53.680
<v Speaker 3>We just were like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get just baked,</v>

2933
02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:59.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the show we traveled at night and </v>

2934
02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:01.261
<v Speaker 3>we'll do these broadcasts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big gay Dave and Ron Show and uh,</v>

2935
02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:08.290
<v Speaker 3>which has no content or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what,</v>

2936
02:07:08.291 --> 02:07:13.291
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that it's growing that much</v>
<v Speaker 3>a periscope and it's the most amazing </v>

2937
02:07:14.291 --> 02:07:16.600
<v Speaker 3>thing that you can do a live broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can pick it up.</v>

2938
02:07:16.601 --> 02:07:21.601
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cairo as easy as you can pick it up in </v>

2939
02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:21.601
<v Speaker 3>Lubbock.</v>

2940
02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2941
02:07:22.431 --> 02:07:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Pretty popular periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Scott Adams.</v>

2942
02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Scott Adams had a very popular Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twitter owns it.</v>

2943
02:07:28.450 --> 02:07:29.970
<v Speaker 2>They just made it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

2944
02:07:29.971 --> 02:07:31.950
<v Speaker 2>It's built right in now to twitter's </v>
<v Speaker 2>apps.</v>

2945
02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Like if you hit twitter and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of putting up a message,</v>

2946
02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:37.090
<v Speaker 2>there's a button that says live video </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's periscope,</v>

2947
02:07:37.091 --> 02:07:42.091
<v Speaker 2>but we'll just open right now trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just figure out how to make it more </v>

2948
02:07:42.091 --> 02:07:45.930
<v Speaker 2>available for people to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do they have a limitation on how </v>

2949
02:07:45.930 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 2>long the clips?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe.</v>

2950
02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:47.750
<v Speaker 2>So there you can go a little over an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

2951
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of interactivity that has </v>

2952
02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:55.990
<v Speaker 2>never existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never,</v>

2953
02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:57.260
<v Speaker 2>there's never existed in anything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2954
02:07:57.370 --> 02:08:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Scott Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was doing coffee with Scott </v>

2955
02:08:02.370 --> 02:08:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Adams like several times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2956
02:08:03.610 --> 02:08:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2957
02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

2958
02:08:07.590 --> 02:08:09.380
<v Speaker 2>if we have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No idea.</v>

2959
02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I know he did a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven.</v>

2960
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:13.600
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times did you do it?</v>

2961
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I might have just made it doesn't easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>access and turning it on.</v>

2962
02:08:15.701 --> 02:08:20.701
<v Speaker 2>It's on now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People know it's on now where you are </v>

2963
02:08:20.701 --> 02:08:20.950
<v Speaker 2>and just turn it on and they get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>notification.</v>

2964
02:08:21.090 --> 02:08:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2965
02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:26.820
<v Speaker 2>They do that on periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have one on periscope and </v>

2966
02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:27.820
<v Speaker 2>says Ron White is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to talk to 25,000</v>

2967
02:08:28.090 --> 02:08:29.700
<v Speaker 2>followers on periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I traveling.</v>

2968
02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:33.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might get them after the other.</v>

2969
02:08:33.611 --> 02:08:38.611
<v Speaker 2>This podcast podcasts will just tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have them and everybody jumped on </v>

2970
02:08:38.690 --> 02:08:43.690
<v Speaker 2>follow way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a good enough signal for </v>

2971
02:08:43.690 --> 02:08:47.761
<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got bored with the periscope </v>

2972
02:08:47.761 --> 02:08:47.761
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2973
02:08:47.761 --> 02:08:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't expose the instagram live.</v>

2974
02:08:48.101 --> 02:08:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Just started up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they've been pushing that around.</v>

2975
02:08:50.201 --> 02:08:54.430
<v Speaker 2>I saw that's a little limited to an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those videos don't last after.</v>

2976
02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's too bad about,</v>

2979
02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:05.100
<v Speaker 2>but I would guess that the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking data that they would have to </v>

2980
02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:08.870
<v Speaker 2>stock pile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If everybody's shit saved every every </v>

2982
02:09:12.391 --> 02:09:12.391
<v Speaker 2>beach.</v>

2983
02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:17.950
<v Speaker 2>All the fucking stupid videos of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy telling a shitty joke at a bar.</v>

2984
02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.280
<v Speaker 2>All those things just gigabyte after </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigabyte after gigabyte,</v>

2985
02:09:21.281 --> 02:09:24.010
<v Speaker 2>stored on the twitter server.</v>

2986
02:09:24.011 --> 02:09:29.011
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened to the TMZ bus ride</v>

2987
02:09:29.410 --> 02:09:34.410
<v Speaker 2>that we miss the problem with futures </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody's going to know </v>

2988
02:09:34.410 --> 02:09:35.560
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody does all the time.</v>

2989
02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Just kind of not going to be as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziness going on in the next hundred </v>

2990
02:09:40.590 --> 02:09:42.100
<v Speaker 2>years in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody's gonna know.</v>

2991
02:09:42.190 --> 02:09:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I think we're about 50 years away from </v>

<v Speaker 2>kind of from behind.</v>

3024
02:11:15.111 --> 02:11:19.490
<v Speaker 2>If she's flexing her muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looks kind of like Floyd Mayweather.</v>

<v Speaker 5>She's always done that.</v>

3031
02:11:32.781 --> 02:11:33.540
<v Speaker 5>So I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 5>seventies without being rude,</v>

3034
02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:42.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's just to get you on a nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 2>dense diet.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a buddy of mine,</v>

3084
02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:11.050
<v Speaker 5>Brian Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3085
02:14:11.051 --> 02:14:11.380
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3086
02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:16.490
<v Speaker 2>his hearing apparently it's all fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up from all these crazy concerts all </v>

3087
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.490
<v Speaker 2>those years.</v>

3088
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:17.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

3089
02:14:17.441 --> 02:14:17.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3090
02:14:17.981 --> 02:14:20.800
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of an interesting thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

3091
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:24.500
<v Speaker 5>because we're talking about the holiday </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution of anything,</v>

3092
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:25.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

3093
02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:31.120
<v Speaker 5>but there was a guy in Australia who </v>
<v Speaker 5>invented the ear in ear monitors which </v>

3094
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:37.330
<v Speaker 5>destroyed his hearing to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he dedicated his life to find a way </v>

3095
02:14:37.851 --> 02:14:40.280
<v Speaker 5>to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he did.</v>

3096
02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:42.560
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he does,</v>

3097
02:14:42.561 --> 02:14:47.561
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you've watched the tape of people </v>

3098
02:14:47.561 --> 02:14:47.600
<v Speaker 5>putting these things on people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost completely deaf,</v>

3099
02:14:47.601 --> 02:14:51.380
<v Speaker 5>putting this system in their ears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone starts crying.</v>

3100
02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:52.700
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every one of them.</v>

3101
02:14:53.210 --> 02:14:54.310
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he,</v>

3102
02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:56.390
<v Speaker 5>he had an open letter to Brian Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

3103
02:14:56.391 --> 02:15:01.391
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to come to your house in </v>

3104
02:15:01.391 --> 02:15:01.391
<v Speaker 5>Sarasota.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want you to put these in your ears.</v>

3105
02:15:01.391 --> 02:15:03.840
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is it's not portable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is not it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>when Axel rose started,</v>

3118
02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I accept this?</v>

3119
02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:41.360
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should you accept axl rose saying and </v>

3120
02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.380
<v Speaker 2>ACDC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NIH excepted it 100 percent because I </v>

3121
02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:46.611
<v Speaker 2>thought it might not be Brian Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still why that's so fucking </v>

3122
02:15:46.611 --> 02:15:47.190
<v Speaker 2>rose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3123
02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Brian couldn't do it anymore.</v>

3124
02:15:51.291 --> 02:15:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Actually steps in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy with that.</v>

3126
02:15:56.190 --> 02:15:58.010
<v Speaker 2>That's a freak show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>

3127
02:15:58.011 --> 02:16:03.011
<v Speaker 2>in an awesome way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how often you're going to see </v>

3128
02:16:03.011 --> 02:16:05.421
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often do you get to see axl rose </v>

3129
02:16:05.421 --> 02:16:05.700
<v Speaker 2>seeing it as a lead singer for AC </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking DC?</v>

3130
02:16:05.710 --> 02:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're digging shit,</v>

3131
02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:10.350
<v Speaker 2>their ticket sales dropped by 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

3132
02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:15.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a bunch of puppies in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's true.</v>

3133
02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:19.950
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

3134
02:16:19.951 --> 02:16:24.330
<v Speaker 2>that's Brian Johnson's voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian Johnson is back in black,</v>

3135
02:16:24.331 --> 02:16:25.950
<v Speaker 2>was the second biggest selling album</v>

3136
02:16:26.070 --> 02:16:30.940
<v Speaker 5>of all time behind thriller and 52 </v>
<v Speaker 5>million copies as Brian Johnson,</v>

3137
02:16:30.941 --> 02:16:35.290
<v Speaker 5>not fucking axl rose Johnson is still a </v>
<v Speaker 5>freak show vocalist.</v>

3138
02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:36.910
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and at some point,</v>

3139
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:37.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his brother,</v>

3140
02:16:37.661 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 5>Malcolm Malcolm was the better guitar </v>
<v Speaker 5>player anyway,</v>

3141
02:16:41.470 --> 02:16:44.260
<v Speaker 5>better than angus and angus knew at </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

3142
02:16:44.261 --> 02:16:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Fucking yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

3143
02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:48.490
<v Speaker 5>but he was the engine behind that really</v>
<v Speaker 5>complicated.</v>

3144
02:16:48.510 --> 02:16:52.330
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't sound complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really fucking complicated rock and roll</v>

3145
02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:57.720
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why it was so engaging for the </v>

3146
02:16:57.720 --> 02:16:57.720
<v Speaker 5>whole fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was.</v>

3147
02:16:57.720 --> 02:16:59.850
<v Speaker 5>But it was Brian Johnson's voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not been,</v>

3148
02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:01.780
<v Speaker 5>not bond Scott's,</v>

<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

3150
02:17:03.970 --> 02:17:06.460
<v Speaker 5>But Scott has some great fucking songs </v>
<v Speaker 5>to write.</v>

3151
02:17:06.550 --> 02:17:08.170
<v Speaker 5>He did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said he did.</v>

3152
02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:10.260
<v Speaker 5>But with Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morgan spurlock while you trying to </v>

<v Speaker 2>I can get stirred up on the periscopes </v>

3455
02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:39.990
<v Speaker 2>about $3,200</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

3456
02:31:40.470 --> 02:31:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3457
02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't used it in so long,</v>

3458
02:31:43.171 --> 02:31:48.171
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where if </v>

3459
02:31:48.171 --> 02:31:50.571
<v Speaker 2>someone found out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's one of the things that </v>

3460
02:31:50.571 --> 02:31:50.571
<v Speaker 2>happened with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3461
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:53.560
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3462
02:31:53.730 --> 02:31:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Scott Adams guy because people found out</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

3463
02:31:56.341 --> 02:31:58.110
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this really intelligent guy.</v>

3464
02:31:58.470 --> 02:32:00.310
<v Speaker 2>He's also a trump supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he trump supporter?</v>

3465
02:32:00.311 --> 02:32:01.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not a trump supporter.</v>

3466
02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:04.650
<v Speaker 2>He's literally not even voting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's breaking down.</v>

3467
02:32:04.651 --> 02:32:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Why thinks trump's going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people are freaking the fuck out.</v>

3468
02:32:06.871 --> 02:32:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Like he literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's telling you,</v>

3469
02:32:07.921 --> 02:32:12.921
<v Speaker 2>I'm not voting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not voting for anybody because then </v>

3470
02:32:12.921 --> 02:32:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll have some sort of a player in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

3471
02:32:13.711 --> 02:32:17.190
<v Speaker 2>He knew he is a weird guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Scott Adams in a good way,</v>

3472
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:19.550
<v Speaker 2>like he's sort of defined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3473
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:24.240
<v Speaker 2>he defies a lot of sort of a democrat </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic.</v>

3474
02:32:25.170 --> 02:32:27.000
<v Speaker 2>He will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very open minded,</v>

3475
02:32:27.060 --> 02:32:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he got unfairly labeled as being </v>

3476
02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:34.200
<v Speaker 2>like this a trump supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I don't think he was a trump.</v>

3477
02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most certainly was not anti trump.</v>

3478
02:32:37.020 --> 02:32:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was trying to send to hurt</v>

3479
02:32:40.690 --> 02:32:45.650
<v Speaker 3>trump's a program for him to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump's gonna win for sure.</v>

3480
02:32:45.651 --> 02:32:50.651
<v Speaker 3>And I'm the one that knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he also has the background and he's </v>

3481
02:32:50.651 --> 02:32:51.500
<v Speaker 3>the one that knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't,</v>

3482
02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:51.950
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3483
02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:55.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the several blows that,</v>

3484
02:32:55.821 --> 02:33:00.821
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Hillary took besides being a </v>

3485
02:33:00.821 --> 02:33:03.350
<v Speaker 3>horrible candidate that she took that </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked it out of her hands.</v>

3486
02:33:03.351 --> 02:33:08.351
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were these two people are running </v>

3487
02:33:08.351 --> 02:33:08.351
<v Speaker 3>against the only people that they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly fucking be.</v>

3488
02:33:08.351 --> 02:33:10.190
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3489
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:14.960
<v Speaker 3>if she just wouldn't have said basket of</v>
<v Speaker 3>deplorables when she said that,</v>

3490
02:33:14.961 --> 02:33:18.860
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ,</v>

3491
02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:21.640
<v Speaker 2>bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them a hammer.</v>

3492
02:33:21.970 --> 02:33:24.010
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

3493
02:33:24.130 --> 02:33:25.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people,</v>

3494
02:33:25.211 --> 02:33:28.000
<v Speaker 2>even people that wanted to look at it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>an alternative vote,</v>

3495
02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:33.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it an alternative to the potential </v>

3496
02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:34.450
<v Speaker 2>chaos that trump could cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3497
02:33:34.451 --> 02:33:37.360
<v Speaker 2>and some people looked at it that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some people honestly,</v>

3498
02:33:37.361 --> 02:33:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3499
02:33:38.230 --> 02:33:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what percentage I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess it would be because there's a </v>

3500
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:45.160
<v Speaker 2>bunch of pragmatists that got in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when it came time to vote,</v>

3501
02:33:45.161 --> 02:33:47.290
<v Speaker 2>looked at that fucking ballot and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what,</v>

3502
02:33:49.150 --> 02:33:54.150
<v Speaker 2>let's just see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just see what happens if we put </v>

3503
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.150
<v Speaker 2>this fucking crazy guy in here.</v>

3504
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:55.290
<v Speaker 3>We were in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>

3505
02:33:55.291 --> 02:33:56.080
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3506
02:33:56.090 --> 02:34:01.090
<v Speaker 3>it went to Margaret,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his friend's house and this guy who I </v>

3507
02:34:01.090 --> 02:34:01.090
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like a,</v>

3508
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:03.900
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3509
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:06.870
<v Speaker 3>the monkey in me would love to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

3510
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monkey in me,</v>

3511
02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:14.260
<v Speaker 3>if get and areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3512
02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:15.740
<v Speaker 3>what could he really do and,</v>

3513
02:34:16.690 --> 02:34:18.070
<v Speaker 2>but I</v>

3514
02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:19.570
<v Speaker 5>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could definitely do something,</v>

3515
02:34:19.571 --> 02:34:20.650
<v Speaker 5>but what would he do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

3516
02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:21.450
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

3517
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.800

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3520
02:34:25.261 --> 02:34:30.261
<v Speaker 4>and I think that this is weird defining </v>
<v Speaker 4>of things right now where everyone has </v>

3521
02:34:30.261 --> 02:34:33.300
<v Speaker 4>to absolutely say in one way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either support or deny,</v>

3522
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:37.830
<v Speaker 4>either support him but don't sweat it </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets to me to be real cultish.</v>

3523
02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:39.380
<v Speaker 4>It gets to me to be real</v>

<v Speaker 5>A guy wouldn't take a picture of me at a</v>
<v Speaker 5>meet and greet because I was.</v>

3528

<v Speaker 5>having open heart surgery back when he </v>

3557
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:22.310
<v Speaker 5>was the Christ.</v>

3559
02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:29.220
<v Speaker 4>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a point in time where Dick </v>

3560
02:36:29.220 --> 02:36:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Cheney literally did not have a pulse </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

3561
02:36:29.220 --> 02:36:30.860
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ isn't this and the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bible.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to really if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you guys want to follow the Bible,</v>

3563
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:36.110
<v Speaker 4>but the end of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's in the Bible,</v>

3564
02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:40.280
<v Speaker 4>but he had a machine inside of the body </v>
<v Speaker 4>that pumped his blood and it didn't make</v>

3565
02:36:40.281 --> 02:36:45.281
<v Speaker 4>a pulse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he didn't have a fucking pulse for a </v>

3566
02:36:45.281 --> 02:36:45.590
<v Speaker 4>long time while he's waiting for a heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>transplant.</v>

3567
02:36:46.190 --> 02:36:47.500
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

<v Speaker 2>100 percent fair and across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt,</v>

3602
02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Dick Cheney did not have any influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever in anyone moving him to the </v>

3603
02:38:32.961 --> 02:38:35.730
<v Speaker 2>front of the line to get a young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fresh 20 year old basketball players.</v>

<v Speaker 5>$150,</v>
<v Speaker 5>million dollars and that was to become a</v>

<v Speaker 2>Where are you going when you're working </v>

3640
02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:35.600
<v Speaker 2>that hard?</v>

<v Speaker 2>what are you shooting for you trying to </v>

3642
02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:39.650
<v Speaker 2>save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He trying to tell people how it is.</v>

3643
02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:40.770
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>

3644
02:40:40.890 --> 02:40:42.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch.</v>

02:40:43.570 --> 02:40:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Keep making money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3646
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Can it be ego?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3647
02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Maybe while you're alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just alive.</v>

3648
02:40:49.650 --> 02:40:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Maybe all of these ideas that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>about people getting older and wiser.</v>

3649
02:40:52.591 --> 02:40:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll all just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you just get older,</v>

3650
02:40:55.710 --> 02:41:00.210
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they're fucking crazy when they're</v>

3651
02:41:00.211 --> 02:41:05.211
<v Speaker 2>30 and they want to take over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do we automatically expect them to </v>

3652
02:41:05.211 --> 02:41:07.050
<v Speaker 2>be on some path of self regulation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvement?</v>

3653
02:41:07.410 --> 02:41:12.410
<v Speaker 2>The point where they become enlightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't want to take over the </v>

3654
02:41:12.410 --> 02:41:15.981
<v Speaker 2>world anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're 17 and they've had 15 open </v>

3655
02:41:15.981 --> 02:41:15.981
<v Speaker 2>heart surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

3656
02:41:15.981 --> 02:41:16.470
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

3657
02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:22.140
<v Speaker 5>They're just people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My goodness gracious Joe Rogan.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3799
02:47:38.330 --> 02:47:41.720
<v Speaker 3>I know Donald Trump doesn't know nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else up there though.</v>

3800
02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:43.160
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3801
02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:47.240
<v Speaker 3>I know who they are and know exactly who</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are and know what bothers him.</v>

3802
02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:49.250
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a bothersome.</v>

3803
02:47:49.430 --> 02:47:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Is the fucking math is just killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

3804
02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:55.420
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3805
02:47:55.520 --> 02:48:00.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nobody ever brought that up in this </v>

3806
02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:00.620
<v Speaker 3>election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did math,</v>

3807
02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:03.740
<v Speaker 3>the math.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the meth made here and not even the</v>

3808
02:48:03.741 --> 02:48:08.320
<v Speaker 3>meth from Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The meth made here in America is a,</v>

3809
02:48:08.390 --> 02:48:11.840
<v Speaker 3>is it kills more people than isis ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>will in this country.</v>

3810
02:48:11.841 --> 02:48:13.580
<v Speaker 3>And unless something fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3811
02:48:13.581 --> 02:48:15.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going on right now.</v>

3812
02:48:15.441 --> 02:48:16.740
<v Speaker 3>100 people a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>

3813
02:48:16.750 --> 02:48:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>

3814
02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:19.080
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundred people a day.</v>

3815
02:48:19.270 --> 02:48:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Dad over the either the</v>

3816
02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:25.790
<v Speaker 5>byproducts of doing math over a period </v>
<v Speaker 5>of time.</v>

3817
02:48:25.791 --> 02:48:29.570
<v Speaker 5>That 100 people a day easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people die from skateboarding?</v>

3818
02:48:30.290 --> 02:48:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Google that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd say a half a person today you think?</v>

3819
02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:41.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you think is the most dangerous </v>

3820
02:48:41.020 --> 02:48:41.020
<v Speaker 5>sport that people die from a day at </v>
<v Speaker 5>Honeywell?</v>

3821
02:48:41.020 --> 02:48:42.020
<v Speaker 5>For Math.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

3822
02:48:42.021 --> 02:48:43.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it would have been.</v>

3823
02:48:43.461 --> 02:48:45.620
<v Speaker 5>If I hadn't been elected president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's what,</v>

3824
02:48:45.621 --> 02:48:47.120
<v Speaker 5>here's my plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>

3825
02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:52.200
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this would have been the most </v>

3826
02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:52.200
<v Speaker 5>dangerous sport would have been run a </v>
<v Speaker 5>math lab.</v>

3827
02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:54.350
<v Speaker 5>That would have been the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>sport.</v>

3828
02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:59.940
<v Speaker 5>That was a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I wouldn't put US troops on the </v>

3829
02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:03.110
<v Speaker 5>ground and I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would put a bounty of $20,000.</v>

3830
02:49:03.111 --> 02:49:06.950
<v Speaker 5>If you can show me an operating math lab</v>
<v Speaker 5>will go in there,</v>

3831
02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:09.810
<v Speaker 5>boots on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll give you eight seconds to get with</v>

3832
02:49:09.820 --> 02:49:14.820
<v Speaker 5>the meth babies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we're going to kill everybody </v>

3833
02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:14.820
<v Speaker 5>in the fucking place and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>blow the place up.</v>

3834
02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:15.060
<v Speaker 5>You would kill the dude from breaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>

3835
02:49:15.550 --> 02:49:17.640
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's real.</v>

3836
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:19.180
<v Speaker 5>But if it was a real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3837
02:49:19.410 --> 02:49:22.710
<v Speaker 5>Fucked fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's because he's killing people,</v>

3838
02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:24.030
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows he's doing it.</v>

3839
02:49:24.540 --> 02:49:27.380
<v Speaker 5>He knows he's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're doing it with just for profit.</v>

3840
02:49:27.390 --> 02:49:30.630
<v Speaker 5>He is a prophet here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could you just enjoy a little math?</v>

3841
02:49:30.631 --> 02:49:33.110
<v Speaker 5>Like a wine tasting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a little.</v>

3842
02:49:33.111 --> 02:49:35.580
<v Speaker 5>Just a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I could,</v>

3843
02:49:35.581 --> 02:49:38.220
<v Speaker 5>but still I would like to see if the </v>
<v Speaker 5>navy seals did meth.</v>

3844
02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:41.520
<v Speaker 5>If you could take like guys with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tremendous amount of discipline.</v>

3845
02:49:41.790 --> 02:49:44.760
<v Speaker 5>Like if you got Tim Kennedy to do math </v>
<v Speaker 5>one time,</v>

3846
02:49:44.910 --> 02:49:49.910
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee he's not going to become a </v>
<v Speaker 5>math junkie or crack crack cocaine is </v>

3847
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:51.300
<v Speaker 5>even more addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it then.</v>

3848
02:49:51.410 --> 02:49:52.200
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but math,</v>

3849
02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:57.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you watched the deterioration of </v>

3850
02:49:57.280 --> 02:49:57.280
<v Speaker 5>somebody on math over a 10 year period </v>
<v Speaker 5>of time.</v>

3851
02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:00.980
<v Speaker 5>It could be a most beautiful woman in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world all the way down to the skank </v>

3852
02:50:00.980 --> 02:50:03.750
<v Speaker 5>and 10 years complete toothless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking is horrible for him.</v>

3853
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:06.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going deep,</v>

3854
02:50:06.091 --> 02:50:09.720
<v Speaker 5>deep down the world of neither one of us</v>
<v Speaker 5>know what the fuck we're talking about.</v>

3855
02:50:09.810 --> 02:50:10.650
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3856
02:50:12.910 --> 02:50:13.720
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

3857
02:50:15.860 --> 02:50:19.940
<v Speaker 5>I told you some meth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've told you a while ago.</v>

3858
02:50:19.950 --> 02:50:21.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm too fucked up to keep doing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

3859
02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:26.640
<v Speaker 5>You're the one that kept going fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're just in a civil debate about </v>

3860
02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:31.521
<v Speaker 5>whether or not a navy seal could smoke a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little meth and just put it down and </v>

3861
02:50:31.521 --> 02:50:34.230
<v Speaker 5>walk away because it's not a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3862
02:50:35.010 --> 02:50:35.760
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ain't.</v>

3863
02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:37.300
<v Speaker 5>He grabs your DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>

3864
02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:39.850
<v Speaker 5>I think a navy seal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Nav,</v>

3865
02:50:39.870 --> 02:50:44.870
<v Speaker 5>so we'd do it in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the whole key to the </v>

3866
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:46.020
<v Speaker 5>investigation that the army had to find </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3867
02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:46.860
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

3868
02:50:46.861 --> 02:50:50.040
<v Speaker 5>Is it willpower?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is a physical like what's the deal?</v>

3869
02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:55.080
<v Speaker 5>It'd be sucking a dick for a sandwich in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the know they don't want sandwiches.</v>

3870
02:50:55.081 --> 02:50:58.170
<v Speaker 5>They want meth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3871
02:50:58.370 --> 02:51:00.220
<v Speaker 5>they right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they have math,</v>

3872
02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:04.890
<v Speaker 5>the sandwich has no importance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like for a lot of people that's</v>

3873
02:51:04.891 --> 02:51:07.020
<v Speaker 5>the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the question is how?</v>

3874
02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:10.110
<v Speaker 5>How even our.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all of us like how many?</v>

3875
02:51:10.250 --> 02:51:12.480
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do some people have cat allergies?</v>

3876
02:51:12.481 --> 02:51:13.950
<v Speaker 5>Why did some people have pain or </v>
<v Speaker 5>analogy?</v>

3877
02:51:13.951 --> 02:51:15.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck's going on?</v>

3878
02:51:15.270 --> 02:51:17.820
<v Speaker 5>How many people that smoke meth?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just smoke it and they go,</v>

3879
02:51:17.821 --> 02:51:20.530
<v Speaker 5>look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people smoke meth in pain?</v>

3880
02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:23.970
<v Speaker 5>Just his size.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I note like we did with me and you.</v>

3881
02:51:24.210 --> 02:51:25.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3882
02:51:25.260 --> 02:51:30.260
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because some people smoke pot and they </v>

3883
02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:30.260
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3884
02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:30.260
<v Speaker 5>I'll never do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I didn't say that.</v>

3885
02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:31.130
<v Speaker 5>You didn't say that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3886
02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:33.660
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like things that make me vibrate</v>

3887
02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:35.910
<v Speaker 5>and I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked it.</v>

3888
02:51:36.530 --> 02:51:38.850
<v Speaker 5>I like to nap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Responsible,</v>

3889
02:51:38.851 --> 02:51:40.980
<v Speaker 5>methamphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>use and community.</v>

3890
02:51:42.500 --> 02:51:47.500
<v Speaker 5>I use math on occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy before work.</v>

3891
02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:53.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if this is real,</v>

3892
02:51:53.521 --> 02:51:56.460
<v Speaker 5>but I mean there are people apparently </v>
<v Speaker 5>that agree with them and there's a whole</v>

3893
02:51:56.461 --> 02:51:58.680
<v Speaker 5>community course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do a bunch of methods.</v>

3894
02:51:58.980 --> 02:52:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Methods are all getting together on each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other's fingers off saying everything's </v>

3895
02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:06.800
<v Speaker 5>fine and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is pitching in to the fucking or </v>

3896
02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:06.800
<v Speaker 5>fucking</v>

3897
02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:06.800
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3898
02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:11.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do a little math to a little math gonna </v>

3899
02:52:11.671 --> 02:52:13.901
<v Speaker 2>make you a metal team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will do from the James Bond movie </v>

3900
02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:15.430
<v Speaker 2>jaws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that guy?</v>

3901
02:52:16.390 --> 02:52:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Metal teeth for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rappers were going with the metal teeth.</v>

3902
02:52:19.931 --> 02:52:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has that led up interesting to grill?</v>

3903
02:52:23.970 --> 02:52:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You agree that grills are still in full </v>

3904
02:52:28.970 --> 02:52:28.970
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

3905
02:52:28.970 --> 02:52:31.981
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why have you ever considered getting a </v>

3906
02:52:31.981 --> 02:52:33.391
<v Speaker 2>grill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe perhaps something like </v>

3907
02:52:33.391 --> 02:52:33.391
<v Speaker 2>platinum and diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

3908
02:52:33.391 --> 02:52:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

3909
02:52:33.940 --> 02:52:36.780
<v Speaker 2>No little wayne ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps.</v>

3910
02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:41.190
<v Speaker 2>That's when Cameron decided to make my </v>
<v Speaker 2>character ball.</v>

3911
02:52:41.210 --> 02:52:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever saw it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was pretty funny.</v>

3912
02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:45.610
<v Speaker 2>You laugh at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see him?</v>

3913
02:52:45.611 --> 02:52:47.680
<v Speaker 2>That character?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that show once.</v>

3914
02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:52.260
<v Speaker 2>If I had known that in any way I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have helped and kept it on the air.</v>

3915
02:52:52.261 --> 02:52:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch every episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find out who's watching.</v>

3916
02:52:58.330 --> 02:53:01.870
<v Speaker 2>How do they find out a dick for not have</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched your show now?</v>

3917
02:53:02.590 --> 02:53:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I think I probably wanted to get around </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

3918
02:53:05.230 --> 02:53:07.030
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I haven't seen that.</v>

3919
02:53:07.230 --> 02:53:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the black superhero?</v>

3920
02:53:11.070 --> 02:53:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Luke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luke cage.</v>

3921
02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep hearing awesome things about it.</v>

3922
02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm in trouble because I said the </v>
<v Speaker 2>black superhero,</v>

3923
02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:21.770
<v Speaker 2>even though he's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other ones?</v>

3924
02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Like netflix has a couple of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have daredevil.</v>

3925
02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:26.500
<v Speaker 2>They have luke cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else they have on a shirt?</v>

3926
02:53:26.501 --> 02:53:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3927
02:53:27.161 --> 02:53:28.450
<v Speaker 2>they have the punisher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3928
02:53:28.451 --> 02:53:30.130
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good things about that too.</v>

3929
02:53:30.131 --> 02:53:33.700
<v Speaker 2>But more about luke cage than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heard a lot of people.</v>

3930
02:53:34.030 --> 02:53:35.440
<v Speaker 2>If somebody has a bit about luke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3931
02:53:35.770 --> 02:53:37.230

<v Speaker 2>Horton.</v>

3932
02:53:37.260 --> 02:53:40.210
<v Speaker 2>As a really funny bit about Luke Cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Horton,</v>

3933
02:53:40.211 --> 02:53:42.880
<v Speaker 2>who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opened up for me in Denver at the comedy</v>

3934
02:53:42.881 --> 02:53:43.210

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's from La.</v>

3937
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:49.250
<v Speaker 2>He brought an opener all the way from </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

3938
02:53:49.270 --> 02:53:51.100
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always bring opener so you don't bring</v>

3939
02:53:51.101 --> 02:53:53.690
<v Speaker 2>openers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

3940
02:53:55.180 --> 02:53:57.700
<v Speaker 2>What's happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my character.</v>

3941
02:53:57.790 --> 02:53:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

3942
02:53:59.110 --> 02:54:04.110
<v Speaker 2>What does he do to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How rude and balled it made you look </v>

3943
02:54:04.110 --> 02:54:04.110
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

3944
02:54:04.110 --> 02:54:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I like the glasses though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the t shirt with glasses that they </v>

3945
02:54:08.490 --> 02:54:11.740
<v Speaker 2>did a lack of fucking audition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fast as fuck them.</v>

3946
02:54:12.130 --> 02:54:14.270
<v Speaker 2>That's funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3947
02:54:14.770 --> 02:54:17.040
<v Speaker 2>So do you enjoy doing that show though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3948
02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a blast.</v>

3949
02:54:18.701 --> 02:54:19.460
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3950
02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:19.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3951
02:54:19.901 --> 02:54:22.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dialogue was a blast to do you know,</v>

3952
02:54:22.370 --> 02:54:22.870
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

3953
02:54:23.010 --> 02:54:24.970
<v Speaker 2>you'd lack it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You watched episode eight.</v>

3954
02:54:25.330 --> 02:54:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Is it available on Netflix or a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to go to the showtime APP.</v>

3955
02:54:28.421 --> 02:54:33.421
<v Speaker 2>I know I have showed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they do it on demand because on </v>

3956
02:54:33.421 --> 02:54:33.421
<v Speaker 2>demand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3957
02:54:33.421 --> 02:54:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I saw it was on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a Delta flight.</v>

3958
02:54:36.810 --> 02:54:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I think right now those providers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different people trying to </v>

3959
02:54:41.810 --> 02:54:42.940
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to get that straight so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can watch pretty much.</v>

3960
02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many years do you think,</v>

3961
02:54:44.651 --> 02:54:46.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many years are we away from?</v>

3962
02:54:46.961 --> 02:54:51.961
<v Speaker 2>Everything that everyone makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being able to be watched online per real</v>

3963
02:54:52.001 --> 02:54:57.001
<v Speaker 2>close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just got to be some universal </v>

3964
02:54:57.001 --> 02:54:57.250
<v Speaker 2>currency thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the universal one click like Amazon,</v>

3965
02:54:57.370 --> 02:55:02.370
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get things on the spot right </v>

3966
02:55:02.370 --> 02:55:05.371
<v Speaker 2>after they come out because you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to massively increase how </v>

3967
02:55:05.371 --> 02:55:10.361
<v Speaker 2>many people watch your show or any show </v>
<v Speaker 2>because some people just don't want to </v>

3968
02:55:10.361 --> 02:55:13.181
<v Speaker 2>pay for that showtime package.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're broke and they have one </v>

3969
02:55:13.181 --> 02:55:13.181
<v Speaker 2>chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3970
02:55:13.181 --> 02:55:13.490
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3971
02:55:13.491 --> 02:55:14.990
<v Speaker 2>let's get hbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3972
02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they were really cheap and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3973
02:55:16.311 --> 02:55:16.460
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

3974
02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:20.030
<v Speaker 2>With cinemax said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cinemax actually only was,</v>

3975
02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:22.230
<v Speaker 2>I call it 50 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3976
02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

3977
02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Cinemax is awesome because that's not my</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

3978
02:55:25.700 --> 02:55:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I point is that if you have it online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's easy to get to,</v>

3979
02:55:30.050 --> 02:55:33.830
<v Speaker 2>you get this open river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the blockades you put up where</v>

3980
02:55:33.831 --> 02:55:36.890
<v Speaker 2>it makes it hard for people to buy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what fucks everything up.</v>

3981
02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I call you want me to sign up A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to sign up.</v>

3982
02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I gotta put my email address here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comes to spam.</v>

3983
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:47.950
<v Speaker 2>If there was just some one easy way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could put that fucking thing online </v>

3984
02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:52.110
<v Speaker 2>is one simple way where everybody could </v>
<v Speaker 2>just give you like a book or whatever it</v>

3985
02:55:52.111 --> 02:55:54.080
<v Speaker 2>is for an episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just really easy.</v>

3986
02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Let me watch the episode real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3987
02:55:58.170 --> 02:56:00.710
<v Speaker 2>God damn everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be everywhere,</v>

3988
02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:03.590
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

3989
02:56:03.620 --> 02:56:07.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just too right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too complicated right now.</v>

3990
02:56:07.161 --> 02:56:10.370
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to figure out that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>various portals for people to be able to</v>

3991
02:56:10.371 --> 02:56:13.310
<v Speaker 2>profit off these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we start this?</v>

3992
02:56:13.390 --> 02:56:18.390
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait because I don't profit off </v>

3993
02:56:18.390 --> 02:56:22.470
<v Speaker 2>the internet at all at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely do because people on the </v>

3994
02:56:22.470 --> 02:56:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>

3995
02:56:22.470 --> 02:56:23.120

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3997
02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.610
<v Speaker 1>In that way they do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd do that.</v>

3998
02:56:26.850 --> 02:56:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of it.</v>

3999
02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get the run white shell started.</v>

4000
02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Jamie is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Needs to be done right now.</v>

4001
02:56:37.610 --> 02:56:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Now what do you mean the podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't do something like once a </v>

4002
02:56:42.610 --> 02:56:43.170
<v Speaker 2>month now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to once a month.</v>

4003
02:56:43.620 --> 02:56:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that much time for an hour.</v>

4004
02:56:47.070 --> 02:56:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Brian White answers questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

4005
02:56:48.961 --> 02:56:53.961
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to put you on the spot.</v>

4006
02:56:58.800 --> 02:56:59.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad now.</v>

4007
02:57:00.690 --> 02:57:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Now to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once a month.</v>

4008
02:57:03.861 --> 02:57:08.861
<v Speaker 1>Nobody said that once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we already said that everybody else </v>

4009
02:57:08.861 --> 02:57:11.570
<v Speaker 1>is like 17 days a week and I only have </v>
<v Speaker 1>17 days a week and fucking do this shit.</v>

4010
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:13.110
<v Speaker 2>So what else are you going to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier?</v>

4011
02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I would never encourage any changing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of what you do because then you </v>

4012
02:57:19.381 --> 02:57:23.580
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be ron white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if ron white decides at one point in</v>

4013
02:57:23.581 --> 02:57:25.950
<v Speaker 2>time that he wants to change whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

4014
02:57:26.390 --> 02:57:31.390
<v Speaker 2>if Ron Wyden decides that he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start drinking carrot and ginger and </v>

4015
02:57:31.390 --> 02:57:33.470
<v Speaker 2>garlic juice every morning going to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking crossfit gym.</v>

4016
02:57:33.650 --> 02:57:37.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm drinking Jack Daniels reviewed Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed message.</v>

4017
02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I am definitely a mixed message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are</v>

4018
02:57:40.980 --> 02:57:43.800
<v Speaker 2>present and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty as charged.</v>

4019
02:57:44.100 --> 02:57:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Just trying to squeeze as much life out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this thing is we can run white and </v>

4020
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:53.310
<v Speaker 2>middle school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sure that helps.</v>

4021
02:57:53.550 --> 02:57:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

4022
02:57:54.540 --> 02:57:56.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expression is little old band,</v>

4023
02:57:58.030 --> 02:58:00.300
<v Speaker 1>not big old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Man.</v>

4024
02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:02.160
<v Speaker 1>You never hear anybody</v>

4025
02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:03.110
<v Speaker 5>say big old man.</v>

4026
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:10.590

<v Speaker 2>grave pulling him towards it.</v>

4027
02:58:14.861 --> 02:58:19.861
<v Speaker 2>How fucked up is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ultimately what is actually </v>

4028
02:58:19.861 --> 02:58:19.861
<v Speaker 2>happening to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you get older,</v>

4029
02:58:19.861 --> 02:58:24.510
<v Speaker 2>you have a stick to fight off the slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull of gravity nation.</v>

4030
02:58:25.450 --> 02:58:26.310
<v Speaker 2>That's just stuck</v>

<v Speaker 2>your ass when you were a baby</v>

4033
02:58:35.370 --> 02:58:40.370
<v Speaker 5>and you just fall over and kick your ass</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time and you got a little </v>

4034
02:58:40.370 --> 02:58:44.751
<v Speaker 5>stronger and then it got to where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could fucking run and didn't get to </v>

4035
02:58:44.751 --> 02:58:46.380
<v Speaker 5>where you could job and you're like </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicking.</v>

4036
02:58:46.381 --> 02:58:50.610
<v Speaker 5>Gravity's asked for a few years and let </v>
<v Speaker 5>gravity never stopped.</v>

4037
02:58:50.790 --> 02:58:53.150
