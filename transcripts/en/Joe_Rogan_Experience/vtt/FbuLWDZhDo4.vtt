41
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Woman Who's just this insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>furious combat athlete.</v>

42
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the one who's just stepped off a </v>

43
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>13 hour flight and is now working all </v>

44
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.270

<v Speaker 1>That's hard.</v>

45
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Especially doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

46
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't.</v>

47
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>We have pretty easy jobs just sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>around talking to people all day in.</v>

48
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.270
<v Speaker 1>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do,</v>

49
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but I really enjoy your show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

50
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>You have some excellent interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you interview that Peter Singer guy?</v>

51
00:01:55.111 --> 00:02:00.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Animal Liberation Liberation </v>

52
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:00.111
<v Speaker 1>Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He founded the.</v>

53
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>He coined the term animal liberation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sort of invented the.</v>

54
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the world's most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>bioethicists.</v>

55
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean in terms of just thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the morality,</v>

56
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:12.141
<v Speaker 1>he's such a brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's as if it's like an alien just came </v>

57
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:12.900
<v Speaker 1>down to width and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

58
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to have any more </v>
<v Speaker 1>preconceptions about what people think </v>

59
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.751
<v Speaker 1>is right and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to start from basics and </v>

60
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:20.751
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

61
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>why do we think about the morality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things the way that we do and how,</v>

62
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>in what ways is that wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he ends up with these crazy </v>

63
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>conclusions and people like hate him.</v>

64
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>For some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like saying it's not necessarily wrong </v>

65
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>to say kill an infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a newborn infant.</v>

66
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does he justify that?</v>

67
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's on the grounds that what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with killing something as a sort </v>

68
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>of combination of snuffing out the life </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

69
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a being that has the capability of </v>

70
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.800
<v Speaker 1>conceiving of itself as having a future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

71
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>You're thwarting a person's plans when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you kill them,</v>

72
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>you're robbing them of all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that they hoped that they </v>

73
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>were gonna have and you're presumably </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing them pain.</v>

74
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>But if you could painlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

75
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:06.211
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think of life as being an </v>

76
00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:08.311
<v Speaker 1>incremental thing that starts from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conception and then gradually evolves up</v>

77
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>into adulthood and sort of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness and consciousness.</v>

78
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean does it two day old baby have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much more sentience and </v>

79
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.991
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and sense of itself than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 week old baby in the womb does not a </v>

80
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>huge amount necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

81
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he just,</v>

82
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.840
<v Speaker 1>he's just a fascinating person to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

83
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Does he have children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

84
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

85
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting that he thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wavy as children because I could see it </v>

86
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to make some sort of a </v>

87
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 2>logic argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

88
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.910
<v Speaker 2>that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could argue it like that,</v>

89
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like being a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference being significant in that</v>

90
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.920
<v Speaker 2>a child represents potential and child </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents to a lot of people represents</v>

91
00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:55.430
<v Speaker 2>this insane bond of love that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the baby.</v>

92
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

93
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I think just to clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's only saying like in cases </v>

95
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>the parents don't want it or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

97
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.140
<v Speaker 1>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you kill someone else's </v>

98
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.501
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a terrible thing because </v>

99
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:11.501
<v Speaker 1>you're depriving the parents of the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

100
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying like if they don't want </v>

101
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.371
<v Speaker 1>their baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big a deal in a situation </v>

102
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:18.371
<v Speaker 1>like a Bush as if it was like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion.</v>

103
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that are extreme</v>

104
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.710
<v Speaker 2>animal rights folks that also believed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something about if you did </v>

105
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.691
<v Speaker 2>kill a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least you stopped that person from </v>

106
00:04:29.691 --> 00:04:32.871
<v Speaker 2>killing all the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to kill or be responsible </v>

107
00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:32.871
<v Speaker 2>for the death of in their entire life,</v>

108
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.910
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gets real insane.</v>

109
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.130
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he'd agree with that.</v>

110
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to know real crazy,</v>

111
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.570
<v Speaker 1>the lobster liberation movement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

112
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

113
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that</v>

114
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 2>break into restaurants or places that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have seafood and keep lobsters and they </v>

115
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 2>released them and take the rubber bands </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

116
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>They're atrophied clause and release </v>
<v Speaker 2>them back into the ocean.</v>

117
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Those</v>

118
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.080
<v Speaker 1>lobsters out stuff of heaven in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean and they've had a too good for too</v>

119
00:04:57.081 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be stimulating being in the</v>

120
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.670
<v Speaker 1>lobster tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sure is safe.</v>

121
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the lobsters eat while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the tank.</v>

122
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they must be fed.</v>

123
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

124
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

125
00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:11.930
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't do it while you're eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

126
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>But they always have the rubber bands on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their claws so they don't Jack each </v>

127
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>other up while they were in that tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probe on top of each other.</v>

128
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 1>It is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

129
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

130
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.970
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

131
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:28.971
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem with it because I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat maintenance so I can't really be a </v>

132
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:32.961
<v Speaker 1>but could have added,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's something just kind </v>

133
00:05:32.961 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Speaker 1>of oddly sadistic about sitting there at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a table and just being like,</v>

134
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.520
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have that,</v>

135
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.090
<v Speaker 1>that I'm going to end that one's life </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and then I'm just going to eat</v>

136
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:40.160
<v Speaker 1>him in front of his buddies.</v>

137
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we have a weird thing about.</v>

138
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>We have like a hierarchy of animals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love and that's one of the things we </v>

139
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.690
<v Speaker 1>found out about Cecil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

140
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say I want to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get to this.</v>

141
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.380
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely should get to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have any problem with even </v>

142
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.771
<v Speaker 1>vegans will slap a mosquito and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>biting them like you don't have a </v>

143
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:02.771
<v Speaker 1>problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

144
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>when bugs are really little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ants will kill it and then brush it</v>

145
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:10.211
<v Speaker 1>off our pants and leave the body on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and it's just like a head on our </v>

146
00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:14.641
<v Speaker 1>pants and just some little limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just crush out the grand bug guts and </v>

147
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:19.121
<v Speaker 1>then the aunt will be an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend do that on my kitchen </v>

148
00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 1>once he had an aunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

149
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking aunt.</v>

150
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>And he just brushed it on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

151
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>isn't that odd that I don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with you doing that,</v>

152
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:30.071
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it odd that we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just brushed bodies under our </v>

153
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:30.071
<v Speaker 1>friends' floors and we don't care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

154
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Just this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So getting back to Peter Singer,</v>

155
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.190
<v Speaker 1>his whole philosophy of animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberation is sort of that there is a </v>

156
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of consciousness and sentience</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to be taken into account.</v>

157
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he happens to be a Vegan,</v>

158
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he doesn't think that an </v>

160
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>oyster has the same right to life as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lion does or as a chimpanzee does.</v>

161
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you factor in the capacity of the,</v>

162
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.780
<v Speaker 1>of the creature to be sent to you and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel pain and to have a conception of </v>

163
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.491
<v Speaker 1>itself and to feel love and fear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of things and how much it </v>

164
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:06.491
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

165
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why human life is probably more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important than any other animal's life.</v>

166
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe whales with dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

167
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Some other animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's equally smart as us,</v>

168
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.740
<v Speaker 1>but so for him the bugs are less worthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for anyone sensible the bugs out.</v>

169
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting when you say like</v>

170
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 1>we have these weird conceptions of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own hierarchies of like cute animals and</v>

171
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 1>non cute animals or animals that we give</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shit about mammals that we don't.</v>

172
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.170
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy doesn't match up with a Peter </v>

173
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Singer with a logical ethical hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why are we so willing to be so </v>

174
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.291
<v Speaker 1>cruel to pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which adjusts as conscious and self </v>

175
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 1>aware and capable of love and family and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain as dogs,</v>

176
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>if not more so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not more so,</v>

177
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.880
<v Speaker 1>but we have these institutionalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated animal feeding operations </v>

178
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>that just torture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's torture.</v>

179
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that industry can do to lower </v>

180
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 1>the price of a pound of flesh by a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>pennies,</v>

181
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>it will do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including anesthetizing the pigs,</v>

182
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.500
<v Speaker 1>get grabbing little piglets by the tile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just smashing their heads against a </v>

183
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>wall to kill them if they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're not viable anymore.</v>

184
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an absolute murder show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>

185
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:20.310
<v Speaker 1>it's an ongoing holocaust of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

186
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>of pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then like little people get arrested</v>

187
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:24.210
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

188
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Michael Vick or something and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something bad for dogs.</v>

189
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>We just don't give it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give a shit.</v>

190
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what paid a singer would say is yes,</v>

191
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's at least be sensible about the</v>

192
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.780
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to settle.</v>

193
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Cecil Cecil was a 13 year old lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I want everyone to understand that</v>

194
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're a male lion and you reach 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of age,</v>

195
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>you have killed a fuck load of baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

196
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

197
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>How many gazelles have you killed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of gazelles.</v>

198
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>But also there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you say,</v>

199
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 1>infanticide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust side,</v>

200
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.090
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>side to</v>

201
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.110
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not trunk.</v>

202
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm always want to make an r there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some reason.</v>

203
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some other types of light </v>

204
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 2>fratricide rise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why infanticide,</v>

205
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 2>if that is the correct way of saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got no wisdom,</v>

206
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that is,</v>

207
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

208
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.260
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an important point to look.</v>

209
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 2>My friend Steve Rinella calls them </v>
<v Speaker 2>charismatic megafauna and he's like,</v>

210
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:24.471
<v Speaker 2>there's all these animals that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>charismatic megafauna that we have </v>

211
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:29.330
<v Speaker 2>anthropomorphized in movies like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lion king and Yogi bear and all these </v>

212
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 2>movies and we have this idealized view </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what they really are.</v>

213
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 2>But the reality of them is so alien to </v>
<v Speaker 2>us because we're never in Africa,</v>

214
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 2>in Zimbabwe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the jungle with these lines.</v>

215
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>And if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be absolutely fucking terrified of</v>

216
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 2>them and you wouldn't think of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I saw Jimmy Kimmel crying on TV.</v>

217
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

218
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you some videos.</v>

219
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you some videos of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cecil killing babies because apparently </v>

220
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of cecil actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing</v>

221
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 1>the actual same lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

222
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be him.</v>

223
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.690
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:10:01.691 --> 00:10:04.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a condescending to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who live there.</v>

225
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

226
00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:06.200
<v Speaker 1>there are farmers there who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

227
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:11.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to be little teary about </v>

228
00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:11.201
<v Speaker 1>a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It eats out damn cows all the time.</v>

229
00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like elephants,</v>

230
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:14.120
<v Speaker 1>they just stomping all over our crops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

231
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.740
<v Speaker 1>let's save them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

232
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:21.190
<v Speaker 1>But we should have a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy for the human beings who were </v>

233
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.190
<v Speaker 1>there to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Well the human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the other one.</v>

235
00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:25.760
<v Speaker 1>The poachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lives of poachers.</v>

236
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

237
00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:27.530
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

238
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I am not defending this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

239
00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:35.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are several different versions of </v>

240
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:37.180
<v Speaker 2>what that guy did and some of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

241
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.060
<v Speaker 2>according to book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

242
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:39.700
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

243
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 2>they're fine in legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the only line that's ever </v>

244
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.430
<v Speaker 2>been killed like this with a collar on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

245
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.100
<v Speaker 2>When the lions are off the preserved </v>
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>

246
00:10:48.101 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 2>it's legal to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

247
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Not saying you should kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just saying if they're not there,</v>

248
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.250
<v Speaker 2>but here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

249
00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:55.960
<v Speaker 2>But they lured him off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the difference,</v>

250
00:10:55.961 --> 00:11:00.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's legal to kill as much as </v>

251
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:00.961
<v Speaker 2>you want poachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

252
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:05.200
<v Speaker 2>they can kill people there every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when they have these hunting camps,</v>

253
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.900
<v Speaker 2>when they go out looking for lions or </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

254
00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:10.720
<v Speaker 2>more often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's lions are fairly rare.</v>

255
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go over there to hunt,</v>

256
00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:17.491
<v Speaker 2>they want to hunt something to eat with </v>
<v Speaker 2>big antlers they could put on their </v>

257
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:17.491
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>

258
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a neeland or a gazelle or something</v>

259
00:11:18.881 --> 00:11:23.881
<v Speaker 2>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they go to hunt those occasionally </v>

260
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:25.270
<v Speaker 2>they'll find people that are there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they call these people poachers,</v>

261
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.000
<v Speaker 2>and what they are is extremely poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are.</v>

262
00:11:28.001 --> 00:11:30.460
<v Speaker 2>They're shooting these animals without a</v>
<v Speaker 2>permit and you know what they do,</v>

263
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 2>they murder them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They murdered these people on a regular </v>

264
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.191
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who went over there for </v>

265
00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:38.191
<v Speaker 2>a hunting camp and while he was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

266
00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:39.970
<v Speaker 2>the people that he was with shot a </v>
<v Speaker 2>poacher,</v>

267
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.020
<v Speaker 2>shot it right in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a man and that man had a,</v>

268
00:11:44.021 --> 00:11:45.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gun that was like a,</v>

269
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.280
<v Speaker 2>they have makeshift guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

270
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.800
<v Speaker 2>it's an actual gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have real bullets.</v>

271
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 2>So what they do is they create a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like a piece of metal,</v>

272
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 2>they find pieces of metal and they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some gun powder and they create a firing</v>

273
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 2>pin and they have to light it like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>musket.</v>

274
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are extremely,</v>

275
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 2>extremely poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

276
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 2>they find their camps and a lot of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>camps,</v>

277
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.580
<v Speaker 2>they'll find evidence of witchcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have this white powder that </v>

278
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 2>they'll find these camps and they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>this white powder on the wrists and they</v>

279
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:21.030
<v Speaker 2>believe this white powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been blessed by this switch.</v>

280
00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:26.031
<v Speaker 2>Doctor makes them invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy was standing out in the </v>

281
00:12:26.031 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 2>open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right next to a tree when the,</v>

282
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game wardens,</v>

283
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 2>the people that live and work in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>and handle this stuff,</v>

284
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:38.641
<v Speaker 2>shot this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shot this guy and you know what </v>

285
00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 2>they do with them when they shoot them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fill out paperwork or they don't.</v>

286
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they just feed them to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyenas.</v>

287
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.230
<v Speaker 2>And this happens every day and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens all the time because they have </v>

288
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.600
<v Speaker 2>these huge hunting preserves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

289
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So these preserves might be 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

290
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 2>40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>acres,</v>

291
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe more enormous.</v>

292
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.930
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend was onset.</v>

293
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 2>It took eight hours to drive from one </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the ranch to the other.</v>

294
00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about an enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of land.</v>

295
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 2>And in this enormous beautiful land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find insanely poor people.</v>

296
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 2>And these insanely poor people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

297
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dry.</v>

298
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 2>There's no supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

299
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no government support.</v>

300
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:13.570
<v Speaker 2>There's no where for them to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do they do?</v>

301
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:18.571
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take a risk and they go and try to </v>

302
00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:20.230
<v Speaker 2>find animals to kill in these hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>preserves and they get shot and they get</v>

303
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 2>killed and no one gives a fuck.</v>

304
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the economic,</v>

305
00:13:23.001 --> 00:13:28.001
<v Speaker 3>the fund,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the underlying problem here is the </v>

306
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:28.001
<v Speaker 3>economics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

307
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:28.001
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's another,</v>

308
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:28.760
<v Speaker 3>there's a case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people say,</v>

309
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.050
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trophy hunting,</v>

310
00:13:30.051 --> 00:13:32.600
<v Speaker 3>you may not agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the $50,000</v>

311
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.670
<v Speaker 3>per person to spending can then go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintaining a preserve that actually </v>

312
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.901
<v Speaker 3>protects a whole bunch of of lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm a bit sort of conflicted about </v>

313
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:44.330
<v Speaker 3>that because there are only a few tens </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thousands of lines left,</v>

314
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.910
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even even fewer elephants at ink.</v>

315
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.500
<v Speaker 2>So there's some areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on Africa.</v>

316
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:54.710
<v Speaker 2>There's some areas where they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>call elephants because they have too </v>

317
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.710
<v Speaker 2>many of them.</v>

318
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

319
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's because of the encroachment of </v>

320
00:13:58.601 --> 00:13:58.601
<v Speaker 3>cities and more and more know losing so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much of their habitat.</v>

321
00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:01.070
<v Speaker 3>You might have a lot of elephants in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular small area,</v>

322
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.560
<v Speaker 3>but overall the number is going down </v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatically across the content.</v>

323
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

324
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.120
<v Speaker 3>I was reading a piece the other day that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was saying that,</v>

325
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within within 15 or 20 years,</v>

326
00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:13.160
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely possible they just won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be any African elephants left.</v>

327
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Well before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So forgive me for anybody who's </v>

328
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.931
<v Speaker 2>listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Louis through has a great </v>

329
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:21.931
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

330
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I heard him on your show as well.</v>

331
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge fan of Louis and I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>that episode a couple of times.</v>

332
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that was pointed out </v>

333
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.031
<v Speaker 2>in that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of animals that were on </v>

334
00:14:33.031 --> 00:14:34.801
<v Speaker 2>the verge of extinction that are now </v>
<v Speaker 2>thriving because they live in these </v>

335
00:14:34.801 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 2>giant hunting camps that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>

336
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.030
<v Speaker 2>You look at it and that's what the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>running the hunting camp said,</v>

337
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:40.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

338
00:14:40.741 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 2>when Louis was kind of confronting him </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

339
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to me,</v>

340
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I have an it guy to clocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

341
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.430
<v Speaker 2>that's an intense moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How incredible.</v>

342
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.710
<v Speaker 2>That guy saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

343
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

344
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>This guy is like,</v>

345
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 4>he's just at his wits end.</v>

346
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 3>So Ricky Gervais' was coming on facebook</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>

347
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 3>about cecil the lion and the trophy </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting and everything.</v>

348
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Because he's a big animal rights guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd super opposed to trophy hunting and</v>

349
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:04.960
<v Speaker 3>he was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

350
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.180
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe this is going to fund something </v>

351
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but would you allow some asshole to like</v>

352
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.730
<v Speaker 3>shoot a cancer patient if he was willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to donate a million dollars to cancer </v>

353
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 3>research?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how.</v>

354
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

355
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.320
<v Speaker 3>why doesn't the asshole who just donate </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he thinks he's doing a good deed to </v>

356
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 3>fail lion conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>donate the $50,000</v>

357
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:24.640
<v Speaker 3>and then just don't kill a lion?</v>

358
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he's,</v>

359
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wants to line in his house so he </v>

360
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.080
<v Speaker 4>could climb on top of it and jerk off to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

361
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.830
<v Speaker 3>and that's the whole point and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what he likes.</v>

362
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Then it comes back to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Jon Ronson,</v>

363
00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 3>you've had him on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've been publicly shamed.</v>

364
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Guys love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

365
00:15:44.051 --> 00:15:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hader does the best John Ronson </v>
<v Speaker 3>impersonation you've ever heard.</v>

366
00:15:47.701 --> 00:15:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I had bill hader and a judd apatow on </v>
<v Speaker 3>huff post live a couple of weeks ago and</v>

367
00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:54.520
<v Speaker 3>for some reason we were just talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what books they like.</v>

368
00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember how it came up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Judd apatow was like,</v>

369
00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm really into John Ronson and I kinda </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that John was my special little </v>

370
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.300
<v Speaker 3>fetish I think is so great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

371
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.740
<v Speaker 3>but he's not like an a list writer in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America at least I don't think that many</v>

372
00:16:08.741 --> 00:16:10.900
<v Speaker 3>people know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Bill Hayden was like,</v>

373
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just listened to the audiobook of his </v>

374
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.850
<v Speaker 3>book and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just listened to the audiobook of his </v>

375
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.191
<v Speaker 3>book and Bill Hader starts going </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant John Ronson infestation.</v>

376
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:28.770
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to this guy who shot the </v>

377
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.871
<v Speaker 3>lion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reminds me a bit of what John is always </v>

378
00:16:30.871 --> 00:16:30.871
<v Speaker 3>on about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about like.</v>

379
00:16:30.871 --> 00:16:32.350
<v Speaker 3>So he's had to shatter his dental </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>

380
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.680
<v Speaker 3>There's like a sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were signs of abuse all over the </v>

381
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.620
<v Speaker 3>dental practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His big business has ruined.</v>

382
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.260
<v Speaker 3>He's had to go into hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

383
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 3>is that fair?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like should you.</v>

384
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did a shitty thing.</v>

385
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.710
<v Speaker 3>I completely don't agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand like trophy hunting.</v>

386
00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:49.300
<v Speaker 3>I understand hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting for meat,</v>

387
00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:51.850
<v Speaker 3>but I don't understand trophy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

388
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.970
<v Speaker 3>but we all pile on and we all love being</v>
<v Speaker 3>so self righteous and so sanctimonious </v>

389
00:16:57.011 --> 00:16:58.840
<v Speaker 3>about it at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once again,</v>

390
00:16:58.841 --> 00:17:03.841
<v Speaker 3>as we're eating all those pigs that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been tortured and people button into </v>

391
00:17:03.841 --> 00:17:05.440
<v Speaker 3>chicken burgers that have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's another tortured animal,</v>

392
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:10.470
<v Speaker 3>but the moment there's something with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big fluffy main and it has a cute name </v>

393
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.870
<v Speaker 3>like [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you pronounce that name?</v>

394
00:17:10.871 --> 00:17:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Cecil in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that Cecil?</v>

395
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

396
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Sessile sounds better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

397
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.500
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also like if the,</v>

398
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.560
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the lion's name was like goth or </v>

399
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:22.560
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people would be.</v>

400
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.270
<v Speaker 3>I was upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sessile is the cutest name.</v>

401
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:27.340
<v Speaker 3>No one who's called sessile has ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>done anything wrong.</v>

402
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cecil though is like a cool black guy </v>

403
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.910
<v Speaker 4>who hangs around pool halls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

404
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.040
<v Speaker 4>Cecil can hook you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cecil,</v>

405
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.350
<v Speaker 4>is it that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's where it cut may west.</v>

406
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.000
<v Speaker 4>That's where the pronunciation </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference comes from.</v>

407
00:17:40.001 --> 00:17:41.920
<v Speaker 4>Does it come from African Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

408
00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

409
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of different words </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they pronounced differently in </v>

410
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:47.990
<v Speaker 4>England.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

411
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.220
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

412
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in spelled differently</v>

413
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.070
<v Speaker 2>like tires of the why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always bizarre when I read like </v>

414
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 2>English auto mail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>auto magazines,</v>

415
00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 2>higher t y r e s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>m,</v>

416
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:02.751
<v Speaker 2>I think that the idea of this killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this animal for no reason other than you</v>

417
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:07.170
<v Speaker 2>want to kill it because you like killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things is what freaks everybody out.</v>

418
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.260
<v Speaker 2>The idea that this sociopath could go </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there and kill these beautiful </v>

419
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:12.260
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

420
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what freaks people out.</v>

421
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:19.011
<v Speaker 2>But what's going on right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why this guy did this is people are </v>

422
00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:19.940
<v Speaker 2>killing lions all over Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

423
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 2>here's really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's really fucked up.</v>

424
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 2>There was an article that said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jericho,</v>

425
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Cecil's brother had also been killed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>line and everybody was like,</v>

426
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>

427
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 2>We lost Jericho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy because it's Geragos got a</v>

428
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 2>name and then they said it was a false </v>
<v Speaker 2>alarm.</v>

429
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Worry not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't Jericho.</v>

430
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.400
<v Speaker 2>It was just some poor</v>

431
00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.810
<v Speaker 1>line that doesn't have a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>

432
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of highlights what Rinella was</v>

433
00:18:47.471 --> 00:18:49.570
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's charismatic Megafauna,</v>

434
00:18:49.571 --> 00:18:54.571
<v Speaker 1>you give them a name and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something significant about </v>

435
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:54.571
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They they are.</v>

436
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:55.840
<v Speaker 1>They have a personality like Simba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

437
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:56.740
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to.</v>

438
00:18:56.741 --> 00:18:58.840
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out here in La this weekend doing an</v>

439
00:18:58.841 --> 00:19:01.540
<v Speaker 1>episode of my new show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just launched a podcast,</v>

440
00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:06.541
<v Speaker 1>which is a panel of three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three comics sitting around talking </v>

441
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:07.210
<v Speaker 1>about the news each week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>

442
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It's called we the people live so people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get.</v>

443
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.690

446
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brains to your list as a clever </v>

447
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be able to write it down.</v>

448
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.940
<v Speaker 1>You say that you need to go on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and my facebook and read some </v>

449
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.880
<v Speaker 1>comments on instagram as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Youtube.</v>

450
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the fire pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the pit of stupidity or or you </v>

451
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.450
<v Speaker 1>can go to WTP livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the other plug plug now,</v>

452
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

453
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had Greg Fitzsimmons on the,</v>

454
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:43.730
<v Speaker 1>on the show last night and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

455
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.770
<v Speaker 1>we just got a bunch of people together </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Hollywood and Fred Stoller who was a </v>

456
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.770
<v Speaker 1>writer on Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>

457
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Fred did a joke about exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were just saying about cecil the lion.</v>

458
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.430
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if someone like had intended,</v>

459
00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.500
<v Speaker 1>like someone accidentally shot Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 1>Willis,</v>

460
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.860
<v Speaker 1>but they thought that we're gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting like Gregory Mcgee and they're </v>

461
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:04.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

462
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize that I was shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>bruce.</v>

463
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought I was going to be killing</v>

464
00:20:06.671 --> 00:20:08.410
<v Speaker 1>this other random dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd still be like,</v>

465
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd still murdered a guy.</v>

466
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether it's Jericho.</v>

467
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:15.130
<v Speaker 1>The shit hit the law and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way was culpable.</v>

468
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.730
<v Speaker 1>People were</v>

469
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:21.170
<v Speaker 2>set that Jericho died and now they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not upset because it was an unknown </v>

470
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:25.041
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no one is calling for the head of </v>

471
00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 2>this person that shot this unknown lion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're stupid.</v>

472
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.890
<v Speaker 2>We're very stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're also ruined by media.</v>

473
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that media depictions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of animals and when you add human voices</v>

474
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:36.390
<v Speaker 2>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like zookeeper movie that I was in,</v>

475
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

476
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:37.950
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>

477
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.980
<v Speaker 2>you do fuck with people's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're not designed to take in </v>

478
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.361
<v Speaker 2>the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't believe that the human </v>

479
00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:49.641
<v Speaker 2>body and brain is designed for films and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when we sit down there and we </v>

480
00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 2>watched some epic movie with lions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was a movie called bears.</v>

481
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.560
<v Speaker 2>That was a nature documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Low was.</v>

483
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 2>It was all over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was another one called cats,</v>

484
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:06.001
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was recent and it was about big </v>

485
00:21:06.001 --> 00:21:08.401
<v Speaker 2>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't show what the fuck they </v>

486
00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:08.401
<v Speaker 2>really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bear documentary,</v>

487
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.280
<v Speaker 2>they didn't show the bears killing cubs </v>
<v Speaker 2>or bears kill cubs.</v>

488
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:17.281
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what they'd like to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why female </v>

489
00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 2>bears are so aggressive when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>around their,</v>

490
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 2>their babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

491
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bears the Disney nature.</v>

492
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Film bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

493
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:27.030
<v Speaker 2>They didn't show that male bears come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of hibernation and they go looking </v>

494
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 2>for cubs first things they try to eat.</v>

495
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that I buy your thesis that</v>

496
00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 3>things like animated movies like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lion king screw us up,</v>

497
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.580
<v Speaker 3>but I do definitely think that if there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is something which is a pseudo </v>

498
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:41.580
<v Speaker 3>documentary like what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

499
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.780
<v Speaker 3>like or something like one movie that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hated,</v>

500
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get through more than 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes of it was march of the penguins.</v>

501
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had opened that about it.</v>

502
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I was angry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

503
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of it.</v>

504
00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:55.010
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that were mating for </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and I was like,</v>

505
00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they mate for life and they're </v>

506
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 2>monogamous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

507
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only meet for a year.</v>

508
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>

509
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look exactly the same.</v>

510
00:22:04.131 --> 00:22:09.131
<v Speaker 2>It's not like one penguin is Jenna </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jameson Pega and the other ones that </v>

511
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:09.131
<v Speaker 2>rosie o'donnell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>penguin,</v>

512
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:10.070
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking penguins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the point in cheating?</v>

513
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Just pretend you're</v>

514
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:15.970
<v Speaker 3>cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like as if everyone was just </v>

515
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:15.970
<v Speaker 3>identical twins,</v>

516
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:15.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

517
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Well it was also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a part of the movie and this </v>

518
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:20.340
<v Speaker 2>really did happen when I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

519
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I was watching and there's those leopard</v>
<v Speaker 2>seals that feed off of the penguins that</v>

520
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:28.591
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know it was a real animal </v>

521
00:22:28.591 --> 00:22:30.140
<v Speaker 2>until that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's this amazing piece of an animal</v>

522
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.760
<v Speaker 2>with these huge teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

523
00:22:31.761 --> 00:22:32.600
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

524
00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.240
<v Speaker 2>this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing's a wow.</v>

525
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.570
<v Speaker 2>And there was a family in front of me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this mom was upset at me that I was </v>

526
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.010
<v Speaker 2>happy when the leopard seal was eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the penguins.</v>

527
00:22:43.011 --> 00:22:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the,</v>

528
00:22:43.531 --> 00:22:45.560
<v Speaker 2>with the penguin is fucking slaughtering</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fish.</v>

529
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Like the hierarchy took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a leopard seal right there.</v>

530
00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Look at the fucking incredible beast of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the leopard sale?</v>

531
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.330
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't need to have a right to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does not mean in all forms.</v>

532
00:22:56.331 --> 00:22:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Can we up the star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the penguin</v>

533
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.110
<v Speaker 3>march of a leopard seal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Josh.</v>

534
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 3>That's what I hated about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was this,</v>

535
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.790
<v Speaker 3>it was a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a total anthropomorphization,</v>

536
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:07.770
<v Speaker 3>if that's a word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which probably isn't of,</v>

537
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.650
<v Speaker 3>of penguin life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's,</v>

538
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.930
<v Speaker 3>it's portraying them as basically humans</v>
<v Speaker 3>in little costumes.</v>

539
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's creating all of these,</v>

540
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean clearly made up relation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be like,</v>

541
00:23:18.451 --> 00:23:23.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd see a shot of a penguin walking </v>

542
00:23:23.451 --> 00:23:25.130
<v Speaker 3>away and it would be like I'm young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimbo wandered off with a heavy heart to</v>

543
00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:32.571
<v Speaker 3>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think about how he'd just been </v>

544
00:23:32.571 --> 00:23:35.330
<v Speaker 3>jilted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like you have no idea what he's </v>

545
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.330
<v Speaker 3>probably wondering over there to take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

546
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking this shit is trying to find some </v>

547
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.761
<v Speaker 2>fish to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got three brain cells banging </v>

548
00:23:40.761 --> 00:23:40.761
<v Speaker 2>around inside of stupid little bird </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

549
00:23:40.761 --> 00:23:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there is a.</v>

550
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>I think like companies like Disney </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably should be held to better </v>

551
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 3>account to be more responsible about </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating to children the reality of</v>

552
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:50.750
<v Speaker 3>animal life rather than making it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sunny.</v>

553
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Don't want their kids to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like pull up this video.</v>

554
00:23:54.011 --> 00:23:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Jamie lion killing cub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male lion killing cops.</v>

555
00:23:56.951 --> 00:23:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I put this up on twitter and I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter took it down.</v>

556
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:05.070
<v Speaker 2>But what actually happened is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>retweeted somebody else tweeted it and </v>

557
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.801
<v Speaker 2>the guy who tweeted it got attacked so </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard that he decided to delete his </v>

558
00:24:08.261 --> 00:24:09.190
<v Speaker 2>tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>

559
00:24:09.191 --> 00:24:10.810
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks a lot Joe.</v>

560
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:16.050
<v Speaker 2>It was just too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason why he got in trouble is </v>

561
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:20.521
<v Speaker 2>because there's line is killing cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this is reality and it's not just </v>

562
00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:21.810
<v Speaker 2>an isolated instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a line.</v>

563
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.240
<v Speaker 2>A screw loose is one on a baby killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>rampage.</v>

564
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.200
<v Speaker 2>This is what they do when a lion takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a pride,</v>

565
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.450
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things he does after he</v>
<v Speaker 2>chases out,</v>

566
00:24:31.451 --> 00:24:31.890
<v Speaker 2>go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play it.</v>

567
00:24:31.891 --> 00:24:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the first things he does after he</v>

568
00:24:33.941 --> 00:24:37.090
<v Speaker 2>chases out the male line is kill all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>its babies.</v>

569
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what's going on right here.</v>

570
00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

571
00:24:40.081 --> 00:24:45.081
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed Richard Dawkins recently </v>

572
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:47.271
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've got another event coming up </v>

573
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:47.271
<v Speaker 3>with him in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in October,</v>

574
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:47.271
<v Speaker 3>which is going to be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

575
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:47.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote the selfish gene,</v>

576
00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:53.450
<v Speaker 3>meaning like the unit of evolution is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the individual and it's not the </v>

577
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.850
<v Speaker 3>species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the gene.</v>

578
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Now that line is killing those cubs </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what better way to make sure </v>

579
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.740
<v Speaker 3>that it's genes ended up getting passed </v>
<v Speaker 3>on and spread out and procreated through</v>

580
00:25:01.741 --> 00:25:03.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

581
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.720
<v Speaker 3>the extended the pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no better by making sure that </v>

582
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.630
<v Speaker 3>all of the other babies from the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys</v>

583
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:10.350
<v Speaker 2>don't go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

584
00:25:10.351 --> 00:25:12.250
<v Speaker 2>he's just following instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why wouldn't you.</v>

585
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.660
<v Speaker 2>This is part of the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

586
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in favor of killing lions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

587
00:25:18.361 --> 00:25:20.820
<v Speaker 2>this is cecil by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true.</v>

588
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

590
00:25:22.951 --> 00:25:25.080
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cecil has been studied.</v>

591
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are part of an Oxford study</v>
<v Speaker 2>or was.</v>

592
00:25:27.121 --> 00:25:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

593
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.650
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actually the head of that study,</v>

594
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.730
<v Speaker 2>the Oxford Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating stuff that looks different </v>

595
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.001
<v Speaker 2>because he's younger in this video and </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently when they get older they get </v>

596
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:38.550
<v Speaker 2>the black around their main.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true,</v>

597
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.780
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bottom line is this is also part of </v>

598
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.580
<v Speaker 2>the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so by showing only the beautiful aspects</v>

599
00:25:44.581 --> 00:25:49.581
<v Speaker 2>of the line with flowing main walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst the cubs that are his and the </v>

600
00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:53.010
<v Speaker 2>female lionesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see the actual whole animal.</v>

601
00:25:53.011 --> 00:25:58.011
<v Speaker 2>You don't see the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also don't see the reality of the </v>

602
00:25:58.011 --> 00:26:00.801
<v Speaker 2>poaching and what these people go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that lived there and they and </v>

603
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:04.540
<v Speaker 2>then it's easy for these hunting wardens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to murder those people that are trying </v>

604
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.990
<v Speaker 2>to survive today is so much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing.</v>

605
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's this big question.</v>

606
00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:09.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's the.</v>

607
00:26:09.691 --> 00:26:14.691
<v Speaker 3>There's the ethics of actually taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lives of these animals and the </v>

608
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:16.020
<v Speaker 3>hypocrisy of loving dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not pigs and of eating chicken,</v>

609
00:26:16.021 --> 00:26:18.060
<v Speaker 3>but then going crazy about cecil the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lion,</v>

610
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 3>but then at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always come back to the fundamental </v>

611
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.450
<v Speaker 3>fact that we are living through one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest extinction events in </v>

612
00:26:27.541 --> 00:26:32.541
<v Speaker 3>history that's been unleashed by humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If in 50 years time we don't want to </v>

613
00:26:33.631 --> 00:26:37.500
<v Speaker 3>live in a world that has no lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has no African elephants,</v>

614
00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.860
<v Speaker 3>has totally polluted overfished waters </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you kind of eat tuna anymore </v>

615
00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 3>because there's so much mercury</v>

616
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.340
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we've got to find ways of dealing </v>

617
00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.660
<v Speaker 2>with this and if the poachers are part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that problem.</v>

618
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you put a bullet in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

619
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.760
<v Speaker 2>but you got to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See with approaches that are getting </v>

620
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.131
<v Speaker 2>killed in Africa though most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's different types of </v>

621
00:27:01.131 --> 00:27:04.041
<v Speaker 2>poachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's poachers in Africa that are </v>

622
00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:04.041
<v Speaker 2>killing elephants for their ivory and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

623
00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 2>This is the most unbelievably brutal </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it.</v>

624
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.480
<v Speaker 2>When poachers kill elephants for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>ivory,</v>

625
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.600
<v Speaker 2>the amount of ivory that they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get like four or five elephants </v>

626
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:14.950
<v Speaker 2>that they kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they they.</v>

627
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.360
<v Speaker 2>There was a big story a few days ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they killed five elephants and </v>

628
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:20.990
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just chop off their tusks and leave</v>

629
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bodies to rot.</v>

630
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.500
<v Speaker 2>They got like $200 for those tusks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those tests on the black market are </v>

631
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 2>worth tens of thousands of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's fucking crazy.</v>

632
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:36.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is not hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also talking about people </v>

633
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.860
<v Speaker 2>that are just so fucking desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't even understand the pint,</v>

634
00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of desperate people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are a lot of desperate people born </v>

635
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.580
<v Speaker 2>desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're stuck.</v>

636
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:45.150
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

637
00:27:45.151 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 2>if you're in that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend,</v>

638
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Speaker 2>his name is Justin wren and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll be on the podcast soon again.</v>

639
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:51.840
<v Speaker 2>He's been on a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

640
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.660
<v Speaker 2>he still was an mma fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he went over there.</v>

641
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a trip and met some pygmies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Congo and fell in love and just was </v>

642
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.491
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to help these people and we've </v>

643
00:28:04.491 --> 00:28:04.491
<v Speaker 2>been donating money and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>building wells.</v>

644
00:28:04.491 --> 00:28:05.870
<v Speaker 2>They've built 16 wells for these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>

645
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 2>They're bringing in medical supplies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing all these things to try to help </v>

646
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his.</v>

647
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 2>The feeling that he got when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

648
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's no one helping these </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

649
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 2>They asked to do anything they can to </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

650
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 2>These people that are on these hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>preserves that they're calling poachers,</v>

651
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are just trying to feed </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

652
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.810
<v Speaker 2>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no where to go.</v>

653
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.960
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no options and it's legal to </v>

654
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 2>kill those people and then the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's someone legal,</v>

655
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.660
<v Speaker 2>it is legal in Africa to kill these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

656
00:28:32.661 --> 00:28:33.970
<v Speaker 2>It's not legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legal.</v>

657
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might.</v>

658
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.500
<v Speaker 2>They might turn a blind eye to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always.</v>

659
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 2>It's always illegal to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

660
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:45.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not in Africa.</v>

661
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 2>A poacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can shoot a poacher when they are on</v>

662
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:52.230
<v Speaker 2>your property and it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fill out paperwork and you're done.</v>

663
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.770
<v Speaker 2>And it not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was being done by what they call,</v>

664
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 2>they call them professional hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're essentially game wardens.</v>

665
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.300
<v Speaker 2>So like if you were um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:29:03.301 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were in Montana,</v>

667
00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.110
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were elk hunting and you,</v>

668
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.050
<v Speaker 2>when you shoot an animal you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a tag for it,</v>

669
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.080
<v Speaker 2>which means in Indian state allows </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting tiger poachers on site offers </v>

670
00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 2>money to informants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

671
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 2>India in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

672
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

673
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:22.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

674
00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not uncommon to be for it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>legal to shoot poachers,</v>

675
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.880
<v Speaker 2>but that's because they're down to only </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a few thousand lines or a few </v>

676
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.380
<v Speaker 2>thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In ancient India it might be even less </v>

677
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.481
<v Speaker 2>than thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be like hundreds of of tigers </v>

678
00:29:38.481 --> 00:29:41.691
<v Speaker 2>in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But point being it's not just legal like</v>

679
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 2>it's done every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyday.</v>

680
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Africa is so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the other thing that people </v>

681
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.710
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

682
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.600
<v Speaker 2>we have this perception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our head that Africa is something like </v>

683
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

684
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 2>well we know what life is like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

685
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:58.570
<v Speaker 2>so we expect life is like that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>

686
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 2>So if these people are over there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa and they're shooting lions,</v>

687
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:07.231
<v Speaker 2>these are terrible people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We the same sanely hard place to live.</v>

688
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Insanely awful place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of ways,</v>

689
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.120
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many parts.</v>

690
00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 3>I think people know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people have any illusions </v>

691
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.851
<v Speaker 3>about what Africa is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only time we see Africa on the news </v>

692
00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:20.060
<v Speaker 3>is when some horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible shit goes down.</v>

693
00:30:20.061 --> 00:30:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Or when Bono is playing some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

694
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:24.230
<v Speaker 3>some charity concert to raise money for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

695
00:30:24.231 --> 00:30:29.231
<v Speaker 3>I think if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've got friends who live in </v>

696
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:29.231
<v Speaker 3>Nairobi and there are lots of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

697
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:31.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean the bill and Melinda Gates </v>
<v Speaker 3>Foundation is doing all kinds of stuff.</v>

698
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.500
<v Speaker 3>There are lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of entrepreneurship.</v>

699
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Cell phones have have revolutionized the</v>
<v Speaker 3>continent because all of a sudden people</v>

700
00:30:37.461 --> 00:30:40.400
<v Speaker 3>are able to like send a text message to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the market that's three,</v>

701
00:30:40.401 --> 00:30:42.950
<v Speaker 3>a three hour walk away and ask what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what price?</v>

702
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish or rice or getting that day and </v>

703
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 3>they can actually plan instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 3>guessing like there.</v>

704
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.070
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of good news stories in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>

705
00:30:49.071 --> 00:30:54.071
<v Speaker 3>I'm not downplaying how terrible it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that the only way that you </v>

706
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:57.761
<v Speaker 3>can survive on the continent of Africa </v>
<v Speaker 3>is by poaching is by being an ivory </v>

707
00:30:57.761 --> 00:30:57.830
<v Speaker 3>poachers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

708
00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.980
<v Speaker 3>These are the people who are saying food</v>
<v Speaker 3>poachers.</v>

709
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these were that are getting shot in </v>

710
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.971
<v Speaker 2>these game preserves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are just hunting gazelles </v>

711
00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:07.971
<v Speaker 2>or something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

712
00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Just hunting for food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have nothing.</v>

713
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is I know all these </v>

714
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:13.740
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware of all these stories.</v>

715
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.961
<v Speaker 2>I read them all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think unless you have feet on the </v>

716
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:19.211
<v Speaker 2>ground in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you actually go there and </v>

717
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:21.371
<v Speaker 2>experience it firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that I've talked to that's </v>

718
00:31:21.371 --> 00:31:21.920
<v Speaker 2>been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it is another world.</v>

719
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.090
<v Speaker 2>You might as well be on the mobile with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Moon,</v>

720
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.690
<v Speaker 2>the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be on the phone as well on that.</v>

721
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I think I know the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think I haven't internalized it </v>

722
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.780
<v Speaker 2>and that's what happened to my friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin when he went there,</v>

723
00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.580
<v Speaker 2>he just just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

724
00:31:37.581 --> 00:31:40.940
<v Speaker 2>I got to do something and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>struck with it because I don't,</v>

725
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think don't think it gets in.</v>

726
00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I think the information hits the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stores it,</v>

727
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one plus one is two.</v>

728
00:31:47.211 --> 00:31:50.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's all there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unless you were there,</v>

729
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you could truly understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

730
00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.450
<v Speaker 2>what that place is like.</v>

731
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:58.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that's probably true and </v>

732
00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:58.840
<v Speaker 3>we're also so caught up in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our own little worlds.</v>

733
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:03.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean especially in this country </v>
<v Speaker 3>because America is so big and it's so </v>

734
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:06.941
<v Speaker 3>easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to maintain just live inside of the </v>

735
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:07.510
<v Speaker 3>American cultural bubble essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not,</v>

736
00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 3>it's you have to actively proactively </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to seek out other sources of </v>

737
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.821
<v Speaker 3>information and other experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise it's very easy to just coast </v>

738
00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:16.970
<v Speaker 3>along here and not really think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the world.</v>

739
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:22.050
<v Speaker 2>It's also kind of ironic that the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>big lion story that came out of Africa </v>

740
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.210
<v Speaker 2>was the editor from the game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got pulled out of her car by a lion.</v>

741
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.340
<v Speaker 2>She was taking a photograph of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lion was like,</v>

742
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an open window.</v>

743
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:33.751
<v Speaker 2>Just dove into the car and literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled her out in front of her friends </v>

744
00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:37.111
<v Speaker 2>and they're all screaming and the lion </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed her right in front of everybody </v>

745
00:32:37.111 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking killers.</v>

746
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>They're nature's cleanup crew.</v>

747
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 4>Anything with a limp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that looks like it's easy to </v>

748
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 4>take out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

749
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 4>the thing that they didn't even eat her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just killed her.</v>

750
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:49.090
<v Speaker 4>It was killer for a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tied over,</v>

751
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 4>taking pictures.</v>

752
00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:55.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like shocks like to just say the </v>
<v Speaker 3>aussie surfer that was crazy and </v>

753
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 3>attacked by a great white and like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole point like.</v>

754
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.640
<v Speaker 3>So sharks don't like what we taste like </v>
<v Speaker 3>right when they're to after big fatty </v>

755
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.100
<v Speaker 3>seals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like scrawny humans.</v>

756
00:33:03.101 --> 00:33:08.101
<v Speaker 3>We're all bound in sin you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they'll just take a bite to see </v>

757
00:33:08.101 --> 00:33:08.800
<v Speaker 3>if they like us and then they'll spit us</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

758
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:13.830
<v Speaker 3>But if it's a nine foot great white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that little taste is enough to kill</v>

759
00:33:13.961 --> 00:33:17.380
<v Speaker 3>you if they rip off your leg or a torso.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've always felt like,</v>

760
00:33:17.381 --> 00:33:22.381
<v Speaker 3>especially as an Australian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were that this was constantly just in </v>

761
00:33:22.381 --> 00:33:22.381
<v Speaker 3>the background of your mind as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility if we.</v>

762
00:33:22.381 --> 00:33:27.300
<v Speaker 3>Because we're always at the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I would prefer it if they actually </v>

763
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.321
<v Speaker 3>liked us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at least one of us is happy and it's </v>

764
00:33:31.321 --> 00:33:33.340
<v Speaker 3>just the ignominy of Bay of both being </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

765
00:33:33.341 --> 00:33:35.440
<v Speaker 3>And then also the shock being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

766
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.660
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you sean.</v>

767
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 4>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are the ultimate cleanup crew.</v>

768
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 4>They're just dead behind the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black Marbles for eyeballs.</v>

769
00:33:43.101 --> 00:33:45.470
<v Speaker 4>Love Him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like a shock nerd as a kid.</v>

770
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Books about sharks and would always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

771
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.820
<v Speaker 4>because I don't really go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

772
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't surf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But apparently surfing in South Africa </v>

773
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 4>is like fucking jogging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were lions live is.</v>

774
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>South Africa and South Australia.</v>

775
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Both at the bottom of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because great whites like you know,</v>

776
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.870
<v Speaker 4>cool is and that's just where you find </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

777
00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:08.420
<v Speaker 4>so fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

778
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.230
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

779
00:34:09.231 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they're finding a lot of them</v>

780
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:16.871
<v Speaker 4>off the Malibu coast right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seeing them on a regular basis and some </v>

781
00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:19.010
<v Speaker 4>reason north in northern San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that area,</v>

782
00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 4>they breed out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a buddy,</v>

783
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 4>my friend Alex Ross who runs a shark </v>
<v Speaker 4>works,</v>

784
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.060
<v Speaker 4>which is actually a porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man like,</v>

787
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.950
<v Speaker 4>calls it.</v>

788
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:34.810
<v Speaker 4>That's the name of his company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shark is a shark fan.</v>

789
00:34:34.811 --> 00:34:36.380
<v Speaker 4>He's a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He told me there's like,</v>

791
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 4>they breed out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

792
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Like in northern somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

793
00:34:40.131 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 4>But like what the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like right there,</v>

794
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:47.700
<v Speaker 4>he's got a damn monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing to what is called </v>

795
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.961
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There aren't that many people swimming </v>

796
00:34:49.961 --> 00:34:51.491
<v Speaker 4>in San Francisco Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a video of them taking a </v>

797
00:34:51.491 --> 00:34:54.611
<v Speaker 4>surfboard and pulling it behind a boat </v>
<v Speaker 4>in South Africa just to show there's </v>

798
00:34:54.611 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 4>this one area that's just overrun with </v>
<v Speaker 4>sharks.</v>

799
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.210
<v Speaker 4>And as they pull this surfboard behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>the boat,</v>

800
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.210
<v Speaker 4>these sharks just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pam just hitting the surfboard,</v>

801
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 4>knocking it up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

802
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.330
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're amazing.</v>

803
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Speaker 4>Who wouldn't love him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a lion sale.</v>

804
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.700
<v Speaker 4>Like I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that girl who lost her arm,</v>

805
00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:13.550
<v Speaker 4>she'd probably wouldn't be really too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much into them.</v>

806
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:13.940
<v Speaker 4>Did,</v>

807
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:14.470
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

808
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.920
<v Speaker 3>did you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this petition that they've got just a.</v>

809
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:22.030
<v Speaker 3>This is from left field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just popped into my head and I </v>

810
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.120
<v Speaker 3>don't know why about the 19 year old kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

811
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:28.121
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had sex with a 17 year old girl who </v>

812
00:35:28.121 --> 00:35:30.671
<v Speaker 3>had told him when she was 14 and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>told him she was 17 and now he and so he</v>

813
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:36.251
<v Speaker 3>went to jail and now he's on the sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>offender registry for 25 years and he's </v>

814
00:35:36.441 --> 00:35:41.441
<v Speaker 3>not going to be able to have a career </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he wanted to do software </v>

815
00:35:41.441 --> 00:35:41.441
<v Speaker 3>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as part of his parole,</v>

816
00:35:41.441 --> 00:35:45.621
<v Speaker 3>he's not allowed to own a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not allowed to own a smartphone </v>

817
00:35:45.621 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 3>because he's classified as a pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though she was physically mature.</v>

818
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 3>He thought she was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her parents lobbied the judge and Sheila</v>

819
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:56.700
<v Speaker 3>with the to plead and say please let </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy off,</v>

820
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.150
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but instead the judge threw,</v>

821
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Speaker 3>threw the book at him basically saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

822
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.770
<v Speaker 3>you should understand that sex is </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be a meaningful and like </v>

823
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.150
<v Speaker 3>holy experience between two people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>love each other.</v>

824
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be hooking up online like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

825
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.420
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

826
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.610

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

827
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 3>it was in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we check that is either.</v>

828
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.010
<v Speaker 3>It was in the midwest somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Indiana.</v>

829
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:25.220
<v Speaker 3>So now there's like 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>signatures on this petition to try to </v>

830
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:25.560
<v Speaker 3>get this guy off the sex offender </v>
<v Speaker 3>registry.</v>

831

835
00:36:33.721 --> 00:36:38.721
<v Speaker 2>At least he went outside and he took a </v>
<v Speaker 2>leak outside of this bar and apparently </v>

836
00:36:38.721 --> 00:36:43.461
<v Speaker 2>it's close to a school and because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>within x amount of feet of a school he </v>

837
00:36:43.461 --> 00:36:44.640

<v Speaker 2>he got caught by the cops and they,</v>

838
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 2>he's a sex offender for exposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

00:37:26.771 --> 00:37:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Girl says she's 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however she is actually 14.</v>

855
00:37:29.141 --> 00:37:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Zack traveled 20 miles from Indiana home</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Michigan and slept with her.</v>

856
00:37:32.891 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 2>He was arrested at the girl's mom.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I signed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

862
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.880
<v Speaker 3>this poor guy.</v>

863
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:47.990
<v Speaker 2>He's just a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

864
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.370
<v Speaker 2>When you're 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

865
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.810
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between a 14 and a 17 year old.</v>

866
00:37:53.811 --> 00:37:58.811
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know there's girls that are </v>

867
00:37:58.811 --> 00:37:58.811
<v Speaker 2>14 that looked like they're 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to.</v>

868
00:37:58.811 --> 00:37:59.750
<v Speaker 2>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

869
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

870
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I met a girl who was 25 who looked like </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was fucking 16.</v>

871
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:08.660
<v Speaker 2>People vary wildly in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their appearance and if you're 19 you</v>

872
00:38:08.661 --> 00:38:11.030
<v Speaker 2>don't have a whole lot of experience in </v>
<v Speaker 2>judging that shit.</v>

873
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:11.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

874
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:16.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he fucking got her drunk </v>
<v Speaker 2>or drugged her or any of that like this.</v>

875
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Is that the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

876
00:38:18.891 --> 00:38:21.350
<v Speaker 2>they should take him and drag him in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same place.</v>

877
00:38:21.351 --> 00:38:26.351
<v Speaker 2>They dragged that fucking surfboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take him and feed them to the </v>

878
00:38:26.351 --> 00:38:26.351
<v Speaker 2>sharks.</v>

879
00:38:26.351 --> 00:38:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Dan Savage has been going on a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this status to say because he liked that</v>

880
00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:29.520
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

881
00:38:29.521 --> 00:38:33.240
<v Speaker 3>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been on a couple of times and he's.</v>

882
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His point is like,</v>

883
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

884
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.040
<v Speaker 4>the hell legal rationale is there for </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that sex is supposed to be this </v>

885
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:46.351
<v Speaker 4>meaningful thing between two people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>love each other and so you shouldn't be </v>

886
00:38:46.351 --> 00:38:46.351
<v Speaker 4>using hot or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

887
00:38:46.351 --> 00:38:47.500
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who says the old judge?</v>

888
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:50.090
<v Speaker 4>And the prosecutor on that job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

889
00:38:50.091 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 4>when he was getting laid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no hot or not.</v>

890
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.360
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't getting the ladies and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably mad that he lost his virginity </v>

891
00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:57.900
<v Speaker 4>at 42 probably fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

892
00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Or never has maybe switch that robe on </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

893
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:06.330
<v Speaker 4>One judge that got caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was had some sort of a masturbation </v>

894
00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:06.480
<v Speaker 4>device underneath the robe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A condom.</v>

895
00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

896
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 4>They caught him in the middle of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>proceedings.</v>

897
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.630
<v Speaker 4>She had some like fucking pump on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>dick.</v>

898
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Crazy assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

899
00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:20.971
<v Speaker 4>I'm wearing one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm having such a good time </v>

900
00:39:20.971 --> 00:39:20.971
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind that I.</v>

901
00:39:20.971 --> 00:39:20.971
<v Speaker 4>I welcome that here.</v>

902
00:39:20.971 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 4>But this guy is a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

903
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:28.591
<v Speaker 4>He supposed to follow the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want his editorial comment on </v>

904
00:39:28.591 --> 00:39:29.580
<v Speaker 4>the nature of civilization and whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>or not people shouldn't,</v>

905
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.020
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't enjoy sex recreationally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

906
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Because that's what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's got nothing to do with,</v>

907
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.820
<v Speaker 4>with the offense at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think anytime a judge says something </v>

908
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:38.820
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should it like,</v>

909
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.781
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not a judge anymore because </v>

910
00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:42.781
<v Speaker 4>you've obviously lost your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

911
00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:44.320
<v Speaker 4>your balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've lost your,</v>

912
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.260
<v Speaker 4>your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what we want from you.</v>

913
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:52.150
<v Speaker 4>We want for you to be an expert in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>law as it's written in the law,</v>

914
00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:57.151
<v Speaker 4>as it's written,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to protect people not </v>

915
00:39:57.151 --> 00:39:57.151
<v Speaker 4>protecting anybody here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

916
00:39:57.151 --> 00:40:00.931
<v Speaker 4>let's try it and the whole point of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sex offender registry and that kind of </v>

917
00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:03.220
<v Speaker 4>stuff is to protect kids and parents </v>
<v Speaker 4>from predatory,</v>

918
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.460
<v Speaker 4>potentially violent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>repeat child rapists.</v>

919
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.800
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's ideally what that offender</v>

920
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 4>registry should do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hat who,</v>

921
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.990
<v Speaker 4>what kids is it protecting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Prosecute this 19 year old.</v>

922
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:19.170
<v Speaker 4>Does anyone seriously believe that if he</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a smart phone at any point in the </v>

923
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:22.471
<v Speaker 4>next 25 years or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's going to be like preying upon </v>

924
00:40:22.471 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 4>multiple 14 year old girls who look like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

925
00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:25.060
<v Speaker 4>17.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

926
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.830
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

927
00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:29.710
<v Speaker 4>it's just madness that someone thinks </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they could do that.</v>

928
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:34.740
<v Speaker 4>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a theory about that and I've </v>

929
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.631
<v Speaker 4>talked about it on the show before that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that one of the main problems </v>

930
00:40:36.631 --> 00:40:39.751
<v Speaker 4>that we have with law enforcement and </v>
<v Speaker 4>with police and even with judge and </v>

931
00:40:39.751 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 4>prosecutors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it becomes a game.</v>

932
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.040
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a win or lose if the guy gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

933
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:47.020
<v Speaker 4>you lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the guy,</v>

934
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:52.050
<v Speaker 4>if you convict him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you scored and I think we have this </v>

935
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.600
<v Speaker 4>built in thing about playing games and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw,</v>

936
00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:58.650
<v Speaker 4>I think it fits very keenly into that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dynamic that we have about winning and </v>

937
00:40:58.871 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Speaker 4>losing and I think that's why cops can </v>
<v Speaker 4>find some sort of a justification for,</v>

938
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.270
<v Speaker 4>for leaving evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for planting evidence.</v>

939
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.360
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy was shot the guy in North </v>
<v Speaker 4>Carolina and drops the Taser and </v>

940
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.260
<v Speaker 4>remember that we shot the guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and then drops the Taser out his </v>

941
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:16.260
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in the POC.</v>

942
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

943
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.090
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of that where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

944
00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:23.020
<v Speaker 4>they get locked into this trying to win </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and some people with cheap,</v>

945
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.710
<v Speaker 4>like people playing pool to like move a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball when you're not looking to cheat.</v>

946
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:31.860
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they want to win his petty </v>

947
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:31.860
<v Speaker 4>playing pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

948
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.800
<v Speaker 4>But when you're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're a cop,</v>

949
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>you also have a</v>

950
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.120
<v Speaker 2>quota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

951
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy on Michael Wood who's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>former police officer in Baltimore,</v>

952
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 2>who's enlightening means to how fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up Baltimore is.</v>

953
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 2>And how fucked up to police department </v>
<v Speaker 2>is and how crazy it is over there.</v>

954
00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:51.311
<v Speaker 2>But he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get in trouble if you're not </v>

955
00:41:51.311 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 2>arresting people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if no one commits crimes,</v>

956
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.370
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked as a cop because they're </v>

957
00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:57.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit.</v>

958
00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:59.030
<v Speaker 2>These people suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it can't be that it ever.</v>

959
00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:00.920
<v Speaker 2>It ever cleans up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be like,</v>

960
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

961
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm Baltimore just became Beverly Hills </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone is like this nice old rich </v>

962
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Jewish couple that doesn't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and no one knowing commits crimes.</v>

963
00:42:10.241 --> 00:42:10.900
<v Speaker 2>So we could just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

964
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:15.910
<v Speaker 2>relax you like to fire department,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit around and wait for something to </v>

965
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.560
<v Speaker 2>happen instead of being forced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if the fire department had quotas,</v>

966
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 2>how many fires you put out today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wilson,</v>

967
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 2>there was no fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be going around fighting fires.</v>

968
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>

969
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:26.050
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

970
00:42:26.051 --> 00:42:31.051
<v Speaker 3>So there's a misalignment of incentives </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically because the people who are </v>

971
00:42:31.051 --> 00:42:35.161
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be doing the cracking down </v>
<v Speaker 3>on crime actually have an incentive for </v>

972
00:42:35.161 --> 00:42:37.720
<v Speaker 3>there still to continue to be some crime</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they can keep doing the cracking down</v>

973
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:43.210
<v Speaker 3>almost reminds me a little bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military industrial complex where like </v>

974
00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.980
<v Speaker 3>the Pentagon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Defense Department is supposed to be</v>

975
00:42:44.981 --> 00:42:49.981
<v Speaker 3>about defending us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we don't have wars to go into </v>

976
00:42:49.981 --> 00:42:51.100
<v Speaker 3>then they're kind of redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

977
00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.640
<v Speaker 3>It's actually good for them when there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a war ironically.</v>

978
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:59.880
<v Speaker 3>But you would expect that the people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are like who are trying to seek our </v>

979
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.370
<v Speaker 3>security would not be one in wars </v>
<v Speaker 3>because wars are bad things.</v>

980
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the overall dynamic of how we </v>

981
00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.951
<v Speaker 2>operate is flawed fundamentally on so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many different levels that we just sort </v>

982
00:43:11.951 --> 00:43:16.691
<v Speaker 2>of try to patch it up and keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you could make an analogy </v>

983
00:43:16.691 --> 00:43:20.291
<v Speaker 2>about this hunting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is kind of fucked that you're </v>

984
00:43:20.291 --> 00:43:22.961
<v Speaker 2>talking about conservation when the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to conserve is to get money from </v>

985
00:43:22.961 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 2>them being murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

986
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:28.781
<v Speaker 2>that's really what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best way is to go over there and </v>

987
00:43:28.781 --> 00:43:33.190
<v Speaker 2>there was an article in huff post </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually today that I was reading and I </v>

988
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.721
<v Speaker 2>was kind of laughing about it because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was wrong on a lot of different levels </v>

989
00:43:37.721 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 2>and it was about hunting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation and that this model doesn't</v>

990
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:45.830
<v Speaker 2>really work or the argument doesn't hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and one of the things they brought up</v>

991
00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:50.831
<v Speaker 2>was that $335,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that guy had paid to go and shoot </v>

992
00:43:50.831 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 2>that Rhino and what that Rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were saying,</v>

993
00:43:53.961 --> 00:43:56.210
<v Speaker 2>well if this rhinos and danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these rhinos are endangered,</v>

994
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.770
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that rhino was an unviable male.</v>

995
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Like he was old and he wasn't breathing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

996
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was killing young male rhinos and </v>

997
00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.730
<v Speaker 2>female rhinos and so they had targeted </v>
<v Speaker 2>him for.</v>

998
00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:09.890
<v Speaker 2>They were going to call him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to kill him anyway.</v>

999
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:13.250
<v Speaker 2>So the reason why this guy was able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend so much money,</v>

1000
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.280
<v Speaker 2>shoot this endangered rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because they were gonna shoot it </v>

1001
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:18.280
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

1002
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.511
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can generate a tremendous amount </v>

1003
00:44:22.511 --> 00:44:22.511
<v Speaker 2>of income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he.</v>

1004
00:44:22.511 --> 00:44:25.271
<v Speaker 2>I had him on the podcast and he said the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money that he paid was </v>

1005
00:44:25.271 --> 00:44:28.871
<v Speaker 2>actually small and the reason why it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>small was that all the negative </v>

1006
00:44:28.871 --> 00:44:33.341
<v Speaker 2>publicity actually fucked up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation aspect of it because there </v>

1007
00:44:33.341 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 2>are people that would pay half a million</v>
<v Speaker 2>even more for that Rhino.</v>

1008
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.880
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't because they were scared</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being having their name thrown into </v>

1009
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:40.880
<v Speaker 2>the pool.</v>

1010
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.740
<v Speaker 2>So this cory Knowlton guy went over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and spent the $335,000,</v>

1011
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:48.741
<v Speaker 2>did everything legally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was in a lot of ways just like </v>

1012
00:44:48.741 --> 00:44:50.460
<v Speaker 2>cecil or just like this Walter Hill </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

1013
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Cecil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>

1014
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Then that brings us back to like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice,</v>

1015
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:56.530
<v Speaker 2>like twitter storm thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1016
00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.780
<v Speaker 2>That you're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ending up with an inferior </v>

1017
00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.371
<v Speaker 2>outcome to the outcome that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially have because the people who </v>

1018
00:45:04.371 --> 00:45:07.641
<v Speaker 2>could pull off the best outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so afraid of us old jumping down their </v>

1019
00:45:07.641 --> 00:45:09.060
<v Speaker 2>throats on twitter and ruining their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

1020
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.630
<v Speaker 2>getting them into a justine sacco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then it also gets to like,</v>

1021
00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that really the only way you can save</v>

1022
00:45:15.151 --> 00:45:17.770
<v Speaker 2>these rhinos?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way you can get $335,000</v>

1023
00:45:17.771 --> 00:45:22.771
<v Speaker 2>and you have to have someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get some guy who wants to </v>

1024
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:22.771
<v Speaker 2>kill one and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1025
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.480
<v Speaker 2>you like killing shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright how much some of our docs,</v>

1026
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.010
<v Speaker 2>but what else?</v>

1027
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Who else is going to pay $350,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to save rhinos?</v>

1028
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the way if people hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of hunting for,</v>

1029
00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.330
<v Speaker 2>for conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they hate this idea,</v>

1030
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.360
<v Speaker 2>the best way to stop it is to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>ramp up conservation as efforts to </v>

1031
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.680
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really ramp up the idea of non hunting </v>

1032
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.920
<v Speaker 2>for conservation and to tell people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1033
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:47.400
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>

1034
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 2>You can generate like Zimbabwe </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently where this guy was,</v>

1035
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 2>they generate some insane amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1036
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to quote it because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know if I'm right,</v>

1037
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:01.020
<v Speaker 2>but I read various amounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was like $200,000,000</v>

1038
00:46:01.021 --> 00:46:04.710
<v Speaker 2>a year just from hunting just from these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people coming over there to hunt.</v>

1039
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 2>And someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1040
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:08.460
<v Speaker 2>that's the only three percent of it goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to conservation.</v>

1041
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.580
<v Speaker 2>That's probably right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still three percent of </v>

1042
00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.730
<v Speaker 2>$200,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1043
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of goddamn money for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have nothing over there.</v>

1044
00:46:17.881 --> 00:46:19.410
<v Speaker 2>How much could they make from tourism </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1045
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.210
<v Speaker 2>for people that are looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lions?</v>

1046
00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:22.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1047
00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:27.660
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe the solution in a lot of </v>

1048
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.741
<v Speaker 2>these situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also another thing that has to be </v>

1049
00:46:30.741 --> 00:46:31.710
<v Speaker 2>carefully considered is that at least in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some areas,</v>

1050
00:46:31.711 --> 00:46:36.711
<v Speaker 2>in some places you have to manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations of animals because if you </v>

1051
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:39.750
<v Speaker 2>just leave nature onto its own nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>will wipe out animals as well.</v>

1052
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Nature doesn't really give a fuck about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wolves don't care if they wipe out </v>

1053
00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.590
<v Speaker 2>all the elk really don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have it in their mind.</v>

1054
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:49.140
<v Speaker 2>They have it in their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can I kill and eat?</v>

1055
00:46:49.141 --> 00:46:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's dogs or whether it's elk or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1056
00:46:52.321 --> 00:46:55.400
<v Speaker 2>It can track down and kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1057
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:58.590
<v Speaker 2>the United States has a problem and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the western states,</v>

1058
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Speaker 2>because they reintroduced wolves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they reintroduced wolves and there was a</v>

1059
00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:07.521
<v Speaker 2>really interesting video about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how wolves are changing yellowstone </v>

1060
00:47:07.521 --> 00:47:07.610
<v Speaker 2>national park and they sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>highlighted the,</v>

1061
00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:12.611
<v Speaker 2>the positive aspects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative aspects of it or the elk </v>

1062
00:47:12.611 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 2>population are getting decimated because</v>
<v Speaker 2>these elk are not used to wolves because</v>

1063
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:20.331
<v Speaker 2>they didn't develop with wolves and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves are within the last few </v>

1064
00:47:20.331 --> 00:47:20.331
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>

1065
00:47:20.331 --> 00:47:24.050
<v Speaker 2>These wolves have been introduced here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they wanted to keep them within a </v>

1066
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.991
<v Speaker 2>certain population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to keep them within a few </v>

1067
00:47:26.991 --> 00:47:26.991
<v Speaker 2>thousand wools and the whole country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1068
00:47:26.991 --> 00:47:27.450
<v Speaker 2>they've gone way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1069
00:47:27.451 --> 00:47:32.451
<v Speaker 2>way past that and so now they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start hunting these wolves and they do </v>

1070
00:47:32.451 --> 00:47:36.421
<v Speaker 2>hunt these wolves in some areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have all these people that are </v>

1071
00:47:36.421 --> 00:47:36.421
<v Speaker 2>freaking out about the hunting of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>

1072
00:47:36.421 --> 00:47:37.990
<v Speaker 2>So you shouldn't hunt these walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to.</v>

1073
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to manage these populations </v>

1074
00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:43.140
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have starvation.</v>

1075
00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Then you have a disease and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have them encroaching into livestock.</v>

1076
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who lives in northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>BC,</v>

1077
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:52.810
<v Speaker 2>British Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he is a hunter up there,</v>

1078
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:57.840
<v Speaker 2>and he also has cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His neighbor's cow was killed in the </v>

1079
00:47:59.050 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 2>middle of the night by a pack of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1080
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:04.681
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know what terror is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're sleeping your house with </v>

1081
00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 2>your children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

1082
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you have glass windows that protect you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the wild,</v>

1083
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:08.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1084
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:13.500
<v Speaker 2>You're not living in a fortress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living in a normal house and you </v>

1085
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.100
<v Speaker 2>look out the window and you see 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

1086
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:20.130
<v Speaker 2>wild savage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murderous wolves tearing a cow apart in </v>

1087
00:48:20.741 --> 00:48:25.741
<v Speaker 2>front of you screaming and cheering and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ripping this thing apart,</v>

1088
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 2>and they'll do that to your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do that to you.</v>

1089
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.210
<v Speaker 2>They'll do that to anything they can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>ahold of.</v>

1090
00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 2>They don't have morals there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their idea is to stay alive.</v>

1091
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:40.171
<v Speaker 2>That is their programming there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't manage their </v>

1092
00:48:40.171 --> 00:48:40.171
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

1093
00:48:40.171 --> 00:48:42.190
<v Speaker 2>So in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kill as many wives as you want.</v>

1094
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1095
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:43.760
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where he lives.</v>

1096
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill them every day.</v>

1097
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:47.450
<v Speaker 3>It all comes back to this misconception </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have,</v>

1098
00:48:47.451 --> 00:48:50.390
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that nature is at a,</v>

1099
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:53.240
<v Speaker 3>at a permanent state of equilibrium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1100
00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:55.760
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't tinker with it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>

1101
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:58.550
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something kind of fundamentally precious</v>

1102
00:48:58.551 --> 00:49:00.920
<v Speaker 3>about a particular state of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nature,</v>

1103
00:49:00.921 --> 00:49:05.921
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is almost all states of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature in the world right now have been </v>

1104
00:49:05.921 --> 00:49:07.340
<v Speaker 3>impacted by human civilization already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as you say,</v>

1105
00:49:07.341 --> 00:49:12.341
<v Speaker 3>like the wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why we have to reintroduce </v>

1106
00:49:12.341 --> 00:49:12.341
<v Speaker 3>the wolves because we killed them in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

1107
00:49:12.341 --> 00:49:17.051
<v Speaker 3>And the relationship between the number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of elk in the number of wolves is </v>

1108
00:49:17.051 --> 00:49:17.600
<v Speaker 3>already out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we need to be able to manage it.</v>

1109
00:49:17.601 --> 00:49:22.601
<v Speaker 3>It reminds me a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a marine biologist I </v>

1110
00:49:22.601 --> 00:49:26.291
<v Speaker 3>think obviously in Tanga will fly specks</v>
<v Speaker 3>South Pacific nation talking to this guy</v>

1111
00:49:27.051 --> 00:49:28.190
<v Speaker 3>about whaling.</v>

1112
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:31.710
<v Speaker 3>And I was talking about how opposed I am</v>
<v Speaker 3>to wailing.</v>

1113
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we should be killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>whales.</v>

1114
00:49:33.021 --> 00:49:34.370
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1115
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:38.590
<v Speaker 3>Because we already have killed so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>blue whales and humpback whales will.</v>

1116
00:49:38.591 --> 00:49:42.370
<v Speaker 3>The big beautiful wiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1117
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 3>the minky whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are the only whales that are </v>

1118
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.451
<v Speaker 3>currently being killed by the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Norwegians and so on are </v>

1119
00:49:49.451 --> 00:49:53.020
<v Speaker 3>crowding out the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bigger wiles from having their </v>

1120
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.340
<v Speaker 3>populations being able to come back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it actually,</v>

1121
00:49:55.341 --> 00:50:00.341
<v Speaker 3>from a sustainability standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may actually want to have some </v>

1122
00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:01.430
<v Speaker 3>culling of the minky whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are the sort of little shitty,</v>

1123
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:08.240
<v Speaker 3>the ugly stepchildren of the while of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whale species because they're eating</v>

1124
00:50:08.241 --> 00:50:13.241
<v Speaker 3>all the plankton and they're reading all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff that the blue whales and the </v>

1125
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:13.241
<v Speaker 3>humpback whales could be using to </v>
<v Speaker 3>resurrect their populations.</v>

1126
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:16.550
<v Speaker 3>And in Australia that people go crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

1127
00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.020
<v Speaker 3>especially known Australians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abet,</v>

1128
00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:19.460
<v Speaker 3>abet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kangaroo cows,</v>

1129
00:50:19.461 --> 00:50:21.530
<v Speaker 3>but you got to kangaroos breed like </v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbits.</v>

1130
00:50:21.531 --> 00:50:26.531
<v Speaker 3>They go out there and shoot Kangaroos to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring down their population so they </v>

1131
00:50:26.531 --> 00:50:27.850
<v Speaker 3>don't starve to death sometimes because </v>
<v Speaker 3>have so many of them.</v>

1132
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Have a good buddy who's a famous hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam Green tree in Australia.</v>

1133
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:37.301
<v Speaker 2>And what he explained to me is what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really crazy is they brought over </v>

1134
00:50:37.301 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 2>certain animals and when they brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>over certain animals,</v>

1135
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:44.531
<v Speaker 2>then they had to bring over certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals to deal with these certain </v>

1136
00:50:44.531 --> 00:50:46.871
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things they brought over </v>

1137
00:50:46.871 --> 00:50:46.871
<v Speaker 2>as rabbits and they just fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1138
00:50:46.871 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 2>They fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these are just terrible.</v>

1139
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.080
<v Speaker 2>They have so many rabbits that will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought over the pain to the </v>

1140
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:53.080
<v Speaker 2>rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1141
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.920
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said they brought over the foxes to </v>

1142
00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.571
<v Speaker 2>deal with the rabbits will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't anticipate as a fox is </v>

1143
00:50:58.571 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 2>killing everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ground nesting birds.</v>

1144
00:50:58.851 --> 00:50:59.470
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1145
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.350
<v Speaker 2>they're destroying these ground nesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>birds and everything else.</v>

1146
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I can get all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have a mission.</v>

1147
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they programmed their DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1148
00:51:06.051 --> 00:51:08.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you foxes are only attracted to rabbits.</v>

1149
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Go kill rabbits and foxes kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1150
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they also kill a lot of calves.</v>

1151
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 2>They kill one of the things that Fox has</v>
<v Speaker 2>left to do and it's a horrible thing.</v>

1152
00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:21.450
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can smell and they know when a </v>

1153
00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.000
<v Speaker 2>mother is about to give birth to a calf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they wait until it's coming out.</v>

1154
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:28.001
<v Speaker 2>And they literally pull it out of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>vagina and eat it in front of the </v>

1155
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:28.001
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they do.</v>

1156
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:32.470
<v Speaker 2>They do that with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do that with anything they can get </v>

1157
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.470
<v Speaker 2>ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a part of nature.</v>

1158
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.050
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having a real problem with that.</v>

1159
00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:39.950
<v Speaker 2>The Fox population is just booming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've set up these crazy fences.</v>

1160
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:45.250
<v Speaker 2>They've hired these contractors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>build these enormous fences and </v>

1161
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Australia to try to keep the rabbits </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1162
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:49.540
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a while to build a fence as </v>

1163
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.851
<v Speaker 2>they're building the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rabbits got in and they just fucked </v>

1164
00:51:51.851 --> 00:51:52.670
<v Speaker 2>like rabbits inside the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now the rabbits are over there too.</v>

1165
00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:57.671
<v Speaker 2>And they don't know what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to figure out how to </v>

1166
00:51:57.671 --> 00:51:57.671
<v Speaker 2>handle it.</v>

1167
00:51:57.671 --> 00:51:57.671
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that reminds me.</v>

1168
00:51:57.671 --> 00:51:58.620
<v Speaker 3>So in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm half New Zealand,</v>

1169
00:51:58.621 --> 00:51:59.870
<v Speaker 3>my mum's a New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1170
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.770
<v Speaker 3>and I was just back there a few weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1171
00:52:01.771 --> 00:52:03.680
<v Speaker 3>My grandmother passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was 100.</v>

1172
00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:06.920
<v Speaker 3>So like congratulations to her made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

1173
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.860
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mark,</v>

1174
00:52:07.861 --> 00:52:09.510
<v Speaker 3>that's the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1175
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned being a hundred anyway,</v>

1176
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 3>but one of the interesting thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand in terms of all of all of </v>

1177
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.031
<v Speaker 3>that conversation around pests is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possibly the only country that </v>

1178
00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:24.660
<v Speaker 3>actually has the capability and a major </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement to do so to take itself back to</v>

1179
00:52:24.661 --> 00:52:29.100
<v Speaker 3>pre to what the ecosystem was before </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans arrived.</v>

1180
00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:34.580
<v Speaker 3>So they like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know what a key way </v>

1181
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:34.580
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bird,</v>

1182
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:38.560
<v Speaker 3>not the fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>short flightless bird that just wanders </v>

1183
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:39.330
<v Speaker 3>around like New Zealand is just lousy </v>
<v Speaker 3>with all of these really,</v>

1184
00:52:39.331 --> 00:52:43.590
<v Speaker 3>really evolutionarily dumb animals like </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds that don't fly,</v>

1185
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:48.800
<v Speaker 3>which when approached by a Predator just</v>
<v Speaker 3>stands still in the hope that the </v>

1186
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.431
<v Speaker 3>Predator isn't gonna come after them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which worked prior to the introduction </v>

1187
00:52:52.431 --> 00:52:54.920
<v Speaker 3>of western species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that there are boxes and they're</v>

1188
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.380
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a great survival tactic to just</v>

1189
00:52:58.381 --> 00:53:01.020
<v Speaker 3>stand still while the Fox is is coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>after you.</v>

1190
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.020
<v Speaker 3>So there's this massive movement in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zealand now,</v>

1191
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:09.380
<v Speaker 3>which my uncle is heavily involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the prime minister is heavily </v>

1192
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.441
<v Speaker 3>involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To actually genuinely eradicate all of </v>

1193
00:53:12.441 --> 00:53:15.390
<v Speaker 3>these small mammals that were brought in</v>
<v Speaker 3>by by humans when they came.</v>

1194
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:20.630
<v Speaker 3>So it's such a green country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's such environmentalist in New </v>

1195
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really,</v>

1196
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:21.810
<v Speaker 3>really get their hands dirty with all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff that's super,</v>

1197
00:53:21.811 --> 00:53:26.811
<v Speaker 3>super natural about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's funny because in the rest of </v>

1198
00:53:26.811 --> 00:53:26.811
<v Speaker 3>the world</v>

1199
00:53:26.811 --> 00:53:31.520
<v Speaker 2>if you're an environmentalist you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably an animal lover and you're </v>

1200
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.100
<v Speaker 2>probably maybe not a bloodthirsty </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

1201
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:37.310
<v Speaker 2>but the Kiwis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New Zealand is I just so blood test </v>

1202
00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:39.771
<v Speaker 2>because they love killing small mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like it's almost like a part of your </v>

1203
00:53:39.771 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>patriotic duty to like just have trap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>settle over the place.</v>

1204
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:46.341
<v Speaker 2>They go out and there's just like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloodied old Fox with its head smashed </v>

1205
00:53:46.341 --> 00:53:46.341
<v Speaker 2>in by a trap and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh good.</v>

1206
00:53:46.341 --> 00:53:48.690
<v Speaker 2>We did know we did our job for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment today.</v>

1207
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:54.080
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there are hunting magazines in </v>

1208
00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.241
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really fucking weird because </v>

1209
00:53:56.241 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 2>hunting magazines in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they show like a deer or an elk,</v>

1210
00:53:57.661 --> 00:53:59.730
<v Speaker 2>like something you hunt for food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1211
00:53:59.731 --> 00:54:00.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1212
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:02.850
<v Speaker 2>this guy got an elk bar that's like 500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds of meat.</v>

1213
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.990
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1214
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 2>hunting magazines in Australia have </v>
<v Speaker 2>those as well,</v>

1215
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:11.960
<v Speaker 2>but they also have guys holding up foxes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feral cats and my friend gave me a </v>

1216
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:17.241
<v Speaker 2>copy of this magazine and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you got fucking dead cats in your </v>

1217
00:54:17.241 --> 00:54:17.241
<v Speaker 2>magazine?</v>

1218
00:54:17.241 --> 00:54:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Like kitty cats?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my cat,</v>

1219
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.580
<v Speaker 2>like this is fuck these ones and feral </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1220
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're feral.</v>

1221
00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.820
<v Speaker 2>They didn't make the cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't make.</v>

1222
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:27.390
<v Speaker 2>They didn't make the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're out there trying to hustle.</v>

1223
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the killing all the birds,</v>

1224
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:33.830
<v Speaker 2>killing all those little flight records </v>
<v Speaker 2>and killing all of the rabbits and </v>

1225
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:34.710
<v Speaker 2>killing all of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything else I can get ahold of.</v>

1226
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:39.150
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand also has a lot of invasive </v>
<v Speaker 2>large game species.</v>

1227
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:41.640
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the big destinations for </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

1228
00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:46.641
<v Speaker 2>like stags stag is a type of elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a similar to an l and it's an </v>

1229
00:54:46.641 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 2>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

1230
00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:50.880
<v Speaker 2>majestic creature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nothing kills them,</v>

1231
00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:54.060
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have any big cats over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we have in America.</v>

1232
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.830
<v Speaker 2>We have mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have bears.</v>

1233
00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Those all killed the calves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the bears kill more than 50 percent</v>

1234
00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.030
<v Speaker 2>or as much as 50 percent depending on </v>
<v Speaker 2>who you ask of the Moose that are born,</v>

1235
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.260
<v Speaker 2>like as they're coming out.</v>

1236
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Same with the Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they find the mother as it's giving </v>

1237
00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:12.650
<v Speaker 2>birth and they literally killed the calf</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

1238
00:55:12.651 --> 00:55:17.651
<v Speaker 2>You need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of their favorite things to </v>

1239
00:55:17.651 --> 00:55:17.651
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it keeps the population low.</v>

1240
00:55:17.651 --> 00:55:18.810
<v Speaker 2>There's sort of a balance to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have that in New Zealand.</v>

1241
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.810
<v Speaker 2>So New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just have these free roaming stags.</v>

1242
00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 2>They're just massive and they have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators,</v>

1243
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:29.180
<v Speaker 2>so it's a huge hunting destination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people fly 16 hours to go to New </v>

1244
00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have all these animals and you </v>

1245
00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.631
<v Speaker 2>could bring the meat back so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring back hundreds and hundreds of </v>

1246
00:55:35.631 --> 00:55:38.480
<v Speaker 2>pounds of this insanely delicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>stagged meat and it's one of the big </v>

1247
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:43.911
<v Speaker 2>hunting destinations in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of call it trophy hunting </v>

1248
00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:45.390
<v Speaker 2>because everybody wants those antlers as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1249
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.880
<v Speaker 2>But the meat is like the best meat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1250
00:55:47.881 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly delicious and so good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

1251
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.920
<v Speaker 2>And so rich nutrients that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get like the,</v>

1252
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1253
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:54.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1254
00:55:54.111 --> 00:55:59.111
<v Speaker 2>like shooting lions are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it's not like stags were in </v>

1255
00:55:59.111 --> 00:56:00.330
<v Speaker 2>danger and they have to shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to have a license.</v>

1256
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.670
<v Speaker 2>That's what's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

1257
00:56:01.671 --> 00:56:06.671
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to have tags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in America it's hard to pull a tag </v>

1258
00:56:06.671 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 2>for an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say like New Mexico.</v>

1259
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:12.470
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico is like prime elk territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these enormous elk in New </v>

1260
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Mexico and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a majestic.</v>

1261
00:56:14.431 --> 00:56:18.630
<v Speaker 2>And if you can get lucky and get a New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico elk tag for hunters,</v>

1262
00:56:18.631 --> 00:56:20.240
<v Speaker 2>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get the milk.</v>

1263
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:22.640
<v Speaker 2>You have to sign up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>

1264
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like there's a lottery</v>

1265
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 4>and you get picked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say like 100 people sign up for tags.</v>

1266
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 4>Maybe like 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll get a tag.</v>

1267
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:34.230
<v Speaker 4>And so you keep trying to get a ticket </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the opening ceremony of the Rio </v>

1268
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Olympics or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next year I might have to apply.</v>

1269
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.660
<v Speaker 4>And then you've got a one in a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>shot up being accepted.</v>

1270
00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 4>You can probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1271
00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:41.810
<v Speaker 4>and also in the same way you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably also get a scalper to buy,</v>

1272
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 4>sell you a ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could probably scalp a tag here.</v>

1273
00:56:45.191 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 4>That probably helped me a black market </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them.</v>

1274
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:49.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think it's a black market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's illegal.</v>

1275
00:56:49.061 --> 00:56:54.061
<v Speaker 4>Like outfitters get a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>tags and so that they could sell their </v>

1276
00:56:54.061 --> 00:56:57.601
<v Speaker 4>tax for like 25 grand or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exorbitant rate and then do it like </v>

1277
00:56:57.601 --> 00:56:57.640
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty five grand.</v>

1278
00:56:57.641 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 4>You could fly first class to New </v>
<v Speaker 4>Zealand.</v>

1279
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.240
<v Speaker 4>You could screw the tag 16 hours though.</v>

1280
00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.220
<v Speaker 4>It's a long flight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can drive to New Mexico.</v>

1281
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:05.390
<v Speaker 4>You have your own car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping intent.</v>

1282
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.520
<v Speaker 4>My friend from Australia actually came </v>
<v Speaker 4>and hunted in New Mexico.</v>

1283
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:12.930
<v Speaker 4>He flew all the way from New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ironically and hunted in,</v>

1284
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.640
<v Speaker 4>in new Mac or flew all the way from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>

1285
00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:17.500
<v Speaker 4>hunted in New Mexico and wrote this big </v>
<v Speaker 4>story about it.</v>

1286
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1287
00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 4>so it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's speaking of the,</v>

1288
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:24.130
<v Speaker 4>of how good the stags taste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like.</v>

1289
00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:29.730
<v Speaker 4>I was amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always amazed when I go back to New </v>

1290
00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:32.170
<v Speaker 4>Zealand and about how much we're missing</v>
<v Speaker 4>out on great produce in America just </v>

1291
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:36.600
<v Speaker 4>because of the proliferation of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of industrialized farming and and the,</v>

1292
00:57:36.601 --> 00:57:39.250
<v Speaker 4>the dearth of great natural food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was,</v>

1293
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:44.310
<v Speaker 4>when I was back in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was staying at this little bed and </v>

1294
00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:46.210
<v Speaker 4>breakfast had these eggs for breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just two fried eggs,</v>

1295
00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.480
<v Speaker 4>like the yolk was bright red and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>stood up like more than an inch above </v>

1296
00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 4>the rest of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the egg and the white was just perfect.</v>

1297
00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.160
<v Speaker 4>It was flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tasted like an egg that I haven't tasted</v>

1298
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 4>in years and years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1299
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.220
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's come from and she's like,</v>

1300
00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:01.510
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what just popped down the road?</v>

1301
00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:04.630
<v Speaker 4>We have a few trucks and we just put up </v>
<v Speaker 4>this morning.</v>

1302
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:07.360
<v Speaker 4>They are just fresh from the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1303
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:12.780
<v Speaker 4>that's what an egg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just all I'm doing is eating an </v>

1304
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:12.780
<v Speaker 4>actual leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I haven't.</v>

1305
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.060
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had an actual egg in ages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When are you going back?</v>

1306
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 4>Uh Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To New York to New York?</v>

1307
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Light on a red eye.</v>

1308
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why get some eggs?</v>

1309
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:23.570
<v Speaker 4>I have 22 chickens to get eggs every </v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

1310
00:58:23.571 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take eggs on the plane.</v>

1311
00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:26.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they'll let you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1312
00:58:26.231 --> 00:58:28.930
<v Speaker 4>it's not coming from another country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me see if I could show you.</v>

1313
00:58:28.931 --> 00:58:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I have an image on my instagram of how </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible the eggs look like.</v>

1314
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see if you could find that,</v>

1315
00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my eggs or like a dark dark orange.</v>

1316
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's because my chickens run around </v>

1317
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:44.431
<v Speaker 4>free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing when you see like </v>

1318
00:58:44.431 --> 00:58:46.680
<v Speaker 4>vegetarian fed chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you see that like grass fed </v>

1319
00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:47.170
<v Speaker 4>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want that.</v>

1320
00:58:47.171 --> 00:58:49.110
<v Speaker 4>Chickens are fucking dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1321
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eat everything they eat.</v>

1322
00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:53.950
<v Speaker 4>A lot of bugs ate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fed my chickens a mouse the other day.</v>

1323
00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.040
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is a story.</v>

1324
00:58:57.041 --> 00:58:58.220
<v Speaker 4>I've already told them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the podcast,</v>

1325
00:58:58.221 --> 00:58:59.890
<v Speaker 4>so I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell us briefly as possible because</v>

1326
00:58:59.891 --> 00:59:02.500
<v Speaker 4>it was very conflicted about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came home,</v>

1327
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:07.980
<v Speaker 4>I was on the road and my family had </v>
<v Speaker 4>found a wounded hawk in our yard and </v>

1328
00:59:08.561 --> 00:59:13.561
<v Speaker 4>this goes back to the hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals argument and they found this </v>

1329
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:13.860
<v Speaker 4>wounded hawk or something was wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 4>its wing,</v>

1330
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 4>it's broken wing and it was a juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 4>hawk.</v>

1331
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:17.140
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1332
00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conference call but a small.</v>

1333
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:20.650
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1334
00:59:20.651 --> 00:59:25.651
<v Speaker 4>they picked up and put it in a box and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to feed it and they had to </v>

1335
00:59:25.651 --> 00:59:28.991
<v Speaker 4>get it to the veterinarian on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were trying to figure out like </v>

1336
00:59:28.991 --> 00:59:29.810
<v Speaker 4>what wildlife organization save these </v>
<v Speaker 4>hawks.</v>

1337
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 4>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we have to feed this thing,</v>

1338
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:36.491
<v Speaker 4>we have to figure out how to feed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was a pet store that's open </v>

1339
00:59:36.491 --> 00:59:36.491
<v Speaker 4>that sells pinkies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are baby mice.</v>

1340
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:41.950
<v Speaker 4>And so they fed this hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these baby mice and it kept it alive </v>

1341
00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:44.930
<v Speaker 4>over the weekend and they gave it some </v>
<v Speaker 4>water with an eyedropper.</v>

1342
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:49.760
<v Speaker 4>And then there was one pinky leftover </v>
<v Speaker 4>and my daughter wanted to keep it.</v>

1343
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Let's keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to keep.</v>

1344
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:51.080
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honey,</v>

1345
00:59:51.081 --> 00:59:53.660
<v Speaker 4>this is not going to live like it needs </v>
<v Speaker 4>its mothers milk.</v>

1346
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 4>The mother's not here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't even.</v>

1347
00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:56.540
<v Speaker 4>It came.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See it's,</v>

1348
00:59:56.541 --> 01:00:01.541
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's only a few days old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was amazed it was still alive and </v>

1349
01:00:01.541 --> 01:00:01.541
<v Speaker 4>I said him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

1350
01:00:01.541 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you were going to do something </v>

1351
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.241
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the two options were take it to </v>

1352
01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 4>the pet store and give it back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pet store,</v>

1353
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 4>which they're going to feed it the </v>
<v Speaker 4>snakes,</v>

1354
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:14.140
<v Speaker 4>that's what they sell them for to sell </v>
<v Speaker 4>them for food or I give it to the </v>

1355
01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 4>chickens and the chickens to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the hierarchy of animals.</v>

1356
01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:22.301
<v Speaker 4>Like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were just feeding these fucking </v>

1357
01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:22.301
<v Speaker 4>things to hawk system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what the hell?</v>

1358
01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:22.301
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1359
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:27.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we made an executive decision and I </v>

1360
01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:27.370
<v Speaker 4>decided that I was going to be the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>since I'm the killer,</v>

1361
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.840
<v Speaker 4>I go out and feed it to the chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I opened up the,</v>

1362
01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:31.340
<v Speaker 4>there's some of my eggs.</v>

1363
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.230
<v Speaker 4>Delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1364
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:34.350
<v Speaker 4>look at the color on the yoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

1365
01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you done.</v>

1366
01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.500
<v Speaker 4>Just don't get that from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>supermarket.</v>

1367
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:41.590
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Goddamn l you ca tech a hot sauce </v>

<v Speaker 4>I hate that this morning I had some of </v>

1369
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:45.160
<v Speaker 4>those exact same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly.</v>

1370
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.240
<v Speaker 4>I have that all the time with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Zucchini bread.</v>

1371
01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:49.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll have an egg sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1372
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:54.880
<v Speaker 4>so I put the pinky in the chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this big huge chicken coop where </v>

1373
01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.030
<v Speaker 4>they all 22 of them run around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have,</v>

1374
01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.310
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many hundreds of square</v>

1375
01:00:58.311 --> 01:00:59.780
<v Speaker 4>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's an enormous chicken coop.</v>

1376
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 4>And where do you live?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live out in the burbs.</v>

1377
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:05.240
<v Speaker 4>I live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I coyotes dear in my yard,</v>

1378
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.320
<v Speaker 4>but I put this thing down for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean one second.</v>

1379
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:12.140
<v Speaker 4>And these chickens dove on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're murderers,</v>

1380
01:01:12.141 --> 01:01:15.590
<v Speaker 4>little fucking dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were biting each other's face.</v>

1381
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Two steel pieces of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little tiny baby mouse from each </v>

1382
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.940
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1383
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:24.070
<v Speaker 4>So goes back to the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you,</v>

1384
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.600
<v Speaker 4>when you said that birds are dinosaurs </v>
<v Speaker 4>you made,</v>

1385
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.780
<v Speaker 4>did you see the story about how the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how scientists have now I'm sequenced </v>

1386
01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 4>the genome of woolly mammoths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1387
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:36.530
<v Speaker 4>Which means that within the next 10 or </v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years,</v>

1388
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.800
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be able to actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>recreate woolly mammoths and bring them </v>

1389
01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:41.800
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should we want to China.</v>

1390
01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:46.180
<v Speaker 4>They're going to do it in China just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like they've recreated like Paris and </v>

1391
01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:46.180
<v Speaker 4>all these weird city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've seen that?</v>

1392
01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:46.880
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen that.</v>

1393
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:51.910
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have these ghost towns in China </v>

1394
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:53.750
<v Speaker 4>where they've recreated famous European </v>
<v Speaker 4>cities and no one's living in them.</v>

1395
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.120
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what the fuck they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

1396
01:01:56.121 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 4>Or like an Eiffel Tower in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have everything.</v>

1397
01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:01.250
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre.</v>

1398
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.990
<v Speaker 4>I look at this like these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are.</v>

1399
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:07.640
<v Speaker 4>This is a real recreated city in China </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're ghost towns.</v>

1400
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:09.260
<v Speaker 4>There's no one living in them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1401
01:02:09.261 --> 01:02:14.261
<v Speaker 4>I did know about the ghost towns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know that they will </v>

1402
01:02:14.261 --> 01:02:15.290
<v Speaker 4>replicated off other existing cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>China's replica of Paris.</v>

1403
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:16.700
<v Speaker 4>Go to that page,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

1404
01:02:16.701 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 4>because it's fucking insane and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that aren't aware of that.</v>

1405
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 4>It's an entirely depressing ghost town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is an exact replica of Paris.</v>

1406
01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:30.081
<v Speaker 4>Go to full screen if you would in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>apartments look like perusing and upon </v>

1407
01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:31.230
<v Speaker 4>their exact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The exact,</v>

1408
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.860
<v Speaker 4>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look at the Eiffel Tower,</v>

1409
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:39.890
<v Speaker 4>you can see like a that they were like </v>
<v Speaker 4>just regular skyscrapers in like a </v>

1410
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:39.890
<v Speaker 4>neighboring city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1411
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.100
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

1412
01:02:41.101 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 4>really strange and they haven't just </v>
<v Speaker 4>done it with Paris but like this is,</v>

1413
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.930
<v Speaker 4>this is abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what's really fucked about it.</v>

1414
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:49.630
<v Speaker 4>Why they have been in the of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving into.</v>

1415
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:54.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had an idea to build something and </v>

1416
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.670
<v Speaker 4>have a bunch of people move in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1417
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:55.350
<v Speaker 4>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1418
01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:57.780
<v Speaker 4>The Chinese government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just forced people to live there.</v>

1419
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:02.610
<v Speaker 4>I think they're just sort of slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 4>surely becoming more capitalistic.</v>

1420
01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:06.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're no less authoritarian.</v>

1421
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:11.150
<v Speaker 4>They're having a big crackdown in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's much more authoritarian than it's </v>

1422
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:13.911
<v Speaker 4>been in the past couple of decades in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of like anti free speech and just </v>

1423
01:03:13.911 --> 01:03:14.910
<v Speaker 4>forcing people to do whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever Beijing wants them to.</v>

1424
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:15.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

1425
01:03:15.841 --> 01:03:20.841
<v Speaker 4>But capitalism as far as their ability </v>
<v Speaker 4>to earn money and that's the apparently </v>

1426
01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:26.601
<v Speaker 4>a huge issue that's in China now is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>haves and the have nots and how baller </v>

1427
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:31.320
<v Speaker 4>everybody wants to act and behave and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's become a huge part of their culture</v>

1428
01:03:31.321 --> 01:03:36.321
<v Speaker 4>like flossing and having the finest of </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything to find his bag and the </v>

1429
01:03:36.321 --> 01:03:37.790
<v Speaker 4>finest watch and the fines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>

1430
01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:43.010
<v Speaker 4>if you're a CEO of a company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must have a home that is bigger and </v>

1431
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:47.031
<v Speaker 4>more grand than anyone working for you </v>
<v Speaker 4>or the other competitive companies that </v>

1432
01:03:47.851 --> 01:03:48.330
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1433
01:03:48.331 --> 01:03:50.550
<v Speaker 4>other also have ceos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have the biggest.</v>

1434
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1435
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredibly consumerist.</v>

1436
01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.220
<v Speaker 3>China and I read an interesting piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how different Asian cultures spend</v>

1437
01:03:57.221 --> 01:04:00.700
<v Speaker 3>their money and one of the points was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Chinese,</v>

1438
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Japanese people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japanese and Chinese culture is like </v>

1439
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.370
<v Speaker 3>totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japanese in Japan,</v>

1440
01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:11.580
<v Speaker 3>people when people earn money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will usually put it towards making </v>

1441
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.851
<v Speaker 3>the home as nice as possible so that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go into a Japanese home and it's </v>

1442
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:15.760
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outwardly.</v>

1443
01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:19.330
<v Speaker 3>People aren't so obsessed with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>flashy things in China.</v>

1444
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:24.690
<v Speaker 3>People will live in an absolute shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>hole if it means that they can afford </v>

1445
01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:26.260
<v Speaker 3>like the best watch or the best car or </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the best handbag.</v>

1446
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.680
<v Speaker 3>So there's like a lot more kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>outward consumerist,</v>

1447
01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:32.200
<v Speaker 3>almost like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalist style,</v>

1448
01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.320
<v Speaker 3>con consumption conspicuous consumption </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than just sort of feathering </v>

1449
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.220
<v Speaker 3>their nest the way that the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 3>home bodies too.</v>

1450
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:41.660
<v Speaker 4>What was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a repression thing,</v>

1451
01:04:41.661 --> 01:04:45.410
<v Speaker 4>like a response to oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of like Catholic school girls,</v>

1452
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Catholic school girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1453
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:50.670
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1454
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.450
<v Speaker 4>I dated a girl that was in Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 4>school when I was,</v>

1455
01:04:53.451 --> 01:04:56.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in high school and she was a freak.</v>

1456
01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:59.570
<v Speaker 4>She was just such a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was because everything was like,</v>

1457
01:04:59.571 --> 01:05:02.870
<v Speaker 4>you're going to Howl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex is bad and you get that girl alone.</v>

1458
01:05:02.871 --> 01:05:05.690
<v Speaker 4>And she was just bought bananas just </v>
<v Speaker 4>bonkers.</v>

1459
01:05:05.691 --> 01:05:10.691
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what happens with the </v>

1460
01:05:10.691 --> 01:05:10.691
<v Speaker 4>repression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1461
01:05:10.691 --> 01:05:12.110
<v Speaker 4>some preacher's daughter type shit.</v>

1462
01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also coming from a much lower </v>

1463
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:17.110
<v Speaker 3>also coming from a much lower place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>

1464
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if dirt poor,</v>

1465
01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 3>and if you've just had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1466
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:22.180
<v Speaker 3>the past couple of decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be your big boom,</v>

1467
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:27.181
<v Speaker 3>and then I suppose you want to show that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're profiting from it more than a </v>

1468
01:05:27.181 --> 01:05:30.330
<v Speaker 3>country like Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has basically been rich since the </v>

1469
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:30.330
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

1470
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like a hybrid of like a communist </v>

1471
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:34.360
<v Speaker 2>and a capitalist state right now there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like,</v>

1472
01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:39.770
<v Speaker 3>well they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's fair to call them </v>

1473
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.170
<v Speaker 3>capitalists because it's best capitalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be about the free exchange about </v>

1474
01:05:42.991 --> 01:05:44.000
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1475
01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:47.360
<v Speaker 3>And the ability of individual human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings to start their own businesses and</v>

1476
01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:52.370
<v Speaker 3>to trade with one another that is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the way that the Chinese economy </v>

1477
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:55.851
<v Speaker 3>runs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what you're alluding to is </v>

1478
01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:58.230
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they are rapaciously pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and desperate to,</v>

1479
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to enhance their,</v>

1480
01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.490
<v Speaker 3>their economic growth as quickly as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

1481
01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.110
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1482
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Mousey tongue said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1483
01:06:05.251 --> 01:06:06.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone,</v>

1484
01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:08.640
<v Speaker 3>someone said that the reforms that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was bringing in,</v>

1485
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.760
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it was Deng Xiaoping said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reforms that he was bringing in,</v>

1486
01:06:11.761 --> 01:06:13.650
<v Speaker 3>what kind of capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1487
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.410
<v Speaker 3>and shouldn't he have more of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>allegiance to communism?</v>

1488
01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:17.530
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1489
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:20.610
<v Speaker 3>black cat white cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as it catches mice.</v>

1490
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clever bastard.</v>

1491
01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Not always so good at things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so good at saying,</v>

1492
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Sun Tzu's art of war.</v>

1493
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.810
<v Speaker 3>You read that shit today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1494
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:32.430
<v Speaker 3>damn at that dude nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1495
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.140
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to make money.</v>

1496
01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.200
<v Speaker 3>They don't give him no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't give a toss whether you call it </v>

1497
01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.111
<v Speaker 3>capitalism will come from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you might describe it as a kind </v>

1498
01:06:42.111 --> 01:06:44.841
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a 19th century </v>

1499
01:06:44.841 --> 01:06:47.510
<v Speaker 3>mercantilist like regime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like the British empire was </v>

1500
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:51.421
<v Speaker 3>or something where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't a lot of freedom for </v>

1501
01:06:51.421 --> 01:06:52.950
<v Speaker 3>individuals to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to prosper off their own bat.</v>

1502
01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:55.590
<v Speaker 3>And there were a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't a lot of free industries.</v>

1503
01:06:55.591 --> 01:06:58.350
<v Speaker 3>So you would have like big state </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting industries that,</v>

1504
01:06:58.351 --> 01:07:00.210
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran like cartels,</v>

1505
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:05.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only one company was allowed to import </v>

1506
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.230
<v Speaker 3>cotton into Britain or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and that you,</v>

1507
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:10.040
<v Speaker 3>these cozy relationships between mega </v>
<v Speaker 3>conglomerates and politicians and the </v>

1508
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.931
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's Kinda what it's like in </v>

1509
01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:14.931
<v Speaker 3>China.</v>

1510
01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So it used to be that you got a signed </v>
<v Speaker 2>an occupation saying the way that we </v>

1511
01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:22.320
<v Speaker 2>think of Russia or the way that we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Cuba that they tell you,</v>

1512
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:27.350
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what you're going to do and so </v>

1513
01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:28.290
<v Speaker 2>you go do this and you get paid x amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the state and that's all you get.</v>

1514
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.700
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't good for business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you got to give people an incentive</v>

1515
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:36.390
<v Speaker 2>in order to push harder and to innovate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like you got to,</v>

1516
01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.070
<v Speaker 2>they have to know that that juicy watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like dangling from that string,</v>

1517
01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.280
<v Speaker 2>like a carrot in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes them push and that's </v>

1518
01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.580
<v Speaker 2>where they fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where they sort of see.</v>

1519
01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.140
<v Speaker 2>They'd see that about America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look,</v>

1520
01:07:49.141 --> 01:07:52.650
<v Speaker 2>these dummies work all day for Alexis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want that car.</v>

1521
01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:57.651
<v Speaker 2>So bad and they see that billboard as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're driving home in their fucking </v>

1522
01:07:57.651 --> 01:07:58.470
<v Speaker 2>shitty Hyundai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that Honda is are Shitty by the way.</v>

1523
01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I like that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really Nice.</v>

1524
01:08:00.331 --> 01:08:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Now I was in one this weekend in Brazil </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

1525
01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:05.820
<v Speaker 2>these things are like fucking Mercedes </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1526
01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.130
<v Speaker 3>You know what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving a Kia here.</v>

1527
01:08:08.131 --> 01:08:10.530
<v Speaker 3>I always thought of kids as being like </v>
<v Speaker 3>crappy.</v>

1528
01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.930
<v Speaker 3>It's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1529
01:08:11.931 --> 01:08:16.931
<v Speaker 3>not bound anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got an upgrade like at the Avis Guy </v>

1530
01:08:16.931 --> 01:08:16.931
<v Speaker 3>gave me an upgrade on</v>

1531
01:08:16.931 --> 01:08:21.040
<v Speaker 4>it because I'm some elite thing or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something or some credit card or </v>

1532
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:21.040
<v Speaker 4>whatever that I've got and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I have a gray Kia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1534
01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:22.970

1537
01:08:29.531 --> 01:08:29.531
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1538
01:08:29.531 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1539
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 4>this is the golden age of automotive </v>
<v Speaker 4>engineering.</v>

1540
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.840
<v Speaker 4>All cars are show that they've learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>so many lessons from the past few </v>

1541
01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:42.190
<v Speaker 4>decades at all cars that the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States used to be known for having Shit </v>

1542
01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:43.730
<v Speaker 4>cars like we used to make shitty fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>

1543
01:08:43.731 --> 01:08:48.731
<v Speaker 4>We made really cool looking cars in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties and then for 20 years we just </v>

1544
01:08:48.731 --> 01:08:51.260
<v Speaker 4>shit all over the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that were buying cars and you</v>

1545
01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:53.810
<v Speaker 4>had to be like a martyr to buy an </v>
<v Speaker 4>American car.</v>

1546
01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Like a Japanese car was cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was better engineered.</v>

1547
01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:02.890
<v Speaker 4>It would break down less and for most of</v>
<v Speaker 4>automotive history you're talking about </v>

1548
01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 4>like starting in the eighties or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something?</v>

1549
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the seventies from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies on when the gas crisis hit in </v>

1550
01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:10.520
<v Speaker 4>the 19 set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was like 73,</v>

1551
01:09:10.521 --> 01:09:14.390
<v Speaker 4>74 American muscle cars and American </v>
<v Speaker 4>like big cars,</v>

1552
01:09:14.391 --> 01:09:19.391
<v Speaker 4>like the cadillacs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that people really loved </v>

1553
01:09:19.391 --> 01:09:19.391
<v Speaker 4>about American cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those signified America.</v>

1554
01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you thought about automobiles,</v>

1555
01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 4>you thought about those big cadillacs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll show a smooth,</v>

1556
01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:27.050
<v Speaker 4>cushy rides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one was making those in Germany knows</v>

1557
01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:29.480
<v Speaker 4>and making those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a true American product,</v>

1558
01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:34.720
<v Speaker 4>but then gas became insanely expensive </v>
<v Speaker 4>and once the gas crisis hit America </v>

1559
01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:39.941
<v Speaker 4>started making four cylinder mustangs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That looked like shit and everything </v>

1560
01:09:39.941 --> 01:09:43.100
<v Speaker 4>just fell apart and they've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were really unreliable.</v>

1561
01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.440
<v Speaker 4>Then there was also the issues with </v>
<v Speaker 4>unions.</v>

1562
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.680
<v Speaker 4>The issues with automotive unions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the union workers wanted to get paid a </v>

1563
01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.681
<v Speaker 4>fuck load of money and I had a buddy who</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a union employee in Detroit and he </v>

1564
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:57.080
<v Speaker 4>told me like how they used to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just ridiculous.</v>

1565
01:09:57.090 --> 01:09:57.820
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1566
01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:02.780
<v Speaker 4>the demands the unions had and what they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were able to achieve in bargaining.</v>

1567
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.120
<v Speaker 4>They would have a job that one person </v>
<v Speaker 4>could do easily eight hour day job,</v>

1568
01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:10.120
<v Speaker 4>but two people would take that job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

1569
01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:12.140
<v Speaker 4>it had to be a two person job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The union demanded it,</v>

1570
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:15.620
<v Speaker 4>so what they would do is one guy would </v>
<v Speaker 4>show up for four hours a day and then he</v>

1571
01:10:15.621 --> 01:10:17.330
<v Speaker 4>would leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other guy would show up four hours a</v>

1572
01:10:17.331 --> 01:10:19.460
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you had both punch in,</v>

1573
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one guy would like punch in at 9:00</v>

1574
01:10:22.371 --> 01:10:27.371
<v Speaker 4>and he would go fuck off for four hours </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he'd go back and the other guy </v>

1575
01:10:27.371 --> 01:10:30.530
<v Speaker 4>would relieve him and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would just switch off like that.</v>

1576
01:10:30.531 --> 01:10:33.890
<v Speaker 4>And the company car companies would have</v>
<v Speaker 4>these massive long term liabilities,</v>

1577
01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:38.891
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because then have like pension programs </v>

1578
01:10:38.891 --> 01:10:40.901
<v Speaker 4>that were defined benefit pensions </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of defined input pinch out and </v>

1579
01:10:40.901 --> 01:10:42.800
<v Speaker 4>that might not be the correct economic </v>
<v Speaker 4>way of saying it,</v>

1580
01:10:42.801 --> 01:10:47.801
<v Speaker 4>but like instead of you put into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>pension and then when you retire at you </v>

1581
01:10:47.801 --> 01:10:47.801
<v Speaker 4>get back what you put in.</v>

1582
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:51.050
<v Speaker 4>It's we will pay you x amount for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of your life.</v>

1583
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Like a form of social security.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's even more weird than social </v>

1584
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:57.470
<v Speaker 4>security.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a form of guaranteed corporate</v>

1585
01:10:57.471 --> 01:11:00.410
<v Speaker 4>welfare for all of the unionized </v>
<v Speaker 4>employees for the rest of their lives.</v>

1586
01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:02.570
<v Speaker 4>After they retire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Ends a lot for a company to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bear and that's why they moved all their</v>

1588
01:11:06.021 --> 01:11:11.021
<v Speaker 4>things overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what happened when they </v>

1589
01:11:11.021 --> 01:11:12.941
<v Speaker 4>started just shipping everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>overseas and then ironically Japanese </v>

1590
01:11:12.941 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 4>companies started shipping their things </v>
<v Speaker 4>to America.</v>

1591
01:11:14.191 --> 01:11:16.320
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of Honda's are built in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

1592
01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:19.770
<v Speaker 4>like different Japanese companies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the fuck it works now.</v>

1593
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 4>One of the biggest Mitsubishi Plants in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Asia Pacific was in Australia.</v>

1594
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are they building it and doing it in</v>

1595
01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:30.390
<v Speaker 4>Australia and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They must have got some sort of a deal.</v>

1596
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:35.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then South Korea came online and </v>

1597
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:36.120
<v Speaker 4>started making good cause like the key </v>
<v Speaker 4>is now.</v>

1598
01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:37.050
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Honda is,</v>

1599
01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 4>are fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

1600
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.670
<v Speaker 4>they're luxury one that they make that </v>
<v Speaker 4>one that looks like a Mercedes.</v>

1601
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:44.160
<v Speaker 4>They sort of ripped off Mercedes design.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1602
01:11:44.161 --> 01:11:46.080
<v Speaker 4>What's that creek twice or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1603
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:47.850
<v Speaker 4>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it not on the Elantra?</v>

1604
01:11:47.851 --> 01:11:50.530
<v Speaker 4>Is Genesis equus or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1606
01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.580
<v Speaker 4>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard you talk also about like the,</v>

1607
01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:57.020
<v Speaker 4>the muscle cars of the fifties in terms </v>
<v Speaker 4>of like the,</v>

1608
01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:00.180
<v Speaker 4>that still in Cuba and still working and</v>
<v Speaker 4>running.</v>

1609
01:12:00.181 --> 01:12:05.181
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to Cuba or was it this past new </v>

1610
01:12:05.181 --> 01:12:05.181
<v Speaker 4>year's?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1611
01:12:05.181 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 4>like two a year and a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Man,</v>

1612
01:12:08.161 --> 01:12:10.860
<v Speaker 4>it's just incredible seeing like </v>
<v Speaker 4>cruising around Havana.</v>

1613
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:12.110
<v Speaker 4>Ollie's old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

1614
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:17.330
<v Speaker 4>They love those cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're still going tanks they call </v>

1615
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.330
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:21.980
<v Speaker 4>They call them Yank tanks because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>built these enormous metal fucking </v>

1617
01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:26.210
<v Speaker 4>buildings that you could drive around </v>
<v Speaker 4>and those was 55 Chevy's and things </v>

1618
01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 4>along those lines.</v>

1619
01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.760
<v Speaker 4>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that while I was going to say,</v>

1620
01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:33.770
<v Speaker 4>do you think that the American industry </v>
<v Speaker 4>is ever going to be as innovative as it </v>

1621
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:34.300
<v Speaker 4>was back in the fifties and it's never </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to rule the coop?</v>

1622
01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be real tough to rule the </v>

1623
01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:39.420
<v Speaker 4>coop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they've made an insane comeback.</v>

1624
01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:42.840
<v Speaker 4>The new American cars are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drove one of those Cadillac escalades.</v>

1625
01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:46.650
<v Speaker 4>That thing is a marvel of engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The entire screen,</v>

1626
01:12:46.651 --> 01:12:51.651
<v Speaker 4>the entire dashboard is an LCD screen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge lcd screen that controls the </v>

1627
01:12:51.651 --> 01:12:54.300
<v Speaker 4>dashboard lcd screen that controls the </v>
<v Speaker 4>navigation.</v>

1628
01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:59.690
<v Speaker 4>Everything is magnetic ride control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you go over bumps and it's like </v>

1629
01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 4>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible engineering.</v>

1630
01:13:00.181 --> 01:13:02.730
<v Speaker 4>Like the car is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ride gray.</v>

1631
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.820
<v Speaker 4>It's an enormous car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it rides like a small car.</v>

1632
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.490
<v Speaker 4>Like when you drive one of those big </v>
<v Speaker 4>cadillac escalades,</v>

1633
01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.640
<v Speaker 4>that thing feels like you're driving </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a mid sized car.</v>

1634
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:13.360
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what it looks like inside.</v>

1635
01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take,</v>

1636
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.800
<v Speaker 4>they took it up a 100 notches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's an amazing car.</v>

1637
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I almost bought one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember close,</v>

1638
01:13:23.381 --> 01:13:26.370
<v Speaker 4>but I went with the instead because </v>
<v Speaker 4>lexus is a.</v>

1639
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:27.740
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1640
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:32.990
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're based off of the Land Cruiser </v>

1641
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:35.450
<v Speaker 4>and the land cruisers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the best platforms for driving </v>

1642
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.450
<v Speaker 4>off road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually have a lift.</v>

1643
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:36.570
<v Speaker 4>He press a button,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it lifts the car up.</v>

1644
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:39.150
<v Speaker 4>So it gives you more ground clearance on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lexus or the linkers.</v>

1645
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Lexis is the same car as a Land Cruiser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing Lexus ls five 75 70.</v>

1646
01:13:44.281 --> 01:13:49.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this same exact car as the Toyota </v>

1647
01:13:49.281 --> 01:13:49.281
<v Speaker 4>Land Cruiser?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just they,</v>

1648
01:13:49.281 --> 01:13:50.100
<v Speaker 4>it's like they call it a Land Cruiser </v>
<v Speaker 4>and drag.</v>

1649
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:52.790
<v Speaker 4>They just make it a little more fluffy </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the inside and modal,</v>

1650
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:56.790
<v Speaker 4>prettier on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm an idiot and for some reason I'm</v>

1651
01:13:56.791 --> 01:13:57.090
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1652
01:13:57.091 --> 01:13:58.640
<v Speaker 4>what if the apocalypse happens?</v>

1653
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:03.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to drive on the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aren't neutral department car like a </v>

1654
01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:06.760
<v Speaker 4>drop in the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of those dummies and things I </v>

1655
01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 4>need to cash canister in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No fuckin grass.</v>

1656
01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:08.900
<v Speaker 4>You'll be laughing on the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your face when that,</v>

1657
01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.350
<v Speaker 4>when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it all goes to shit.</v>

1658
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Now when it all to shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a meteor hits,</v>

1659
01:14:12.551 --> 01:14:17.551
<v Speaker 4>I hope it hits me in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope the meteor hits my house and I </v>

1660
01:14:17.551 --> 01:14:18.890
<v Speaker 4>hope you don't even know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want.</v>

1661
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:21.350
<v Speaker 4>What's that whistling sound?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

1662
01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.310
<v Speaker 4>But I don't want to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the.</v>

1663
01:14:24.311 --> 01:14:25.790
<v Speaker 4>Like the prepper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1664
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:31.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when you're fucking hold up </v>

1665
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:34.441
<v Speaker 4>trying to take little cat naps while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're holding a shotgun because you're </v>

1666
01:14:34.441 --> 01:14:34.930
<v Speaker 4>worried that someone's going to come and</v>
<v Speaker 4>steal your canned peaches.</v>

1667
01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:36.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be that guy.</v>

1668
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.310
<v Speaker 4>But then I also don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely unprepared.</v>

1669
01:14:39.311 --> 01:14:44.311
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't even have an emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in Manhattan and I don't even </v>

1670
01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:47.431
<v Speaker 4>have a little bag with some like granola</v>
<v Speaker 4>bars in it and some fresh water in case </v>

1671
01:14:47.431 --> 01:14:48.880
<v Speaker 4>we get hit with a dirty bomb or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1672
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 4>You know that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have that stuff I have.</v>

1673
01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:56.560
<v Speaker 4>I have freeze dried food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have hundreds of pounds of frozen meat</v>

1674
01:14:56.561 --> 01:14:58.420
<v Speaker 4>because I hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I have like,</v>

1675
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.480
<v Speaker 4>if I can keep some sort of power on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1676
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:04.990
<v Speaker 4>like by generator or solar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have food for a long time,</v>

1677
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:10.350
<v Speaker 4>but that's not why I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it because that's what I actually </v>

1678
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:13.230
<v Speaker 4>do eat really prepping for doomsday in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of those that,</v>

1679
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:15.910
<v Speaker 4>those cars being so sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 4>nowadays.</v>

1680
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:20.170
<v Speaker 4>I was interviewing a guy from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Gorka who was involved in</v>

1681
01:15:20.171 --> 01:15:21.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

1682
01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:26.400
<v Speaker 4>like a test where these hackers </v>
<v Speaker 4>encouraged him to get in the car I </v>

1683
01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:26.400
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

1684
01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they,</v>

1685
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:31.830
<v Speaker 4>they hacked into the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the was,</v>

1686
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.030
<v Speaker 4>it was recent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1687
01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Really when they shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they yet now they've turned it off </v>

1688
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:38.300
<v Speaker 4>the side of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1689
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.320
<v Speaker 4>So you could have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine if you have hundreds of </v>

1690
01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.991
<v Speaker 4>thousands of a particular type of car </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving around in America and because </v>

1691
01:15:45.991 --> 01:15:46.770
<v Speaker 4>they're all wifi enabled and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 4>saddled,</v>

1692
01:15:46.771 --> 01:15:51.771
<v Speaker 4>they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all on the satellite and </v>

1693
01:15:51.771 --> 01:15:53.011
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have hackers or terrorists or </v>

1694
01:15:53.011 --> 01:15:53.011
<v Speaker 4>just knit a wells or some kind of hack </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1695
01:15:53.011 --> 01:15:57.720
<v Speaker 4>And theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they can certainly slow down the </v>

1696
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:57.720
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can certainly make the cotton,</v>

1697
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.860
<v Speaker 4>they can certainly screw around with it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some way,</v>

1698
01:15:59.861 --> 01:16:04.861
<v Speaker 4>but if they could make it speed up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>160 miles an hour and then via sharply </v>

1699
01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:06.940
<v Speaker 4>to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could be killed 100,000</v>

1700
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:08.830
<v Speaker 4>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that.</v>

1701
01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:14.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the argument for Michael </v>

1702
01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:14.060
<v Speaker 4>Hastings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that story,</v>

1703
01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:14.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remind me,</v>

1704
01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:18.721
<v Speaker 4>Michael Hastings was the journalist that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was writing all these stories about </v>

1705
01:16:18.721 --> 01:16:22.080
<v Speaker 4>generals like he had taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was one of the guys that had taken </v>

<v Speaker 4>Find out about it.</v>

1707
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember his name.</v>

1708
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Hastings.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.630
<v Speaker 4>he had actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was it,</v>

<v Speaker 4>was that taken down crystal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1712
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.390

<v Speaker 4>He did the mcchrystal,</v>

1713
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.330
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1714
01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:42.040
<v Speaker 4>So he did that and he was insanely </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried about his safety.</v>

1715
01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was telling people like,</v>

1716
01:16:43.961 --> 01:16:45.760
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I wind up dead,</v>

1717
01:16:45.761 --> 01:16:47.800
<v Speaker 4>I didn't kill myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just know this.</v>

1718
01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:52.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he died because his Mercedes was </v>

1719
01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.260
<v Speaker 4>barreling down sunset going into 120 </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles an hour running a tree.</v>

1720
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.310
<v Speaker 4>I remember they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he committed suicide and not only that,</v>

1721
01:16:57.311 --> 01:17:01.080
<v Speaker 4>the engine flew from the wreckage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1722
01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:02.350
<v Speaker 4>there is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

1723
01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:07.351
<v Speaker 4>that's the video of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these cars today are so fucking </v>

1724
01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 4>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so</v>

1725
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>much gadgetry and stuff going on inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them that there are many that argue </v>

1726
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 1>that not only it has been possible for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>

1727
01:17:18.951 --> 01:17:20.660
<v Speaker 1>but they've been doing this for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1728
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.650
<v Speaker 1>He was a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a good report.</v>

1729
01:17:22.651 --> 01:17:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I have is with buzzfeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1730
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe he was murdered.</v>

1731
01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a pace.</v>

1732
01:17:27.411 --> 01:17:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I've got a place here in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine,</v>

1733
01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.840
<v Speaker 1>which I just chatted to Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who killed Michael Hastings,</v>

1734
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:36.050
<v Speaker 1>reflexively distrustful Egan to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful enemies.</v>

1735
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:39.110
<v Speaker 1>The young journalist who's Mercedes </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploded in Los Angeles one night,</v>

1736
01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:40.760
<v Speaker 1>couldn't possibly have died </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally.</v>

1737
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1738
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:47.831
<v Speaker 1>that will also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had apparently he had crystal </v>

1739
01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:47.831
<v Speaker 1>methodist system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

1740
01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:52.330
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that work really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that do long hours and are involved </v>

1741
01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:54.230
<v Speaker 1>in journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take adderall.</v>

1742
01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1743
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And adderall and crystal meth or fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>kissing cousins.</v>

1744
01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:02.710
<v Speaker 1>They're almost exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that he wasn't really on </v>

1745
01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:03.500
<v Speaker 1>crystal meth and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1746
01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look at the toxicology </v>
<v Speaker 1>examination,</v>

1747
01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:07.200
<v Speaker 1>but they could've been lying about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just.</v>

1748
01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It could have been adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adderall is so fucking common.</v>

1749
01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:11.450
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1750
01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:16.780
<v Speaker 1>especially people that are on deadlines </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they need energy to push through </v>

1751
01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.300
<v Speaker 1>something pretty common in journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is,</v>

1752
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:18.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went back on the drugs,</v>

1753
01:18:18.651 --> 01:18:23.651
<v Speaker 1>he was on adderall and he drove into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree man or math and drove into a </v>

1754
01:18:23.651 --> 01:18:25.040
<v Speaker 1>treatment and not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily who knows?</v>

1755
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in speaking of adderall,</v>

1756
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:31.841
<v Speaker 1>did you see the story this week that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic game is association is going </v>

1757
01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:35.740
<v Speaker 1>to start drug testing as a game is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be drug tested for.</v>

1758
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I interviewed the DS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1759
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:38.650
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for PDS,</v>

1760
01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.660
<v Speaker 1>like adderall and I mean I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation on huff post live </v>

1761
01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:44.240
<v Speaker 1>with the head of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the.</v>

1762
01:18:44.241 --> 01:18:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it do?</v>

1763
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:48.620
<v Speaker 1>The Electronic Gaming Association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that the Srb I think.</v>

1764
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had the,</v>

1765
01:18:50.361 --> 01:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>like the president of that on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1766
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:56.770
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a bunch of gamers and like some </v>

1767
01:18:56.770 --> 01:18:59.321
<v Speaker 1>sports psychologists and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethicists about this and like,</v>

1768
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird why we object to doping in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>

1769
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Like it gets very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I understand.</v>

1770
01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protocol on adderall,</v>

1771
01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:10.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1772
01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:13.620
<v Speaker 1>So that's what sparked this whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he made those comments.</v>

1773
01:19:13.621 --> 01:19:14.240
<v Speaker 1>So then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1774
01:19:14.241 --> 01:19:17.660
<v Speaker 1>we got to crack down on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's like cracking down on comics</v>

1775
01:19:17.661 --> 01:19:20.390
<v Speaker 1>for marijuana if they start drug testing</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy clubs,</v>

1776
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.180
<v Speaker 1>good fucking luck.</v>

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Really enjoy talking to him and he'll be</v>
<v Speaker 4>on soon and really empathetic and </v>

1820
01:21:16.021 --> 01:21:21.021
<v Speaker 4>sympathetic guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not like some evil person is just </v>

1821
01:21:21.021 --> 01:21:25.230
<v Speaker 4>like some fucking Jack Law here to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the criminals.</v>

1822
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.890
<v Speaker 4>He's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy who was sort of seeing both</v>

1823
01:21:28.891 --> 01:21:33.891
<v Speaker 4>sides of it and that's one of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons why the people </v>

1824
01:21:33.891 --> 01:21:35.220
<v Speaker 4>cooperated with him to kind of go after </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lance Armstrong.</v>

1825
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:37.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people will say like,</v>

1826
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:38.300
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well lance,</v>

1827
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:43.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the reason why it's bet what </v>

1828
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Lance Armstrong did is bad is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's on a fair.</v>

1829
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:45.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lebron James is.</v>

1830
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Genetics is unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1831
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:53.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean the fact that I now feel better </v>
<v Speaker 4>after having two cups of coffee then I </v>

1832
01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.120
<v Speaker 4>did an hour ago is unfair be too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1833
01:21:54.121 --> 01:21:59.121
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm jet lagged and Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have a two cups of coffee and for </v>

1834
01:21:59.121 --> 01:22:02.991
<v Speaker 4>Alpha brands and I'm kicking right in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How different is that stuff from </v>

1835
01:22:02.991 --> 01:22:02.991
<v Speaker 4>adderall?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1836
01:22:02.991 --> 01:22:04.460
<v Speaker 4>isn't it all just degrees?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe we should just a lamp.</v>

1837
01:22:04.690 --> 01:22:07.290
<v Speaker 4>Why maybe we should just allowed doping?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1838
01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:12.291
<v Speaker 4>I think to a certain extent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the real problems with </v>

1839
01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:14.421
<v Speaker 4>Lance Armstrong said he was suing people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're accurately talking about his </v>

1840
01:22:14.421 --> 01:22:19.071
<v Speaker 4>drug use because they got busted and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was going after them and trying to ruin </v>

1841
01:22:19.071 --> 01:22:19.071
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

1842
01:22:19.071 --> 01:22:21.630
<v Speaker 4>an absolutely and a liar at just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathological liar,</v>

1843
01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:22.680
<v Speaker 4>deceiver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's.</v>

1844
01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.620
<v Speaker 4>But that's less interesting I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the question of like whether or not</v>

1845
01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:30.621
<v Speaker 4>the laws that he broke should be against</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rules that he broke should be </v>

1846
01:22:30.621 --> 01:22:33.320
<v Speaker 4>against the rules in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I agree with that and also there's </v>

1847
01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:33.690
<v Speaker 4>also an argument that the Tour de </v>
<v Speaker 4>France,</v>

1848
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.780
<v Speaker 4>notice how I said France and that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>very impressed.</v>

1849
01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very good at the misspelling ties with </v>

1850
01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:44.191
<v Speaker 4>the one they say that that race is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>grueling.</v>

1851
01:22:44.221 --> 01:22:47.100
<v Speaker 4>There's an argument that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthier to do with drugs.</v>

1852
01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:52.640
<v Speaker 4>That doing it with drugs actually allows</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body to recuperate in a way that </v>

1853
01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.871
<v Speaker 4>you would be breaking it down and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be susceptible to rhabdomyolysis.</v>

1854
01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.760
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that thing that those crossfit </v>

1855
01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:02.760
<v Speaker 4>people get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start pissing looks like diet coke,</v>

1856
01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:03.660
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen it?</v>

1857
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:04.270
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1858
01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's awful.</v>

1859
01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 4>When when people have a breakdown of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their muscle tissue and then your,</v>

1860
01:23:10.971 --> 01:23:11.630
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1861
01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:14.920
<v Speaker 4>your body starts processing it and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes out in your urine.</v>

1862
01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:20.100
<v Speaker 4>Like ultra marathon runners have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a buddy who runs ultra marathons </v>

1863
01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you done you pee,</v>

1864
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:25.950
<v Speaker 4>it's black like soda or like coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's awful and it's just your body's </v>

1865
01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:27.220
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your kidneys are malfunctioning.</v>

1866
01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:30.130
<v Speaker 4>Everything's just shutting down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not The fittest guy in the world,</v>

1867
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.570
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not proud of that.</v>

1868
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:36.630
<v Speaker 4>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am not the fittest guy in the </v>

1869
01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:36.630
<v Speaker 4>wheelchair and tested yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have not tested myself.</v>

1870
01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:37.600
<v Speaker 4>I could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good point Mike,</v>

1871
01:23:37.670 --> 01:23:42.670
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think if you're doing as string </v>

1872
01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:44.110
<v Speaker 4>and all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're running marathons,</v>

1873
01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:45.850
<v Speaker 4>good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good for you America.</v>

1874
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:51.030
<v Speaker 4>But if you pissing black,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body's telling you that you </v>

1875
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.220
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1876
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:56.250
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing is they're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to push past all the pain and </v>

1877
01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:59.731
<v Speaker 4>discomfort and show mental toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's supposed to be </v>

1878
01:23:59.731 --> 01:23:59.731
<v Speaker 4>inspiring is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1879
01:23:59.731 --> 01:24:00.620
<v Speaker 4>this guy ran like my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1880
01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 4>Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he ran 106 miles in 24 hours,</v>

1881
01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:10.380
<v Speaker 4>does a 24 hour race where you had a one </v>
<v Speaker 4>mile course and he did it a hundred and </v>

1882
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:11.890
<v Speaker 4>six times in 24 hours.</v>

1883
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:14.920
<v Speaker 4>He and he came in fourth place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't even fucking win.</v>

1884
01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:18.950
<v Speaker 4>Some dude ran like 120 something miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is insane.</v>

1885
01:24:18.951 --> 01:24:20.650
<v Speaker 4>And he said it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can you combine them all?</v>

1886
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals that's like,</v>

1887
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got beat by a chick too.</v>

1888
01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I think a chick came in third place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1889
01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.500
<v Speaker 4>she's definitely on the juice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never know.</v>

1890
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.330
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean just being angry,</v>

1891
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>running on the fuel of eight,</v>

1892
01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.320
<v Speaker 4>they're almost equivalent of 50 iron man</v>
<v Speaker 4>triathlons in 50 days in 50 states to </v>

1893
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.470
<v Speaker 4>promote fitness among youth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1894
01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.410
<v Speaker 4>But is that fitness is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1895
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:48.160
<v Speaker 4>are you actually doing good for </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself?</v>

1896
01:24:48.161 --> 01:24:53.161
<v Speaker 4>If you know 50 triathlons in 50 days?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well his body has the capacity to do </v>

1897
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:56.110
<v Speaker 4>that kind of work and my body doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the argument is,</v>

1898
01:24:56.111 --> 01:24:58.720
<v Speaker 4>and he's getting more fit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're better than me,</v>

1899
01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:03.400
<v Speaker 4>is the argument is that his body is more</v>
<v Speaker 4>fit than the average person's body,</v>

1900
01:25:03.401 --> 01:25:05.200
<v Speaker 4>but he's definitely not doing a service.</v>

1901
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.180
<v Speaker 4>Like my friend who did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cameron,</v>

1902
01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:10.120
<v Speaker 4>he did it a couple months ago and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said he hasn't recovered yet,</v>

1903
01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.730
<v Speaker 4>so he's still hasn't recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said when he runs,</v>

1904
01:25:12.731 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 4>like he still runs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when he runs he's like,</v>

1905
01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:17.680
<v Speaker 4>you still feeling that he's not back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>baseline to where he was.</v>

1906
01:25:17.681 --> 01:25:18.760
<v Speaker 4>His times were off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1907
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:20.980
<v Speaker 4>he's exhausted and he didn't even come </v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

1908
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:22.030
<v Speaker 4>No second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His legs,</v>

1909
01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:27.420
<v Speaker 4>his legs swelled up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said almost twice the size they </v>

1910
01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:27.420
<v Speaker 4>normally are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1911
01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:29.680
<v Speaker 4>Fuck all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1912
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to open a BA pretty soon.</v>

1913
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:33.760
<v Speaker 4>We got whiskey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1914
01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:37.930
<v Speaker 4>We can just go hard right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's spark up a joint and have a drink.</v>

1915
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:41.380
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely have it be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you want a beer?</v>

1916
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beer.</v>

1917
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:44.830
<v Speaker 4>That'd be one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A couple of beers.</v>

1918
01:25:44.831 --> 01:25:45.250
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1919
01:25:45.251 --> 01:25:45.880
<v Speaker 4>it's five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>10.</v>

1920
01:25:45.881 --> 01:25:48.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm Australian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If as soon as the clock ticks five.</v>

1921
01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.590
<v Speaker 4>Every Australian has to stop drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1922
01:25:50.591 --> 01:25:52.360
<v Speaker 4>I'll have us there too as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds good.</v>

1923
01:25:52.361 --> 01:25:54.340
<v Speaker 4>It's the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got a few good ones.</v>

1924
01:25:54.341 --> 01:25:54.960
<v Speaker 4>We've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1925
01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:58.300
<v Speaker 4>what does that butte like a dark beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black Butte port.</v>

1926
01:25:58.690 --> 01:25:59.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that stuff.</v>

1927
01:25:59.830 --> 01:26:00.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1928
01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:01.380
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1929
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a real good argument</v>

1930
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.980
<v Speaker 2>that coffee is a stimulant and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulant helps and if that helps why </v>

1931
01:26:09.471 --> 01:26:14.471
<v Speaker 2>not adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also marijuana allows you to see </v>

1932
01:26:14.471 --> 01:26:18.341
<v Speaker 2>things in a different way and if you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that and maybe write something </v>

1933
01:26:18.341 --> 01:26:19.550
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana helped you write that thing.</v>

1934
01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:23.570
<v Speaker 2>That's not exactly just your creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the marijuana.</v>

1935
01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the weird thing is when there are </v>

1936
01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.020
<v Speaker 1>drugs that are not actually performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing but are also banned,</v>

1937
01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:31.990
<v Speaker 1>like marijuana will be banned in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sportswear.</v>

1938
01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.940
<v Speaker 1>It clearly wouldn't actually give you an</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage,</v>

1939
01:26:33.941 --> 01:26:38.941
<v Speaker 1>but like which ones I don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of athletic sport is probably not </v>

1940
01:26:38.941 --> 01:26:38.941
<v Speaker 1>going to be enhanced by meryl</v>

1941
01:26:38.941 --> 01:26:40.860
<v Speaker 2>and it was actually what you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually showing,</v>

1942
01:26:40.861 --> 01:26:44.280
<v Speaker 2>especially ultra marathon runners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're showing that marijuana does have</v>

1943
01:26:44.281 --> 01:26:46.410
<v Speaker 2>a significant impact on ultra marathon</v>

1944
01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.630
<v Speaker 1>runners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just about coordination sports.</v>

1945
01:26:48.631 --> 01:26:49.240
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1946
01:26:49.241 --> 01:26:50.880
<v Speaker 1>playing soccer or something and put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>out sweet.</v>

1947
01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Better</v>

1948
01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.000
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's crazy.</v>

1949
01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:53.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you?</v>

1950
01:26:53.821 --> 01:26:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Jitsu is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>

1951
01:26:56.011 --> 01:26:57.120
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1952
01:26:57.121 --> 01:27:00.210
<v Speaker 2>really common for Jujitsu guys to train </v>
<v Speaker 2>on marijuana.</v>

1953
01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:05.660
<v Speaker 2>A matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm better at Jujitsu when I do </v>

1954
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:06.910
<v Speaker 2>marijuana than I am when I'm sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How high can I still be bad?</v>

1955
01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.450
<v Speaker 2>High as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really high as fuck to the point where I</v>

1956
01:27:09.451 --> 01:27:11.780
<v Speaker 2>can't even demonstrate techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I try to forget.</v>

1957
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I forget how it works or didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1958
01:27:13.881 --> 01:27:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

1959
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:17.370
<v Speaker 2>when you're in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See when you're sparring.</v>

1960
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:19.680
<v Speaker 2>The idea about sparring is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got this stuff.</v>

1961
01:27:19.681 --> 01:27:20.990
<v Speaker 2>This is from New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

1962
01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:22.830
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take it.</v>

1963
01:27:22.831 --> 01:27:27.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try the new one because I know in </v>

1964
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:27.831
<v Speaker 1>new castle and I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll try.</v>

1965
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:27.831
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1966
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:28.000
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1967
01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:32.850
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that it allows you to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of zen state where you flow.</v>

1968
01:27:32.851 --> 01:27:37.851
<v Speaker 2>So the things you already know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think it's not that good for the </v>

1969
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:37.851
<v Speaker 2>learning stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually.</v>

1970
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a gentleman.</v>

1971
01:27:38.821 --> 01:27:41.190
<v Speaker 2>He opens his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he opens one and hands it to me and then</v>

1972
01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.720
<v Speaker 2>he gets his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a good man.</v>

1973
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I do what I was raised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right joe?</v>

1974
01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:45.630
<v Speaker 2>You were sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were.</v>

1975
01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:51.170
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that it's not good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning stuff because it just goes in </v>

1976
01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:54.381
<v Speaker 2>and out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff that you already know </v>

1977
01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:54.690
<v Speaker 2>that's in your system that you already </v>
<v Speaker 2>have trained down,</v>

1978
01:27:54.691 --> 01:27:56.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a part of your.</v>

1979
01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost muscle memory in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't require a lot of cognitive </v>

1980
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:02.120
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1981
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:02.780
<v Speaker 1>like tennis players,</v>

1982
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:05.310
<v Speaker 2>apparently fine marijuana helps them </v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly as well.</v>

1983
01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Recreational tennis players would tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you when they get really high,</v>

1984
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:11.790
<v Speaker 2>they kind of like see the ball better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can move pool players.</v>

1985
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:16.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge thing with pool with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can feel where the ball's going </v>

1986
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:17.220
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys who play,</v>

1987
01:28:17.221 --> 01:28:20.310
<v Speaker 2>they say it gives them like a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 percent advantage when they,</v>

1988
01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:20.840
<v Speaker 2>when they smell it.</v>

1989
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I think there are different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who respond to the drug </v>

1990
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:26.000
<v Speaker 1>differently of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I mean,</v>

1991
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a huge pot smoker.</v>

1992
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll have it occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1993
01:28:27.571 --> 01:28:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I can only have like a very small amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so I get that buzz.</v>

1994
01:28:30.691 --> 01:28:35.691
<v Speaker 1>If I have too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start to get scattered and like </v>

1995
01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:35.880
<v Speaker 1>paranoid and just like I can't focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do things.</v>

1996
01:28:35.881 --> 01:28:40.881
<v Speaker 1>I kind of can be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't follow the plot of like </v>

1997
01:28:40.881 --> 01:28:43.340
<v Speaker 1>television shows and stuff it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I know I've got tons of friends </v>

1998
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:43.470
<v Speaker 1>who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not me.</v>

1999
01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they probably swung a lot of pot </v>

2000
01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:49.190
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2001
01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:49.860
<v Speaker 1>that's probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tolerance thing that's real and also</v>

2002
01:28:49.861 --> 01:28:54.861
<v Speaker 1>the acceptance of the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you fight the experience </v>

2003
01:28:54.861 --> 01:28:57.870
<v Speaker 1>like Oh high and that's where paranoia </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in.</v>

2004
01:28:57.871 --> 01:29:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And also I think paranoia is also one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that does is it</v>

2005
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.280
<v Speaker 2>lowers the boundaries that we put up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to get things done.</v>

2006
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Like we have boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a sort of blinders that you</v>

2007
01:29:08.581 --> 01:29:13.581
<v Speaker 2>put on that allow you to get through </v>
<v Speaker 2>your job and get in your car and drive </v>

2008
01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:16.140
<v Speaker 2>home to your family and not consider the</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive amount of variables at the world</v>

2009
01:29:16.141 --> 01:29:19.680
<v Speaker 2>creates or that the world presents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also space.</v>

2010
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:22.770
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you're on a fucking giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24,000</v>

2011
01:29:22.771 --> 01:29:27.771
<v Speaker 2>mile round ball that's going a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour in a circle and hurling </v>

2012
01:29:27.771 --> 01:29:32.091
<v Speaker 2>through infinity when he smoked pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of unveils all of these </v>

2013
01:29:32.091 --> 01:29:33.930
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and potentials and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaks people out.</v>

2014
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get freaked out by that.</v>

2015
01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:37.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're describing,</v>

2016
01:29:37.111 --> 01:29:39.010
<v Speaker 3>you're not taking enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that said,</v>

2017
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:40.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you will.</v>

2018
01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I just needed a better dealer or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2019
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2020
01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to take it on the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

2021
01:29:47.710 --> 01:29:48.400
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2022
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:51.550
<v Speaker 3>smell this and we'll get you high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you,</v>

2023
01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:55.670
<v Speaker 3>are you allowed to have this as this </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicinal last patient I have.</v>

2024
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That smells great.</v>

2025
01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.390
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What your,</v>

2026
01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:01.910
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about there in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the doors of perception being kind of</v>

2027
01:30:01.911 --> 01:30:03.370
<v Speaker 3>shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2028
01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:06.830
<v Speaker 3>During normal behavior strikes me as </v>
<v Speaker 3>more of a psychedelic thing.</v>

2029
01:30:06.831 --> 01:30:11.831
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had some of the most in like </v>

2030
01:30:11.831 --> 01:30:11.831
<v Speaker 3>insightful experiences of my entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2031
01:30:11.831 --> 01:30:16.331
<v Speaker 3>I don't do them anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I was in my late teens and </v>

2032
01:30:16.331 --> 01:30:18.791
<v Speaker 3>early twenties doing acid or mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 3>and having that sense of sudden complete</v>

2033
01:30:19.401 --> 01:30:23.840
<v Speaker 3>awareness that you are on a rock that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going around this star on the outer edge</v>

2034
01:30:23.841 --> 01:30:27.540
<v Speaker 3>of a spiral galaxy in a cosmos that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so vast that you,</v>

2035
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:32.890
<v Speaker 3>you cannot comprehend it and we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved as a species to not comprehend </v>

2036
01:30:34.041 --> 01:30:39.041
<v Speaker 3>it and to not focus on it all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if we actually thought about </v>

2037
01:30:39.041 --> 01:30:41.180
<v Speaker 3>where we are and what we're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how many things could be thrown at us at</v>

2038
01:30:41.181 --> 01:30:42.740
<v Speaker 3>any point in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in time,</v>

2039
01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:44.270
<v Speaker 3>we'd go crazy.</v>

2040
01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:48.530
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't even bother like aiding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't buy like working and eating</v>

2041
01:30:48.531 --> 01:30:49.970
<v Speaker 3>anymore because everything would seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2042
01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.220
<v Speaker 3>so kind of trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2043
01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Does to many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of friends in the quote </v>

2044
01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:00.341
<v Speaker 2>unquote psychedelic community that lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives around the time they do </v>

2045
01:31:00.951 --> 01:31:03.410
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics and then the downtime in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between.</v>

2046
01:31:03.411 --> 01:31:08.411
<v Speaker 2>There were the sort of processing it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gearing up for their next psychedelic </v>

2047
01:31:08.411 --> 01:31:11.591
<v Speaker 2>trip and for them it's just that's their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2048
01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:14.000
<v Speaker 2>That's a part of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those,</v>

2049
01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:19.090
<v Speaker 2>those crazy trips and those realizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a significant part of their </v>

2050
01:31:19.090 --> 01:31:21.260
<v Speaker 2>existence and what's make makes life </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful to them.</v>

2051
01:31:21.710 --> 01:31:22.940
<v Speaker 2>And then there's people like you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2052
01:31:22.941 --> 01:31:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it before,</v>

2053
01:31:23.931 --> 01:31:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it anymore.</v>

2054
01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean I wonder if there are also </v>

2055
01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.170
<v Speaker 3>like non drug related ways of getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2056
01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this guy got out or a pendant </v>

2057
01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Dusa who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Hindu chaplain.</v>

2058
01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:41.750
<v Speaker 3>He's the first Hindu chaplain of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbia University and yeah.</v>

2059
01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:42.620
<v Speaker 3>So he</v>

2060
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:46.580
<v Speaker 2>hinduism as a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a chaplain.</v>

2061
01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I guess is the religious authority</v>

2062
01:31:49.061 --> 01:31:49.900
<v Speaker 3>at the university.</v>

2063
01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a designation by the.</v>

2064
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:53.210
<v Speaker 3>The university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2065
01:31:53.230 --> 01:31:56.140
<v Speaker 3>but he's just a Hindu spiritual teacher </v>
<v Speaker 3>in New York.</v>

2066
01:31:56.141 --> 01:31:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Lovely guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he is just know you can.</v>

2067
01:31:59.950 --> 01:32:01.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Dalai Lama or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2068
01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 3>You can just sense this awareness of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like him just being on another plane.</v>

2069
01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:10.660
<v Speaker 3>He is not bothered by the same trivial </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that distracts us.</v>

2070
01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:15.820
<v Speaker 3>He is clearly communing with some kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of level of existence that is beyond the</v>

2071
01:32:15.821 --> 01:32:18.640
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that is sort of similar</v>

2072
01:32:18.641 --> 01:32:22.690
<v Speaker 3>to the mindset that you can get into </v>
<v Speaker 3>with psychedelics.</v>

2073
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think yoga can take you there if you </v>

2074
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800
<v Speaker 2>do the right kind of yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do hot yoga,</v>

2075
01:32:27.801 --> 01:32:30.680
<v Speaker 2>like a [inaudible] type hot yoga and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great for the body.</v>

2076
01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:33.020
<v Speaker 2>It was really is great for relaxation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to me,</v>

2077
01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:38.500
<v Speaker 2>my on some things happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I do a lot of yoga I was </v>

2078
01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:38.500
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in a car accident,</v>

2079
01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.180
<v Speaker 2>somebody rear ended my expensive Germans</v>
<v Speaker 2>porche car and I,</v>

2080
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2081
01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I asked are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything okay.</v>

2082
01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:45.020
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't even mad at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2083
01:32:45.021 --> 01:32:50.021
<v Speaker 2>I should've been probably upset that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy wasn't paying attention or </v>

2084
01:32:50.021 --> 01:32:53.111
<v Speaker 2>texting or whatever the fuck it was and </v>
<v Speaker 2>slammed into my car and cost me a </v>

2085
01:32:53.111 --> 01:32:53.111
<v Speaker 2>shitload of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wasn't.</v>

2086
01:32:53.111 --> 01:32:55.880
<v Speaker 2>And I attribute it to doing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga that week.</v>

2087
01:32:56.210 --> 01:32:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it calms you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something.</v>

2088
01:32:58.701 --> 01:33:03.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a reason why those skinny</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indian dudes have been doing that shit </v>

2089
01:33:03.701 --> 01:33:03.701
<v Speaker 2>for thousands of years.</v>

2090
01:33:03.701 --> 01:33:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they'd just been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a hobby.</v>

2091
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:07.820
<v Speaker 2>And they just stuck with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Kundalini Yoga,</v>

2092
01:33:07.821 --> 01:33:12.821
<v Speaker 2>which I don't practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have friends that do and I have a </v>

2093
01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:14.060
<v Speaker 2>friend who teaches it in boulder and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

2094
01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:14.900
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2095
01:33:14.901 --> 01:33:19.310
<v Speaker 2>a firm advocate of achieving psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 2>states through this practice.</v>

2096
01:33:19.311 --> 01:33:24.311
<v Speaker 2>You get up at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and you do these </v>

2097
01:33:24.311 --> 01:33:26.981
<v Speaker 2>breathing exercises and you want to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a certain direction and it's all like</v>

2098
01:33:27.411 --> 01:33:32.411
<v Speaker 2>very ritualistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also based on the idea of the </v>

2099
01:33:32.411 --> 01:33:35.500
<v Speaker 2>circadian cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sort of interrupt your sleep cycle </v>

2100
01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.741
<v Speaker 2>and the cycle of the earth and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do these stimulation exercises that </v>

2101
01:33:38.741 --> 01:33:43.741
<v Speaker 2>supposedly a activate your pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the gland that's been proven to</v>

2102
01:33:43.911 --> 01:33:48.911
<v Speaker 2>produce dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the most potent psychedelic </v>

2103
01:33:48.911 --> 01:33:52.151
<v Speaker 2>drug known to man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's related in many ways to </v>

2104
01:33:52.151 --> 01:33:55.871
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very similar in their chemical </v>

2105
01:33:55.871 --> 01:33:56.600
<v Speaker 2>composition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know that,</v>

2106
01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:57.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2107
01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.200
<v Speaker 2>these psychedelic drugs that the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces.</v>

2108
01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:04.480
<v Speaker 2>If you can take them and you extract </v>
<v Speaker 2>them from plants and every,</v>

2109
01:34:04.490 --> 01:34:05.870
<v Speaker 2>the existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of plants.</v>

2110
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.010
<v Speaker 2>You have these insanely profound </v>
<v Speaker 2>visionary experiences.</v>

2111
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:15.250
<v Speaker 2>She says that you can achieve these </v>
<v Speaker 2>states through meditation and through </v>

2112
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Kundalini Yoga.</v>

2113
01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't doubt that I don't get out or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bill,</v>

2114
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he meditates two or three hours a day.</v>

2115
01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:24.190
<v Speaker 3>That would probably explain why he is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the type of person that he is.</v>

2116
01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:27.010
<v Speaker 3>And you get into weird places when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

2117
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a,</v>

2118
01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of meditation in an isolation</v>
<v Speaker 2>tank.</v>

2119
01:34:30.690 --> 01:34:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I have an isolation to wanting to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

2120
01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I can hook it up and tell me when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me when I'll look it up.</v>

2121
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2122
01:34:36.811 --> 01:34:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so connected to this,</v>

2123
01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.430
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this community community.</v>

2124
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2125
01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Put me in touch with someone in New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>City.</v>

2126
01:34:43.050 --> 01:34:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Had a good good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There must be good.</v>

2127
01:34:44.290 --> 01:34:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Outfit out</v>

2128
01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.880
<v Speaker 2>the word right now and we will get </v>
<v Speaker 2>messages on twitter.</v>

2129
01:34:47.881 --> 01:34:49.380
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you there's places in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>

2130
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:52.320
<v Speaker 2>When I started talking about this about </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago,</v>

2131
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:54.150
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like 2002.</v>

2132
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were very few of these.</v>

2133
01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Now they're all over the country and</v>

2134
01:34:58.110 --> 01:35:02.480
<v Speaker 4>me making videos and talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had one in my basement when I first</v>

2135
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 4>started talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the float lab,</v>

2136
01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.690
<v Speaker 4>where I got mine from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is in Venice,</v>

2137
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:10.220
<v Speaker 4>which is the finest float tanks in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world next to this guy in Austin.</v>

2138
01:35:10.221 --> 01:35:15.221
<v Speaker 4>I was also has amazing one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were basically like almost on </v>

2139
01:35:15.221 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 4>the verge of going out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they're opening up new locations,</v>

2140
01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:19.790
<v Speaker 4>new locations all over the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the world.</v>

2141
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:22.550
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them they have as their option,</v>

2142
01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:27.551
<v Speaker 4>like how did you learn about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan is like one of the options </v>

2143
01:35:27.551 --> 01:35:27.800
<v Speaker 4>because I talk about it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

2144
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.630
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think it should be something that</v>

2145
01:35:29.631 --> 01:35:31.260
<v Speaker 4>everybody should do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>

2146
01:35:31.450 --> 01:35:35.960
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing form of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing relaxation for your body.</v>

2147
01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:40.961
<v Speaker 4>It's an incredible way for your body to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get magnesium because it absorbs it </v>

2148
01:35:40.961 --> 01:35:40.961
<v Speaker 4>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the skin,</v>

2149
01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.290
<v Speaker 4>the epsom salts.</v>

2150
01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.560
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the best ways that your body</v>
<v Speaker 4>can absorb magnesium and it's a hugely </v>

2151
01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:51.221
<v Speaker 4>important for muscle recovery and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>your health and wellness and relaxation.</v>

2152
01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:53.310
<v Speaker 4>It's an incredible experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2153
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:54.500
<v Speaker 4>You heard it here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look,</v>

2154
01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:57.170
<v Speaker 4>if you are a float tank person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to New York.</v>

2155
01:35:57.710 --> 01:35:58.940
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hook it up 100 percent.</v>

2156
01:35:58.941 --> 01:35:59.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to put out the word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

2157
01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.550
<v Speaker 4>We'll put it out on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

2158
01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:03.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't even know these people.</v>

2164
01:36:10.191 --> 01:36:11.600
<v Speaker 4>That's New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2165
01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:12.470
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and I could use a little posts about </v>

2171
01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:27.650
<v Speaker 4>stockers are going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2172
01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:32.651
<v Speaker 4>this is the place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're going to give you the </v>

2173
01:36:32.651 --> 01:36:32.651
<v Speaker 4>address,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fortunately said who will go through</v>

2174
01:36:32.651 --> 01:36:32.651
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

2175
01:36:32.651 --> 01:36:36.970
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be plastic all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>floor and it goes some fucking dexter </v>

2176
01:36:36.970 --> 01:36:36.970
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2177
01:36:36.970 --> 01:36:41.290
<v Speaker 4>when we were talking about the size of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cosmos and how mindblowing all of </v>

2178
01:36:41.290 --> 01:36:41.660
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it reminded me,</v>

2179
01:36:41.690 --> 01:36:46.690
<v Speaker 4>did you see about this Russian </v>
<v Speaker 4>billionaire who has just invested </v>

2180
01:36:46.690 --> 01:36:46.860
<v Speaker 4>$100,000,000?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2181
01:36:48.330 --> 01:36:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

2182
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:50.330
<v Speaker 4>not to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to listen,</v>

2183
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:53.090
<v Speaker 4>to listen in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just needs mushrooms.</v>

2184
01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:58.120
<v Speaker 4>You can meet aliens in an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an hour and 20 minutes so you could be </v>

2185
01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.800
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's got like Stephen Hawking and all</v>

2186
01:36:59.801 --> 01:37:04.801
<v Speaker 4>these amazing people on board to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the biggest injection of cash to </v>

2187
01:37:04.801 --> 01:37:09.101
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the search for extraterrestrial </v>

2188
01:37:09.101 --> 01:37:09.101
<v Speaker 4>intelligence in history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a guy like hockings just like,</v>

2189
01:37:09.101 --> 01:37:09.590
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2190
01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:11.120
<v Speaker 4>if you want to throw some money at </v>
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>

2191
01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:11.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2192
01:37:11.541 --> 01:37:13.730
<v Speaker 4>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just science.</v>

2193
01:37:13.731 --> 01:37:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want innovation,</v>

2194
01:37:15.471 --> 01:37:16.310
<v Speaker 4>you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2195
01:37:16.311 --> 01:37:16.880
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>

2196
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I personally think that there's,</v>

2197
01:37:20.010 --> 01:37:22.830
<v Speaker 4>there's two very distinct possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

2198
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's two that I consider all the </v>

2199
01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:27.880
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them is that this is it,</v>

2200
01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.900
<v Speaker 4>that what we have achieved is </v>
<v Speaker 4>exceedingly rare,</v>

2201
01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:35.020
<v Speaker 4>incredibly rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that if the universe is 13 point 7 </v>

2202
01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.050
<v Speaker 4>billion years old or whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is when it started,</v>

2203
01:37:36.051 --> 01:37:41.051
<v Speaker 4>then it's entirely possible that it took</v>
<v Speaker 4>this long for something to come out of </v>

2204
01:37:41.051 --> 01:37:45.281
<v Speaker 4>it like us and that we are at the front </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the line of the idea of conscious </v>

2205
01:37:46.701 --> 01:37:51.701
<v Speaker 4>life where the only thing that we know </v>
<v Speaker 4>of on this whole planet that's not just </v>

2206
01:37:51.701 --> 01:37:55.571
<v Speaker 4>conscious but conscious and manipulates </v>
<v Speaker 4>its environment to the point where we </v>

2207
01:37:55.571 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 4>can change the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can do all</v>

2208
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:01.070
<v Speaker 2>kinds of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like send videos all to Australia </v>

2209
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.350
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in Australia and I'm here,</v>

2210
01:38:01.570 --> 01:38:06.570
<v Speaker 2>you can send me a text message with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>photograph of you smiling and I'll get </v>

2211
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:06.570
<v Speaker 2>it in a couple of seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2212
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 2>we could be having the same conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're having right now.</v>

2213
01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

2214
01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.630
<v Speaker 2>really clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just madness.</v>

2215
01:38:12.650 --> 01:38:17.650
<v Speaker 2>That's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is entirely possible that we </v>

2216
01:38:17.650 --> 01:38:20.550
<v Speaker 2>are as advanced as intelligent life has </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever gotten ever in the entire universe.</v>

2217
01:38:20.730 --> 01:38:25.730
<v Speaker 2>And that all of our searching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>longing is really just some Alpha </v>

2218
01:38:25.730 --> 01:38:27.690
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee thing where we're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for the daddy.</v>

2219
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:32.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be a god or it might be a king </v>

2220
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:33.720
<v Speaker 2>or it might be a guru or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're always looking for someone to show</v>

2221
01:38:33.721 --> 01:38:35.460
<v Speaker 2>us the way because we know we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way</v>

2222
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:40.910
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that that's the </v>

2223
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.910
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2224
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:44.210
<v Speaker 3>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that life got started here pretty much </v>

2225
01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:47.331
<v Speaker 3>as quickly as it could and it evolved </v>
<v Speaker 3>into our sort of level of consciousness </v>

2226
01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:51.900
<v Speaker 3>as quickly as you would expect it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>given natural selection.</v>

2227
01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 3>So it's true that we could be at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

2228
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:54.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could be sort of the,</v>

2229
01:38:55.430 --> 01:39:00.430
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first intelligent conscious species </v>

2230
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:01.650
<v Speaker 3>in the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that life got kicked off so</v>

2231
01:39:01.651 --> 01:39:06.000
<v Speaker 3>quickly and the fact that we emerged so </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparatively quickly might also suggest</v>

2232
01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.690
<v Speaker 3>that it's woven into the fabric of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmos.</v>

2233
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:11.730
<v Speaker 3>That this is a [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was a really,</v>

2234
01:39:11.731 --> 01:39:12.300
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2235
01:39:12.301 --> 01:39:13.590
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really rare thing,</v>

2236
01:39:13.591 --> 01:39:18.591
<v Speaker 3>then you would have expected the earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a dead gaseous bowl for billions </v>

2237
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:20.220
<v Speaker 3>of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many,</v>

2238
01:39:20.221 --> 01:39:21.870
<v Speaker 3>many more billions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was.</v>

2239
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:23.400
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not convinced by that.</v>

2240
01:39:23.401 --> 01:39:28.401
<v Speaker 3>And I think also you might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>underestimating just how mindbogglingly </v>

2241
01:39:28.401 --> 01:39:31.560
<v Speaker 3>huge the cosmos is and how little access</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it we have,</v>

2242
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:35.430
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that we haven't found </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything yet doesn't mean anything.</v>

2243
01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are a hundred billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars,</v>

2244
01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our galaxy.</v>

2245
01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:42.480
<v Speaker 3>So there are a hundred billion suns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justin,</v>

2246
01:39:42.481 --> 01:39:47.481
<v Speaker 3>our galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are billions of galaxies in </v>

2247
01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:50.601
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single style that we see in the </v>

2248
01:39:50.601 --> 01:39:51.630
<v Speaker 3>night sky is inside our galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's only a tiny,</v>

2249
01:39:51.631 --> 01:39:56.631
<v Speaker 3>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny fraction of our little corner of </v>

2250
01:39:56.631 --> 01:39:56.631
<v Speaker 3>that galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then beyond that galaxy,</v>

2251
01:39:56.631 --> 01:40:00.180
<v Speaker 3>there are innumerable other galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea that we are,</v>

2252
01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:01.650
<v Speaker 3>as Carl Sagan said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2253
01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:06.651
<v Speaker 3>the great scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if were the only intelligent life </v>

2254
01:40:06.651 --> 01:40:07.730
<v Speaker 3>in the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is an awfully large backdrop.</v>

2255
01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why bother?</v>

2256
01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Why is it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no one's saying that we're not,</v>

2257
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:12.770
<v Speaker 2>we're the only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2258
01:40:12.771 --> 01:40:13.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2259
01:40:13.151 --> 01:40:18.151
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there also is the theory that the </v>

2260
01:40:18.151 --> 01:40:20.081
<v Speaker 2>universe is so incredibly large that not</v>
<v Speaker 2>only is there an exact replica of earth </v>

2261
01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:22.490
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but infinity,</v>

2262
01:40:22.491 --> 01:40:23.720
<v Speaker 2>which is what the universe is supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

2263
01:40:23.721 --> 01:40:28.721
<v Speaker 2>Infinite is that not only is there an </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact version of earth out there,</v>

2264
01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:35.080
<v Speaker 2>there's everything that has happened on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this planet in the exact same order up </v>

2265
01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:40.001
<v Speaker 2>to me touching that microphone right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there has happened exactly down to the </v>

2266
01:40:40.001 --> 01:40:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Nanosecond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of times throughout </v>

2267
01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:46.070
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's how big the universe is,</v>

2268
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:49.040
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean that someone's ahead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>

2269
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:50.900
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that it doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2270
01:40:50.901 --> 01:40:55.901
<v Speaker 2>but it does mean that intelligent is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very likely scattered throughout the </v>

2271
01:40:56.021 --> 01:41:01.021
<v Speaker 2>entire cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

2272
01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:03.460
<v Speaker 2>intelligent life has reached a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>past where we are right now.</v>

2273
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:06.140
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't necessarily mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if but,</v>

2274
01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:11.590
<v Speaker 3>but I think that you would be well </v>
<v Speaker 3>advised to believe that it probably has </v>

2275
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:14.060
<v Speaker 3>just because the median is usually a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better assumption then the extremes.</v>

2276
01:41:14.061 --> 01:41:15.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the,</v>

2277
01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.300
<v Speaker 3>the likelihood is that we're not at </v>
<v Speaker 3>either of the,</v>

2278
01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:22.540
<v Speaker 3>either of the very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very extreme that we're not at the very </v>

2279
01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:23.090
<v Speaker 3>first nor the very last civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just statistically,</v>

2280
01:41:23.091 --> 01:41:28.091
<v Speaker 3>if you were just tossing a coin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would expect our civilization to </v>

2281
01:41:28.091 --> 01:41:29.630
<v Speaker 3>just happen to be clustered somewhere on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bell curve in roughly the middle.</v>

2282
01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:33.580
<v Speaker 3>That's just a less anomalous statistical</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to have happened.</v>

2283
01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most certainly.</v>

2284
01:41:34.741 --> 01:41:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not decided on it.</v>

2285
01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a possibility that this is it.</v>

2286
01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:44.010
<v Speaker 2>This is about a smart as anything has </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever gotten ever in the entire existence</v>

2287
01:41:44.011 --> 01:41:47.070
<v Speaker 2>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's depressing or not.</v>

2288
01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Or pretty fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where the ballers or the universe,</v>

2289
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe this,</v>

2290
01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:52.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this system that they're going to put up</v>

2291
01:41:52.921 --> 01:41:54.980
<v Speaker 3>with this brush and billion is money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2292
01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:57.360
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at the end exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be able to do.</v>

2293
01:41:57.361 --> 01:42:00.600
<v Speaker 3>So astronomers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be able to examine 1000</v>

2294
01:42:00.601 --> 01:42:05.601
<v Speaker 3>star systems for any sign of as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>used because apparently radar is a good </v>

2295
01:42:05.601 --> 01:42:08.000
<v Speaker 3>way of telling that someone is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

2296
01:42:08.210 --> 01:42:13.210
<v Speaker 3>may have invented it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to be able to detect a </v>

2297
01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:16.011
<v Speaker 3>laser with the output of an ordinary 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>watt light bulb from $23,000,</v>

2298
01:42:16.921 --> 01:42:21.921
<v Speaker 3>billion miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the distance of the nearest </v>

2299
01:42:21.921 --> 01:42:23.130
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty 3 trillion miles away,</v>

2300
01:42:23.131 --> 01:42:28.131
<v Speaker 3>there'll be able to spot a laser with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wattage of an ordinary household </v>

2301
01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:28.980
<v Speaker 3>bulb.</v>

2302
01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.120
<v Speaker 2>What I was going to say about the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility is the other possibility is </v>

2303
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.571
<v Speaker 2>what I believe we're heading towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now is that we're heading towards </v>

2304
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:41.501
<v Speaker 2>a virtual universe and that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating something with the possibility </v>

2305
01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:46.211
<v Speaker 2>of artificial intelligence and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of living inside of some </v>

2306
01:42:46.211 --> 01:42:49.220
<v Speaker 2>artificial reality that they've created </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your brain interfaces with.</v>

2307
01:42:49.221 --> 01:42:54.221
<v Speaker 2>That there's going to be no need for </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling anywhere or no need even for </v>

2308
01:42:54.221 --> 01:42:57.530
<v Speaker 2>the type of carbon based life </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization that we currently enjoy and</v>

2309
01:42:57.710 --> 01:43:02.710
<v Speaker 2>it won't exist anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we're going to create </v>

2310
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:04.000
<v Speaker 2>artificial life and that the artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is the next stage of evolution.</v>

2311
01:43:04.001 --> 01:43:09.001
<v Speaker 2>And then will we are is some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmic caterpillar that's going to </v>

2312
01:43:09.001 --> 01:43:13.031
<v Speaker 2>become a butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why we're </v>

2313
01:43:13.031 --> 01:43:15.161
<v Speaker 2>so obsessed with shiny brand new laptops</v>
<v Speaker 2>and innovation and beautiful </v>

2314
01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:20.230
<v Speaker 2>materialistic items,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that that has the mechanism and the </v>

2315
01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:22.490
<v Speaker 2>fuel behind creating those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our obsession with these newer,</v>

2316
01:43:22.491 --> 01:43:23.750
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greater things.</v>

2317
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:25.960
<v Speaker 2>It's fueling the creation of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>newer,</v>

2318
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:30.970
<v Speaker 2>better create greater things and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately going to lead to artificial </v>

2319
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:30.970
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

2320
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:31.620
<v Speaker 2>and that's what Elon Musk is.</v>

2321
01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:36.980
<v Speaker 3>That was just about to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at what Elon Musk and Stephen </v>

2322
01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Hawking is saying about if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know Sam Harris,</v>

2323
01:43:37.341 --> 01:43:42.341
<v Speaker 3>who I know is a friend of yours and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>a huge fan of Sam's and I've spoken to </v>

2324
01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:47.081
<v Speaker 3>him on huffpost live about this with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that we are really not </v>

2325
01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:52.660
<v Speaker 3>understanding the potential of creating </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence systems that </v>

2326
01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:57.431
<v Speaker 3>self improve in a way that they end up </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting sort of exponentially more self </v>

2327
01:43:57.431 --> 01:44:01.871
<v Speaker 3>aware until they're actually outsmarting</v>
<v Speaker 3>us and they have in every meaningful </v>

2328
01:44:01.871 --> 01:44:03.680
<v Speaker 3>sense a sense of their own existence in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way that we might.</v>

2329
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:06.680
<v Speaker 3>In the same way that norm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that biological intelligence does.</v>

2330
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:10.670
<v Speaker 3>That is going to be a game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The likes of which,</v>

2331
01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:15.820
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe biology just gets </v>

2332
01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:16.250
<v Speaker 3>extinguished or maybe we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we end up,</v>

2333
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:17.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2334
01:44:17.011 --> 01:44:17.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2335
01:44:17.461 --> 01:44:22.461
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of agnostic on the question of </v>

2336
01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:24.821
<v Speaker 3>whether or not we could ever upload our </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness into a silicon based form</v>

2337
01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.610
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too dumb to make that.</v>

2338
01:44:27.611 --> 01:44:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2339
01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:32.961
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people start going to the </v>

2340
01:44:32.961 --> 01:44:36.630
<v Speaker 2>singularity thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a chance to talk to him for a </v>

2341
01:44:36.630 --> 01:44:37.300
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did an interview with him for Saifai,</v>

2342
01:44:37.301 --> 01:44:42.301
<v Speaker 2>sat down for him with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just me and him chatting about this for </v>

2343
01:44:42.301 --> 01:44:42.301
<v Speaker 2>about an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of it.</v>

2344
01:44:42.301 --> 01:44:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I was fairly convinced that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable,</v>

2345
01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:49.860
<v Speaker 2>fairly convinced that it's like if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at like the invention of the wheel </v>

2346
01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:54.610
<v Speaker 2>and then you look at the Cadillac that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we just showed today and,</v>

2347
01:44:54.611 --> 01:44:59.611
<v Speaker 2>or the mosque sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Tesla is new insane Tesla that he </v>

2348
01:44:59.611 --> 01:45:00.100
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all electric.</v>

2349
01:45:00.101 --> 01:45:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Goes zero to 60 in less than three </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

2350
01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking insane.</v>

2351
01:45:04.601 --> 01:45:06.880
<v Speaker 2>These things that we've created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are just the beginning.</v>

2352
01:45:06.881 --> 01:45:08.200
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to go.</v>

2353
01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think zero to 60 in three seconds.</v>

2354
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:12.160
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's stop right there.</v>

2355
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:12.870
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to.</v>

2356
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:13.600
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to stop,</v>

2357
01:45:13.601 --> 01:45:18.601
<v Speaker 3>but isn't there a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's making a philosophical case as </v>

2358
01:45:18.601 --> 01:45:18.601
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2359
01:45:18.601 --> 01:45:23.011
<v Speaker 3>and this is why I say I'm agnostic about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it because I did philosophy at </v>

2360
01:45:23.011 --> 01:45:27.961
<v Speaker 3>university and one of the big thorny </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions in philosophy of mind is </v>

2361
01:45:27.961 --> 01:45:32.790
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's necessary to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the biological substructure of a of a </v>

2362
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:37.150
<v Speaker 3>brain in order to have a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you disentangle those two things?</v>

2363
01:45:37.151 --> 01:45:42.151
<v Speaker 3>Could the experience of me feeling like </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and feeling like I'm alive be </v>

2364
01:45:42.151 --> 01:45:46.981
<v Speaker 3>disentangled from the biological reality</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my physiology and the gray stuff in </v>

2365
01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:51.220
<v Speaker 3>between my ears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kurzweil's assumption,</v>

2366
01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.370
<v Speaker 3>which is basically just taking on faith </v>
<v Speaker 3>is yes,</v>

2367
01:45:54.371 --> 01:45:59.371
<v Speaker 3>you could disentangle that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could replicate all of the data </v>

2368
01:45:59.371 --> 01:46:02.161
<v Speaker 3>that's whirring around in my head right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now as I'm saying these words as I'm </v>

2369
01:46:02.161 --> 01:46:02.560
<v Speaker 3>sitting here talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could take all of the things that</v>

2370
01:46:02.561 --> 01:46:04.750
<v Speaker 3>are going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the electrical impulses,</v>

2371
01:46:04.751 --> 01:46:06.730
<v Speaker 3>all of those neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of those synapses,</v>

2372
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.830
<v Speaker 3>and you could replicate that in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>

2373
01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.580
<v Speaker 3>Then that computer would be me and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would not just seem like me.</v>

2374
01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:15.340
<v Speaker 3>It would feel like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I would be.</v>

2375
01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:21.360
<v Speaker 3>I could actually be uploaded to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer and you could kill my body and </v>

2376
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I would be existing in some really </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful sense.</v>

2377
01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I would be a model.</v>

2378
01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I think we're entirely too attached to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of me or of us.</v>

2379
01:46:29.530 --> 01:46:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I think we're entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're too attached to the idea of this </v>

2380
01:46:34.530 --> 01:46:36.881
<v Speaker 2>even being a good structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we are so entangled with our </v>

2381
01:46:38.001 --> 01:46:43.001
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so entangled with our our monkey </v>

2382
01:46:43.001 --> 01:46:47.240
<v Speaker 2>needs that we think that these have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would want to be downloaded into a </v>

2383
01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>computer and that computer would be me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would share all my hopes and fears</v>

2384
01:46:50.011 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 2>and dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck would you want those?</v>

2385
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:56.550
<v Speaker 2>And we're gonna have like youtube haters</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are in our artificial world that we</v>

2386
01:46:56.551 --> 01:46:59.310
<v Speaker 2>created and we're going to recreate them</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the exact same way.</v>

2387
01:46:59.510 --> 01:47:04.510
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine the trolls when you're actually </v>

2388
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.510
<v Speaker 3>inside the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside the Matrix.</v>

2389
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm selling,</v>

2390
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:10.390
<v Speaker 2>like haters and jealousy and anger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>misplaced fear and homophobia and the </v>

2391
01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:18.480
<v Speaker 2>the hatred of xenophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different bizarre,</v>

2392
01:47:20.110 --> 01:47:23.410
<v Speaker 2>angry things that we have that make up a</v>
<v Speaker 2>human being.</v>

2393
01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 2>All these nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different strange things that </v>

2394
01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.101
<v Speaker 2>we've sort of just become inexorably </v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to in our culture that we're </v>

2395
01:47:32.101 --> 01:47:34.090
<v Speaker 2>trying to eradicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we never seem to quite do.</v>

2396
01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.850
<v Speaker 2>All of those things are a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey body,</v>

2397
01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that monkey bodies,</v>

2398
01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:41.580
<v Speaker 2>what we're trying to save,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to save that and downloaded</v>

2399
01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:46.620
<v Speaker 2>into consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if we can purify consciousness and </v>

2400
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:49.510
<v Speaker 2>remove it from emotion removed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological need and even sex?</v>

2401
01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:54.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that freaks me out </v>

2402
01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:54.720
<v Speaker 2>about aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I believe in aliens,</v>

2403
01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:57.610
<v Speaker 2>but the the iconic image of the alien is</v>
<v Speaker 2>always sexless.</v>

2404
01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:59.920
<v Speaker 2>They're smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have smooth genitals,</v>

2405
01:48:00.130 --> 01:48:03.370
<v Speaker 2>they have no muscle there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally undefined.</v>

2406
01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:06.070
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell what's a male or a female</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have these enormous heads.</v>

2407
01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that we have this iconic </v>
<v Speaker 2>image because we kind of know and </v>

2408
01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:16.441
<v Speaker 2>understand that ultimately the only way </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to transcend this monkey </v>

2409
01:48:16.441 --> 01:48:20.881
<v Speaker 2>body is to move past all the needs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've sort of automatically associated </v>

2410
01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:26.350
<v Speaker 2>with being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being alive means,</v>

2411
01:48:26.351 --> 01:48:27.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to kind of find food.</v>

2412
01:48:27.961 --> 01:48:32.961
<v Speaker 2>I've got to be a prepper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to make sure that I have canned </v>

2413
01:48:32.961 --> 01:48:32.961
<v Speaker 2>foods and my band water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it goes down?</v>

2414
01:48:32.961 --> 01:48:34.570
<v Speaker 2>I got to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay alive.</v>

2415
01:48:34.571 --> 01:48:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all live.</v>

2416
01:48:36.250 --> 01:48:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It's all about the monkey body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people want to be sexy.</v>

2417
01:48:40.331 --> 01:48:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I've got to get my lips done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're too skinny and one wants a fuck.</v>

2418
01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:47.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that crazy shit that people have in </v>

2419
01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:50.221
<v Speaker 2>their brain is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is monkey body leftover </v>

2420
01:48:50.221 --> 01:48:50.221
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2421
01:48:50.221 --> 01:48:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's an interesting theory </v>

2422
01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:56.251
<v Speaker 3>about why the alien,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the model of the cliched alien is </v>

2423
01:48:56.251 --> 01:48:56.260
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a more,</v>

2424
01:48:56.290 --> 01:49:01.290
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a less advanced conception of humans is </v>

2425
01:49:01.290 --> 01:49:04.000
<v Speaker 3>like Harrier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Racism also plays into this,</v>

2426
01:49:04.001 --> 01:49:05.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darker skinned,</v>

2427
01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:10.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with features that are more kind of </v>

2428
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:10.260
<v Speaker 3>monkey like or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2429
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:14.200
<v Speaker 3>and then the more advanced conceptions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of civilization is white man with his </v>

2430
01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.670
<v Speaker 3>tools and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you extend that,</v>

2431
01:49:15.671 --> 01:49:17.200
<v Speaker 3>if you extrapolate from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yeah.</v>

2432
01:49:17.290 --> 01:49:18.730
<v Speaker 3>More hairless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose,</v>

2433
01:49:18.731 --> 01:49:21.730
<v Speaker 3>less prone to sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less driven by animal desire.</v>

2434
01:49:22.090 --> 01:49:24.640
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge factor in religion.</v>

2435
01:49:24.641 --> 01:49:25.870
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2436
01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:29.800
<v Speaker 3>religions are so hung up about sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's what links us,</v>

2437
01:49:29.801 --> 01:49:32.860
<v Speaker 3>it's what makes us animals and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to think of us as animals.</v>

2438
01:49:32.861 --> 01:49:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Then when I think of us as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>defined,</v>

2439
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:37.630
<v Speaker 3>we are touched by the spark of God in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that no other animal lives according</v>

2440
01:49:37.631 --> 01:49:42.631
<v Speaker 3>to religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to quash six because the </v>

2441
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:42.631
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gluttony,</v>

2442
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:44.600
<v Speaker 3>because those are reminders that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just prime,</v>

2443
01:49:44.601 --> 01:49:44.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2444
01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.830
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the depictions of God,</v>

2445
01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:47.740
<v Speaker 2>he's ripped,</v>

2446
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:51.250
<v Speaker 1>ripped and he's always wearing a robe </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's modest.</v>

2447
01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:54.220
<v Speaker 1>He's reaching over and touching people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His fingers go,</v>

2448
01:49:54.221 --> 01:49:57.010
<v Speaker 1>he's got giant traps and what's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

2449
01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 1>God looks at his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son's looking great on the cross,</v>

2450
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:06.180
<v Speaker 1>beaten to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's got abs and really watch for a </v>

2451
01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:08.260
<v Speaker 1>dice was for a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was living in the Middle East 2000 years</v>

2452
01:50:08.261 --> 01:50:09.890
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but skin of bronze,</v>

2453
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:12.520
<v Speaker 1>hair of wool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

2454
01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:13.210
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2455
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:16.210
<v Speaker 1>the other possibility of a black planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chuck d was right.</v>

2456
01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:17.140
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

2457
01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at God.</v>

2458
01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude on the left hind a little </v>

2459
01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:23.400
<v Speaker 1>robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying,</v>

2460
01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 1>not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why even draw it?</v>

2461
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 1>You might as well just make him an alien</v>
<v Speaker 1>with no genitals.</v>

2462
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:29.140
<v Speaker 1>People back then just had little or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick's.</v>

2463
01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>

2464
01:50:31.631 --> 01:50:35.490
<v Speaker 1>but I've always just assumed that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the modesty of the artist like it.</v>

2465
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.560
<v Speaker 1>It kind of changed the frame of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of God reaching down and </v>

2466
01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:44.941
<v Speaker 1>touching men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If men had a massive schlong just </v>

2467
01:50:44.941 --> 01:50:44.941
<v Speaker 1>hanging down his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2468
01:50:44.941 --> 01:50:47.230
<v Speaker 1>it would be distracting if you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant John Holmes Hog,</v>

2469
01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.350
<v Speaker 1>but look how big the muscles are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>

2470
01:50:50.351 --> 01:50:55.351
<v Speaker 1>Like these guys have to be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossfitting all day as well as being </v>

2471
01:50:55.351 --> 01:51:00.001
<v Speaker 1>divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy on the left is doing a </v>

2472
01:51:00.001 --> 01:51:01.180
<v Speaker 1>lot of fucking weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not a regular body.</v>

2473
01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:04.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a body of someone who's picking </v>
<v Speaker 1>up heavy shit all day long,</v>

2474
01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's got a skinny neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he's never been choked.</v>

2475
01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not a guy who knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of a choke.</v>

2476
01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:15.340
<v Speaker 1>No Little Dick Skinny neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but giant fucking biceps,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weight lifting for </v>

2478
01:51:20.670 --> 01:51:23.401
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine </v>

2479
01:51:23.401 --> 01:51:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Chapel and look at the bizarre image of </v>
<v Speaker 1>God being supported by Cherubs.</v>

2480
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So weird people are religion.</v>

2484
01:51:36.461 --> 01:51:39.730
<v Speaker 1>but God on the ceiling of the Sistine </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chapel looks a bit like Meryl Streep.</v>

2485
01:51:46.330 --> 01:51:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Meryl Streep with a bad because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of got breasts and he's,</v>

2486
01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:54.540
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing like a nice white robe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like an old American actor and </v>

2487

<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his fucking name </v>

2496
01:52:11.530 --> 01:52:12.940
<v Speaker 1>That dude's getting all the love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2497
01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:14.920
<v Speaker 1>fuck that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a little Dick.</v>

2498
01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Look at her face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not filled with love.</v>

2499
01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:19.750
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2500
01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:22.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

2501
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:27.750
<v Speaker 1>on that question of the evolution of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humans creating like maybe,</v>

2502
01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:32.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe computers and artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence of the next stage and maybe</v>

2503
01:52:32.111 --> 01:52:37.111
<v Speaker 1>that's maybe the universe is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like artificial intelligence that isn't </v>

2504
01:52:37.111 --> 01:52:41.521
<v Speaker 1>sending out the signals that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for when we're looking for </v>

2505
01:52:41.521 --> 01:52:41.521
<v Speaker 1>biological intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2506
01:52:41.521 --> 01:52:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't need right as anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't need to be losing laces </v>

2507
01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:45.240
<v Speaker 1>because they were all in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2508
01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 1>in computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

2509
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:51.070
<v Speaker 3>other possibility which is similar to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and which is very depressing and </v>

2510
01:52:51.070 --> 01:52:54.491
<v Speaker 3>which I don't particularly like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that once a species becomes capable </v>

2511
01:52:54.491 --> 01:52:57.950
<v Speaker 3>of destroying itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they usually do,</v>

2512
01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.760
<v Speaker 3>like you can't get beyond like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2513
01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:05.800
<v Speaker 3>you're not responsible enough to be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to handle the kind of industrial scale </v>

2514
01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:09.760
<v Speaker 3>destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destructive capacity that we now have </v>

2515
01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.610
<v Speaker 3>with nuclear weapons and with coal fired</v>
<v Speaker 3>power plants.</v>

2516
01:53:10.611 --> 01:53:15.611
<v Speaker 3>And with all of our ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so successful as a species that </v>

2517
01:53:15.611 --> 01:53:17.240
<v Speaker 3>were successful enough to destroy </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves,</v>

2518
01:53:17.241 --> 01:53:22.241
<v Speaker 3>but not yet wise enough not to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe that's a trap that lots </v>

2519
01:53:22.241 --> 01:53:26.750
<v Speaker 3>of species fall into as they try to pass</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the crucible of going from being</v>

2520
01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:31.810
<v Speaker 3>ordinary animals to hyper-intelligent a </v>
<v Speaker 3>self self-aware animals,</v>

2521
01:53:32.691 --> 01:53:37.010
<v Speaker 3>but then on the way they invent tools </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they aren't yet mature enough to be</v>

2522
01:53:37.011 --> 01:53:39.740
<v Speaker 3>able to handle properly and they end up </v>
<v Speaker 3>wiping themselves out.</v>

2523
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly possible.</v>

2524
01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And if we look at the universe as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite,</v>

2525
01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.920
<v Speaker 2>the infinite possibilities exist as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2526
01:53:45.921 --> 01:53:50.921
<v Speaker 2>So probably all the pitfalls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the things that we avoid it,</v>

2527
01:53:51.191 --> 01:53:56.191
<v Speaker 2>like the Cuban missile crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they didn't avoid and maybe they </v>

2528
01:53:56.191 --> 01:53:57.980
<v Speaker 2>were wiped out and maybe they did toxify</v>
<v Speaker 2>their atmosphere to the point where they</v>

2529
01:53:57.981 --> 01:54:02.981
<v Speaker 2>didn't recover for hundreds of thousands</v>
<v Speaker 2>of years and mutants and freaks barely </v>

2530
01:54:02.981 --> 01:54:03.090
<v Speaker 2>made it by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2531
01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:06.350
<v Speaker 2>running from hybrid wolves that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking glowing red eyes.</v>

2532
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what has been done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2533
01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So what kind of genetic engineering has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been done on these planets?</v>

2534
01:54:11.481 --> 01:54:14.240
<v Speaker 2>It's been run amok and fucked everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the movie.</v>

2535
01:54:14.241 --> 01:54:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we in what version of what we've done in</v>

2536
01:54:17.241 --> 01:54:22.241
<v Speaker 2>Australia with foxes and rabbits is out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of control nature experiments that have </v>

2537
01:54:23.811 --> 01:54:27.320
<v Speaker 2>really gone all fucked up wolves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Idaho that are out of control,</v>

2538
01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:32.680
<v Speaker 2>how much of that has been done in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other places as well as genetically </v>

2539
01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.760
<v Speaker 2>modifying things to the point where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work anymore.</v>

2540
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:36.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also possible.</v>

2541
01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's sort of staggering to me is </v>

2542
01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.240
<v Speaker 3>getting an insight into how recently we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have invented all of this stuff and </v>

2543
01:54:44.251 --> 01:54:45.940
<v Speaker 3>change the world like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was,</v>

2544
01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:51.280
<v Speaker 3>I was in Athens during the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>financial crisis just in the week after </v>

2545
01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:55.701
<v Speaker 3>they had the big no vote was the week </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it really looked like grace was </v>

2546
01:54:55.701 --> 01:54:56.370
<v Speaker 3>going to crash out of the eurozone about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2547
01:54:56.371 --> 01:54:58.860
<v Speaker 3>four or five weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2548
01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:01.970
<v Speaker 3>we went to the Acropolis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Parthenon because you know,</v>

2549
01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:05.310
<v Speaker 3>that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was standing there in the museum,</v>

2550
01:55:05.311 --> 01:55:10.311
<v Speaker 3>like looking at all this stuff and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>struck not so much by how incredibly </v>

2551
01:55:10.311 --> 01:55:14.991
<v Speaker 3>ancient it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is the birthplace of </v>

2552
01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:14.991
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2553
01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:14.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where it all began.</v>

2554
01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:16.440
<v Speaker 3>This is the birthplace of Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization basically,</v>

2555
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:20.580
<v Speaker 3>but I was amazed at how actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparatively recent that is.</v>

2556
01:55:20.610 --> 01:55:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Like I was saying earlier that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandmother just died.</v>

2557
01:55:22.621 --> 01:55:25.650
<v Speaker 3>She was a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can conceive of her lifetime.</v>

2558
01:55:25.651 --> 01:55:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew her like that's a long lifetime,</v>

2559
01:55:29.071 --> 01:55:32.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's not inconceivably long as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time.</v>

2560
01:55:32.190 --> 01:55:33.990
<v Speaker 3>She was born before the roaring </v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties.</v>

2561
01:55:33.991 --> 01:55:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:55:35.070 --> 01:55:40.070
<v Speaker 3>She was born in Nineteen 15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was born during the Gallipoli </v>

2563
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:41.510
<v Speaker 3>campaign in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2564
01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:46.580
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a span time that I can wrap my </v>

2565
01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:48.981
<v Speaker 3>head around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have 30 or 40 of those and you're </v>

2566
01:55:48.981 --> 01:55:52.641
<v Speaker 3>back at the Acropolis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right on the banks of the birthplace of </v>

2567
01:55:52.641 --> 01:55:52.641
<v Speaker 3>Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not a number.</v>

2568
01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:57.860
<v Speaker 3>That's like the hundred billion stars in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the galaxy that I can't wrap my head </v>

2569
01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:01.820
<v Speaker 3>even begin to wrap my head around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a number like the billions of </v>

2570
01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:02.070
<v Speaker 3>years that the earth is all that I can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrap my head around.</v>

2571
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a very measurable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understandable thing.</v>

2572
01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:10.610
<v Speaker 3>The birth of Western civilization is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just 30 or 40 of my grandmother's long </v>

2573
01:56:10.610 --> 01:56:15.260
<v Speaker 3>and then think about the fact that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>she was born there were no nuclear </v>

2574
01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:15.260
<v Speaker 3>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was no nuclear power.</v>

2575
01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:16.650
<v Speaker 3>We haven't discovered any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2576
01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:19.020
<v Speaker 3>This is so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>

2577
01:56:19.021 --> 01:56:21.330
<v Speaker 3>We have the privilege of being the </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation,</v>

2578
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:25.220
<v Speaker 3>the couple of generations that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>witnessing the,</v>

2579
01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:29.280
<v Speaker 3>the dawn of the beginning of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily new,</v>

2580
01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:34.580
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the capacity to destroy ourselves using </v>

2581
01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:37.011
<v Speaker 3>nukes and environmental degradation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>be the rise of artificial intelligence </v>

2582
01:56:37.011 --> 01:56:39.060
<v Speaker 3>and in computing and mobilization.</v>

2583
01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:40.840
<v Speaker 2>You look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Acropolis,</v>

2584
01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:44.050
<v Speaker 2>the parthenon was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Acropolis is the building,</v>

2585
01:56:44.051 --> 01:56:45.040
<v Speaker 2>right and the Parthenon is</v>

2586
01:56:45.190 --> 01:56:48.610
<v Speaker 3>built on the Acropolis is the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing I think,</v>

2587
01:56:48.611 --> 01:56:50.050
<v Speaker 3>and I think the Parthenon is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

2588
01:56:50.051 --> 01:56:51.850
<v Speaker 3>Am I getting that back to front?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure,</v>

2589
01:56:51.970 --> 01:56:52.630
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

2590
01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:57.780
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is when you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek scholars and they talk about the </v>

2591
01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:00.820
<v Speaker 2>construction of the building on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was built on Samba,</v>

2592
01:57:00.850 --> 01:57:04.540
<v Speaker 2>something that was even more ancient and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't exactly know who built.</v>

2593
01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:08.500
<v Speaker 2>They don't exactly know who built the </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform that fucker was put on and then</v>

2594
01:57:08.501 --> 01:57:13.501
<v Speaker 2>you go back to crazy things like Baalbek</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Lebanon where they have these </v>

2595
01:57:13.501 --> 01:57:17.641
<v Speaker 2>enormous stone things that thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of tons and </v>

2596
01:57:18.161 --> 01:57:18.460
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2597
01:57:18.461 --> 01:57:19.960
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck bill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd they build these?</v>

2598
01:57:19.961 --> 01:57:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Would they do with these where these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things fucking come from?</v>

2599
01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:27.060
<v Speaker 2>And they really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that brings up the possibility that </v>

2600
01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:30.070
<v Speaker 2>we haven't had a linear progression from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man to this,</v>

2601
01:57:30.190 --> 01:57:34.000
<v Speaker 2>but we've had these ups and downs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been at partially wiped out.</v>

2602
01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:39.660
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a series of super volcanoes all </v>

2603
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:42.391
<v Speaker 2>over the world and one big one being in </v>
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone that everyone's terrified </v>

2604
01:57:42.391 --> 01:57:42.391
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's one of them,</v>

2605
01:57:42.391 --> 01:57:47.281
<v Speaker 2>I believe in Indonesia that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain theory that links to a massive </v>

2606
01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:51.490
<v Speaker 2>eruption of this supervolcano 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

2607
01:57:51.730 --> 01:57:55.270
<v Speaker 2>That is the reason why we all share </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2608
01:57:55.290 --> 01:57:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so little genetic diversity.</v>

2609
01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And they believed that we might have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been down to a few thousand people </v>

2610
01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:04.990
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

2611
01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:07.110
<v Speaker 3>We were down to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean scientists,</v>

2612
01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:10.410
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary biologists can tell that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were down to,</v>

2613
01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's as low as that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly,</v>

2614
01:58:12.810 --> 01:58:16.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and I know when that was,</v>

2615
01:58:16.441 --> 01:58:21.441
<v Speaker 3>but I remember you mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Supervolcano last time I was on this </v>

2616
01:58:21.441 --> 01:58:22.440
<v Speaker 3>show and then I went and googled it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2617
01:58:22.441 --> 01:58:24.720
<v Speaker 3>and it was like a probably didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

2618
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Like most of the expert sites that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went and looked at was like,</v>

2619
01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:33.170
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of one of those sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory things that we don't </v>

2620
01:58:33.170 --> 01:58:36.291
<v Speaker 3>actually think happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whether or not it was that </v>

2621
01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:36.291
<v Speaker 3>particular Indonesian super volcano or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2622
01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:38.670
<v Speaker 3>we do know that there have been periods </v>
<v Speaker 3>where humankind has,</v>

2623
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 3>has almost gone extinct and we've just </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten through that.</v>

2624
01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings have been in this form for </v>

2625
01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:47.720
<v Speaker 4>who knows how long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2626
01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:50.560
<v Speaker 4>like a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it's been there without a doubt</v>

2627
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.380
<v Speaker 4>has been an eruption of yellowstone in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that time period.</v>

2628
01:58:53.410 --> 01:58:57.280
<v Speaker 4>So if there were human beings in North </v>
<v Speaker 4>America 600,000</v>

2629
01:58:57.281 --> 01:59:00.970
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those fuckers were cooked and we're do.</v>

2630
01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:02.980
<v Speaker 4>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every six to 800,000</v>

2631
01:59:02.981 --> 01:59:07.981
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yellowstone blows and it is a continent </v>

2632
01:59:07.981 --> 01:59:10.441
<v Speaker 4>killer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will fuck up everything in the </v>

2633
01:59:10.441 --> 01:59:11.470
<v Speaker 4>continent and caused some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear winter effect to a vast majority</v>

2634
01:59:11.471 --> 01:59:12.880
<v Speaker 4>of the world except maybe like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>

2635
01:59:13.390 --> 01:59:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Australian passport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to scrape back to the </v>

2636
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Homeland New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go and kill some foxes.</v>

2637
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:23.010
<v Speaker 4>That might be the spot to spot because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a real but didn't have to deal </v>

2638
01:59:23.171 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 4>with what they're doing at [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>dot com.</v>

2639
01:59:24.551 --> 01:59:29.551
<v Speaker 4>That poor bastard Kim got.com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what's going on with him </v>

2640
01:59:29.551 --> 01:59:33.541
<v Speaker 4>with that Mega upload site and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to extradite him to a country </v>

2641
01:59:33.541 --> 01:59:34.000
<v Speaker 4>that he's not even from.</v>

2642
01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.160
<v Speaker 4>Show him that this was a super </v>
<v Speaker 4>volcanoes.</v>

2643
01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Valpo is an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said what we're looking at here for </v>

2644
01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:43.120
<v Speaker 4>people who are listening to the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>is yellowstone and then turbo,</v>

2645
01:59:43.121 --> 01:59:45.340
<v Speaker 4>which looks like it's in Indonesia and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tampa,</v>

2646
01:59:45.341 --> 01:59:49.270
<v Speaker 4>which is was a mega volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so tell my uncle actually is a.</v>

2647
01:59:49.330 --> 01:59:52.330
<v Speaker 4>is like a melody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have maddy on my side.</v>

2648
01:59:52.331 --> 01:59:52.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

2649
01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:54.210
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2650
01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:56.440
<v Speaker 4>those crazy face tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a tattoo on my back,</v>

2651
01:59:56.441 --> 02:00:01.441
<v Speaker 4>which is a symbol and to tempo is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is an old extinct volcano when it blew,</v>

2652
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:10.470
<v Speaker 4>they will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are writings of people in Italy </v>

2653
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:12.991
<v Speaker 4>talking about how the sunset is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how like the sky is red at sunset and </v>

2654
02:00:12.991 --> 02:00:16.060
<v Speaker 4>that's because of the ash from a volcano</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the opposite side of the world and is</v>

2655
02:00:16.061 --> 02:00:21.061
<v Speaker 4>currently a crater that is so big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a lake that you can reach a </v>

2656
02:00:21.061 --> 02:00:22.330
<v Speaker 4>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like huge.</v>

2657
02:00:22.330 --> 02:00:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that whole thing was just a stream </v>

2658
02:00:27.330 --> 02:00:30.691
<v Speaker 4>of lava just exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's you can you stand on the side </v>

2659
02:00:30.701 --> 02:00:35.701
<v Speaker 4>of the lake and you're like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even imagine what kind of </v>

2660
02:00:35.701 --> 02:00:36.880
<v Speaker 4>Armageddon that must've been back when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was active.</v>

2661
02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our stability,</v>

2662
02:00:38.081 --> 02:00:43.081
<v Speaker 4>the stability that we've enjoyed over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the past several thousand years that </v>

2663
02:00:43.081 --> 02:00:44.410
<v Speaker 4>people have written about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean other than,</v>

2664
02:00:44.490 --> 02:00:49.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the one that happened in Rome </v>

2665
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:51.470
<v Speaker 4>or what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was it based on pay?</v>

2666
02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:52.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Pompei one,</v>

2667
02:00:52.901 --> 02:00:57.901
<v Speaker 4>which was a fairly famous because we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually found people that were killed </v>

2668
02:00:57.901 --> 02:00:59.170
<v Speaker 4>and we could see their bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2669
02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:04.200
<v Speaker 4>there's an exhibit somewhere where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the bodies of the people from palm </v>

2670
02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.730
<v Speaker 4>pay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the preserved ones on display somewhere.</v>

2671
02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:09.910
<v Speaker 4>What's supposed to be really freaky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

2672
02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:15.280
<v Speaker 4>that was a major,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a minor one in comparison to </v>

2673
02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:15.280
<v Speaker 4>yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even.</v>

2674
02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:19.030
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the people that were fucking </v>

2675
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.030
<v Speaker 4>frozen in time and cooked and killed by </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2676
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:22.150
<v Speaker 4>It's just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are actual real human beings.</v>

2677
02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:27.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like some claymation animated </v>

2678
02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:27.460
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

2679
02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:30.190
<v Speaker 4>But the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they believe is that,</v>

2680
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:31.780
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't even know.</v>

2681
02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:36.870
<v Speaker 4>Here's another thing they didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>know about yellowstone until they </v>

2682
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:39.721
<v Speaker 4>started looking at it from satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had no idea it was a Caldera </v>

2683
02:01:39.721 --> 02:01:43.780
<v Speaker 4>volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew that there was some sort of </v>

2684
02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:44.780
<v Speaker 4>thermal activity because of old </v>
<v Speaker 4>faithful.</v>

2685
02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:47.330
<v Speaker 4>They knew there was some lava going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>under there,</v>

2686
02:01:47.331 --> 02:01:52.331
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't know how big the thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>was until they started looking at it </v>

2687
02:01:52.331 --> 02:01:53.090
<v Speaker 4>with satellite imagery and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize what,</v>

2688
02:01:53.091 --> 02:01:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2689
02:01:53.841 --> 02:01:54.350
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2690
02:01:54.351 --> 02:01:59.351
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This thing is like 600 kilometers wide </v>

2691
02:01:59.351 --> 02:02:03.520
<v Speaker 4>and what it is is a mountain that </v>
<v Speaker 4>explodes and leaves this crater and </v>

2692
02:02:05.121 --> 02:02:06.350
<v Speaker 4>that's what it called dairy is.</v>

2693
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:10.540
<v Speaker 4>It reaches this explosion and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain fly.</v>

2694
02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:15.580
<v Speaker 4>You got 300 mile wide mountain shoots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lava up into the sky and just kills </v>

2695
02:02:16.131 --> 02:02:19.130
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything anywhere on the west coast.</v>

2696
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:21.890
<v Speaker 4>All this is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny how we have a kind of.</v>

2697
02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.920
<v Speaker 4>There's a sort of cognitive dissonance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It comes back to what we were talking </v>

2698
02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:29.441
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about like the doors of perception and </v>

2699
02:02:29.441 --> 02:02:31.331
<v Speaker 4>how our brains are forced by evolution </v>
<v Speaker 4>and to keep us in a very narrow mindset </v>

2700
02:02:31.331 --> 02:02:35.741
<v Speaker 4>where we don't think about the reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what's going on around us and how </v>

2701
02:02:35.741 --> 02:02:39.730
<v Speaker 4>vast everything is and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I think sometimes about like my </v>

2702
02:02:39.730 --> 02:02:44.171
<v Speaker 4>friends who live in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>San Francisco is going to be devastated </v>

2703
02:02:44.171 --> 02:02:48.101
<v Speaker 4>by a massive earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just gonna happen when this to La.</v>

2704
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:52.790
<v Speaker 4>San Francisco goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look at you.</v>

2705
02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>San Francisco goes,</v>

2706
02:02:55.591 --> 02:02:56.780
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be awful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but oh yeah,</v>

2707
02:02:56.781 --> 02:03:00.720
<v Speaker 4>but he's gonna go to La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is Ballet as being no las.</v>

2708
02:03:00.850 --> 02:03:05.850
<v Speaker 4>He's saying much San Francisco is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>innovation Langley to be to be more </v>

2709
02:03:07.911 --> 02:03:09.110
<v Speaker 4>devastated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>likable,</v>

2710
02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:11.170
<v Speaker 4>more likable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more technical,</v>

2711
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:16.330
<v Speaker 4>having wood's put in my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a paranoid paranoid or you,</v>

2712
02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:19.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so anyhow,</v>

2713
02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:21.300
<v Speaker 4>at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is great.</v>

2714
02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:24.010
<v Speaker 4>That's what I felt like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2715
02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:29.110
<v Speaker 4>we know this is going to happen and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>all go about our daily lives and we </v>

2716
02:03:29.110 --> 02:03:32.111
<v Speaker 4>don't pay any attention to it because we</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't because we would be paralyzed </v>

2717
02:03:32.111 --> 02:03:32.390
<v Speaker 4>if we kept thinking isn't going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

2718
02:03:32.391 --> 02:03:33.920
<v Speaker 4>is it going to be tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we'd just be.</v>

2719
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:35.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's OCD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2720
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:40.990
<v Speaker 4>So we are forced to go through life not </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrecking will not actually reckoning </v>

2721
02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:44.771
<v Speaker 4>with the fact that that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen and yellowstone is going to </v>

2722
02:03:44.771 --> 02:03:47.591
<v Speaker 4>happen and all kinds of stuff's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go down and there's not a thing we can </v>

2723
02:03:47.591 --> 02:03:47.810
<v Speaker 4>do about it then.</v>

2724
02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:51.800
<v Speaker 4>Then there's asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>asteroidal impacts of the big one,</v>

2725
02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:56.860
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the evidence that they're finding </v>

2726
02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:58.601
<v Speaker 4>now about all the different impact </v>
<v Speaker 4>craters that they have ignored or not,</v>

2727
02:03:58.671 --> 02:04:02.210
<v Speaker 4>not been aware of until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The discovery of what they called,</v>

2728
02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:04.820
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called Triton nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nuclear glass,</v>

2729
02:04:04.821 --> 02:04:09.821
<v Speaker 4>that that exists on nuclear test sites </v>
<v Speaker 4>and also made meteor a meteor impacts </v>

2730
02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:15.170
<v Speaker 4>that they've founded all throughout Asia</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all throughout other parts of Europe</v>

2731
02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:20.380
<v Speaker 4>from 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago and they think that that </v>

2732
02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.871
<v Speaker 4>coincided with the end of the ice age at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the end of the ice age or might have </v>

2733
02:04:22.871 --> 02:04:26.201
<v Speaker 4>been instigated by massive astro </v>
<v Speaker 4>asteroids and impacts all over the world</v>

2734
02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:30.110
<v Speaker 4>like 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

2735
02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:35.500
<v Speaker 4>That might have been why there is this </v>
<v Speaker 4>really old structures that are sort of </v>

2736
02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:38.700
<v Speaker 4>unexplained and this sort of resurgence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of civilization.</v>

2737
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere around the 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>year mark that we have this big </v>

2738
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:44.520
<v Speaker 2>downfall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People start figuring things out again,</v>

2739
02:04:44.521 --> 02:04:46.560
<v Speaker 2>just like if you go back 2000 years from</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2740
02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:48.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about Greece,</v>

2741
02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:53.420
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about ancient Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then 2000 years later you have New </v>

2742
02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:53.420
<v Speaker 2>York City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2743
02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2000 years after this media,</v>

2744
02:04:55.111 --> 02:04:58.920
<v Speaker 2>real media in most terrible words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using girl.</v>

2745
02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to say like a weather </v>

2746
02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:04.420
<v Speaker 2>reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jet Lags triploid along flat.</v>

2747
02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asteroidal and I'm drinking now.</v>

2748
02:05:05.221 --> 02:05:07.170
<v Speaker 2>You've had a half beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all I need.</v>

2749
02:05:07.530 --> 02:05:11.100
<v Speaker 2>New.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this fucking Nuevo New Mexican beer?</v>

2750
02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

2751
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they think that it's very possible </v>

2752
02:05:16.810 --> 02:05:17.460
<v Speaker 2>that civilization has experienced many </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these.</v>

2753
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what Graham Hancock is based,</v>

2754
02:05:19.381 --> 02:05:21.900
<v Speaker 2>like a tremendous amount of his work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're aware of him,</v>

2755
02:05:21.901 --> 02:05:25.770
<v Speaker 2>but he's a good friend and he wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book called fingerprints of the Gods.</v>

2756
02:05:25.771 --> 02:05:30.771
<v Speaker 2>It's based on exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this evidence that shows that their </v>

2757
02:05:30.771 --> 02:05:35.120
<v Speaker 2>civilization has experienced these peaks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and valleys and that things have </v>

2758
02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:39.111
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there have been some resets and it </v>

2759
02:05:39.111 --> 02:05:40.170
<v Speaker 2>hasn't been as simple as people figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>out fire.</v>

2760
02:05:40.171 --> 02:05:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Then they figured out they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here we are today in New York City.</v>

2761
02:05:44.650 --> 02:05:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I mentioned it last time</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the podcast or not,</v>

2762
02:05:47.951 --> 02:05:52.951
<v Speaker 3>but there's an amazing kind of study and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an amazing article about this </v>

2763
02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:59.050
<v Speaker 3>sort of research which is if society </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapses and we still have nuclear </v>

2764
02:05:59.501 --> 02:06:04.501
<v Speaker 3>waste in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we mark our nuclear waste sites </v>

2765
02:06:04.501 --> 02:06:07.030
<v Speaker 3>such that a future civilization who has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's completely from us?</v>

2766
02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't speak our language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has no more records of anything that </v>

2767
02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:13.150
<v Speaker 3>went on so that they don't go and hurt </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves by digging it up,</v>

2768
02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:18.360
<v Speaker 3>and so there's the actual there a </v>
<v Speaker 3>semiotician and like all these people </v>

2769
02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:21.811
<v Speaker 3>who study the nature of symbols and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>and of conscious interpretation of the </v>

2770
02:06:21.811 --> 02:06:26.461
<v Speaker 3>ways that we communicate and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>who have got these crazy ideas like </v>

2771
02:06:26.461 --> 02:06:30.361
<v Speaker 3>putting up these big kind of structures </v>
<v Speaker 3>that look like big scary angled polls </v>

2772
02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:36.240
<v Speaker 3>that get deeper and deeper and thicker </v>
<v Speaker 3>and thicker as you get towards the site </v>

2773
02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:39.751
<v Speaker 3>of where the nuclear waste is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>stored to try to indicate to future </v>

2774
02:06:39.751 --> 02:06:40.510
<v Speaker 3>intelligent civilizations.</v>

2775
02:06:40.810 --> 02:06:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Not to go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the conclusion that they always</v>

2776
02:06:43.781 --> 02:06:47.380
<v Speaker 3>reach is they're just going to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be interested in it.</v>

2777
02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:48.870
<v Speaker 3>They're going to want to explore it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2778
02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:51.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like if even if they understood </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2779
02:06:51.431 --> 02:06:54.520
<v Speaker 3>we're saying that there is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>invisible radioactive stuff.</v>

2780
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 3>If they haven't yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like devise the concept of nuclear </v>

2781
02:06:59.790 --> 02:07:02.971
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they're just going to treat it the </v>

2782
02:07:02.971 --> 02:07:02.971
<v Speaker 3>way that we treat the warnings on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids saying,</v>

2783
02:07:02.971 --> 02:07:07.741
<v Speaker 3>don't go into the mummies because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you'll get a tech by spirits were </v>

2784
02:07:07.741 --> 02:07:07.741
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2785
02:07:07.741 --> 02:07:11.131
<v Speaker 3>that was a nice fun thing for you to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>you old fashioned people in ancient </v>

2786
02:07:11.131 --> 02:07:14.791
<v Speaker 3>civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to go in and open the </v>

2787
02:07:14.791 --> 02:07:16.891
<v Speaker 3>tomb anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the conclusion was don't do </v>

2788
02:07:16.891 --> 02:07:16.891
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't mock it at all.</v>

2789
02:07:16.891 --> 02:07:21.781
<v Speaker 3>Don't try to communicate it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>human curiosity is always going to be </v>

2790
02:07:21.781 --> 02:07:21.781
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even human curiosity.</v>

2791
02:07:21.781 --> 02:07:23.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like whatever this future species </v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

2792
02:07:23.841 --> 02:07:28.841
<v Speaker 3>curiosity is going to be more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>than any warning that we could possibly </v>

2793
02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:33.630
<v Speaker 3>give them because this stuff last for </v>
<v Speaker 3>tens sometimes hundreds of thousands of </v>

2794
02:07:33.630 --> 02:07:33.630
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2795
02:07:33.630 --> 02:07:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really fucked up that whole nuclear </v>

2796
02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:39.271
<v Speaker 2>power thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to explain to someone who </v>

2797
02:07:39.271 --> 02:07:41.571
<v Speaker 2>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a pretty staunch conservative and </v>

2798
02:07:41.571 --> 02:07:42.040
<v Speaker 2>he was saying how clean nuclear power is</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively.</v>

2799
02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:45.190
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you understand that nuclear power has</v>

2800
02:07:45.191 --> 02:07:50.191
<v Speaker 2>only been around since the 19 forties </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we already in this brief moment of </v>

2801
02:07:50.191 --> 02:07:54.661
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already have three spots that we can </v>

2802
02:07:54.661 --> 02:07:55.300
<v Speaker 2>never go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're done like,</v>

2803
02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Chernobyl is done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked,</v>

2804
02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:01.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Fukushima is fucked.</v>

2805
02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:03.420
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2806
02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:05.350
<v Speaker 2>there was the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mile island,</v>

2807
02:08:05.351 --> 02:08:07.830
<v Speaker 2>three mile island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever it,</v>

2808
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:11.110
<v Speaker 2>it was really fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2809
02:08:11.170 --> 02:08:14.560
<v Speaker 2>But that's still three spots that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up already.</v>

2810
02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Never to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even to mention all the ones that </v>

2811
02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:20.110
<v Speaker 2>are based in the same technology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fukushima was.</v>

2812
02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:22.390
<v Speaker 2>When they can't really shut them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2813
02:08:22.410 --> 02:08:27.410
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these archaic fucking nuclear </v>

2814
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:28.300
<v Speaker 2>power plants they build when they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand nuclear power plants.</v>

2815
02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of pebble shell reactors </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that?</v>

2816
02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pebble.</v>

2817
02:08:33.731 --> 02:08:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see if I can find.</v>

2818
02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Because there is apparently a type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reactor now where if anything goes </v>

2819
02:08:40.541 --> 02:08:42.340
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it automatically shuts down.</v>

2820
02:08:42.341 --> 02:08:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a physiological thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were they having a,</v>

2821
02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:49.900
<v Speaker 3>it's called a pebble bed reactors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a graphite moderated gas cooled nuclear </v>

2822
02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:51.970
<v Speaker 3>reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's apparently,</v>

2823
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I believe scientists when they say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are new types of reactors that are</v>

2824
02:08:56.771 --> 02:09:01.771
<v Speaker 3>basically meltdown proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My concern is I just think it's so </v>

2825
02:09:02.261 --> 02:09:04.890
<v Speaker 3>woefully irresponsible to do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2826
02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:06.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>producers waste,</v>

2827
02:09:06.481 --> 02:09:11.481
<v Speaker 3>fits incredibly deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna last for thousands and </v>

2828
02:09:11.481 --> 02:09:15.841
<v Speaker 3>thousands of times longer than any of us</v>
<v Speaker 3>or any of our children or any of our </v>

2829
02:09:15.841 --> 02:09:19.951
<v Speaker 3>grandchildren or great grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be around and just leave it up </v>

2830
02:09:19.951 --> 02:09:20.290
<v Speaker 3>to other people to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hear conservatives,</v>

2831
02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:22.030
<v Speaker 3>so a pro nuclear people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2832
02:09:22.031 --> 02:09:23.470
<v Speaker 3>we'll figure it out eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2833
02:09:23.471 --> 02:09:28.471
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not use nuclear power until we </v>

2834
02:09:28.471 --> 02:09:28.471
<v Speaker 3>figure it out then because otherwise you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2835
02:09:28.471 --> 02:09:28.960
<v Speaker 3>you fucking with other people's lives.</v>

2836
02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:34.140
<v Speaker 2>People don't think like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think short term and they just try </v>

2837
02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:34.180
<v Speaker 2>to make as much money as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2838
02:09:34.181 --> 02:09:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Noble today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2839
02:09:36.730 --> 02:09:39.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a great documentary that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched on the plane back from Brazil.</v>

2840
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Merchants of doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

2841
02:09:42.170 --> 02:09:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2842
02:09:43.491 --> 02:09:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Remind me what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think I interviewed the film</v>

2843
02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.440
<v Speaker 2>fucking fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is about fake experts essentially get</v>

2844
02:09:50.901 --> 02:09:55.901
<v Speaker 2>hired by oil companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tobacco companies to poo poo the </v>

2845
02:09:55.901 --> 02:09:59.741
<v Speaker 2>concerns and debate them ferociously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The concerns about global warming </v>

2846
02:09:59.741 --> 02:10:04.180
<v Speaker 2>concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to do the concerns about </v>

2847
02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:06.640
<v Speaker 2>tobacco being or nicotine being </v>
<v Speaker 2>addictive and causing cancer and this </v>

2848
02:10:07.371 --> 02:10:11.150
<v Speaker 2>guy shows that that when when there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>money involved,</v>

2849
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:16.390
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they do is they hire all these </v>

2850
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:18.761
<v Speaker 2>people to fuck with the argument and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they write op Ed columns and all these </v>

2851
02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:22.931
<v Speaker 2>different newspapers all throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and they constantly hammer so </v>

2852
02:10:22.931 --> 02:10:25.820
<v Speaker 2>that your grandfather reads and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read a thing today is at 31,000.</v>

2853
02:10:25.821 --> 02:10:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Scientists have said that global </v>
<v Speaker 2>warming's not real.</v>

2854
02:10:28.150 --> 02:10:30.620
<v Speaker 2>We know who is amongst those 31,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

2855
02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Michael J Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of it.</v>

2856
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:34.730
<v Speaker 2>One of the names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fake.</v>

2857
02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:38.000
<v Speaker 2>It's fake names and they have Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shermer on.</v>

2858
02:10:38.001 --> 02:10:43.001
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of explaining that he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one point in time he thought that </v>

2859
02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:45.230
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was nonsense that global warming</v>

2860
02:10:45.231 --> 02:10:47.200
<v Speaker 2>is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he started delving into the,</v>

2861
02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:49.610
<v Speaker 2>the actual data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual scientific papers,</v>

2862
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.050
<v Speaker 2>and then he realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2863
02:10:51.051 --> 02:10:56.051
<v Speaker 2>there's not only is there a consensus </v>
<v Speaker 2>that man made global warming is a real </v>

2864
02:10:56.541 --> 02:10:59.600
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are no peer reviewed studies,</v>

2865
02:10:59.750 --> 02:11:03.320
<v Speaker 2>no scientific papers that indicate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

2866
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:04.100
<v Speaker 2>None,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

2867
02:11:04.101 --> 02:11:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Zilch.</v>

2868
02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed the director of that movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2869
02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:11.460
<v Speaker 3>on huffpost live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did see the movie on a screen up </v>

2870
02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:11.460
<v Speaker 3>beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2871
02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:15.710
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amazing thing to me was that it's </v>

2872
02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:17.611
<v Speaker 3>not just the same tactics that are being</v>
<v Speaker 3>used in sowing doubt about climate </v>

2873
02:11:17.611 --> 02:11:21.421
<v Speaker 3>change as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Used in sowing doubt about all kinds of </v>

2874
02:11:21.421 --> 02:11:21.421
<v Speaker 3>other different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2875
02:11:21.421 --> 02:11:22.300
<v Speaker 3>starting bestest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bestest,</v>

2876
02:11:22.301 --> 02:11:25.360
<v Speaker 3>all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same human beings.</v>

2877
02:11:25.361 --> 02:11:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2878
02:11:26.530 --> 02:11:31.530
<v Speaker 3>These are professional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's called merchants of </v>

2879
02:11:31.530 --> 02:11:31.530
<v Speaker 3>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the same human beings who went</v>

2880
02:11:31.530 --> 02:11:36.331
<v Speaker 3>in and fought for the tobacco lobby who </v>
<v Speaker 3>then went and fought for the asbestos </v>

2881
02:11:36.331 --> 02:11:38.680
<v Speaker 3>industry who are now fighting for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fossil fuel companies.</v>

2882
02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Exactly the same human beings using </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same playbook,</v>

2883
02:11:42.011 --> 02:11:43.000
<v Speaker 3>using exactly the same.</v>

2884
02:11:43.410 --> 02:11:48.410
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Goddamn television shows where </v>

2885
02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:49.360
<v Speaker 2>they have the split screen where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the host and then they have the two</v>

2886
02:11:49.361 --> 02:11:52.960
<v Speaker 2>experts debate it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then have one person who's like Bill</v>

2887
02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Nye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's sort of a reasonable scientist is </v>

2888
02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:01.871
<v Speaker 2>saying things that people can't totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand because they're a little bit </v>

2889
02:12:01.871 --> 02:12:05.101
<v Speaker 2>too tactical and then you have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouting guy who like fact 23,000</v>

2890
02:12:06.341 --> 02:12:10.780
<v Speaker 2>scientists from 40 countries have said </v>
<v Speaker 2>global warming's not real fact.</v>

2891
02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:13.060
<v Speaker 2>The United States and went along and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2892
02:12:13.070 --> 02:12:17.320
<v Speaker 2>they have this playbook that they use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have this style of communicating in</v>

2893
02:12:17.321 --> 02:12:20.440
<v Speaker 2>these short bursts because those shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>only last.</v>

2894
02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>You have seven minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have seven minutes.</v>

2895
02:12:22.751 --> 02:12:25.060
<v Speaker 2>There's three people there were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

2896
02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:27.920
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to get a point across and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2897
02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:33.270
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the shittiest ways to discuss a </v>

2898
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.270
<v Speaker 2>subject.</v>

2899
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:37.680
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the things that I really </v>

2900
02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:39.000
<v Speaker 3>spend a lot of time trying to do in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>job,</v>

2901
02:12:39.330 --> 02:12:43.860
<v Speaker 3>which is overturn this phony sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance that is required.</v>

2902
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:49.030
<v Speaker 3>It's so every journalist in every media </v>
<v Speaker 3>person tries to be anyone who's good has</v>

2903
02:12:50.941 --> 02:12:53.190
<v Speaker 3>instilled in them a sense that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be fair,</v>

2904
02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:56.500
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that often gets misallocated,</v>

2905
02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:58.560
<v Speaker 3>especially at places like CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2906
02:12:58.561 --> 02:13:00.900
<v Speaker 3>where they're trying to be genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 3>even handed,</v>

2907
02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:05.820
<v Speaker 3>but what they think that means is giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>a microphone to the two people at either</v>

2908
02:13:05.821 --> 02:13:10.821
<v Speaker 3>side of any particular debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there are some debates where one </v>

2909
02:13:10.821 --> 02:13:12.540
<v Speaker 3>side is right and one side is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2910
02:13:12.541 --> 02:13:17.541
<v Speaker 3>Or there's a 98 percent chance that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>side is right and a two percent chance </v>

2911
02:13:17.541 --> 02:13:20.751
<v Speaker 3>that the other side is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you try to be balanced by just </v>

2912
02:13:20.751 --> 02:13:24.171
<v Speaker 3>sitting in the middle and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate a debate between those two </v>

2913
02:13:24.171 --> 02:13:27.501
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually not being unbiased at </v>

2914
02:13:27.501 --> 02:13:27.501
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

2915
02:13:27.501 --> 02:13:29.730
<v Speaker 3>You're being biased towards false hood </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of towards truth.</v>

2916
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:35.030
<v Speaker 3>So whenever I have have a weekly segment</v>
<v Speaker 3>about science news called the nerds </v>

2917
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:38.901
<v Speaker 3>forum on Huff Post live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I always try to try to explain to </v>

2918
02:13:38.901 --> 02:13:38.901
<v Speaker 3>people and express,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2919
02:13:38.901 --> 02:13:41.610
<v Speaker 3>this is the likelihood that this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually true.</v>

2920
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:46.910
<v Speaker 3>So let's talk about the science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not get caught up in this trap of </v>

2921
02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:47.940
<v Speaker 3>false equivalencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2922
02:13:47.941 --> 02:13:50.090
<v Speaker 3>where did you say a call?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

2923
02:13:50.290 --> 02:13:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Did a bit about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2924
02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:52.560
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barrows.</v>

2925
02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:56.010
<v Speaker 3>John Oliver did a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same guy.</v>

2926
02:13:57.630 --> 02:14:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Same Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Oliver is a different guy.</v>

2927
02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Does he have an English accent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has an English accent,</v>

2928
02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:04.000
<v Speaker 3>new character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Colbert.</v>

2929
02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Colbert is a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So John,</v>

2930
02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:12.210
<v Speaker 3>although he's not anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the host of the late show.</v>

2931
02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kobe is no more carry on.</v>

2932
02:14:15.810 --> 02:14:18.700
<v Speaker 3>So John Oliver did this bit where he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a.</v>

2933
02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:23.720
<v Speaker 3>instead of having a pro climate change </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and an anti climate change </v>

2934
02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:24.180
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2935
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:29.390
<v Speaker 3>we think that we should actually reflect</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proportions accurately since 99 </v>

2936
02:14:29.581 --> 02:14:31.650
<v Speaker 3>percent of climate scientists believe in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2937
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:34.100
<v Speaker 3>They have one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he brings out nine.</v>

2938
02:14:34.110 --> 02:14:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Nine people come on sand and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>just shouting,</v>

2939
02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:41.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually pro the pro climate change </v>

2940
02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.821
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's this one other guy who's </v>

2941
02:14:43.821 --> 02:14:43.821
<v Speaker 3>chatting the etsy climate change </v>
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

2942
02:14:43.821 --> 02:14:44.430
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what it actually is like.</v>

2943
02:14:44.431 --> 02:14:47.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not one for one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's $99 for one,</v>

2944
02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:49.800
<v Speaker 3>and that's how the media should portray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

2945
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:51.420
<v Speaker 3>That's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2946
02:14:51.710 --> 02:14:52.930
<v Speaker 3>there really is a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Idea.</v>

2947
02:14:53.290 --> 02:14:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that those shows are horrible </v>

2948
02:14:58.290 --> 02:15:00.271
<v Speaker 2>because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how a lot of people get their </v>

2949
02:15:00.271 --> 02:15:01.360
<v Speaker 2>information and they say they call it </v>
<v Speaker 2>the news in quotes,</v>

2950
02:15:01.630 --> 02:15:06.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an entertainment show and it's an </v>

2951
02:15:06.630 --> 02:15:06.630
<v Speaker 2>entertainment show that relies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials,</v>

2952
02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:11.760
<v Speaker 2>so you this balanced nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspectives and arguments that are </v>

2953
02:15:11.891 --> 02:15:16.891
<v Speaker 2>extremely complex like we like we spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this time talking about the </v>

2954
02:15:16.891 --> 02:15:21.151
<v Speaker 2>conservation for hunting argument and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the artificial intelligence </v>

2955
02:15:21.151 --> 02:15:21.400
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument,</v>

2956
02:15:21.450 --> 02:15:25.960
<v Speaker 2>the argument about pursuing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things are real complex,</v>

2957
02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:31.200
<v Speaker 2>nuanced issues that require long sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed examinations of all the </v>

2958
02:15:33.851 --> 02:15:38.851
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and not from a biased </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective but from as objective as is </v>

2959
02:15:38.851 --> 02:15:43.261
<v Speaker 2>humanly possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when there's real </v>

2960
02:15:43.261 --> 02:15:45.871
<v Speaker 2>ramifications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like global warming or nuclear </v>

2961
02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:49.141
<v Speaker 2>energy or things that really are gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck up our generation and generations </v>

2962
02:15:49.141 --> 02:15:50.860
<v Speaker 2>to come like the hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of years from now.</v>

2963
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Those don't get addressed when you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven minutes and you have a guy who's </v>

2964
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:58.870
<v Speaker 2>being paid by these think tanks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's crazy about this merchants</v>

2965
02:15:58.871 --> 02:16:03.871
<v Speaker 2>of doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a documentary is it shows that there's </v>

2966
02:16:03.871 --> 02:16:07.150
<v Speaker 2>these people that are paid by think </v>
<v Speaker 2>tanks and these think tanks.</v>

2967
02:16:07.151 --> 02:16:12.151
<v Speaker 2>What they really are is they're these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fake organizations that are propped up </v>

2968
02:16:12.151 --> 02:16:16.081
<v Speaker 2>by companies that are selling whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck they would benefit from this </v>

2969
02:16:16.081 --> 02:16:18.790
<v Speaker 2>being passed or this being the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The concerns being alleviated.</v>

2970
02:16:18.791 --> 02:16:23.791
<v Speaker 2>One of them being like this doctor who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a paid by this think tank to go and </v>

2971
02:16:24.190 --> 02:16:29.190
<v Speaker 2>preach about these flame retardant </v>
<v Speaker 2>fabrics and materials using to make </v>

2972
02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:36.060
<v Speaker 2>furniture and that he would say this </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about a woman who left a candle in</v>

2973
02:16:36.851 --> 02:16:39.450
<v Speaker 2>the babies was a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a candle.</v>

2974
02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:41.080
<v Speaker 2>She said a candle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She left it.</v>

2975
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 2>There was a cigarette story too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a woman left a candle in her</v>

2976
02:16:44.321 --> 02:16:49.321
<v Speaker 2>baby's crib and that the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the pillow was flame retardant </v>

2977
02:16:51.281 --> 02:16:53.250
<v Speaker 2>leaves a candle in a baby's crib </v>
<v Speaker 2>annually.</v>

2978
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a real story.</v>

2979
02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:58.000
<v Speaker 2>It was a lie and this guy had told not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that story,</v>

2980
02:16:58.030 --> 02:17:03.030
<v Speaker 2>not just once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but several times over a long period of </v>

2981
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.030
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over many years,</v>

2982
02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:06.370
<v Speaker 2>and these people started investigating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the merchants of doubt.</v>

2983
02:17:06.371 --> 02:17:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Go Watch the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2984
02:17:07.631 --> 02:17:12.631
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they started investigating this </v>

2985
02:17:12.631 --> 02:17:14.020
<v Speaker 2>doctor and what did they call them up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you actually treat these people?</v>

2986
02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:16.680
<v Speaker 2>They looked into his past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His background is passed.</v>

2987
02:17:16.850 --> 02:17:21.850
<v Speaker 2>They did a computer database on all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>infants that died from burns in this </v>

2988
02:17:21.850 --> 02:17:26.821
<v Speaker 2>guy's a area and they found that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lie and so they called him and he </v>

2989
02:17:26.821 --> 02:17:26.821
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2990
02:17:26.821 --> 02:17:29.980
<v Speaker 2>this is an anecdotal thing and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust it wasn't real.</v>

2991
02:17:29.981 --> 02:17:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I was just trying to paint a story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's possible.</v>

2992
02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:33.400
<v Speaker 2>No you fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

2993
02:17:33.430 --> 02:17:38.430
<v Speaker 2>because he wasn't under oath because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't under oath when he was </v>

2994
02:17:38.430 --> 02:17:38.430
<v Speaker 2>testifying.</v>

2995
02:17:38.430 --> 02:17:41.380
<v Speaker 2>He was allowed to lie about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they asked him,</v>

2996
02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:46.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was paid for citizens for fire safety </v>

2997
02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:46.560
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck that's the think </v>
<v Speaker 2>tank was.</v>

2998
02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.210
<v Speaker 2>And then when a think tank has less than</v>
<v Speaker 2>x amount of members,</v>

2999
02:17:49.211 --> 02:17:54.211
<v Speaker 2>you have to sort of disclose where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding comes from and the funding all </v>

3000
02:17:54.211 --> 02:17:57.151
<v Speaker 2>came from the manufacturers of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>flame retardants shit that is causing </v>

3001
02:17:57.151 --> 02:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of problems with children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially babies like babies around </v>

3002
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:03.520
<v Speaker 2>this flame retardants stuff that dust </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that stuff gets in their lungs that</v>

3003
02:18:03.521 --> 02:18:08.521
<v Speaker 2>gets in their system and they showed </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the difference between the amount </v>

3004
02:18:08.521 --> 02:18:11.491
<v Speaker 2>of this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an American babies versus the </v>

3005
02:18:11.491 --> 02:18:13.771
<v Speaker 2>amount of the shit that's in babies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries where they don't have </v>

3006
02:18:13.771 --> 02:18:14.790
<v Speaker 2>these people lobbying to have the shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>be put in there.</v>

3007
02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Their furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking terrifying.</v>

3008
02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:22.140
<v Speaker 3>I often wonder living in America why </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer rights here are increasing at </v>

3009
02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:23.080
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the right that they are.</v>

3010
02:18:23.170 --> 02:18:27.570
<v Speaker 3>And you know why Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can answer this Washington.</v>

3011
02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean not those hot chicks or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going on right up.</v>

3012
02:18:33.281 --> 02:18:36.220
<v Speaker 3>That is not happening in Japan and it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not happening in,</v>

3013
02:18:36.221 --> 02:18:41.221
<v Speaker 3>in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder whether it is stuffed like </v>

3014
02:18:41.221 --> 02:18:42.520
<v Speaker 3>industry's lobbying for fire safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that are.</v>

3015
02:18:42.521 --> 02:18:44.050
<v Speaker 3>So every time you sit down on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>couch,</v>

3016
02:18:44.051 --> 02:18:46.930
<v Speaker 3>you just a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just absorbing like the tiniest,</v>

3017
02:18:46.931 --> 02:18:51.931
<v Speaker 3>tiniest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiniest little bit of some shitty </v>

3018
02:18:51.931 --> 02:18:51.931
<v Speaker 3>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3019
02:18:51.931 --> 02:18:52.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get too hippy dippy </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

3020
02:18:52.421 --> 02:18:55.820
<v Speaker 3>but like all the stuff that's in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>soaps and the teenager just the,</v>

3021
02:18:55.821 --> 02:18:56.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number,</v>

3022
02:18:56.740 --> 02:18:58.720
<v Speaker 3>you look at the ingredients on things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were just,</v>

3023
02:18:58.721 --> 02:19:00.940
<v Speaker 3>it's just a litany of chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me,</v>

3024
02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:03.000
<v Speaker 3>it makes me want to move to New Zealand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ate my,</v>

3025
02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:08.260
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandmother's beautiful eggs from a </v>

3026
02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:10.830
<v Speaker 3>natural chicken and just use eucalyptus </v>
<v Speaker 3>oil to bathe myself in and sit on a </v>

3027
02:19:10.930 --> 02:19:11.770
<v Speaker 3>wooden chair.</v>

3028
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

3029
02:19:12.981 --> 02:19:17.981
<v Speaker 2>And I think though the argument is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty clear when you see things like </v>

3030
02:19:17.981 --> 02:19:21.101
<v Speaker 2>this merchants of doubt and you find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>how lobbyists work and you find out how </v>

3031
02:19:21.101 --> 02:19:24.131
<v Speaker 2>think tanks work and you find out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are actively trying to get </v>

3032
02:19:24.131 --> 02:19:25.970
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the concerns about these things that</v>

3033
02:19:25.971 --> 02:19:30.971
<v Speaker 2>alleviated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're it strictly for financial </v>

3034
02:19:30.971 --> 02:19:30.971
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3035
02:19:30.971 --> 02:19:32.330
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing it because they have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real concern.</v>

3036
02:19:32.510 --> 02:19:34.730
<v Speaker 2>And it takes us a while before we figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>it out,</v>

3037
02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:36.430
<v Speaker 2>like thalidomide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thumb,</v>

3038
02:19:36.431 --> 02:19:39.230
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of my babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has to happen as best as people</v>

3039
02:19:39.231 --> 02:19:40.520
<v Speaker 2>have to get cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get rid of.</v>

3040
02:19:40.570 --> 02:19:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Especially now they're getting rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trans fats.</v>

3041
02:19:42.231 --> 02:19:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Trans fats are now illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3042
02:19:43.851 --> 02:19:46.340
<v Speaker 2>how many fucking people had to get sick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3043
02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:49.370
<v Speaker 2>how long have trans fats and margarine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's not butter.</v>

3044
02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:53.390
<v Speaker 2>How long has that shift been around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been around forever and people have</v>

3045
02:19:53.391 --> 02:19:57.110
<v Speaker 2>lobbied in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lied and promoted these things for their</v>

3046
02:19:57.111 --> 02:19:59.750
<v Speaker 2>own personal gain and profits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

3047
02:19:59.751 --> 02:20:02.570
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a real part of our culture.</v>

3048
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:06.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a real part of our legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real part of how we,</v>

3049
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:07.370
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3050
02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:09.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we create laws.</v>

3051
02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:10.670
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of scary.</v>

3052
02:20:10.671 --> 02:20:13.550
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of scary when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how sociopathic it really is.</v>

3053
02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:14.900
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do think that the,</v>

3054
02:20:14.970 --> 02:20:16.460
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming back to the media,</v>

3055
02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I think we have a big responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we own the media.</v>

3056
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:25.630
<v Speaker 3>You will realize I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean to include you in the way </v>

3057
02:20:25.630 --> 02:20:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I was including nervous was including </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3058
02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:31.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're part of the good part of the </v>

3059
02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:32.420
<v Speaker 3>media in so far as what the Internet is </v>
<v Speaker 3>now doing is allowing conversations like</v>

3060
02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:33.020
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you say,</v>

3061
02:20:33.021 --> 02:20:34.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you get to impart these ideas in</v>

3062
02:20:34.791 --> 02:20:36.080
<v Speaker 3>seven minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3063
02:20:36.081 --> 02:20:38.460
<v Speaker 3>you're lucky if you get seven minutes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>exhibit TV,</v>

3064
02:20:38.490 --> 02:20:40.280
<v Speaker 3>you usually get three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're on the today show,</v>

3065
02:20:40.281 --> 02:20:45.281
<v Speaker 3>you get three minutes or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how many people have time to listen </v>

3066
02:20:45.281 --> 02:20:46.130
<v Speaker 3>to a three hour podcast at one point 6 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million twitter followers?</v>

3067
02:20:46.660 --> 02:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot now.</v>

3068
02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:53.100
<v Speaker 2>It's getting more now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also ridiculous that a former </v>

3069
02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:56.890
<v Speaker 2>fear factor host meatheads cage fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>commentators smokes pot all the time,</v>

3070
02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:58.900
<v Speaker 2>is the guy that you come into for </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

3071
02:20:59.170 --> 02:21:01.000
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there should be someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>more qualified.</v>

3072
02:21:01.050 --> 02:21:01.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

3073
02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:06.800
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean when there are like Sam </v>

3074
02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Harris and there's a lot more people out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there that are doing this as well,</v>

3075
02:21:07.291 --> 02:21:12.291
<v Speaker 3>but this medium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you that this medium </v>

3076
02:21:12.291 --> 02:21:12.291
<v Speaker 3>absolutely genius of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the problem is that people,</v>

3077
02:21:12.291 --> 02:21:17.270
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not don't tend to be scientifically </v>

3078
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:19.671
<v Speaker 3>literate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when something comes out saying that </v>

3079
02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:20.550
<v Speaker 3>butter is a deadly killer and monitoring</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the answer,</v>

3080
02:21:20.970 --> 02:21:23.790
<v Speaker 3>then someone puts out a press release,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a PR company,</v>

3081
02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:26.760
<v Speaker 3>then some money from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the modern industry,</v>

3082
02:21:26.970 --> 02:21:31.970
<v Speaker 3>and then the producer at the radio </v>
<v Speaker 3>station or television station who </v>

3083
02:21:31.970 --> 02:21:33.000
<v Speaker 3>receives that knows that that's a juicy </v>
<v Speaker 3>tidbit.</v>

3084
02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:38.060
<v Speaker 3>So they write it up and they do a story </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it and that's that all of a sudden </v>

3085
02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:40.620
<v Speaker 3>the viewer is under the impression that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a settled fact.</v>

3086
02:21:40.621 --> 02:21:45.621
<v Speaker 3>It's not a settled fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what was one study and in three </v>

3087
02:21:45.621 --> 02:21:48.561
<v Speaker 3>years' time module is going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>deadly killer and bought is going to be </v>

3088
02:21:48.561 --> 02:21:48.561
<v Speaker 3>good again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also in the</v>

3089
02:21:48.561 --> 02:21:50.080
<v Speaker 2>defense of the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributing that information,</v>

3090
02:21:50.081 --> 02:21:52.390
<v Speaker 2>there was very little known about </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol back then.</v>

3091
02:21:52.391 --> 02:21:53.350
<v Speaker 2>LDL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>

3092
02:21:53.351 --> 02:21:54.160
<v Speaker 2>hdl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol.</v>

3093
02:21:54.161 --> 02:21:55.390
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was needed?</v>

3094
02:21:55.570 --> 02:22:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Scientific work has still been needed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be done on a lot of different dietary </v>

3095
02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:03.610
<v Speaker 2>supplements and things that the data </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't in yet.</v>

3096
02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Joe,</v>

3097
02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:07.780
<v Speaker 3>scientists will always speak with more </v>
<v Speaker 3>caveats than the media does.</v>

3098
02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:13.200
<v Speaker 3>Huge bug and scientists back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they hadn't known about ldl </v>

3099
02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:13.200
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would've said,</v>

3100
02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:17.200
<v Speaker 3>look on the basis of what we currently </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand about module and bought a and</v>

3101
02:22:17.201 --> 02:22:18.700
<v Speaker 3>human physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blahdy,</v>

3102
02:22:18.701 --> 02:22:19.270
<v Speaker 3>blahdy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

3103
02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:24.300
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way that it ends up </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting impounded because nobody wants </v>

3104
02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:26.521
<v Speaker 3>to watch a television show that </v>
<v Speaker 3>equivocates like that or a news </v>

3105
02:22:26.521 --> 02:22:26.521
<v Speaker 3>broadcast that equivocates like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3106
02:22:26.521 --> 02:22:26.521
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

3107
02:22:26.521 --> 02:22:31.010
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely right about that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>also think that we're in a weird time </v>

3108
02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:32.800
<v Speaker 2>now where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the Internet and because like</v>

3109
02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:38.090
<v Speaker 2>you could do huffpost live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what kind of editorial </v>

3110
02:22:38.090 --> 02:22:38.860
<v Speaker 2>control they have over what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you finish.</v>

3111
02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

3112
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:45.590
<v Speaker 2>if anybody hasn't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I wanted to get you on </v>

3113
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.590
<v Speaker 2>the show in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched many episodes your show and</v>

3114
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:48.120
<v Speaker 2>it's very balanced and until I like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

3115
02:22:48.121 --> 02:22:50.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a cool show and it's,</v>

3116
02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:55.340
<v Speaker 2>and it's very unlike something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would see in normal NBC 8:00</v>

3117
02:22:56.460 --> 02:22:58.920
<v Speaker 2>PM or whatever the fuck it would be on </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast television.</v>

3118
02:22:58.921 --> 02:23:02.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that kind of stuff and that</v>

3119
02:23:02.371 --> 02:23:07.371
<v Speaker 2>the Internet and what the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the freedom that it provides and also </v>

3120
02:23:07.371 --> 02:23:07.800
<v Speaker 2>the freedom of Info,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of information,</v>

3121
02:23:07.801 --> 02:23:10.670
<v Speaker 2>the access to it is kind of changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3122
02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:12.630
<v Speaker 2>the ability of these people to do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3123
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:14.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3124
02:23:15.210 --> 02:23:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you say,</v>

3125
02:23:16.801 --> 02:23:19.080
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this also just popped into my head while</v>

3126
02:23:19.081 --> 02:23:20.220
<v Speaker 3>we were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3127
02:23:20.850 --> 02:23:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Richard Dawkins tweet about feminism in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>

3128
02:23:25.650 --> 02:23:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Nobody saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3129
02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:31.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam needs a feminist revolution.</v>

3130
02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:36.800
<v Speaker 3>It will be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What can we do to help and which seems </v>

3131
02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.070
<v Speaker 3>reasonable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3132
02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:38.900
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3133
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:41.580
<v Speaker 3>the Internet just exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had I store,</v>

3134
02:23:41.581 --> 02:23:42.960
<v Speaker 3>it feels like they got mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3135
02:23:42.961 --> 02:23:47.580
<v Speaker 3>totally misogynistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare he has a white male.</v>

3136
02:23:47.581 --> 02:23:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have these.</v>

3137
02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I still have these tabs up on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer because we were looking at it </v>

3138
02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:53.660
<v Speaker 3>as a white male.</v>

3139
02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Women who are forced to wear these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>outfits.</v>

3140
02:23:55.311 --> 02:23:57.290
<v Speaker 2>They cover their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't go to school.</v>

3141
02:23:57.500 --> 02:23:58.850
<v Speaker 2>They can't drive.</v>

3142
02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:01.320
<v Speaker 3>So look at the candidate vote ugliest </v>
<v Speaker 3>headlines.</v>

3143
02:24:01.321 --> 02:24:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mansplained feminism to Muslim women.</v>

3144
02:24:06.570 --> 02:24:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Atheist Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tweet file.</v>

3145
02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Richard Dawkins fail spectacularly on </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminism and Islam.</v>

3146
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Who wrote these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3147
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:16.400
<v Speaker 3>they're all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3148
02:24:16.750 --> 02:24:18.690
<v Speaker 3>one of them's Napoleon pace in the huff </v>
<v Speaker 3>post.</v>

3149
02:24:18.691 --> 02:24:20.430
<v Speaker 3>One of them said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3150
02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:22.890
<v Speaker 3>we made a blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the opinion blog?</v>

3151
02:24:22.891 --> 02:24:25.260
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the.</v>

3152
02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see if I was told that.</v>

3153
02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:30.780
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saved the titles here.</v>

3154
02:24:30.890 --> 02:24:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Say so I don't have the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are so many people looking to call</v>

3155
02:24:34.801 --> 02:24:37.630
<v Speaker 3>bullshit on men that somehow or another</v>

3156
02:24:37.690 --> 02:24:42.490
<v Speaker 2>try to say anything about what women do </v>
<v Speaker 2>or need to do.</v>

3157
02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Like here's one twitter user says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Dawkins needs to abandon his </v>

3158
02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:48.430
<v Speaker 3>patronizing white savior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paternalist,</v>

3159
02:24:48.450 --> 02:24:53.450
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobia like how many buzzwords can</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fit in a tweet?</v>

3160
02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:56.280
<v Speaker 3>How many politically correct buzzwords </v>
<v Speaker 3>can you fit?</v>

3161
02:24:56.281 --> 02:24:58.430
<v Speaker 3>That person's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a Stephen Colbert,</v>

3162
02:24:58.550 --> 02:25:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Huffington post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pretending to be a fucking </v>

3163
02:25:03.550 --> 02:25:05.120
<v Speaker 3>liberal conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

3164
02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:10.200
<v Speaker 3>and then it was an article saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's no better than early 20th century </v>

3165
02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:11.040
<v Speaker 3>European colonists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim women,</v>

3166
02:25:11.041 --> 02:25:14.880
<v Speaker 3>that they needed help from European men </v>
<v Speaker 3>even says,</v>

3167
02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.590
<v Speaker 3>what can we do to help?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>

3168
02:25:16.591 --> 02:25:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Islam needs a feminist revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be hard.</v>

3169
02:25:19.141 --> 02:25:20.100
<v Speaker 3>What can we do to help?</v>

3170
02:25:20.170 --> 02:25:22.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful tweet and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct when look,</v>

3171
02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:25.360
<v Speaker 2>if you just look at it as human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about Islam.</v>

3172
02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Forget about sex is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about all that gender's shit.</v>

3173
02:25:29.290 --> 02:25:34.290
<v Speaker 2>If you just looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a human being that's looking at </v>

3174
02:25:34.290 --> 02:25:36.010
<v Speaker 2>other human beings that are forced to </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave in a way that they might not want</v>

3175
02:25:36.011 --> 02:25:39.210
<v Speaker 2>to picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with this.</v>

3176
02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's a new group that starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>up tomorrow and they call themselves the</v>

3177
02:25:42.971 --> 02:25:44.260
<v Speaker 2>fucking monkey faces.</v>

3178
02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ignoring the deep complexity of </v>

3179
02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:49.440
<v Speaker 3>so many different strains of Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world.</v>

3180
02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:52.530
<v Speaker 3>You're disempowering women of color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>western world.</v>

3181
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:53.890
<v Speaker 3>What about white chicks that are Muslim?</v>

3182
02:25:54.290 --> 02:25:55.200
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a racist.</v>

3183
02:25:55.770 --> 02:25:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I just called you out and you don't call</v>
<v Speaker 2>out fucking racist.</v>

3184
02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:00.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of white Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

3185
02:26:01.330 --> 02:26:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm just so frustrating with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was sarcastic too.</v>

3186
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do?</v>

3187
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.000
<v Speaker 2>How can we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are people that are trying to call </v>

3188
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.611
<v Speaker 2>bullshit on people when the bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't exist because they want a score </v>

3189
02:26:16.611 --> 02:26:19.761
<v Speaker 2>just like we were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that cops want to arrest people because </v>

3190
02:26:19.761 --> 02:26:19.761
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking game and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

3191
02:26:19.890 --> 02:26:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I think there's people that want to win </v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter.</v>

3192
02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:24.600
<v Speaker 2>There's people that want to win on huff </v>
<v Speaker 2>post is people that are looking to write</v>

3193
02:26:24.601 --> 02:26:28.680
<v Speaker 2>blogs about a guy like Richard Dawkins </v>
<v Speaker 2>who has said some kind of weird,</v>

3194
02:26:28.681 --> 02:26:33.681
<v Speaker 2>questionable shit in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like especially the shit that he said </v>

3195
02:26:33.681 --> 02:26:33.900
<v Speaker 2>about child molesting that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3196
02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:37.260
<v Speaker 2>he experienced some mild molestation </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was young.</v>

3197
02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:39.300
<v Speaker 2>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got over it.</v>

3198
02:26:39.301 --> 02:26:39.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3199
02:26:39.661 --> 02:26:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3200
02:26:40.211 --> 02:26:41.040
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck,</v>

3201
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:46.090
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to what he was actually </v>

3202
02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:46.090
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what he was,</v>

3203
02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:46.850
<v Speaker 3>I think what he was saying is get over </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we get,</v>

3204
02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:50.240
<v Speaker 3>we get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have certain paradigms of about which</v>

3205
02:26:50.241 --> 02:26:55.241
<v Speaker 3>we get very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very upset and because abusing and </v>

3206
02:26:55.241 --> 02:26:59.141
<v Speaker 3>violently raping children is pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing that you can possibly </v>

3207
02:26:59.141 --> 02:27:02.441
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have made it mandatory to regard all </v>

3208
02:27:02.441 --> 02:27:04.400
<v Speaker 3>child abuse as being the worst thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can possibly happen.</v>

3209
02:27:04.430 --> 02:27:09.430
<v Speaker 3>I think his point was like I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>funneled by by a stupid crazy priest </v>

3210
02:27:09.430 --> 02:27:12.710
<v Speaker 3>when I was 12 years old or something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pretty quickly got over it.</v>

3211
02:27:12.890 --> 02:27:16.160
<v Speaker 3>So that's not to say that other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who didn't get over it and going through</v>

3212
02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:21.220
<v Speaker 3>didn't go through horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do we have to regard every single </v>

3213
02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:25.040
<v Speaker 3>instance of every single type of crime </v>
<v Speaker 3>as equally bad?</v>

3214
02:27:25.041 --> 02:27:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Can we be a bit more nuance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe they're a very,</v>

3215
02:27:28.221 --> 02:27:31.880
<v Speaker 3>very bad forms of child abuse and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are less bad forms of child abuse,</v>

3216
02:27:31.881 --> 02:27:36.881
<v Speaker 3>but the moment you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone says he's saying a child abuse </v>

3217
02:27:36.881 --> 02:27:36.881
<v Speaker 3>is good.</v>

3218
02:27:36.881 --> 02:27:36.881
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3219
02:27:36.881 --> 02:27:38.990
<v Speaker 2>and also this is a horrible thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3220
02:27:39.290 --> 02:27:44.290
<v Speaker 2>but I'll preface it by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my own personal experience.</v>

3221
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I was bullied when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was mild bullying,</v>

3222
02:27:47.810 --> 02:27:52.810
<v Speaker 2>like nobody did anything horrible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never beaten half to death or I </v>

3223
02:27:52.810 --> 02:27:55.010
<v Speaker 2>was never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever threatened me with weapons.</v>

3224
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:57.200
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of picked on and fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3225
02:27:57.201 --> 02:28:00.320
<v Speaker 2>but it got me into martial arts and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed my life.</v>

3226
02:28:00.650 --> 02:28:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Like these are the Yin and the Yang to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and I think that sometimes take a</v>

3227
02:28:05.301 --> 02:28:10.301
<v Speaker 2>little bit of resistance is good because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reaction to that resistance is you </v>

3228
02:28:10.301 --> 02:28:14.711
<v Speaker 2>decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is never going to happen to me </v>

3229
02:28:14.711 --> 02:28:16.391
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fire up and I'm going to </v>

3230
02:28:16.391 --> 02:28:18.911
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to empower myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is no longer a fear of mine and </v>

3231
02:28:18.911 --> 02:28:23.351
<v Speaker 2>I think that a little bit of someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>being an asshole to you makes you </v>

3232
02:28:23.351 --> 02:28:24.320
<v Speaker 2>appreciate kind people.</v>

3233
02:28:24.590 --> 02:28:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evil people in the world.</v>

3234
02:28:26.481 --> 02:28:29.030
<v Speaker 2>And here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shitty relationships.</v>

3235
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:31.730
<v Speaker 2>I think most of us have had some bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>

3236
02:28:32.330 --> 02:28:35.250
<v Speaker 2>bad relationships make you appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 2>good relationships.</v>

3237
02:28:35.550 --> 02:28:36.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

3238
02:28:36.231 --> 02:28:38.780
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate one of the things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really love about my wife,</v>

3239
02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:41.900
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't like to argue about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like a really kind person.</v>

3240
02:28:41.901 --> 02:28:46.901
<v Speaker 2>She's friendly and sweet and warm and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not like a person like picks on </v>

3241
02:28:46.901 --> 02:28:50.861
<v Speaker 2>people and she like picks on you or </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts arguing or brings up shit that </v>

3242
02:28:50.861 --> 02:28:54.911
<v Speaker 2>happened like a month ago or a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy that has a wife that </v>

3243
02:28:54.911 --> 02:28:55.310
<v Speaker 2>argues with them like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3244
02:28:55.311 --> 02:28:56.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

3245
02:28:56.181 --> 02:28:57.740
<v Speaker 2>when we were first dating you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

3246
02:28:57.770 --> 02:29:02.770
<v Speaker 2>that was fucking police fucking selling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My body is different from the cells that</v>

3247
02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:10.880
<v Speaker 2>were in my body seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not responsible for that guy who </v>

3248
02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:12.290
<v Speaker 2>came home drunk and fucking shit already</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologized.</v>

3249
02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not.</v>

3250
02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:16.250
<v Speaker 2>If anything comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if she does something wrong,</v>

3251
02:29:16.251 --> 02:29:18.980
<v Speaker 2>like if she doesn't pay a bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was put the fuck the cables off.</v>

3252
02:29:19.010 --> 02:29:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Well you remember when we first started </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating and fucking yes,</v>

3253
02:29:21.831 --> 02:29:24.590
<v Speaker 2>I do remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also has nothing whatsoever to do</v>

3254
02:29:24.591 --> 02:29:26.240
<v Speaker 2>with the conversation that we're having </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

3255
02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3256
02:29:26.830 --> 02:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>when you experienced that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucked up and married this crazy </v>

3257
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>broad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

3258
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I said broad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an asshole.</v>

3259
02:29:33.450 --> 02:29:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Let me try to explain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was white male privilege or ripping </v>

3260
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:39.630
<v Speaker 2>into the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I split.</v>

3261
02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I spray that shit like come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do with my white male </v>

3262
02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:48.461
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't allow it to just ooze out like </v>

3263
02:29:48.461 --> 02:29:48.461
<v Speaker 2>maple syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3264
02:29:48.461 --> 02:29:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that when we see these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like when I go to,</v>

3265
02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I love Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil is a wonderful country.</v>

3266
02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:58.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people are friendly,</v>

3267
02:29:58.221 --> 02:29:59.720
<v Speaker 2>they're free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happy,</v>

3268
02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:02.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like kind of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>unorganized.</v>

3269
02:30:03.050 --> 02:30:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Like when you go to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the things when we were </v>

3270
02:30:08.050 --> 02:30:11.840
<v Speaker 2>getting on a plane from Sao Paulo to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil or Sao Paulo to Rio rather,</v>

3271
02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:12.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3272
02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:17.660
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't find out what fucking gate </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was because they said 17.</v>

3273
02:30:17.661 --> 02:30:20.850
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'd go to 17 c and the lady,</v>

3274
02:30:20.851 --> 02:30:21.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3275
02:30:21.380 --> 02:30:23.000
<v Speaker 2>she speaks Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's like,</v>

3276
02:30:23.001 --> 02:30:23.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3277
02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:24.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>day 24,</v>

3278
02:30:24.291 --> 02:30:25.100
<v Speaker 2>20 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM I,</v>

3279
02:30:25.101 --> 02:30:30.101
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't say 24 slash slash eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go to 24 and 24 says floor </v>

3280
02:30:30.101 --> 02:30:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Annapolis and it says another one next </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

3281
02:30:32.081 --> 02:30:37.081
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were saying it over the </v>

3282
02:30:37.081 --> 02:30:39.371
<v Speaker 2>loudspeaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the people that are listening </v>

3283
02:30:39.371 --> 02:30:41.620
<v Speaker 2>that spoke Portuguese knew that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no signs because there </v>

3284
02:30:41.620 --> 02:30:41.810
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world.</v>

3285
02:30:41.811 --> 02:30:46.811
<v Speaker 2>They have a different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it made me appreciate when you come </v>

3286
02:30:46.811 --> 02:30:46.811
<v Speaker 2>back to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look up at the fucking departures.</v>

3287
02:30:46.811 --> 02:30:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh there's the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

3288
02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:50.120
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you only spoke mandarin,</v>

3289
02:30:50.121 --> 02:30:52.100
<v Speaker 2>the true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be fucked.</v>

3290
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:53.990
<v Speaker 2>You'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fucking just a bad hit.</v>

3291
02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Even worse because if I spoke mandarin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was in Brazil,</v>

3292
02:30:58.011 --> 02:30:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I'd be double.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

3293
02:30:59.580 --> 02:31:04.580
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even read what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're writing and they couldn't know </v>

3294
02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:07.601
<v Speaker 2>what the hell you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go to your app on your phone </v>

3295
02:31:07.601 --> 02:31:10.931
<v Speaker 2>and try to decipher it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But point being like when when you see </v>

3296
02:31:10.931 --> 02:31:14.291
<v Speaker 2>something like if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to like my buddy who went to </v>

3297
02:31:14.291 --> 02:31:17.171
<v Speaker 2>Africa and experienced like all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos of Africa said God mean people </v>

3298
02:31:17.171 --> 02:31:19.350
<v Speaker 2>complain about America like you to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3299
02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 2>of course</v>

3300
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:24.690
<v Speaker 3>it's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no utopia on this planet who is</v>

3301
02:31:24.691 --> 02:31:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Denmark Utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like,</v>

3302
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I think there were degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3303
02:31:28.231 --> 02:31:33.231
<v Speaker 3>Like obviously Africa and many South </v>
<v Speaker 3>American countries are going to be more </v>

3304
02:31:33.231 --> 02:31:37.140
<v Speaker 3>screwed up then rich countries like </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

3305
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then within the club of rich </v>

3306
02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:42.190
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are also countries where shit just</v>

3307
02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:44.250
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just easy stuff is easy.</v>

3308
02:31:44.251 --> 02:31:49.251
<v Speaker 3>I lived in Copenhagen for a semester and</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to university there in my early </v>

3309
02:31:49.251 --> 02:31:49.470
<v Speaker 3>twenties and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3310
02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:51.300
<v Speaker 3>there's no lines at the post office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

3311
02:31:51.330 --> 02:31:52.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean granted there's no people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>live there.</v>

3312
02:31:52.921 --> 02:31:54.510
<v Speaker 3>There's like 14 people in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

3313
02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:58.110
<v Speaker 3>But like it's still scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could actually have.</v>

3314
02:31:58.130 --> 02:32:00.750
<v Speaker 3>They still got a tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same tax base per capita,</v>

3315
02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:06.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as America could have if it wanted to </v>

3316
02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:06.480
<v Speaker 3>have higher taxes and you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a dmv that that works and you could</v>

3317
02:32:06.481 --> 02:32:07.680
<v Speaker 3>have a post office that functions.</v>

3318
02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:09.000
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to wait around all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3319
02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:12.090
<v Speaker 3>It's just A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certainly societies that,</v>

3320
02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:17.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Friedman says that flying from </v>

3321
02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Schiphol airport in Amsterdam into JFK </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like flying from the,</v>

3322
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:25.070
<v Speaker 3>from the jetsons to the Flintstones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like laguardia is a shit hole.</v>

3323
02:32:26.210 --> 02:32:28.140
<v Speaker 3>Then that's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3324
02:32:28.410 --> 02:32:33.410
<v Speaker 3>there are countries whose airports are </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice and who's trains of fast and these </v>

3325
02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:35.460
<v Speaker 3>healthcare systems work more cheaply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst though,</v>

3326
02:32:35.610 --> 02:32:37.860
<v Speaker 3>the way the people treat you at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Laguardia,</v>

3327
02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:42.150
<v Speaker 3>there is so fucking over it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressively over it,</v>

3328
02:32:42.151 --> 02:32:44.130
<v Speaker 3>like Shitty to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3329
02:32:44.190 --> 02:32:48.260
<v Speaker 3>New York Tsa workers are my least </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite of all the TSA workers.</v>

3330
02:32:48.270 --> 02:32:51.780
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he asked them a question,</v>

3331
02:32:53.550 --> 02:32:55.040
<v Speaker 3>now that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that I've got,</v>

3332
02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:58.290
<v Speaker 3>I've got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're lucky that you have global entry.</v>

3333
02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Need to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta get it.</v>

3334
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:02.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking idiot.</v>

3335
02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:03.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] damn it,</v>

3336
02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I just got my green card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3337
02:33:05.610 --> 02:33:08.190
<v Speaker 3>I got my green card earlier this year </v>
<v Speaker 3>and done to our country.</v>

3338
02:33:08.191 --> 02:33:09.780
<v Speaker 3>So thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you enjoy it.</v>

3339
02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been in 10 years,</v>

3340
02:33:12.270 --> 02:33:13.230
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3341
02:33:13.930 --> 02:33:18.360

<v Speaker 3>now that I was able to get global entry,</v>

3342
02:33:18.390 --> 02:33:22.560
<v Speaker 3>just not having to deal with the customs</v>
<v Speaker 3>officials coming in,</v>

3343
02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:26.340
<v Speaker 3>especially in the foreign as lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I imagine it may be better in the</v>

3344
02:33:26.341 --> 02:33:31.341
<v Speaker 3>city and the citizens lane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coming in and the foreign is lane </v>

<v Speaker 3>Like people who don't speak English who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are probably coming in with with some </v>

3347
02:33:39.450 --> 02:33:41.640
<v Speaker 3>lousy shit from abroad or chicken in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their back.</v>

3348
02:33:41.660 --> 02:33:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

3349
02:33:42.391 --> 02:33:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3350
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:48.240

<v Speaker 3>So just being able to go to the kiosk </v>

3358
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.870
<v Speaker 3>and swept the global entry and then just</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk straight through.</v>

3359
02:34:09.090 --> 02:34:12.930
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the greatest things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the guys I work with the UFC habit.</v>

3360
02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:14.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only one who doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking moron.</v>

3361
02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:16.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just busy,</v>

3362
02:34:16.471 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing a lot of podcasts and shit.</v>

3363
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:23.280
<v Speaker 2>You are not a hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make an appointment.</v>

3364
02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I go to cryotherapy five times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go to global entry apartment.</v>

3365
02:34:28.001 --> 02:34:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3366
02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:31.360
<v Speaker 2>You should not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I agree with you?</v>

3367
02:34:31.570 --> 02:34:33.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm disappointed in myself as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should be.</v>

3368
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3369
02:34:35.010 --> 02:34:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Is I wonder whether or not just on why </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are angry at Richard Dawkins for </v>

3370
02:34:40.010 --> 02:34:41.280
<v Speaker 3>saying something that obviously makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

3371
02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:43.750
<v Speaker 2>I think they're not really angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe they are angry.</v>

3372
02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like</v>

3373
02:34:46.270 --> 02:34:51.270
<v Speaker 3>some people see the world in groups and </v>
<v Speaker 3>identities and for them identity </v>

3374
02:34:52.181 --> 02:34:57.181
<v Speaker 3>politics is the most important way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>contextualizing and conceiving of the </v>

3375
02:34:57.181 --> 02:34:58.540
<v Speaker 3>things that are happening around them in</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

3376
02:34:58.930 --> 02:35:03.160
<v Speaker 3>So the moment a person who's a white </v>
<v Speaker 3>male starts saying anything,</v>

3377
02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:04.390
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3378
02:35:04.391 --> 02:35:08.770
<v Speaker 3>this is in the category of patronizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>white male authority.</v>

3379
02:35:09.310 --> 02:35:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Looking down on this other category of </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who is oppressed like religious </v>

3380
02:35:14.561 --> 02:35:19.561
<v Speaker 3>minority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's not actually listen to what's </v>

3381
02:35:19.561 --> 02:35:19.561
<v Speaker 3>being said and let's not give anyone the</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit of the doubt.</v>

3382
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's just super impose that into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>jigsaw puzzle in my brain,</v>

3383
02:35:24.221 --> 02:35:27.370
<v Speaker 3>which is like culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you say it also in,</v>

3384
02:35:27.371 --> 02:35:32.371
<v Speaker 3>in all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the racial problems that have </v>

3385
02:35:32.371 --> 02:35:32.371
<v Speaker 3>been happening in the past year in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

3386
02:35:32.371 --> 02:35:35.500
<v Speaker 3>And I'm totally on the side of the black</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives matter movement here.</v>

3387
02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:38.030
<v Speaker 3>And I have a huge problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3388
02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:42.790
<v Speaker 3>with the brutality that police show </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards towards minority communities.</v>

3389
02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:47.820
<v Speaker 3>But you got to make sure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually talking on the same page about </v>

3390
02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:51.331
<v Speaker 3>the ideas and the practices that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just caricaturing people into </v>

3391
02:35:51.331 --> 02:35:52.450
<v Speaker 3>stereotypes of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3392
02:35:52.451 --> 02:35:53.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think maybe that's what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening here.</v>

3393
02:35:53.900 --> 02:35:55.220
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be.</v>

3394
02:35:55.221 --> 02:35:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that what's going on is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>game of hungry,</v>

3395
02:35:57.261 --> 02:36:02.261
<v Speaker 2>hungry hippo and there's a little marble</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they see that you can snatch that </v>

3396
02:36:02.261 --> 02:36:05.951
<v Speaker 2>marble and they go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an opening and I don't </v>

3397
02:36:05.951 --> 02:36:05.951
<v Speaker 2>think it's logical and you know what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

3398
02:36:05.951 --> 02:36:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I love when people who have these knee </v>
<v Speaker 2>jerk reactions to these things,</v>

3399
02:36:09.231 --> 02:36:11.810
<v Speaker 2>like they see these openings and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>go for it because they feel like there's</v>

3400
02:36:11.811 --> 02:36:16.490
<v Speaker 2>an opening to attack also get attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a woman who wrote a piece,</v>

3401
02:36:16.491 --> 02:36:21.491
<v Speaker 2>she's a feminist and she wrote a piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>about my friend Amy Schumer who is </v>

3402
02:36:21.491 --> 02:36:23.960
<v Speaker 2>hilarious and wild and just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

3403
02:36:23.961 --> 02:36:27.800
<v Speaker 2>And she's kicking ass right now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in the cover of a magazine sucking</v>

3404
02:36:27.801 --> 02:36:32.801
<v Speaker 2>on [inaudible] finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were saying why this magazine </v>

3405
02:36:32.801 --> 02:36:34.180
<v Speaker 2>is so awful about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3406
02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:35.330
<v Speaker 2>against feminism.</v>

3407
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:36.440
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

3408
02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:39.660
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an antifeminist thing.</v>

3409
02:36:39.661 --> 02:36:41.290
<v Speaker 2>And she shouldn't be sucking fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3410
02:36:41.810 --> 02:36:44.840
<v Speaker 2>as if like you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be sexual,</v>

3411
02:36:44.841 --> 02:36:49.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like isn't it like part of being a </v>

3412
02:36:49.841 --> 02:36:50.840
<v Speaker 2>person who owns themselves owning all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you enjoy?</v>

3413
02:36:50.930 --> 02:36:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she likes sucking fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3414
02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:57.980
<v Speaker 2>like she's a fucking picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>

3415
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Bad ass bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at her.</v>

3416
02:36:59.930 --> 02:37:01.100
<v Speaker 2>She's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>

3417
02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's gangster as fuck.</v>

3418
02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:05.900
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This same woman wrote a bit of,</v>

3419
02:37:05.901 --> 02:37:10.901
<v Speaker 2>she wrote another piece because I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to follow knuckleheads showed another </v>

3420
02:37:10.901 --> 02:37:12.020
<v Speaker 2>piece about how she's getting older and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really kind of.</v>

3421
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:15.920
<v Speaker 2>She's torn because she doesn't get cat </v>
<v Speaker 2>called much anymore.</v>

3422
02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:21.910
<v Speaker 1>She's actually getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's actually as conflicting opinions </v>

3423
02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:25.481
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's the tweet that drove me </v>

3424
02:37:25.481 --> 02:37:25.481
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made me laugh.</v>

3425
02:37:25.481 --> 02:37:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I howled at my own computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone tweeted her saying that this </v>

3426
02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:33.620
<v Speaker 1>article about being conflicted about not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being catcalled anymore.</v>

3427
02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I felt like that was a very white cis </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>

3428
02:37:37.940 --> 02:37:39.410
<v Speaker 1>White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cisgender,</v>

3429
02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:44.650
<v Speaker 1>meaning that people of Color and trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to worry about being </v>

3430
02:37:44.650 --> 02:37:49.391
<v Speaker 1>catcalled because trans people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if their cat called and then someone </v>

3431
02:37:49.391 --> 02:37:52.991
<v Speaker 1>finds out that the trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get beaten to death and you </v>

3432
02:37:52.991 --> 02:37:53.840
<v Speaker 1>should be more aware that when you write</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pieces,</v>

3433
02:37:53.930 --> 02:37:56.620
<v Speaker 1>you're insensitive and true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could.</v>

3434
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:57.390
<v Speaker 1>She had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a.</v>

3435
02:37:57.590 --> 02:38:02.590
<v Speaker 1>She had to acquiesce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had to like give into it because </v>

3436
02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:02.590
<v Speaker 1>she's a part of that fucking retarded </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

3437
02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:07.211
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she got stuck in our own bullshit </v>

3438
02:38:07.211 --> 02:38:09.020
<v Speaker 1>ideology is the caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trans Women in particular,</v>

3439
02:38:09.021 --> 02:38:12.020
<v Speaker 1>but trans people in general are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victims of violence that way.</v>

3440
02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Higher rates than everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just put that aside and say </v>

3441
02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:19.601
<v Speaker 1>that that's a terrible thing and that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>should still be supportive of the Trans </v>

3442
02:38:19.601 --> 02:38:20.090
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

3443
02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:25.420
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard about it was a college that </v>

3444
02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:27.641
<v Speaker 1>canceled the vagina monologues because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing a production of the </v>

3445
02:38:27.641 --> 02:38:28.620
<v Speaker 1>vagina monologues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this popular feminist play.</v>

3446
02:38:28.780 --> 02:38:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3447
02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:33.440
<v Speaker 1>The trend and the and the on campus </v>
<v Speaker 1>trends community,</v>

3448
02:38:33.490 --> 02:38:38.490
<v Speaker 1>not even the on campus trans community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't an on campus trans </v>

3449
02:38:38.490 --> 02:38:41.471
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the on campus like liberal fucking </v>

3450
02:38:41.471 --> 02:38:45.191
<v Speaker 1>knee jerk douchebag decided it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>insensitive to trans to trans people </v>

3451
02:38:45.191 --> 02:38:45.830
<v Speaker 1>because not all women have vaginas.</v>

3452
02:38:48.060 --> 02:38:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Someone when that Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3453
02:38:50.241 --> 02:38:53.180
<v Speaker 1>and not all people are people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My dog has a person.</v>

3454
02:38:53.210 --> 02:38:56.300
<v Speaker 1>My dog identifies as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know that.</v>

3455
02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3456
02:38:57.291 --> 02:38:59.990
<v Speaker 1>you be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be more respectful and sensitive because</v>

3457
02:38:59.991 --> 02:39:01.730
<v Speaker 1>not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all dogs are actually.</v>

3458
02:39:01.731 --> 02:39:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all people are human beings,</v>

3459
02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:06.700
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't follow that big live in fucking</v>

3460
02:39:06.701 --> 02:39:08.310
<v Speaker 1>fairy tale land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we are.</v>

3461
02:39:08.530 --> 02:39:10.730
<v Speaker 1>It's too easy to get food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on,</v>

3462
02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:12.760
<v Speaker 1>so people make up shit to get upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3463
02:39:12.770 --> 02:39:17.770
<v Speaker 1>That's my feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too easy to just go to the </v>

3464
02:39:17.770 --> 02:39:18.140
<v Speaker 1>supermarket and pick up fucking cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too easy.</v>

3465
02:39:18.410 --> 02:39:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you actually supposed to help </v>

3466
02:39:23.410 --> 02:39:25.511
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are we supposed to be kind and </v>

3467
02:39:25.511 --> 02:39:28.901
<v Speaker 1>considerate and generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time we try to we get shut down </v>

3468
02:39:28.901 --> 02:39:29.540
<v Speaker 1>because we put our foot in it.</v>

3469
02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Like Dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins in that tweet about Islam is </v>

3470
02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:34.540
<v Speaker 1>trying to support women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3471
02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Like what could be wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tries to do that and then feminist </v>

3472
02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:43.001
<v Speaker 1>jumped down his throat for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>condescending towards women because </v>

3473
02:39:43.001 --> 02:39:43.001
<v Speaker 1>Muslim women should be the ones who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticking up for Muslim women.</v>

3474
02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:45.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't need your white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal,</v>

3475
02:39:45.231 --> 02:39:50.231
<v Speaker 1>Islamaphobic male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a activity to in order to do so because </v>

3476
02:39:50.231 --> 02:39:52.030
<v Speaker 1>they are proud and bold Muslim women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3477
02:39:52.031 --> 02:39:57.031
<v Speaker 1>not all of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are in stuck in beekeepers </v>

3478
02:39:57.031 --> 02:39:59.441
<v Speaker 1>outfits in Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we help them if every time we </v>

3479
02:39:59.441 --> 02:39:59.630
<v Speaker 1>try to help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get jumped.</v>

3480
02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:00.590
<v Speaker 1>We jumped on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3481
02:40:00.591 --> 02:40:05.591
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to negate the opinions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those people that write these posts </v>

3482
02:40:05.591 --> 02:40:07.190
<v Speaker 1>for like the huff post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write these articles.</v>

3483
02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.400
<v Speaker 1>We have to negate them by mocking them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it is hilariously </v>

3484
02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:15.611
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that opinion is a fucking </v>

3485
02:40:15.611 --> 02:40:15.611
<v Speaker 1>hilariously</v>

3486
02:40:15.611 --> 02:40:19.340
<v Speaker 2>stupid that he doesn't have the right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say that he has concern for people that </v>

3487
02:40:19.381 --> 02:40:22.290
<v Speaker 2>are a different gender than him that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a different ideology than him.</v>

3488
02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:27.500
<v Speaker 2>They'd live in a different part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and him that have more melanin in </v>

3489
02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:27.500
<v Speaker 2>their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

3490
02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:31.521
<v Speaker 2>And I think what we're doing here by </v>
<v Speaker 2>mocking that is really what the correct </v>

3491
02:40:31.521 --> 02:40:32.370
<v Speaker 2>response is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only correct response.</v>

3492
02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:34.140
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get that response </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the news.</v>

3493
02:40:34.141 --> 02:40:35.520
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get that from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

3494
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:41.030
<v Speaker 2>but didn't you get that from people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a vested interest in </v>

3495
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:43.791
<v Speaker 2>supporting one particular tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's one of the things </v>

3496
02:40:43.791 --> 02:40:47.391
<v Speaker 2>that they talked about in this merchants</v>
<v Speaker 2>of doubt documentary that I have really </v>

3497
02:40:47.391 --> 02:40:51.231
<v Speaker 2>resonated with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a lot of times when people talk </v>

3498
02:40:51.231 --> 02:40:54.051
<v Speaker 2>about global warming or they talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking chem trails or any of these </v>

3499
02:40:54.051 --> 02:40:57.621
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a tribe of people that have </v>

3500
02:40:57.621 --> 02:40:59.871
<v Speaker 2>subscribed to that ideology and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very important that you support that </v>

3501
02:40:59.871 --> 02:40:59.871
<v Speaker 2>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might.</v>

3502
02:41:00.170 --> 02:41:05.170
<v Speaker 2>It can it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It manifests itself as in ridiculous </v>

3503
02:41:05.170 --> 02:41:06.810
<v Speaker 2>places like the tribe of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like android phones.</v>

3504
02:41:06.970 --> 02:41:09.510
<v Speaker 2>They love android phones and they hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>iphones.</v>

3505
02:41:09.650 --> 02:41:11.520
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who fucking hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>

3506
02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:13.890
<v Speaker 2>She's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a brilliant director.</v>

3507

<v Speaker 3>not being a Mac person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Madness.</v>

3523
02:41:51.550 --> 02:41:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Those people who when a new product </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes out and it's usually an apple </v>

3524
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560
<v Speaker 3>product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go out and they'll camp for four</v>

3525
02:41:56.561 --> 02:42:00.240
<v Speaker 3>or five days in order to be the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who gets the light.</v>

3526
02:42:00.250 --> 02:42:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I do not under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It reminded me a little bit of when you </v>

3527
02:42:05.250 --> 02:42:05.350
<v Speaker 3>were talking about your buddy who did </v>
<v Speaker 3>the massive mess of marathon,</v>

3528
02:42:05.351 --> 02:42:08.530
<v Speaker 3>but then came in fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always like I was watching,</v>

3529
02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I was watching the today show or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something where they were interviewing </v>

3530
02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:14.590
<v Speaker 3>the people who were standing in line and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd been there.</v>

3531
02:42:14.591 --> 02:42:15.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've all got.</v>

3532
02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:18.790
<v Speaker 3>They've got tents and they got sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>bags like they were on fifth avenue,</v>

3533
02:42:18.791 --> 02:42:21.730
<v Speaker 3>like near Central Park and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping on the sleeping,</v>

3534
02:42:21.731 --> 02:42:25.960
<v Speaker 3>camping for 72 hours and they were and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the correspondent was talking to someone</v>

3535
02:42:25.961 --> 02:42:30.961
<v Speaker 3>who was like the seventh in line or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and I was like,</v>

3536
02:42:33.490 --> 02:42:35.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand spending a week outside</v>

3538
02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:42.250
<v Speaker 3>number seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even better than being like number 342.</v>

3539
02:42:42.251 --> 02:42:43.120
<v Speaker 3>What differences.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

3543
02:42:49.611 --> 02:42:54.611
<v Speaker 2>what is it about people that are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get something that doesn't even do </v>

3544
02:42:54.611 --> 02:42:54.611
<v Speaker 2>anything different?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3558
02:43:21.890 --> 02:43:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even realize there was a six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's how cool I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The type of individual I am Joe.</v>

3561
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so like totes out of like the whole </v>

3562
02:43:32.910 --> 02:43:34.210
<v Speaker 1>like keep up with the Jones' </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gizmodo.com.</v>

3563
02:43:35.350 --> 02:43:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Live in Brooklyn and eat Kale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kale is even better because they don't </v>

3564
02:43:40.350 --> 02:43:43.150
<v Speaker 1>grow Kale in Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have it flown in from Brazil.</v>

3565
02:43:46.170 --> 02:43:51.170
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any room on my phone to </v>

3566
02:43:51.170 --> 02:43:54.631
<v Speaker 1>upgrade to the latest software.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for ages I was still running the on </v>

3567
02:43:54.631 --> 02:43:56.650
<v Speaker 1>the older software and gradually your </v>
<v Speaker 1>apps just stop working.</v>

3568
02:43:56.710 --> 02:44:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Like stuff just doesn't even work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you open up the American Airlines </v>

3569
02:44:01.710 --> 02:44:02.740
<v Speaker 1>APP and it's like this is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported by this software.</v>

3570
02:44:02.741 --> 02:44:04.540
<v Speaker 1>So they keep you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep you on your toes.</v>

3571
02:44:04.610 --> 02:44:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I still have an older software to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the newest software because I don't have</v>

3572
02:44:09.260 --> 02:44:11.920
<v Speaker 1>a new software on my computer either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard fucking crashes.</v>

3573
02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wait a long time.</v>

3574
02:44:14.091 --> 02:44:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Man may take some time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>

3575
02:44:16.930 --> 02:44:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I was to be in a plastic surgeon in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia about penile enlargement </v>

3576
02:44:21.930 --> 02:44:22.210
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>

3577
02:44:22.220 --> 02:44:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it work?</v>

3578
02:44:25.150 --> 02:44:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Is that done at the end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

3579
02:44:27.970 --> 02:44:29.220
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3580
02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but they're a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has some side effects.</v>

3581
02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:37.020
<v Speaker 1>What's the side effects?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Dick flips around in weird ways </v>

3582
02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:37.020
<v Speaker 1>when it.</v>

3583
02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:37.020
<v Speaker 1>That's when they cut the tendon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3584
02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:39.700
<v Speaker 1>That's not so it doesn't religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a micro Dick,</v>

3585
02:44:39.701 --> 02:44:40.990
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get an extra inch.</v>

3586
02:44:40.991 --> 02:44:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Woah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>

3587
02:44:42.131 --> 02:44:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Now you have two inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly just for vain people.</v>

3588
02:44:44.291 --> 02:44:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not for micro Dick People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also they can take fat out of,</v>

3589
02:44:47.290 --> 02:44:51.570
<v Speaker 1>out of other parts of your body and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll put fat in around the edges,</v>

3590
02:44:51.571 --> 02:44:54.100
<v Speaker 1>but thins fat and smushy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one wants that.</v>

3591
02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is simply this,</v>

3592
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't intending to talk about do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little Dick.</v>

3593
02:44:59.141 --> 02:45:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Dude's getting getting bigger dicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroids.</v>

3594
02:45:01.210 --> 02:45:04.420
<v Speaker 1>He said that there's a maximum in in </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine that you should never be either</v>

3595
02:45:04.421 --> 02:45:07.510
<v Speaker 1>the first nor the last to adopt a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedure.</v>

3596
02:45:08.090 --> 02:45:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good smart.</v>

3597
02:45:09.521 --> 02:45:14.521
<v Speaker 1>That's my way towards on phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my philosophy on technology on </v>

3598
02:45:14.521 --> 02:45:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the basis of penile enlargement surgery.</v>

3599
02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wait a little while,</v>

3600
02:45:17.651 --> 02:45:22.120
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not the last person to adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm probably like third.</v>

3601
02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm like in the third wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not enough.</v>

3602

<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that right now.</v>

3603
02:45:28.161 --> 02:45:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not waiting in line for a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

3604
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:33.910
<v Speaker 1>It's never ran out the kinks anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless the phone does like holograms.</v>

3605
02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Once you put the phone down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help me Obi wan.</v>

3606
02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:41.040

<v Speaker 1>pops up and fucking dances for you.</v>

3607
02:45:41.141 --> 02:45:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Then then I'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>

3608
02:45:43.061 --> 02:45:44.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to then realized that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go.</v>

3609
02:45:44.610 --> 02:45:47.080
<v Speaker 1>You'll be one of the first adopters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll realize it gives you.</v>

3610
02:45:47.081 --> 02:45:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It's radioactive and it gives you cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll die.</v>

3611
02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:55.040
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn your smartphone into a three d </v>

3612
02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:55.040

<v Speaker 1>smart phone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3618
02:46:04.781 --> 02:46:09.781
<v Speaker 1>we're really close to these new goggles </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're creating where even right </v>

3619
02:46:09.781 --> 02:46:09.980

<v Speaker 4>but eventually they're going to be like,</v>

3621
02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:15.950
<v Speaker 4>like sunglasses that are the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>desktop.</v>

3622
02:46:15.980 --> 02:46:17.210
<v Speaker 4>That is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

3623
02:46:17.211 --> 02:46:18.410
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

3624
02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:21.350
<v Speaker 4>What does that magic leap?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that,</v>

3625
02:46:21.390 --> 02:46:23.570
<v Speaker 4>that technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it called magic leap?</v>

3626
02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:29.140
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have that technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also like a Hologram that you </v>

3627
02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:29.690
<v Speaker 4>can hold in your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly how that works,</v>

3628
02:46:29.691 --> 02:46:32.780
<v Speaker 4>but there's another version of it that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it just being fired out of your phone</v>

3629
02:46:32.781 --> 02:46:33.860
<v Speaker 4>or what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or out of a laptop.</v>

3630
02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:37.340
<v Speaker 4>They're being very secretive about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've shown some demonstrations of</v>

3631
02:46:37.341 --> 02:46:42.341
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but only the demonstration in the fact </v>

3632
02:46:42.341 --> 02:46:44.411
<v Speaker 4>that you can see like there's a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl that's watching a ballerina on her </v>

3633
02:46:44.411 --> 02:46:45.590
<v Speaker 4>bed dancing around the ballerina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like four inches high.</v>

3634
02:46:45.770 --> 02:46:47.710
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks amazing.</v>

3635
02:46:47.711 --> 02:46:49.790
<v Speaker 4>It looks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is magic leap.</v>

3636
02:46:50.210 --> 02:46:53.300
<v Speaker 4>They don't explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's going to be this.</v>

3637
02:46:53.410 --> 02:46:54.860
<v Speaker 4>Not Cgi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a real.</v>

3638
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:55.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3639
02:46:55.311 --> 02:46:55.820
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3640
02:46:55.821 --> 02:46:57.980
<v Speaker 4>It's not CGI.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at a little.</v>

3641
02:46:57.981 --> 02:47:01.830
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at a little tiny total in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the palm of someone's hand with a tinier</v>

3642
02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:02.810
<v Speaker 4>puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3643
02:47:02.811 --> 02:47:05.960
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's somehow they're going to be able</v>

3644
02:47:05.961 --> 02:47:09.350
<v Speaker 4>to broadcast holograms and it's not done</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

3645
02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:14.760
<v Speaker 4>This is like some technology that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>proof of concept and it's in the middle </v>

3646
02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:18.460
<v Speaker 4>of being developed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there's another one that's </v>

3647
02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:21.910
<v Speaker 4>similar but different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the one that Google one with </v>

3648
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.910
<v Speaker 4>the goggles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

3649
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:23.270
<v Speaker 4>do you remember that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Microsoft Hollow Lens.</v>

3650
02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:24.080
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3651
02:47:24.081 --> 02:47:25.460
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in.</v>

3652
02:47:25.461 --> 02:47:28.850
<v Speaker 4>The Hollow Lens is going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>change a room into a desktop.</v>

3653
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:30.740
<v Speaker 4>Say like a video game that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing,</v>

3654
02:47:30.741 --> 02:47:32.270
<v Speaker 4>like say if you want to play like call </v>
<v Speaker 4>of duty.</v>

3655
02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:35.990
<v Speaker 4>He play call of duty in an empty room </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the whole room will be the desktop.</v>

3656
02:47:36.410 --> 02:47:37.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3657
02:47:37.041 --> 02:47:37.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3658
02:47:37.461 --> 02:47:39.590
<v Speaker 4>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they have demonstrations of that and</v>

3659
02:47:39.591 --> 02:47:44.591
<v Speaker 4>they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like minority report that will you </v>

3660
02:47:44.591 --> 02:47:49.120
<v Speaker 4>scroll and you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll be able to spin cubes around the </v>

3661
02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:49.580
<v Speaker 4>air and hold them and Muslim like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>

3662
02:47:49.730 --> 02:47:51.890
<v Speaker 4>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how they're gonna.</v>

3663
02:47:51.891 --> 02:47:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be,</v>

3664
02:47:53.201 --> 02:47:55.730
<v Speaker 4>you need to be aware of these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be spread,</v>

3665
02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:57.560
<v Speaker 4>pinch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk around your house.</v>

3666
02:47:57.561 --> 02:47:59.120
<v Speaker 4>These fucking right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're goofy.</v>

3667
02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:02.250
<v Speaker 4>They're these giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge ski goggles.</v>

3668
02:48:02.330 --> 02:48:04.520
<v Speaker 4>So exciting when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're actually going to be able to</v>

3669
02:48:04.521 --> 02:48:09.521
<v Speaker 4>have three dimensional interactivity </v>
<v Speaker 4>with computer generated images.</v>

3670
02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:14.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fairly inevitable if you think </v>

3671
02:48:14.710 --> 02:48:14.710
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this,</v>

3672
02:48:14.710 --> 02:48:16.520
<v Speaker 4>like how she's there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's already have something like this.</v>

3673
02:48:16.521 --> 02:48:21.521
<v Speaker 4>There's a virtual reality program that </v>
<v Speaker 4>architects can use where they can walk </v>

3674
02:48:21.521 --> 02:48:23.330
<v Speaker 4>through the house before it's been built</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on their designs and they can be.</v>

3675
02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:24.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they can,</v>

3676
02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:26.480
<v Speaker 4>they can do stuff like this where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be like,</v>

3677
02:48:26.481 --> 02:48:31.481
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just extend this wool by another </v>

3678
02:48:31.481 --> 02:48:31.481
<v Speaker 4>three inches and see what that looks </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

3679
02:48:31.481 --> 02:48:34.160
<v Speaker 4>And then they can actually take people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are prospective buyers of properties</v>

3680
02:48:34.430 --> 02:48:38.060
<v Speaker 4>on three dimensional virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>tours of the house that isn't even built</v>

3681
02:48:38.061 --> 02:48:38.900
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

3682
02:48:38.901 --> 02:48:43.150
<v Speaker 4>This is showing an instructional from </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to put together a pipe on a,</v>

3683
02:48:43.151 --> 02:48:48.151
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a piece of plumbing and under your sink </v>

3684
02:48:48.151 --> 02:48:50.740
<v Speaker 4>and it's showing like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual applications where you could </v>

3685
02:48:50.740 --> 02:48:52.160
<v Speaker 4>use something for instructional </v>
<v Speaker 4>purposes.</v>

3686
02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:54.470
<v Speaker 4>So it's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>

3687
02:48:54.590 --> 02:48:59.590
<v Speaker 4>this is almost inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just as crazy as what we were talking </v>

3688
02:48:59.590 --> 02:49:03.311
<v Speaker 4>about before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could send videos to other parts of </v>

3689
02:49:03.311 --> 02:49:04.700
<v Speaker 4>the world and skype instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All this stuff is just next level stuff.</v>

3690
02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:06.320
<v Speaker 4>It's probably not that far off as well.</v>

3691
02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:11.320
<v Speaker 4>This isn't like in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the kind of stuff that we're </v>

3692
02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:11.490
<v Speaker 4>going to be using and dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably an in 10 years.</v>

3693
02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Look at what he just showed that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3694
02:49:13.470 --> 02:49:17.580
<v Speaker 4>that was a three d,</v>
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality version of the,</v>

3695
02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:20.300
<v Speaker 4>of the surface of Mars backup a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit more.</v>

3696
02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Jamie like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>

3697
02:49:21.630 --> 02:49:26.630
<v Speaker 4>That's real too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be able to send one of </v>

3698
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.630
<v Speaker 4>these rovers to Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>

3699
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:28.590
<v Speaker 4>Be able to walk around on Mars and see </v>
<v Speaker 4>it as if it's really right there.</v>

3700
02:49:28.830 --> 02:49:33.830
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what will be a game </v>
<v Speaker 4>changer for virtual reality and three </v>

3701
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:36.501
<v Speaker 4>dimensional stuff like this will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling be a game that when when you get</v>

3702
02:49:37.591 --> 02:49:42.591
<v Speaker 4>a virtual reality headset and some kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of like suit device that allows people </v>

3703
02:49:42.811 --> 02:49:45.420
<v Speaker 4>to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel,</v>

3704
02:49:45.421 --> 02:49:47.880
<v Speaker 4>feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>touches on actually some kind of like,</v>

3705
02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:49.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3706
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:54.030
<v Speaker 4>I messed up patient thing or they </v>
<v Speaker 4>already on you then then get linked up </v>

3707
02:49:54.030 --> 02:49:56.880
<v Speaker 4>to a virtual reality that actually looks</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like a three d robot human,</v>

3708
02:49:57.090 --> 02:50:02.090
<v Speaker 4>but kind of like an actual plausible </v>
<v Speaker 4>human being that is going to make so </v>

3709
02:50:02.090 --> 02:50:02.090
<v Speaker 4>much money.</v>

3710
02:50:02.090 --> 02:50:03.300
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3711
02:50:03.301 --> 02:50:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Well it's already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's already happened.</v>

3712
02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:07.400
<v Speaker 4>They already have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that technology called again?</v>

3713
02:50:07.420 --> 02:50:09.600
<v Speaker 4>The one that Duncan's always ready to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oculus rift,</v>

3714
02:50:10.830 --> 02:50:15.830
<v Speaker 4>they put the goggles on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have for first person interactive </v>

3715
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:19.641
<v Speaker 4>porn where you put your Dick into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine and the machine sort of strokes </v>

3716
02:50:19.641 --> 02:50:21.900
<v Speaker 4>your deck and you're having sex with </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone in first person.</v>

3717
02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:23.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they already have it.</v>

3718
02:50:23.550 --> 02:50:24.840
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

3719
02:50:24.841 --> 02:50:29.841
<v Speaker 4>it coincides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The movements coincide to a computer </v>

3720
02:50:29.841 --> 02:50:29.841
<v Speaker 4>program that coincides with the action </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're seeing.</v>

3721
02:50:29.841 --> 02:50:31.890
<v Speaker 4>That's what you'd want it to actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel.</v>

3722
02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:33.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the advances that are coming in,</v>

3723
02:50:33.901 --> 02:50:37.750
<v Speaker 4>all of that kind of stuff in the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>decade is going to be mind boggling.</v>

3724
02:50:37.770 --> 02:50:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that goes back to what we're </v>

3725
02:50:42.770 --> 02:50:44.030
<v Speaker 4>talking about about future civilizations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that do these civilizations that exist </v>

3726
02:50:44.030 --> 02:50:48.471
<v Speaker 4>out there in the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have radar or are they transcended </v>

3727
02:50:48.471 --> 02:50:48.471
<v Speaker 4>that and they have.</v>

3728
02:50:48.471 --> 02:50:51.240
<v Speaker 4>They gone into virtual because I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>once,</v>

3729
02:50:51.270 --> 02:50:53.610
<v Speaker 4>once we realized that virtual can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>Avatar,</v>

3730
02:50:53.611 --> 02:50:57.630
<v Speaker 4>we can live inside some fantastic world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so much more rewarding and exciting</v>

3731
02:50:57.631 --> 02:51:02.631
<v Speaker 4>and why bother with the regular carbon </v>
<v Speaker 4>based life world?</v>

3732
02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Why do we need everything to be real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3733
02:51:04.711 --> 02:51:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I can knock on this table.</v>

3734
02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:10.620
<v Speaker 4>Why is this table better than a table </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I feel like I can knock on,</v>

3735
02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:13.320
<v Speaker 4>but it's way better and every time I </v>
<v Speaker 4>touch it it gives me love.</v>

3736
02:51:13.380 --> 02:51:16.500
<v Speaker 4>Well this is the problem that's raised </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the film.</v>

3737
02:51:16.501 --> 02:51:17.220
<v Speaker 4>The Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

3738
02:51:17.221 --> 02:51:19.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean it become sort of a punchline of </v>
<v Speaker 4>light blue pill,</v>

3739
02:51:19.861 --> 02:51:24.861
<v Speaker 4>red pill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's actually a profound </v>

3740
02:51:24.861 --> 02:51:24.861
<v Speaker 4>philosophical question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you rather,</v>

3741
02:51:24.861 --> 02:51:28.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do what the bad guy does in the matrix </v>

3742
02:51:28.580 --> 02:51:31.251
<v Speaker 4>when he sells them all out and decides </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's going to go back into the </v>

3743
02:51:31.251 --> 02:51:32.040
<v Speaker 4>matrix and have his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his memory of the Matrix,</v>

3744
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:35.420
<v Speaker 4>it'd be a raised and he'll live like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>life of a road rich celebrity,</v>

3745
02:51:35.810 --> 02:51:39.240
<v Speaker 4>or do you prefer the tragedy of reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing that it's actually true,</v>

3746
02:51:39.241 --> 02:51:42.600
<v Speaker 4>but then what does it mean to say that </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality is actually true or true,</v>

3747
02:51:42.601 --> 02:51:44.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than a matrix would.</v>

3748
02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why does it have to be?</v>

3749
02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Why does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why does everything that's real have to </v>

3750
02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:51.720
<v Speaker 4>be real in only the way we understand it</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

3751
02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:56.960
<v Speaker 4>It's just as we've come accustomed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even our own real of today has </v>

3752
02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:59.030
<v Speaker 4>become very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the real money,</v>

3753
02:51:59.370 --> 02:52:04.370
<v Speaker 4>the real of money used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had a leather sack filled with gold </v>

3754
02:52:04.370 --> 02:52:05.440
<v Speaker 4>coins and you carry that around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone could steal it from you.</v>

3755
02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 4>Now</v>

3756
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:09.220
<v Speaker 1>it's bitcoin and it's on your phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just digits,</v>

3757
02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:11.260
<v Speaker 1>digits that have no relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

3758
02:52:11.540 --> 02:52:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It's preparing us for this inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial weird world of something that</v>

3759
02:52:17.351 --> 02:52:19.060
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not even artificial,</v>

3760
02:52:19.210 --> 02:52:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just a new level of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a new thing.</v>

3761
02:52:22.270 --> 02:52:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really good point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point out that it's not artificial </v>

3762
02:52:27.270 --> 02:52:27.270
<v Speaker 1>because look at what we're doing right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3763
02:52:27.270 --> 02:52:32.190
<v Speaker 1>We're having a conversation which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through technology that half </v>

3764
02:52:32.190 --> 02:52:32.410
<v Speaker 1>century ago would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconceivable,</v>

3765
02:52:32.411 --> 02:52:37.411
<v Speaker 1>which is being viewed by people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching us in real time and also </v>

3766
02:52:37.411 --> 02:52:41.221
<v Speaker 1>listened to by people who were carrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>around devices in their pockets who are </v>

3767
02:52:41.221 --> 02:52:44.851
<v Speaker 1>able to listen to us at any point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time after the fact and those devices </v>

3768
02:52:44.851 --> 02:52:46.060
<v Speaker 1>would have been unimaginable a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>

3769
02:52:46.390 --> 02:52:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And yet what we're actually doing is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic and as old as time.</v>

3770
02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Which is what happened to conversation.</v>

3771
02:52:52.090 --> 02:52:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're having a conversation that's </v>

3772
02:52:57.090 --> 02:52:59.161
<v Speaker 1>fueled by this digital interface that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have in front of us that's allowing us </v>

3773
02:52:59.161 --> 02:53:03.511
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real time get information in a way </v>

3774
02:53:03.511 --> 02:53:03.511
<v Speaker 1>that was never possible just a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>

3775
02:53:03.700 --> 02:53:06.160
<v Speaker 1>We can get all this information and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that?</v>

3776
02:53:06.161 --> 02:53:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

3777
02:53:06.761 --> 02:53:09.320
<v Speaker 1>He pulls it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see it up on the big screens.</v>

3778
02:53:09.321 --> 02:53:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living right now in the matrix.</v>

3779
02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:15.160
<v Speaker 1>We're living in like a baby matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it matters though?</v>

3780
02:53:15.380 --> 02:53:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have visions of like people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>just spend all their days in the,</v>

3781
02:53:20.201 --> 02:53:23.380
<v Speaker 1>in their basements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plugged into a virtual reality machine.</v>

3782
02:53:23.580 --> 02:53:28.580
<v Speaker 1>We'd like a drip in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm providing them with sustenance and </v>

3783
02:53:28.580 --> 02:53:29.230
<v Speaker 1>just are off in this other universe of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

3784
02:53:29.690 --> 02:53:34.690
<v Speaker 1>How is that then people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this while they're playing </v>

3785
02:53:34.690 --> 02:53:37.060
<v Speaker 1>video games and drinking mountain dew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that you have to live in</v>

3786
02:53:37.061 --> 02:53:40.330
<v Speaker 1>the real world in order to be valid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>

3787
02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the only reason why is because we</v>

3788
02:53:42.551 --> 02:53:45.130
<v Speaker 1>have needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have needs for companionship and love</v>

3789
02:53:45.131 --> 02:53:48.460
<v Speaker 1>and friendship and it's good to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and smell the fresh air,</v>

3790
02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but when they figured out a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>oculus rift,</v>

3791
02:53:51.851 --> 02:53:54.730
<v Speaker 1>you put on a headset and it's way better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than regular fresh air.</v>

3792
02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto something with </v>
<v Speaker 1>companionship.</v>

3793
02:53:56.560 --> 02:53:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that gets to the nub of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern about it,</v>

3794
02:53:59.140 --> 02:54:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that as long as that person who's laying</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their basement plugged into an ivy </v>

3795
02:54:04.140 --> 02:54:08.730
<v Speaker 1>and living in a virtual reality world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with actual other human </v>

3796
02:54:08.730 --> 02:54:09.340
<v Speaker 1>beings who were also in that virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3797
02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I have less of a problem with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he's interacting with avatars who</v>

3798
02:54:12.850 --> 02:54:17.850
<v Speaker 1>aren't actual human beings but who give </v>
<v Speaker 1>him all of the feedback that we need </v>

3799
02:54:17.850 --> 02:54:21.721
<v Speaker 1>from companionship and he's living in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake world where there is no </v>

3800
02:54:21.721 --> 02:54:25.111
<v Speaker 1>reciprocation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm pretty confident that you </v>

3801
02:54:25.111 --> 02:54:25.111
<v Speaker 1>actually have a consciousness.</v>

3802
02:54:25.111 --> 02:54:26.890
<v Speaker 1>You might be a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty confident that what we're</v>

3803
02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:28.710
<v Speaker 1>doing in your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3804
02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:30.970
<v Speaker 1>You might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be dreaming right now.</v>

3805
02:54:31.030 --> 02:54:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty confident that you are a </v>

3806
02:54:36.030 --> 02:54:36.160
<v Speaker 1>human being and that you are actually at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3807
02:54:36.161 --> 02:54:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I am currently engaged in an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious exchange.</v>

3808
02:54:39.370 --> 02:54:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you are an Avatar and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in virtual reality,</v>

3809
02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3810
02:54:44.321 --> 02:54:46.420
<v Speaker 1>You know the concept of simulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

3811
02:54:46.421 --> 02:54:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3812
02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The concept being for those are not </v>

3813
02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:54.391
<v Speaker 1>aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that one day we were going to not </v>

3814
02:54:54.391 --> 02:54:55.450
<v Speaker 1>wait because I'm dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone way smarter than us.</v>

3815
02:54:55.451 --> 02:54:58.570
<v Speaker 1>He's going to figure out a way to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of oculus rift thing,</v>

3816
02:54:58.571 --> 02:55:03.571
<v Speaker 1>next level stuff that we're discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now to a point where it's you </v>

3817
02:55:03.951 --> 02:55:04.400
<v Speaker 1>can't</v>

3818
02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:06.740
<v Speaker 2>tell the difference between this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

3819
02:55:06.770 --> 02:55:11.770
<v Speaker 2>It is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to eventually figure it </v>

3820
02:55:11.770 --> 02:55:14.441
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like the stuff that we're looking </v>

3821
02:55:14.441 --> 02:55:16.331
<v Speaker 2>at right now is sort of the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>stages of this inevitable technology </v>

3822
02:55:16.331 --> 02:55:20.231
<v Speaker 2>that's going to transform via whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever mode that they figured out how </v>

3823
02:55:21.231 --> 02:55:23.750
<v Speaker 2>to do and you're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an artificial reality.</v>

3824
02:55:23.751 --> 02:55:26.180
<v Speaker 2>It's indistinguishable from reality that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we currently experience.</v>

3825
02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:31.510
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we know that we haven't already </v>

3826
02:55:31.510 --> 02:55:32.990
<v Speaker 2>gotten there and why would they tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

3827
02:55:32.991 --> 02:55:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Why would you not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>

3828
02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:37.700
<v Speaker 2>if you are in a virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are in an artificial,</v>

3829
02:55:37.701 --> 02:55:41.540
<v Speaker 2>simulated version of the world we live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and it's so good,</v>

3830
02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:46.750
<v Speaker 2>you can't distinguish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know that it's not already </v>

3831
02:55:46.750 --> 02:55:49.181
<v Speaker 2>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what's going on right </v>

3832
02:55:49.181 --> 02:55:49.181
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

3833
02:55:49.181 --> 02:55:51.640
<v Speaker 3>and there's one mode of strand of </v>
<v Speaker 3>logical argument in that philosophy </v>

3834
02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:56.291
<v Speaker 3>which says that big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're probably likely to invent that </v>

3835
02:55:56.811 --> 02:56:00.290
<v Speaker 3>kind of technology and a fairly fairly </v>
<v Speaker 3>early in the evolution of our,</v>

3836
02:56:00.410 --> 02:56:03.560
<v Speaker 3>of the human rights of our civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about the dinosaurs,</v>

3837
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:05.150
<v Speaker 3>having lived for hundreds of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

3838
02:56:05.151 --> 02:56:07.580
<v Speaker 3>we've only been around for a few hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand or something,</v>

3839
02:56:07.850 --> 02:56:10.070
<v Speaker 3>then we're probably going to get to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>point really soon.</v>

3840
02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Then this argument says it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very likely that we actually are in the </v>

3841
02:56:15.550 --> 02:56:19.991
<v Speaker 3>simulation already because we've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of years in the </v>

3842
02:56:19.991 --> 02:56:20.330
<v Speaker 3>simulation and only maybe 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

3843
02:56:20.331 --> 02:56:22.940
<v Speaker 3>not in the simulation at the very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dawn of our species.</v>

3844
02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:26.150
<v Speaker 3>So odds are we're probably already in </v>
