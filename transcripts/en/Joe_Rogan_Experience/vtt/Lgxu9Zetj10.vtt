<v Speaker 1>fucking hang in there.</v>

12
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>hit all those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's dirt on you.</v>

13
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>You're a part of skank fest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's going to be.</v>

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of grabbing by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postseason.</v>

15
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>You're on a podcast called the legion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>skanks.</v>

16
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.223
<v Speaker 1>It's could be introduced in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential debate and then I have to </v>

17
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was my shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

19
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>but you would do it just like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would start laughing.</v>

20
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>We're realizing that this just do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a politician or I'd be like,</v>

21
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.553
<v Speaker 1>I repudiated that show years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I no longer associate with big joker </v>

22
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.520
<v Speaker 1>seven dude speaking in which they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiener in the pokey today.</v>

23
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Twenty one months in jail for sexting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was a 15 year old.</v>

24
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.833
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single handedly probably changed </v>

26
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she really did,</v>

28
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>but he changed it through Dick Pics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which.</v>

29
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>How else were you going to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>America in 2017?</v>

30
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>The road edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Windier.</v>

31
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>It gets hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the post?</v>

32
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>The Post is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever writes for the post,</v>

33
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn they have some fucking great </v>
<v Speaker 1>headlines.</v>

34
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Wiener gets hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

35
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.850
<v Speaker 1>you know what's horrible is before all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened,</v>

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>he was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy could have been the president.</v>

37
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had that politiciany thing.</v>

38
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was he and he was like for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>young politician on the fast track.</v>

39
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

40
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do think Hilary Clinton.</v>

41
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it was such a close race </v>

42
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>that any little thing probably could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have made the difference.</v>

43
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>So you could blame any number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>

44
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.953
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the FBI coming out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reopening and investigation on you like </v>

45
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.123
<v Speaker 1>less than two weeks before an election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty tough to get over </v>

46
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>politically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in any normal year,</v>

47
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>any candidate would be buried by the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all that,</v>

48
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>lock her up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lock her up.</v>

49
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can survive that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The FBI is looking into it.</v>

50
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.670
<v Speaker 1>All the people that don't want to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it any further than the surface,</v>

51
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>they immediately go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

52
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>we fucking got heads over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

53
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think there's also just in terms </v>

54
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:33.050
<v Speaker 1>of the politics and the way people work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something about Anthony Wiener</v>

55
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:33.884
<v Speaker 1>were so it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made the American public think about </v>

56
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>him again.</v>

57
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.443
<v Speaker 1>And trump was bringing the women who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusing Bill Clinton of rape to the </v>

58
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:43.000
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the average person just kind</v>

59
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:43.850
<v Speaker 1>of went like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

60
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your husband is a sexual Predator art</v>

61
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 1>and your best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her husband is also a sexual predator.</v>

62
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Like who the fuck are these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck are you that the story for.</v>

63
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's one of the that got me about</v>

64
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:00.694
<v Speaker 1>Fox News because Fox News has always </v>
<v Speaker 1>been the voice of conservative America </v>

65
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

66
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:08.344
<v Speaker 1>These staunch verse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the staunch Voice of conservative </v>

67
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.573
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet all this sex stuff comes out </v>

68
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.383
<v Speaker 1>like the bill o'reilly tapes where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was calling up as whoever the girl was </v>

69
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>and saying crazy shit with a loofa </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponge.</v>

70
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Remember all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

71
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I read about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy,</v>

72
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>but they had recordings of it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

73
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

74
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:29.314
<v Speaker 1>all the women that accused him of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment and sexual harassment with </v>

75
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>other people and other people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending Dick pics and like,</v>

76
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are freaks.</v>

77
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really crazy about it was that so</v>

78
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Roger Ailes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the head of the network,</v>

79
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.443
<v Speaker 1>she went down first for sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment and then as soon as he was </v>

80
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:48.184
<v Speaker 1>down like a whole bunch of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>started going back and then you really </v>

81
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>start wondering like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

82
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Like was it just like a new guy isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting us sexually harass anymore?</v>

83
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.480
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

84
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just there was a culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they could get away with before the</v>

85
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:04.324
<v Speaker 1>Internet where they were the bosses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the women were the underlings and they </v>

86
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:07.804
<v Speaker 1>all felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's probably a lot of </v>

87
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>dynamics plan there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a power situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man,</v>

89
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.063
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's the boss is in position </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's also women that are </v>

90
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.084
<v Speaker 1>attracted to power figures and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also this conservative like </v>

91
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>really repressed environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which always leads to freak shit.</v>

92
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>It always does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>We have like people buttoned down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always lead to frequently.</v>

94
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:32.450
<v Speaker 1>They have to find a way out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

95
00:04:32.451 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>It's got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

96
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say to people,</v>

97
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in New York City,</v>

98
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a bar in the financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>district,</v>

99
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.230
<v Speaker 1>like right after work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really crazy scene.</v>

100
00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Something interesting like the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic you're talking about.</v>

101
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Whereas these people who are all day </v>
<v Speaker 1>working in this crazy like this and then</v>

102
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:51.844
<v Speaker 1>like the ties are loosen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's this like drinking and they </v>

103
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>take their shoes off at the bar and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

104
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:56.734
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are getting slapped on the ass </v>

105
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.470
<v Speaker 1>like crazy shit is going on that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't think your banker,</v>

106
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.383
<v Speaker 1>you know the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who runs your retirement </v>

107
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

108
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:05.044
<v Speaker 1>Because like we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>before with like before the podcast </v>

109
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>started with like these ancient reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

110
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>there's an ancient reward system for </v>
<v Speaker 1>plundering.</v>

111
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.453
<v Speaker 1>I really believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these guys feel like their </v>

112
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>goddamn pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're plundering,</v>

113
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.310
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're part of the financial market and</v>

114
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:20.144
<v Speaker 1>then they're doing shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to fucking check and take </v>

115
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grab each other,</v>

116
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fucking take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take them down.</v>

117
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.443
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you think about the </v>

118
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:30.514
<v Speaker 1>acquisition of property of goods or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that throughout human </v>

119
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea of like a,</v>

120
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:36.124
<v Speaker 1>just a theory of just acquisition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>property is like relatively new and the </v>

121
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>way everything was acquired for all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history was through conquest.</v>

122
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.030
<v Speaker 1>you take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take other people's Shit and you got</v>

124
00:05:47.031 --> 00:05:47.864
<v Speaker 1>to think that like a hostile takeover </v>
<v Speaker 1>must feel incredibly like sacking the </v>

125
00:05:50.961 --> 00:05:52.050
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

126
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

127
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>that's from Wall Street from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name wasn't Wall Street.</v>

128
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.360
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A wolf of Wall Street.</v>

129
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>That was a great scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people resonate.</v>

131
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.600
<v Speaker 1>That scene resonated with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucking going.</v>

132
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucking going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody said it's like being above</v>

133
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:15.041
<v Speaker 1>the system kind of tapping in just same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way football taps in.</v>

134
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.593
<v Speaker 1>It's tapping into this ancient reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>system for plundering when men get </v>

135
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:21.554
<v Speaker 1>together and they fuck up other men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take all their shit and then we kick </v>

136
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable how much.</v>

137
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I thought about this a lot this last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year through the election,</v>

138
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.123
<v Speaker 1>but like it's unbelievable how much like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that football team dynamic is just the </v>

139
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:34.574
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like human beings love to get </v>

140
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:37.934
<v Speaker 1>into a stadium to be like red team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue team identified with one team and </v>

141
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:43.154
<v Speaker 1>lose their freaking minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally lose their minds and </v>

142
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 1>that's when they know it's meaningless.</v>

143
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just about a ball crossing a line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has absolutely no.</v>

144
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.370
<v Speaker 1>We'll still bring God into it with brand</v>
<v Speaker 1>team into all these.</v>

145
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.473
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see like with this trump thing now </v>

146
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:57.284
<v Speaker 1>that he just stepped on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and Jamie were joking around before </v>

147
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>we started like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's like he,</v>

148
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>he liked threatening nuclear war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulted Steph curry in,</v>

149
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>in one thought I'd ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What did you say?</v>

152
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.323

<v Speaker 1>like this is just what gets them </v>

153
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>interested.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like what we'd like is a squabble </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the leader of the free world who</v>

156

193
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

194
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

195
00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:57.864
<v Speaker 2>how crazy it is to see that this is all </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on while Puerto Rico has no power </v>

196
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 2>and only five percent of it has cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone service.</v>

197
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to talk about.</v>

198
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.393
<v Speaker 2>There's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird racist thing that we </v>

199
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 2>will like if that was an island filled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with white people,</v>

200
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.293
<v Speaker 2>do you really truly think it was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>island filled with white people that </v>

201
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 2>spoke perfect English and it sounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like us.</v>

202
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we have so little coverage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Puerto Rico the way we do now?</v>

203
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico is technically a part of the</v>

204
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a state,</v>

205
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's technically like we had on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Schiff.</v>

206
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.143
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Turns out you can only predict the </v>

216
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 2>subprime mortgage crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not acts of God.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Pilots about.</v>

233
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Definitely can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

234
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:05.940
<v Speaker 2>that might be like one of the V perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>events in human history.</v>

235
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Forget about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

236
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planting the flag and Iud Jima,</v>

237
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.003
<v Speaker 2>this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dude making that face that will be </v>

238
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 2>used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows how many,</v>

239
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 2>countless hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

240
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 2>How many times did that thing been used?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It maybe millions,</v>

241
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

242
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.240
<v Speaker 2>if a youtube video get millions of hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably in the millions.</v>

243
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Millions of times used for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

244
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.573
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a weird fucking time with all </v>

245
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 2>this because we're concentrating so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>on weird stuff.</v>

246
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Like whether or not you should stand for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flag or Neil and first of all,</v>

247
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I think what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

248
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 2>they're protesting cops shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocent people.</v>

249
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.153
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of ineffective on their </v>

250
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:52.290
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the message,</v>

251
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 2>because you have to listen to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>

252
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you don't like America,</v>

253
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.093
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what people have a problem with </v>

254
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:58.324
<v Speaker 2>and trump's plan on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they get down on one knee and you </v>

255
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:01.601
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

256
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:04.410
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of weird because it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>respectful as all.</v>

257
00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:05.244
<v Speaker 2>Also getting down on one knee for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flag is actually more respectful than </v>

258
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:10.990
<v Speaker 2>putting your hand over your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really weird.</v>

259
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they.</v>

260
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.580
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to be protesting cops </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have shot innocent unarmed people,</v>

261
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:18.544
<v Speaker 2>which have been a fuck load of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a weird way to do it because </v>

262
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it during the anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The anthem isn't those cops.</v>

263
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.140
<v Speaker 2>The anthem is all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's.</v>

264
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.093
<v Speaker 2>It's a shitty way to divide because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really making a whole lot of sense </v>

265
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:31.894
<v Speaker 2>because the people who wrote the star </v>
<v Speaker 2>spangled banner who were singing it </v>

266
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:35.284
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who have sung it all </v>

267
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:38.164
<v Speaker 2>throughout the years and stood there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they aren't the ones that shot those </v>

268
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 2>unarmed people.</v>

269
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 2>What you have is a cop who was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a nervous wreck,</v>

270
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 2>most likely has been operating with ptsd</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the past five,</v>

271
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.040
<v Speaker 2>six fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have friends that are cops.</v>

272
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.353
<v Speaker 2>A few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

273
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.960
<v Speaker 2>They tell you crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

274
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

275
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I know a bunch of cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially from Jujitsu.</v>

276
00:12:57.311 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I know a ton of cops and and from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC as well.</v>

277
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.850
<v Speaker 2>They tell you some fucking horror </v>
<v Speaker 2>stores,</v>

278
00:13:02.851 --> 00:13:06.120
<v Speaker 2>things that they have to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they stumble upon a crime scene.</v>

279
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Guys got half his fucking head missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people chopped up,</v>

280
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of dark,</v>

281
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:13.690
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark shit and it's in their head all the</v>

282
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've had buddies get shot in the face</v>

283
00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

284
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.650
<v Speaker 2>routine traffic stops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's freaked out because over the</v>

285
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 2>course of 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a police officer.</v>

286
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 2>You have seen a fucking amazing amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit,</v>

287
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 2>probably unfit for the job.</v>

288
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 2>These guys that are shooting people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we think about the vast number of people</v>

289
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.310
<v Speaker 2>that are cops that aren't doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>

290
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.163
<v Speaker 2>all the interactions were concentrating </v>
<v Speaker 2>on these terrible things that obviously </v>

291
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no defense for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

292
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:39.911
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

293
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:40.271
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

294
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Defending someone shooting a 13 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy with a plastic gun.</v>

295
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.433
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no defending any of the crazy </v>

296
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:47.014
<v Speaker 2>stuff that we saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guy who shot the guy and he had </v>

297
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.050
<v Speaker 2>planted the Taser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no defending any of this.</v>

298
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:50.884
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how many interactions are cops </v>

299
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 2>having with people where this doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

300
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.180
<v Speaker 2>A fuckload man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's keep some perspective because</v>

301
00:13:58.181 --> 00:13:59.014
<v Speaker 2>the other end and if you live in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>country with 320 million people and you </v>

302
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.570
<v Speaker 2>see one incident or a few incidents </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

303
00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:05.520
<v Speaker 2>there's no perspective there so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>find it.</v>

304
00:14:05.521 --> 00:14:06.354
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any example to paint whatever narrative </v>

305
00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 2>you want to.</v>

306
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.670
<v Speaker 2>If you're just going off random </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples.</v>

307
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.100
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like it.</v>

308
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It's really frustrating for me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole.</v>

309
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like the whole trump thing and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole moment we're in now,</v>

310
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.160
<v Speaker 2>it's all about a culture war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what it's really about.</v>

311
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not about politics or policy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

312
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:24.754
<v Speaker 2>It's really a culture war and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have here and this is why everyone gets </v>

313
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:27.784
<v Speaker 2>so into the kneeling for the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>anthem thing because it's symbolic of </v>

314
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.200
<v Speaker 2>two cultures and to me it's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

315
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I see the worst in both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really frustrating.</v>

316
00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:40.801
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the left wing thing is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bash America with no perspective,</v>

317
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 2>like no fucking perspective at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

318
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>

319
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:46.594
<v Speaker 2>So there'll be protesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like cops being shot or something </v>

320
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:49.324
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can say certainly there are </v>

321
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>legitimate cases of that and I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who</v>

322
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.390
<v Speaker 3>believes we have like a real real police</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in America and,</v>

323
00:14:55.391 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 3>and we have like just insane amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrests for nonviolent crimes,</v>

324
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 3>really fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shangri mass incarceration,</v>

325
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:03.750
<v Speaker 3>all these fucked up things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

326
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.203
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that being said like there's also </v>

327
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 3>justifiable shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot cops do,</v>

328
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.363
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

329
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 3>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have these people taking a neat.</v>

330
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:11.084
<v Speaker 3>But it's kind of like symbolic to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who aren't on the left of this culture </v>

331
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 3>of like everything over the law on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left is just like anti America,</v>

332
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 3>anti capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anti White Man,</v>

333
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:24.830
<v Speaker 3>anti man in general and anti Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization with no perspective,</v>

334
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.920
<v Speaker 3>like no perspective of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

335
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.880
<v Speaker 3>just like Americans is white supremacist</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

336
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.511
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

337
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like compared to what,</v>

338
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.800
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying it doesn't exist,</v>

339
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like when they say like we live</v>

340
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 3>in a rape culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what does that mean?</v>

341
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 3>If I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in a robbery culture,</v>

342
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 3>there are robberies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but compared to what?</v>

343
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 3>So if you're going to say we're a white </v>
<v Speaker 3>supremacy culture,</v>

344
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:44.683
<v Speaker 3>to me it's kind of like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like saying America is a poor </v>

345
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:48.750
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

346
00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:49.584
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose compared to some richer </v>

347
00:15:50.371 --> 00:15:51.204
<v Speaker 3>country in the future that's figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit out that we haven't compared </v>

348
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 3>to everything else that's ever existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're a rich country.</v>

349
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Speaker 3>So if you're talking about white </v>
<v Speaker 3>supremacy,</v>

350
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

351
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.840
<v Speaker 3>by and large were probably the best like</v>
<v Speaker 3>melting pot and most diverse,</v>

352
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 3>most inclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

353
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we feel more guilty for the sins of</v>

354
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:08.910
<v Speaker 3>our past than pretty much any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>country commercial.</v>

355
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.730
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know any country that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

356
00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:14.540
<v Speaker 3>it's like America was founded by </v>
<v Speaker 3>conquest of the native Americans.</v>

357
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:14.931
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

358
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:16.720
<v Speaker 3>And so as every single other country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

359
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.220
<v Speaker 3>and every country had slavery in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>country had all these things.</v>

360
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not no one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>150 years ago,</v>

361
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't exist.</v>

362
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you have some perspective,</v>

363
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 3>the left wing thing gets pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrating after awhile.</v>

364
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then on the,</v>

365
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 3>on the trump side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've kind of been more sympathetic to</v>

366
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:33.734
<v Speaker 3>the right than the left probably over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last year and a half because I </v>

367
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:36.164
<v Speaker 3>really do see like the issue of our time</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming this like are you for free </v>

368
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:40.244
<v Speaker 3>speech are against free speech that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me is like really because we don't </v>

369
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 3>really figure things out unless we get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to debate them.</v>

370
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.820
<v Speaker 3>We can't have been topics and we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>have topics that are supercharged to the</v>

371
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:52.850
<v Speaker 3>point where they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a position on them.</v>

372
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't explore them.</v>

373
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.330
<v Speaker 3>There is a real powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

374
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

375
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.770
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

376
00:16:57.771 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 3>it's one reason I think there's many </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>

377
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:01.010
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of the most important.</v>

378
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Like why we need free speech because </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you fucking.</v>

379
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 3>Unless you come from the position of I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have everything 100 percent correct.</v>

380
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.353
<v Speaker 3>Like then maybe you need to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation and someone has a </v>

381
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:10.784
<v Speaker 3>conversation back with you because odds </v>
<v Speaker 3>are you don't have everything 100 </v>

382
00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 3>percent correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's their correct versus your correct.</v>

383
00:17:15.591 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Like they're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Gender Quality?</v>

384
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 3>They're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is transgender rights?</v>

385
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 3>They're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Socialism there?</v>

386
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is like,</v>

387
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:23.993
<v Speaker 3>and if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm talking about people far </v>

388
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not talking about you.</v>

389
00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:28.304
<v Speaker 3>If you're listening just I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the hypothetical extreme far left </v>

390
00:17:31.611 --> 00:17:36.300
<v Speaker 3>person that is protesting Ben Shapiro on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley campus calling him a Nazi,</v>

391
00:17:36.301 --> 00:17:37.730
<v Speaker 3>but this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't just,</v>

392
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a right,</v>

393
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:40.094
<v Speaker 3>it's not you're making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a hypothetical </v>

394
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:41.804
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously this is happening in </v>

395
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:43.394
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They exist lots of them and there's </v>

396
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.150
<v Speaker 3>enough to the point where like it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this real thing where,</v>

397
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:47.984
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the great threat to free speech and </v>

398
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 3>our time isn't coming from the state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

399
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 3>like as a libertarian that would be more</v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable to my narrative.</v>

400
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:55.913
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what I've been thinking for </v>
<v Speaker 3>years is the great threat to free </v>

401
00:17:58.081 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

402
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 3>it's coming from this left wing culture </v>
<v Speaker 3>that says a right.</v>

403
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:07.011
<v Speaker 3>Like Ben Shapiro can't speak Milo </v>
<v Speaker 3>Yiannopoulos can't speak Condoleeza Rice</v>

404
00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 3>can't speak about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

405
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.403
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson need </v>

406
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:14.380
<v Speaker 3>to be silenced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>

407
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 3>My only problem with those two is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to moderate.</v>

408
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Like these are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are not bigots,</v>

409
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.393
<v Speaker 3>these are not these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are intellectuals making an </v>

410
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 3>intellectual argument and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even speak.</v>

411
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very scary.</v>

412
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:26.844
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing I would just </v>
<v Speaker 3>say on this left wing culture and is </v>

413
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:31.860
<v Speaker 3>what cabarnet kind of embodies to meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>is just the,</v>

414
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.830
<v Speaker 3>it's this frustrating ignorance like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this client.</v>

415
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.733
<v Speaker 3>So you'll be protesting police brutality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mass incarceration and then like </v>

416
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 3>you'll put a Castro image on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacket.</v>

417
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:47.761
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

418
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

419
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Come on dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

420
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you can't stand up for something and </v>
<v Speaker 3>swing and miss that big like that.</v>

421
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.370
<v Speaker 3>So like you got to research a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

422
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean do five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the information is on your phone.</v>

423
00:18:59.010 --> 00:18:59.843
<v Speaker 3>Like I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's that and I get being against </v>

424
00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:03.714
<v Speaker 3>that and I want to be like on the free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech side and I see a lot of these </v>

425
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:06.924
<v Speaker 3>guys like who will bring up like Steven </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowder and Ben Shapiro guys you've had </v>

426
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.430
<v Speaker 3>on your show who I really admire a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're fighting against that.</v>

427
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.870
<v Speaker 3>And Jordan Peterson fighting against </v>
<v Speaker 3>that anti authoritarian authoritarian pc</v>

428
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.853
<v Speaker 3>antifreeze speech stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of more sympathetic to the </v>

429
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's this thing with the nfl</v>

430
00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:23.130
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it really just reminds me of all the</v>

431
00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 3>cultural aspects of the right that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate,</v>

432
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.790
<v Speaker 3>which is when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

433
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.773
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's standing for freedom of </v>

434
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.100
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

435
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty fucking troubled by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president of the United States,</v>

436
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.743
<v Speaker 3>the man who's in control of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful army in the military and the </v>

437
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:38.340
<v Speaker 3>history of human humanity coming out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

438
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.070
<v Speaker 3>I think if someone takes a need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should be fired.</v>

439
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.180
<v Speaker 3>Now that may not be writing a law </v>
<v Speaker 3>against a speech,</v>

440
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.510
<v Speaker 3>but that's pretty fucking chilling to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have like the government telling you,</v>

441
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.141
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

442
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:49.974
<v Speaker 3>what would please me is if you started </v>
<v Speaker 3>firing people when they spoke out </v>

443
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.480
<v Speaker 3>against me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that.</v>

444
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.600
<v Speaker 3>And this fucking right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like praise the flag.</v>

445
00:19:57.601 --> 00:19:59.600
<v Speaker 3>And if you say anything against it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

446
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.230
<v Speaker 3>you're in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like religious,</v>

447
00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:02.064
<v Speaker 3>like it's blast for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a criticize the troops or </v>

448
00:20:03.961 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 3>criticized the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck that.</v>

449
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a power issue.</v>

450
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.250
<v Speaker 3>When I was going to say earlier is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were talking about the state,</v>

451
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.820
<v Speaker 3>when you were talking about the fear of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the state and the censorship coming from</v>

452
00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:17.510
<v Speaker 3>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing because the state is</v>

453
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.380
<v Speaker 3>just power and the far left is power too</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's power with shame and with blogs</v>

454
00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:23.214
<v Speaker 3>and with protests and it is the power </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're trying to exercise to get </v>

455
00:20:26.821 --> 00:20:29.880
<v Speaker 3>you to behave the way they want you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the right does the same thing.</v>

456
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 3>I think what we should have if we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna,</v>

457
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.740
<v Speaker 3>if we're gonna really keep doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole,</v>

458
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.633
<v Speaker 3>we're a country thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should have like an armistice when </v>

459
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:39.883
<v Speaker 3>then this is I think reasonable people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reasonable people have an issue with </v>

460
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 3>this idea of desecrating the flag </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the flag is just a flag and it's</v>

461
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 3>not important,</v>

462
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.670
<v Speaker 1>but what is important is that we treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other like we're a team and we look</v>

463
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 1>out for each other and we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and we're all united together.</v>

464
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we have an issue,</v>

465
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 1>our issue should be with communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships across the world that have</v>

466
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons that are holding their </v>
<v Speaker 1>people captive,</v>

467
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.170
<v Speaker 1>like if it was ever a time to look at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and go,</v>

468
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:09.004
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a country that is in an unjust </v>

469
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:11.794
<v Speaker 1>position and it's a really terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>dilemma that you have this murderous </v>

470
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.383
<v Speaker 1>dictator who's in control of nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons and he has an entire country of </v>

471
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:20.344
<v Speaker 1>people enslaved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what's going on in </v>

472
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:23.501
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

473
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:25.730
<v Speaker 1>It's basically like a giant hostage </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that's,</v>

474
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.583
<v Speaker 1>that's a real giant issue to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not whether or not transgender </v>

475
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 1>people can use the fucking males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men's room or the women's room.</v>

476
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not our issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

477
00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:35.184
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a cultural conversation and that </v>

478
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:38.014
<v Speaker 1>cultural conversation should become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we should be friendly to each other </v>

479
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:42.620
<v Speaker 1>because we're supposed to be on the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>team though.</v>

480
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.473
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that stuff with the like the </v>

481
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:46.670
<v Speaker 1>transgender bathrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to say man,</v>

482
00:21:46.671 --> 00:21:48.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's really weird for me sometimes I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't.</v>

483
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.773
<v Speaker 1>I can't even believe I hold some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions I do because I grew up like a </v>

484
00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:53.850
<v Speaker 1>kind of left wing kid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I was raised by a single mom in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

486
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:56.764
<v Speaker 1>I kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of where I belong </v>

487
00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 1>culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really can't,</v>

488
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the Kooky conservatives</v>

489
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious coogee conservatives who I</v>

490
00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:07.630
<v Speaker 1>just dismissed for years is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just insane.</v>

491
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.823
<v Speaker 1>Had more of like they had a grain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth that I didn't realize they'd be </v>

492
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:12.961
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

493
00:22:12.961 --> 00:22:13.794
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't legalize gay marriage or </v>

494
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 1>they'll start coming after the kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

495
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just insane.</v>

496
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Anybody like gay marriage gets legalized</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

497
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.223
<v Speaker 1>Like the next year they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids should be able to take hormones to </v>

498
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:24.161
<v Speaker 1>suppress the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

499
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of weird.</v>

500
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.813
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird to me that the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't take like a minute to celebrate </v>

501
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:33.094
<v Speaker 1>this victory on gay marriage that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been fighting for like my entire </v>

502
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:37.900
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got a huge victory.</v>

503
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.833
<v Speaker 1>The Supreme Court came in and forced it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the remaining 20 states or so who </v>

504
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 1>weren't ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We weren't going to vote for it.</v>

505
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.550
<v Speaker 1>They forced it on them and there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big backlash like that.</v>

506
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 1>One chick went to jail for like three </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

507
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the one in Oklahoma with </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay folks,</v>

508
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Wendy Davis Owens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she and then it's not like,</v>

509
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.013
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like this wave of Republicans </v>

510
00:22:57.131 --> 00:22:59.130
<v Speaker 1>who rose up like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to repeal it.</v>

511
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 1>We're going to write a law to reverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>that supreme court decision.</v>

512
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:01.931
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

513
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:04.570
<v Speaker 1>actually they elected the first pro gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage president.</v>

514
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like you won on this issue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately as soon as they won,</v>

515
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:09.610
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now transgender bathrooms.</v>

516
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Now this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

517
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're related.</v>

518
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

519
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.933
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay marriage thing is consenting </v>

520
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:18.784
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be able to do whatever they </v>

521
00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:20.224
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between gay people and </v>

522
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 1>transgender people is pretty radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No great.</v>

523
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:30.130
<v Speaker 1>If almost the same difference as between</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight people and gay people there.</v>

524
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.050
<v Speaker 1>But they're in the same four letters </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the left,</v>

525
00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:37.210
<v Speaker 1>but that whole Lbgtq a plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is now,</v>

526
00:23:37.211 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of new ones that they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>added on asexual.</v>

527
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.413
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

528
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually insulting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they lumped them together as if it's the</v>

529
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:44.021
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

530
00:23:44.021 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a weird that when trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted the thing</v>

531
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 2>about trans people not being able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>serve in the military,</v>

532
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.573
<v Speaker 2>I saw a bunch of people being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump has come out against lgbt rights </v>

533
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.193
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell does this have to do with </v>

534
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:56.270
<v Speaker 2>lg?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or be like,</v>

535
00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that crazy?</v>

536
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.310
<v Speaker 2>They're just a gang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lump it all together.</v>

537
00:23:59.311 --> 00:24:01.930
<v Speaker 2>A big progressive gang of acronyms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

538
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.853
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always going to say about all </v>

539
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 2>this stuff being lumped in together is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the left has been the side that has</v>

540
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Speaker 2>looked towards the hard science when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to global warming.</v>

541
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:12.494
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hard science when it comes to </v>

542
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:13.754
<v Speaker 2>climate data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the ones that are always </v>

543
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.970
<v Speaker 2>pushing whether they're right or wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>or getting the right data.</v>

544
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:17.804
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones that are really harping</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the science and if you looked in </v>

545
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:26.270
<v Speaker 2>terms of the amount of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>working in universities,</v>

546
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 2>there are far more left than there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>far more left.</v>

547
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Professors now are right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you would think,</v>

548
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:31.994
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have this base of academia and </v>

549
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:34.184
<v Speaker 2>knowledge on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet the left is the side that's </v>

550
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:38.714
<v Speaker 2>willing to entertain the idea that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>young kid should take hormones to alter </v>

551
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.813
<v Speaker 2>their sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you know for a fucking fact that </v>

552
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 2>when you're a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're extremely confused,</v>

553
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:51.980
<v Speaker 2>constantly back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>

554
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.130
<v Speaker 2>There are hormonal changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cerebral cortex,</v>

555
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 2>the frontal cortex isn't even really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fully develop.</v>

556
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:01.970
<v Speaker 2>They don't say you're a real fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed until you're like 25 if you're</v>

557
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:02.804
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which explains a lot of the shit that I </v>

558
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:05.810
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

559
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people listening that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 and retarded that like,</v>

560
00:25:09.271 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I doing with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

561
00:25:11.241 --> 00:25:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're barely an adult.</v>

562
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:13.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about things you do at </v>

563
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:14.684
<v Speaker 2>like 22 and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm the same human </v>

564
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so this same party,</v>

565
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:21.434
<v Speaker 2>the same progressive mindset that is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly open minded but yet also so </v>

566
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:26.474
<v Speaker 2>deeply embedded in academia like far </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than the right is this is the side </v>

567
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.933
<v Speaker 2>that is willing to put aside all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know about biology and psychology </v>

568
00:25:36.591 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 2>and physiology and children.</v>

569
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Put aside that a lot of people are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>all in one lump.</v>

570
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:42.764
<v Speaker 2>Anybody together put aside that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Progressive Brownie points for saying </v>

571
00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:47.744
<v Speaker 2>that you are so incredibly open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this child obviously knows that he </v>

572
00:25:50.871 --> 00:25:51.704
<v Speaker 2>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She or she is a he and we need to start </v>

573
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 2>addressing them as that and this is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fact.</v>

574
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a fact.</v>

575
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a conversation that we should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it varies in individuals and</v>

576
00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:02.324
<v Speaker 2>I think there are some people that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have personally talked to the </v>

577
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:04.664
<v Speaker 2>transgender people that for sure are </v>
<v Speaker 2>happier being a woman or a man and they </v>

578
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:10.460
<v Speaker 2>were born in what they feel is the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

579
00:26:10.461 --> 00:26:14.120
<v Speaker 2>And I absolutely 100 percent salute </v>
<v Speaker 2>their right to go out and do that,</v>

580
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.553
<v Speaker 2>but we should have a real conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>as to how many people is that really </v>

581
00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:19.904
<v Speaker 2>happening to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of these people have a </v>

582
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:25.130
<v Speaker 2>psychological issue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people.</v>

583
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Is there a physical trait that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing?</v>

584
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.680
<v Speaker 2>Is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

585
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.130
<v Speaker 2>some switch that gets flipped when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're young?</v>

586
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.093
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a fascinating aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings that you are one sex and </v>

587
00:26:34.851 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 2>wish you were another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

588
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 2>And it seems strange to me that on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left the rules always seem to be.</v>

589
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 2>There's this topic like it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left forever.</v>

590
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

591
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 3>always like we need to have a national </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation about race.</v>

592
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 3>But if you say the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you ruined.</v>

593
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

594
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same thing with like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender thing.</v>

595
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:54.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like they want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like we want to have a conversation</v>

596
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:56.670
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put this forward as like this is an</v>

597
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:58.230
<v Speaker 3>issue we need to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also,</v>

598
00:26:58.231 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to say anything.</v>

599
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:00.923
<v Speaker 3>So if you bring up the 40 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide rate and say maybe this isn't </v>

600
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:03.954
<v Speaker 3>due to societal oppression because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no real link between societal </v>

601
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:09.760
<v Speaker 3>oppression and high suicide rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you need to be fired or something,</v>

602
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say 40 percent of transgender people </v>

603
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 3>commit suicide and the people that want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to support the idea that there's not any</v>

604
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:19.040
<v Speaker 3>sort of a mental illness in any people </v>
<v Speaker 3>on shore.</v>

605
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.120
<v Speaker 3>It's not in some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not generalizing,</v>

606
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.790
<v Speaker 3>but it must be in some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

607
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.083
<v Speaker 3>The people that want to deny that side </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reason why they are suicidal is </v>

608
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:31.350
<v Speaker 3>because they don't get a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>express their genuine,</v>

609
00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:33.630
<v Speaker 3>authentic self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very good point.</v>

610
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.710
<v Speaker 3>So it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that either or.</v>

611
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:36.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

612
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:36.913
<v Speaker 3>I'm open to the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the argument that the 40 percent is </v>

613
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.453
<v Speaker 3>possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's maybe a combination of those two </v>

614
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:43.643
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's some people that are </v>

615
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:45.144
<v Speaker 3>mentally ill that are suicidal in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place and they hope that maybe </v>

616
00:27:47.221 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Speaker 3>becoming a woman would make them feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and it didn't work out.</v>

617
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.560
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole website where people,</v>

618
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.853
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called transgender regret </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that and it's all </v>

619
00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:56.934
<v Speaker 3>people that switched over and we're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>really upset that they did it and then </v>

620
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 3>realized it was like some strange phrase</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going through or whatever,</v>

621
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.250
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

622
00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.163
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are sure suicidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they want to be one way and </v>

623
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.690
<v Speaker 3>people just constantly shit on them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullied him and heckle them and they,</v>

624
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.410
<v Speaker 3>that's what's causing them to be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply.</v>

625
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not like one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

626
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 3>And I think in every individual case </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably like a complex,</v>

627
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.060
<v Speaker 3>a complex set of different cause causing</v>
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>

628
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

629
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how low,</v>

630
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 3>obviously I'm for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

631
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.383
<v Speaker 3>like everyone owns their own body and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's able to do whatever they want to </v>

632
00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:35.490
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can find a doctor who was willing</v>

633
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 3>to perform a surgery on you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

634
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 3>whatever surgery you want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

635
00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 3>and I think transgender people should </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the freedom to do that.</v>

636
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Truthfully speaking though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really see anyone.</v>

637
00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:45.204
<v Speaker 3>Not that anyone is in saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really see anyone </v>

638
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.240
<v Speaker 3>disagreeing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

639
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:49.074
<v Speaker 3>like most people seem to agree are </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that think it's a sickness and </v>

640
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.513
<v Speaker 3>they absolutely shouldn't be allowed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is it seems like that's pretty </v>

641
00:28:56.221 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 3>rare.</v>

642
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Like even the people who are getting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of,</v>

643
00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 3>a lot of heat for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their stance on transgender issues.</v>

644
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:03.760
<v Speaker 3>Like I've never heard Gavin mcinnes say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be illegal.</v>

645
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard like Ben Shapiro say it</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be illegal.</v>

646
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.490
<v Speaker 3>What they will say is that I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pretend that you're a what?</v>

647
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 3>You're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to acknowledge that you have a</v>

648
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Speaker 3>y chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that to me is like okay,</v>

649
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:16.560
<v Speaker 3>that has nothing to do with your freedom</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a surgery.</v>

650
00:29:16.561 --> 00:29:17.394
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy has a free freedom of thought </v>

651
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.633
<v Speaker 3>to describe what's going on and it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of crazy like you said with the </v>

652
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:24.720
<v Speaker 3>global warming thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like,</v>

653
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:25.554
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left Prague themselves on being the </v>

654
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 3>science party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we believe in science.</v>

655
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.583
<v Speaker 3>Although the problem is that I try very </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to like wrap my head around all of </v>

656
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:36.414
<v Speaker 3>these different issues and I've read a </v>
<v Speaker 3>decent amount on climate change and I'm </v>

657
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 3>pretty tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty tough stuff.</v>

658
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not</v>

659
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like some of these other issues</v>

660
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:44.464
<v Speaker 1>that are much easier to understand and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>will say that about 90 percent of the </v>

661
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 1>people on the left who are like have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

662
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.223
<v Speaker 1>they haven't looked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've just been told this is the </v>

663
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 1>science and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh great.</v>

664
00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:53.794
<v Speaker 1>Now I get to bash people by having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>science because if you're going to say </v>

665
00:29:56.331 --> 00:29:58.720
<v Speaker 1>like you're the side that that believes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in science.</v>

666
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to deny that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological effects on biological effects</v>

667
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:05.524
<v Speaker 1>on gender is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's science as you be such a </v>

668
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 1>small fringe group that do make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>

669
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:14.490
<v Speaker 1>They think that there's no biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in the sexes there.</v>

670
00:30:14.491 --> 00:30:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Those people are really just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of pushed it so far,</v>

671
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 1>they're so far left that there in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy alternative reality.</v>

672
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of those.</v>

673
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I look at it like the same way a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

674
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:25.683
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientologists have like their levels I </v>

675
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 1>look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like left wing ideology,</v>

676
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:30.904
<v Speaker 1>jc or something like the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior who's like out in the front </v>

677
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:39.631
<v Speaker 1>lines protesting Christina Hoff summers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like top level left wing mindset,</v>

678
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:42.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

679
00:30:42.611 --> 00:30:43.444
<v Speaker 1>the idea that gender is a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct is pretty well accepted I </v>

680
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:50.290
<v Speaker 1>think on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me that is insane.</v>

681
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.183
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's only accepted in a very </v>

682
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 1>fringe group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially academics.</v>

683
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.163
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people in school that protest about </v>

684
00:30:58.091 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 1>it and people that are super active </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors.</v>

685
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:02.224
<v Speaker 1>I think if you polled people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they think there's a </v>

686
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 1>biological difference and you gave them </v>
<v Speaker 1>three choices.</v>

687
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.361
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

688
00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And Dha that most people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Da Da,</v>

689
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.110
<v Speaker 1>here's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the only thing I'll just,</v>

690
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

691
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I think you're 100 percent right.</v>

692
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:16.960
<v Speaker 1>If they were taking that test </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymously,</v>

693
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.210
<v Speaker 1>anonymously to put their names behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

694
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd get a much different </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

695
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 1>I talk to college professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my sister's a college professor.</v>

696
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I talked to our friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to other people.</v>

697
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.940
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them will come up to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like this thing,</v>

698
00:31:27.941 --> 00:31:30.550
<v Speaker 1>like at a dinner table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like get close and be like,</v>

699
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

700
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I really agree with you on like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and I'm not,</v>

701
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it'll be like the people who for,</v>

702
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.233
<v Speaker 1>for the one Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who by the way a guy like Jordan </v>

703
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:40.983
<v Speaker 1>Peterson really does beg the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't there more Jordan Peterson's </v>

704
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.273
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it just you and five other </v>

705
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:46.720
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are there not more professors?</v>

706
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.060
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is because they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidated.</v>

707
00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Look at all the shit he's had to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

708
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 1>They're all intimidated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein,</v>

709
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:53.704
<v Speaker 1>who's a super progressive guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's way left and he got shamed </v>

710
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:01.700
<v Speaker 1>and he got like literally threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

711
00:32:01.701 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 1>and now he just won a lawsuit though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just got paid $500,000.</v>

712
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.233
<v Speaker 1>We had him on like right after Evergreen</v>
<v Speaker 1>College had to shut down and kids were </v>

713
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:13.180
<v Speaker 1>patrolling the fucking parking lot with </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball bats.</v>

714
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Looking for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was really crazy,</v>

715
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.003
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

716
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Really crazy stuff that the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

717
00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:20.800
<v Speaker 1>imagine if that was coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

718
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:21.663
<v Speaker 1>you would start calling them Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started calling them white </v>

719
00:32:23.861 --> 00:32:25.900
<v Speaker 1>supremacists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start calling them thugs,</v>

720
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.750
<v Speaker 1>but on the left they conveniently ignore</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same types of pattern.</v>

721
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It's so unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the double standard of life.</v>

722
00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:35.420
<v Speaker 1>A dude will look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have like the,</v>

723
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.303
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that happened in </v>

724
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where you have like,</v>

725
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a few hundred</v>

726
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 3>people marched and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess there were dozens of them at</v>

727
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 3>least at least who were like wearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazi gear,</v>

728
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:48.591
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

729
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:52.760
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's pretty eyeopening and like,</v>

730
00:32:52.761 --> 00:32:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

732
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 3>it's like disturbing and kind of very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It very interesting to me that anyone in</v>

733
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 3>2017 in America is putting a swastika </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

734
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.343
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these dumb fucks got together in public </v>

735
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.553
<v Speaker 3>with lit their face with torches so </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody can take video and photos of </v>

736
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:10.484
<v Speaker 3>them and March student street together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling like blood and soil and all </v>

737
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.803
<v Speaker 3>sorts of weird fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what would the quotes that they do </v>

738
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.420
<v Speaker 3>you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the Jews will not replace us was.</v>

739
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.273
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What can I tell you is that as a Jewish </v>

740
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:23.264
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never felt more empowered in my </v>

741
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:27.770
<v Speaker 3>life than the Jews will not replace what</v>
<v Speaker 3>an unbelievable.</v>

742
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Like I've never even entertained the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of replacing anybody.</v>

743
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.840
<v Speaker 3>And then when they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jews will not replace us.</v>

744
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I think we can replace these </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers got worried about it.</v>

745
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's make a move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews,</v>

746
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.060
<v Speaker 3>let's go replace these Charlottesville.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people were there?</v>

747
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.060
<v Speaker 3>The protest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>100.</v>

748
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.670
<v Speaker 3>I think between three and $400.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

749
00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:48.740
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good size crowd.</v>

750
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.210
<v Speaker 3>That would be psyched if they came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see me,</v>

751
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:52.703
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>

752
00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.180
<v Speaker 3>if I walked into that on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

753
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the line again.</v>

754
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Theater.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we're doing good tonight.</v>

756
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:01.670
<v Speaker 3>And they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty white supremacy in Italy and</v>

757
00:34:01.671 --> 00:34:02.481
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

759
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:06.670
<v Speaker 3>at first I thought it was well lit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can they bring their Tiki torches inside</v>

760
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.523
<v Speaker 3>or a sticker on a dirt outside?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to funny to watch those </v>

761
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 3>fires and how to get to know which </v>
<v Speaker 3>torches yours has got the.</v>

762
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:15.830
<v Speaker 3>We got a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have numbers.</v>

763
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:16.664
<v Speaker 3>We got it all figured out yet she passed</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walmart Torch when you had a nice home </v>

764
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:20.084
<v Speaker 3>depot torch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good solidly constructed American Home </v>

765
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Depot Choice and some dude stole your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and left you with some main Chinese</v>

766
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:28.190
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be.</v>

767
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:31.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll vto bullshit and it's probably just</v>
<v Speaker 3>good enough that you get halfway through</v>

768
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:33.110
<v Speaker 3>the march before you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

769

<v Speaker 3>Look up and you see made in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

770
00:34:36.771 --> 00:34:39.420

<v Speaker 3>little American flag under each.</v>

771
00:34:39.421 --> 00:34:41.630
<v Speaker 3>A little metal bonnet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get real.</v>

772
00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:42.950
<v Speaker 3>They were all made in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

773
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:43.853
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a big market for Tiki </v>

774
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:46.610
<v Speaker 3>torches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

775
00:34:46.611 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 3>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these guys like,</v>

776
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean nobody even like people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>real far ahead on the right wing who are</v>

777
00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 3>like pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

778
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:53.120
<v Speaker 3>considered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

779
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:55.760
<v Speaker 3>like whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Ben Shapiro who was being protested</v>

780
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:56.594
<v Speaker 3>by these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't associate with any of those </v>

781
00:34:58.071 --> 00:34:58.320
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

782
00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.153
<v Speaker 3>I disgusted by them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gavin McInnes won't associate with any </v>

783
00:35:01.281 --> 00:35:02.630
<v Speaker 3>of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's disgusted by them.</v>

784
00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.180
<v Speaker 3>These guys can't even speak at their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>rallies.</v>

785
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.160
<v Speaker 3>They don't come to the right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does a,</v>

786
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I think a fairly decent job at just </v>
<v Speaker 3>being like,</v>

787
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.760
<v Speaker 3>no we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not even associated with trump.</v>

788
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Did Not denounce them correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

789
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.050
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

790
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

791
00:35:18.621 --> 00:35:19.454
<v Speaker 3>from what I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually thought it was a weird </v>

792
00:35:20.511 --> 00:35:22.110
<v Speaker 3>reaction to what trump said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

793
00:35:22.111 --> 00:35:22.944
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what I'm saying is I see this going </v>

794
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:24.614
<v Speaker 3>on here with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the one thing that happened in </v>

795
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:27.404
<v Speaker 3>Charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

796
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.740
<v Speaker 3>And I haven't seen too much Nazi stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of that,</v>

797
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.160
<v Speaker 3>right on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean like in terms of response.</v>

798
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 3>But this will just make this point </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I to address what you're saying.</v>

799
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then this happened,</v>

800
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:40.230
<v Speaker 3>this one limited.</v>

801
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.840
<v Speaker 3>There's one thing with a few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in Charlottesville happened.</v>

802
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 3>The media goes fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

803
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 3>this is the biggest thing that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened on the other side,</v>

804
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.083
<v Speaker 3>on the left wing side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere that someone tries to have a </v>

805
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 3>free speech rally everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who's,</v>

806
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.413
<v Speaker 3>who's one step to the right of Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanders wants to speak like Condoleezza </v>

807
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Rice can't speak like anyone who's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>step to the right of Bernie Sanders gets</v>

808
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 3>shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there is this mob,</v>

809
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called Antifa,</v>

810
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.573
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who actively go after assaulting people </v>

811
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.360
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this isn't just Nazis,</v>

812
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 3>they go after trump supporters or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone,</v>

813
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.120
<v Speaker 3>anyone who disagrees with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were hammer and sickle flags,</v>

814
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.950
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

815
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.340
<v Speaker 3>represent representing an ideology that </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed more people than the Nazis.</v>

816
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:21.174
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

817
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.910
<v Speaker 3>let's put them both on the level of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>genocidal horrible,</v>

818
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>

819
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.033
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one group on the left is going </v>

820
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.733
<v Speaker 3>everywhere across the country and are </v>
<v Speaker 3>given comfort and aid by college </v>

821
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:32.544
<v Speaker 3>professors.</v>

822
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.000
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then my ears.</v>

823
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

824
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.713
<v Speaker 3>there actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when it's brought up and it's </v>

825
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:38.184
<v Speaker 3>actually backed up by things like 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of millennials in a Chicago </v>

826
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:43.110
<v Speaker 3>University,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a study,</v>

827
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.303
<v Speaker 3>a state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe in free speech for </v>

828
00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:47.544
<v Speaker 3>hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means you don't believe </v>

829
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:49.314
<v Speaker 3>in free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got about 40 percent of </v>

830
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.930
<v Speaker 3>millennials who don't believe in free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

831
00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to define hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where things get slippery and</v>

832
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:57.360
<v Speaker 3>what you might call hate speech is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>different from me,</v>

833
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I might,</v>

834
00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.123
<v Speaker 3>what you might call hate speech is me </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that I don't want to call a </v>

835
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:03.510
<v Speaker 3>transgender woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

836
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.860
<v Speaker 3>her right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That well,</v>

837
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:05.720
<v Speaker 3>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that has been,</v>

838
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.790
<v Speaker 3>that has been labeled hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a microaggression.</v>

839
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.880
<v Speaker 3>These are all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

840
00:37:08.881 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 3>once you define that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

841
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can punch a Nazi.</v>

842
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:11.874
<v Speaker 3>But by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone who disagrees with me as a </v>

843
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am against hate speech.</v>

844
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything I don't like I'm offended by is</v>

845
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:17.380
<v Speaker 3>hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

846
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:21.930
<v Speaker 3>and that's the whole idea of freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech is to protect unpopular speech.</v>

847
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.213
<v Speaker 3>It's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can talk about things that don't </v>

848
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:25.200
<v Speaker 3>offend you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>

849
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 3>No one has a problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so you have this on the left,</v>

850
00:37:27.841 --> 00:37:31.680
<v Speaker 3>which this math problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the media demands that everyone</v>

851
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 3>on the right denounce this non existent </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

852
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.070
<v Speaker 3>so when trump can on a nonexistent thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>was disturbing,</v>

853
00:37:38.071 --> 00:37:41.400
<v Speaker 3>was seeing hundreds of people walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the street with torches,</v>

854
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 3>yelling out racist things together as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>

855
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.990
<v Speaker 3>and the only thing that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiating,</v>

856
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.913
<v Speaker 3>differentiating their idea was so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>more stupid than the free speech idea </v>

857
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.143
<v Speaker 3>because their idea was just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiate people based on how much </v>

858
00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 3>melanin in their skin and what part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet their ancestors came from.</v>

859
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.810
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the dumbest fucking ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>in human history.</v>

860
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.793
<v Speaker 3>So what you have is this river of dumb </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumbs walking down the street and the </v>

861
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:06.924
<v Speaker 3>president doesn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The president doesn't say he's the guy </v>

862
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:10.044
<v Speaker 3>who's running the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

863
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.943
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

864
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:16.070
<v Speaker 3>this is the lowest form of stupidity </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we know of with humans.</v>

865
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 3>The lowest form of stupidity is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accept everyone that looks like you.</v>

866
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.073
<v Speaker 3>This is so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're pretending that someone has any </v>

867
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:26.850
<v Speaker 3>power whatsoever over where they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>born,</v>

868
00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:29.550
<v Speaker 3>their national origin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who their parents were.</v>

869
00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:30.384
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any fucking power over </v>

870
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:32.274
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're putting all the power and </v>

871
00:38:33.331 --> 00:38:36.730
<v Speaker 3>things that you have zero control with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means you're a fucking loser.</v>

872
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.653
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that means the only thing that you </v>

873
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 3>got to bank on is this white skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unity of in workforce.</v>

874
00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.693
<v Speaker 3>This is the group that you're lumping </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody together with and you don't </v>

875
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:45.880
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

876
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.660
<v Speaker 3>Do you not know any great black people </v>
<v Speaker 3>do not know any great Hispanic or Latino</v>

877
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.494
<v Speaker 3>people you don't know any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you need to get the fuck out </v>

878
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:54.060
<v Speaker 3>of your neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ignorance,</v>

879
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 3>but I think that applies to that thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying about kind of being like a</v>

880
00:38:57.971 --> 00:38:58.804
<v Speaker 3>loser and then grasping to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>collective because you don't have </v>

881
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 3>anything in your own story to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>cling to life.</v>

882
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>

883
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:06.723
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that applies to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who get into this identity bullshit on </v>

884
00:39:08.891 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 3>all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't disagree.</v>

885
00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:12.094
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

886
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean for a second about the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Short,</v>

887
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.870
<v Speaker 3>short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just think to me what he said,</v>

888
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.900
<v Speaker 3>from what I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what like he did call out those guys,</v>

889
00:39:19.901 --> 00:39:22.870
<v Speaker 3>he did say it was like disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what people were upset about it that</v>

890
00:39:22.871 --> 00:39:25.570
<v Speaker 3>he said there were bad people on both </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides.</v>

891
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:26.423
<v Speaker 3>What did you ever see a storm fronts </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction to trump speech that he never </v>

892
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 3>criticized white supremacy and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying it was very good,</v>

893
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:34.054
<v Speaker 3>very positive overall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said that there was problems on </v>

894
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:38.074
<v Speaker 3>both sides and bad people on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see videos slide that Antifa was bad </v>

895
00:39:43.511 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 3>also and they were say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God bless Donald Trump.</v>

896
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.013
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is what I saw from the videos </v>

897
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:50.290
<v Speaker 3>that I saw because I have learned and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>could go through this forever,</v>

898
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:52.540
<v Speaker 3>that I don't trust the mainstream media </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

899
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:56.740
<v Speaker 3>They're completely full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whoever rotated by corrupt people,</v>

900
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:57.960
<v Speaker 3>a reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

901
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.863
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it's necessarily </v>

902
00:39:59.651 --> 00:40:00.484
<v Speaker 3>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but been an embedded reporter that just </v>

903
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:03.340
<v Speaker 3>wanted to write a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe maybe,</v>

904
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 3>but I'm from the videos that I saw like </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos of what was going on there.</v>

905
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:07.721
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

906
00:40:07.721 --> 00:40:08.950
<v Speaker 3>I saw all the stuff you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

907
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:10.030
<v Speaker 3>like the Tiki torches.</v>

908
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.040
<v Speaker 3>The Jews will not replace us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swastikas,</v>

909
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.210
<v Speaker 3>all that really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

910
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.790
<v Speaker 3>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I also saw,</v>

911
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.863
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like David Duke and Richard Spencer and </v>

912
00:40:18.911 --> 00:40:20.950
<v Speaker 3>all these guys who are kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Spencer,</v>

913
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I think as a white nationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Duke has been around forever.</v>

914
00:40:24.281 --> 00:40:24.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

915
00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.513
<v Speaker 3>is a bigoted guy who had a almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful run for governor I think at </v>

916
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:31.390
<v Speaker 3>one point in Louisiana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

917
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:32.224
<v Speaker 3>it's been around forever now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find a lot of both of their ideas a </v>

918
00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:39.460
<v Speaker 3>fucked up at offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they got a permit and we're there to</v>

919
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:40.294
<v Speaker 3>speak and this was the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has nothing to do the night before </v>

920
00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 3>they were out doing all that crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we were talking about.</v>

921
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.043
<v Speaker 3>And then I did see this video of groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who were forced out when they </v>

922
00:40:50.621 --> 00:40:51.454
<v Speaker 3>canceled the speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a forced out through an Antifa mob at a </v>

923
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:57.160
<v Speaker 3>bunch of them getting tear gassed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocks thrown at them and shit like that.</v>

924
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean as,</v>

925
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:00.363
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as disgusting as like white supremacy </v>

926
00:41:02.051 --> 00:41:03.550
<v Speaker 3>may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or national socialism,</v>

927
00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:04.384
<v Speaker 3>particularly to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone whose family was fucking </v>

928
00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:09.750
<v Speaker 3>slaughtered by them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I believe in freedom of speech and I</v>

929
00:41:09.751 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 3>think like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I do think to some degree I get,</v>

930
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I just get where and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like I get where trump is being.</v>

931
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:18.423
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm sympathetic to is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's being like a raked over the coals </v>

932
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 3>for not for calling out both sides </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of just calling out one side.</v>

933
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Whereas everyone on the left is silent </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this antifa group.</v>

934
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:28.683
<v Speaker 3>It just started getting press actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>covered in a fair way in the mainstream </v>

935
00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's everywhere but blow.</v>

936
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.813
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea of anti for though is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to react to people they disagree with </v>

937
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 2>who are speaking right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

938
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:41.234
<v Speaker 2>this is their idea versus the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights of premesis to walk down the </v>

939
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.134
<v Speaker 2>street and denounce other weaker races </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get together as a big group with </v>

940
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 2>torches and then people protest them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's violence.</v>

941
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.903
<v Speaker 2>I think you got to address the root of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of it as a representative of </v>

942
00:41:56.061 --> 00:41:56.894
<v Speaker 2>all the people in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The root of the idea of it is that it's </v>

943
00:41:59.691 --> 00:42:02.950
<v Speaker 2>okay to be a white racist and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that said,</v>

944
00:42:02.951 --> 00:42:03.784
<v Speaker 2>what about Brown pride?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How cain Velasquez is brown product </v>

945
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:10.070
<v Speaker 2>tattooed on his fucking chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know the difference between</v>

946
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.160
<v Speaker 2>a guy who is born of immigrants that </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally his dad walked from Mexico,</v>

947
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

948
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 2>he's a first generation.</v>

949
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're second generation.</v>

950
00:42:21.051 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I guess his dad was first generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it work?</v>

951
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.773
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's first generation American because </v>

952
00:42:25.611 --> 00:42:27.920
<v Speaker 2>his dad was from Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a,</v>

953
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:28.791
<v Speaker 2>it's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

954
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:29.624
<v Speaker 2>they came here to try to get a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>life because they got a shit roll the </v>

955
00:42:31.671 --> 00:42:32.504
<v Speaker 2>dice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were born in Mexico and he wanted </v>

956
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.293
<v Speaker 2>out and he wanted better for his family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they took a chance to come here when </v>

957
00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:40.590
<v Speaker 2>he has brown pride tattooed on his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not saying that like,</v>

958
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 2>you know they're going to dominate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jews will not replace us.</v>

959
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.740
<v Speaker 2>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud to be a Mexican.</v>

960
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 2>It sure when you say you're proud to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Mexican for whatever reason,</v>

961
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean you hate white people.</v>

962
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.000
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you hate black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means you have pride in your heritage</v>

963
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.910
<v Speaker 2>when you have white pride in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason.</v>

964
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.983
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our thought is that you hate other </v>

965
00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:03.370
<v Speaker 2>races.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you are,</v>

966
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.890
<v Speaker 2>if you're a white nationalists like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>love white people,</v>

967
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:11.330
<v Speaker 2>people look at you like you're a piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit and you are racist and you.</v>

968
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.193
<v Speaker 2>You think black people are inferior and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think Mexican people and Asian </v>

969
00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:17.270
<v Speaker 2>people and American Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think they're all inferior.</v>

970
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 2>That's how we look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have black pride,</v>

971
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:22.243
<v Speaker 2>we look at you as a strong person who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>resisting this really fucked up society </v>

972
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:33.580
<v Speaker 2>that has brought your ancient ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 2>over from Africa and enslaved people and</v>

973
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.343
<v Speaker 2>literally marginalized everyone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like you and you were there to </v>

974
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:43.190
<v Speaker 2>fight against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's kind of strange in a way,</v>

975
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:44.024
<v Speaker 2>like even as you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of strange that we think of </v>

976
00:43:45.531 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 2>one this way and the other that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think like,</v>

977
00:43:47.991 --> 00:43:48.601
<v Speaker 2>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

978
00:43:48.601 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I get the certainly get the point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like came to Alaska,</v>

979
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:52.904
<v Speaker 2>is tattooing brown pride on his skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give him his story is a very different </v>

980
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:56.420
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

981
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.253
<v Speaker 2>Then tattooing white pride on your skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're like a neo Nazi or </v>

982
00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:01.094
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the UFC heavyweight champion </v>

983
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.770
<v Speaker 2>and it never came up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

984
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:06.530
<v Speaker 2>He's arguably the greatest UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight in history.</v>

985
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.950
<v Speaker 2>It only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only came up in the,</v>

986
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>in the fact that like they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

987
00:44:09.471 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna sell numbers in Mexico City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown pride.</v>

988
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.490
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost the belt.</v>

989
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he shouldn't have used Brown.</v>

990
00:44:14.661 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking English word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People to say,</v>

991
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even.</v>

992
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the word?</v>

993
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Brown and Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the word?</v>

994
00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:24.794
<v Speaker 2>Pride in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a guarantee you it ain't brown </v>

995
00:44:26.601 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go over there and you go,</v>

996
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I got brown pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd go,</v>

997
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say?</v>

998
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 3>So weirdly symbolizes how American he </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

999
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or our own.</v>

1000
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.910
<v Speaker 3>That's how you said that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>should say.</v>

1001
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what she'd say came.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

1002
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Fuck cane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to see that guy fighting.</v>

1003
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.490
<v Speaker 3>I hope he can heal up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 3>He's had a lot of injuries or injuries?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1005
00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:49.683
<v Speaker 3>just his whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a lot of injuries but he's been </v>

1006
00:44:51.091 --> 00:44:51.481
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

1007
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:53.630
<v Speaker 3>maybe the best heavy weight ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just wanted to,</v>

1008
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 3>to what you were saying like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

1009
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.850
<v Speaker 3>I get the difference and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very,</v>

1010
00:44:57.851 --> 00:44:58.684
<v Speaker 3>very valid point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like there is this thing like the </v>

1011
00:45:01.981 --> 00:45:06.480
<v Speaker 3>idea of white people embracing identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

1012
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.060
<v Speaker 3>The way the left has kind of embraced </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics.</v>

1013
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does in some sick way.</v>

1014
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Seemed like the natural logical </v>
<v Speaker 3>progression.</v>

1015
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 3>If you want to accept what the left wing</v>
<v Speaker 3>believes and then you're like,</v>

1016
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:18.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you look at the demographics,</v>

1017
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:19.763
<v Speaker 3>white people are becoming a minority in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country in the future and this is </v>

1018
00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:24.600
<v Speaker 3>how you kind of have like I get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point you're making,</v>

1019
00:45:24.601 --> 00:45:27.960
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time it's a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird setup that the left has.</v>

1020
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:28.883
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone else is allowed to say these </v>

1021
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:30.624
<v Speaker 3>things except white people ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like political correctness kind of only </v>

1022
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:33.894
<v Speaker 3>applies to this one group and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to put everything you say under a </v>

1023
00:45:36.451 --> 00:45:37.284
<v Speaker 3>fine tooth comb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somebody else could say whatever </v>

1024
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:40.374
<v Speaker 3>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets to a cartoonish point where you </v>

1025
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:42.864
<v Speaker 3>have ice cube lecturing Bill Maher about</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a joke and actually ironically </v>

1026
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:51.180
<v Speaker 3>while he's promoting his gangster rap </v>
<v Speaker 3>album,</v>

1027
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.103
<v Speaker 3>sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now what made you think it was cool to </v>

1028
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 3>say that Bill Maher and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

1029
00:45:56.941 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 3>you made cop killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1030
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.110
<v Speaker 3>she iced tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1031
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was his song now?</v>

1032
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both didn't like cops is my point,</v>

1033
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.380
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying like he makes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1034
00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 3>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's key calls,</v>

1035
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:15.670
<v Speaker 3>easy e a house Nigga on that album,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1036
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 3>He uses the same insults actually toward</v>
<v Speaker 3>another black guy.</v>

1037
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:20.243
<v Speaker 3>Not as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as a self deprecating joke the way </v>

1038
00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:22.824
<v Speaker 3>Bill Maher used that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the worst way you could insult </v>

1039
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:26.460
<v Speaker 3>another black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He uses it,</v>

1040
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.443
<v Speaker 3>so I just think there is this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamic on the left where it's like the </v>

1041
00:46:30.531 --> 00:46:31.364
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric is so anti white and so anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>male that I almost sit there and I go </v>

1042
00:46:35.491 --> 00:46:36.324
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1043
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.460
<v Speaker 3>if you guys think Charlottesville is </v>
<v Speaker 3>ugly,</v>

1044
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:39.350
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna.</v>

1045
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.193
<v Speaker 3>Create a lot more of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting at my sister's place a </v>

1046
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.273
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks ago and talking with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few of her left wing professors and my </v>

1047
00:46:46.531 --> 00:46:47.980
<v Speaker 3>sister's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a college professor.</v>

1048
00:46:47.981 --> 00:46:49.970
<v Speaker 3>He's got this big bookshelf up behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1049
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like behind the table,</v>

1050
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:52.243
<v Speaker 3>lots of books and I just looked over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a Michael Moore book from the </v>

1051
00:46:54.391 --> 00:46:58.500
<v Speaker 3>nineties called stupid white men and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just look at it and you're like,</v>

1052
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.410
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's why they're all angry.</v>

1053
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:03.383
<v Speaker 3>People don't like being the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black Guy wrote a book called stupid </v>

1054
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:09.390
<v Speaker 3>black men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would come out of him so hard.</v>

1055
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sounds like something Larry elder </v>

1056
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.670
<v Speaker 3>my right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with a more eloquent title for it.</v>

1057
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:16.643
<v Speaker 3>Nobody fuck with some stupid black man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a black guy wrote a book that was </v>

1058
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:20.471
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1059
00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:22.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all white people aren't stupid.</v>

1060
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.510
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like uncle Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1061
00:47:23.511 --> 00:47:24.510
<v Speaker 3>like right away it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1062
00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:27.780
<v Speaker 3>you sell out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's racist.</v>

1063
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:28.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't like to think it's racist </v>

1064
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 3>because it's about</v>

1065
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 2>white people and generally white people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to deal with racism nearly as</v>

1066
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 2>much as other races.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we allow it to be okay.</v>

1067
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 2>It's also sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There a big thing that's going on now,</v>

1068
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:43.950
<v Speaker 2>especially lately where women think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay to say all white CIS men are trash.</v>

1069
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking common.</v>

1070
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.823
<v Speaker 2>It is such a crazy generalization to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all men or all white men are </v>

1071
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:56.590
<v Speaker 2>terrible and they're horrible trash </v>
<v Speaker 2>until prove until they prove otherwise.</v>

1072
00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:57.453
<v Speaker 2>And it's so fucking killer to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so contradicts everything they've </v>

1073
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 2>supposedly believed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1074
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1075
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.500
<v Speaker 2>if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1076
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.393
<v Speaker 2>if there's like a Muslim terrorist event</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then somebody lumps that into like </v>

1077
00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:15.280
<v Speaker 2>radical lumps that into all Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on the left will lose their mind.</v>

1078
00:48:15.281 --> 00:48:16.114
<v Speaker 2>Like how can you lump every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole group in with what this one </v>

1079
00:48:18.221 --> 00:48:21.910
<v Speaker 2>bad guy did and then they turn the land </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lecture white people about the evils</v>

1080
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:22.610
<v Speaker 2>of history.</v>

1081
00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 2>But forget if we just stopped saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right,</v>

1082
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.570
<v Speaker 2>don't you think that what this is is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just human beings doing that team thing,</v>

1083
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.823
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you start adopting the rules </v>

1084
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:35.950
<v Speaker 2>and the patterns of the team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a Wisconsin cheese hat or</v>

1085
00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:39.310
<v Speaker 2>you're a Boston red sox fan or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck it is that you're into,</v>

1086
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:42.880
<v Speaker 2>you get into this like you've ever heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>those vikings chant,</v>

1087
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:43.743
<v Speaker 2>whether they get the whole stadium like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand people and they clapped her </v>

1088
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:52.870
<v Speaker 2>hands together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1089
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.970
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing,</v>

1090
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:58.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But obviously that is a group think sort</v>

1091
00:48:58.331 --> 00:48:59.800
<v Speaker 2>of a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they all,</v>

1092
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:00.723
<v Speaker 2>they all gear together and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>support this behavior that makes them </v>

1093
00:49:03.521 --> 00:49:05.140
<v Speaker 2>feel good that they're a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

1094
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.243
<v Speaker 2>And I think people do that when whenever</v>
<v Speaker 2>they support rightwing causes and I </v>

1095
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:10.714
<v Speaker 2>think people do that whenever they </v>
<v Speaker 2>support left wing causes and what the </v>

1096
00:49:12.671 --> 00:49:13.504
<v Speaker 2>right and the left arm is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>just frameworks that we can fit in our </v>

1097
00:49:16.841 --> 00:49:17.674
<v Speaker 2>ideologies and our mind and our needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of our social and emotional </v>

1098
00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:24.963
<v Speaker 2>requirements and we can fit them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these patterns that we follow and when </v>

1099
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:31.840
<v Speaker 2>anybody opposes the structure that we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted as reality,</v>

1100
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.990
<v Speaker 2>then we fight with bike locks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking pepper spraying girls with trump</v>

1101
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:38.170
<v Speaker 2>hats on.</v>

1102
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:39.003
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find all sorts of insane </v>

1103
00:49:42.101 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 2>justifications for racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism,</v>

1104
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.173
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of crazy shit that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it were happening to anyone else </v>

1105
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.610
<v Speaker 2>other than the person that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposing.</v>

1106
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.700
<v Speaker 2>You would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of it as being a horrible front to</v>

1107
00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:55.534
<v Speaker 2>everything that you stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as long as it's a white man who </v>

1108
00:49:57.341 --> 00:49:58.720
<v Speaker 2>cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit him in the head with a bike lock.</v>

1109
00:49:59.080 --> 00:49:59.913
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if it was a black woman that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was this professor was disagreeing with </v>

1110
00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:05.530
<v Speaker 2>and he stepped up and he hit her in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head with a bike lock.</v>

1111
00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.110
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's when,</v>

1112
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 2>when you see someone who does that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Antifa,</v>

1113
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.373
<v Speaker 2>it is exactly the same as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That redneck who pulls out his gun and </v>

1114
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:17.230
<v Speaker 2>shoots at that black guy was holding a </v>
<v Speaker 2>torch.</v>

1115
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1116
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.140
<v Speaker 2>This is all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1117
00:50:20.141 --> 00:50:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I also know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1118
00:50:21.131 --> 00:50:21.901
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1119
00:50:21.901 --> 00:50:23.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1120
00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:27.650
<v Speaker 2>they're shocking similarities between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the extreme and the extreme,</v>

1121
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1122
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1123
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.001
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1124
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:30.770
<v Speaker 2>these teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with you completely.</v>

1125
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:31.604
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all just this tribal team </v>
<v Speaker 2>group think bullshit kind of that we </v>

1126
00:50:35.481 --> 00:50:36.314
<v Speaker 2>have to a large degree outgrown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's still kind of haunts us and </v>

1127
00:50:40.021 --> 00:50:40.854
<v Speaker 2>it's still don't think they've outgrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>and universities and that's part of the </v>

1128
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:43.694
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why this is all happening at UC </v>

1129
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.793
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're seeing it all </v>

1130
00:50:45.921 --> 00:50:49.240
<v Speaker 2>throughout the country in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities because in universities,</v>

1131
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a bunch of people.</v>

1132
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.153
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try to be as honest and objective </v>

1133
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1134
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you have a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeking knowledge.</v>

1135
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.340
<v Speaker 2>You have young people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>idealistic,</v>

1136
00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 2>that want to change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that want to stand out as being better.</v>

1137
00:51:00.681 --> 00:51:01.514
<v Speaker 2>They want to virtue signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to do all the crazy things </v>

1138
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:06.410
<v Speaker 2>that they can to be something great and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other ones that want to get laid</v>

1139
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:09.170
<v Speaker 2>and there's other ones that want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate and they still don't know who</v>

1140
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

1141
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 2>They still don't know how to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have these professors and a lot</v>

1142
00:51:12.951 --> 00:51:15.710
<v Speaker 2>of these professors went through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>process and then after they went through</v>

1143
00:51:15.711 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 2>this process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got their phd,</v>

1144
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:18.853
<v Speaker 2>they wrote and then they started </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching and so they have never been </v>

1145
00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:26.650
<v Speaker 2>outside the hallowed halls of academia </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the time they were like 19 years.</v>

1146
00:51:26.651 --> 00:51:27.484
<v Speaker 2>They've been going through the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and some of them do it and they </v>

1147
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:31.484
<v Speaker 2>do it with balance and they figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>who they are and they take great pride </v>

1148
00:51:34.371 --> 00:51:37.790
<v Speaker 2>in the fact that they can mold these </v>
<v Speaker 2>young minds and give them information.</v>

1149
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.983
<v Speaker 2>And some of them are incredibly broken </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are never sexually viable </v>

1150
00:51:42.651 --> 00:51:43.484
<v Speaker 2>when they were young and now they're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a position of power and they virtue </v>

1151
00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:46.874
<v Speaker 2>signal to a sickening degree and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and you see them standing up for </v>

1152
00:51:51.621 --> 00:51:52.454
<v Speaker 2>women above all else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what happened with this whole </v>

1153
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:56.780
<v Speaker 2>betsy devos thing when she's there.</v>

1154
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to push this and say her </v>
<v Speaker 2>name devoss.</v>

1155
00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.293
<v Speaker 2>I think they're trying to push due </v>
<v Speaker 2>process in the case of these sexual </v>

1156
00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:07.640
<v Speaker 2>assault cases on campus and people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>resisting due process.</v>

1157
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.660
<v Speaker 2>People are resisting guilty until proven</v>
<v Speaker 2>innocent.</v>

1158
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they want.</v>

1159
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:14.263
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1160
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.900
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean to also like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1161
00:52:16.901 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 2>like keep harping on this kind of left </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus right thing.</v>

1162
00:52:19.011 --> 00:52:19.844
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost want like some term to like </v>

1163
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.093
<v Speaker 2>define,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this left side of a lake on college </v>

1164
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:25.940
<v Speaker 2>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This grill,</v>

1165
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:28.880
<v Speaker 2>they're position is simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1166
00:52:28.881 --> 00:52:31.040
<v Speaker 2>it's really quite amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their position is that,</v>

1167
00:52:31.041 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 2>and this is what basically what was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>repealed now,</v>

1168
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:36.710
<v Speaker 2>but this is what the guidelines under </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama basically did on college campuses.</v>

1169
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.030
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1170
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.790
<v Speaker 2>there's no due process for men who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>accused of rape.</v>

1171
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1172
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.660
<v Speaker 2>and this isn't in the legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just the cultural punch,</v>

1173
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.300
<v Speaker 2>but so there's no due process for men </v>
<v Speaker 2>accused of rape and by the way,</v>

1174
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.070
<v Speaker 2>everything is rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's right.</v>

1175
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Everything's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1176
00:52:50.061 --> 00:52:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Every guy you've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1177
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:55.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you had anything to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1178
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:56.174
<v Speaker 2>the man is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not responsible or the man is </v>

1179
00:52:58.191 --> 00:53:01.310
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The woman is not so great beers.</v>

1180
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:02.203
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've probably taken 90 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least of the pool of what men and </v>

1181
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:09.740
<v Speaker 2>women in America previously considered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good guys.</v>

1182
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.713
<v Speaker 2>Forget even like rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good men like just the guys who you </v>

1183
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 2>think are good people not like consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1184
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent of them are serial </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapists.</v>

1185
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard the story from University</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Amherst?</v>

1186
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:20.864
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most ridiculous ones or </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy suing now and he has gone </v>

1187
00:53:24.231 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 2>through hell for the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1188
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.963
<v Speaker 2>but it was a kid who was a student from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria and some girl who was in his </v>

1189
00:53:31.201 --> 00:53:32.034
<v Speaker 2>class and they hooked up and they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and they apparently they were </v>

1190
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:38.190
<v Speaker 2>slightly intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think on marijuana.</v>

1191
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:39.323
<v Speaker 2>The girl gave the guy a blow job and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then she wanted to stop and he was </v>

1192
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 2>trying to get her to do it again and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>said no.</v>

1193
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.620
<v Speaker 2>And so they ended it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

1194
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she talked to her friends.</v>

1195
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:50.723
<v Speaker 2>They decided that she had been sexually </v>
<v Speaker 2>assaulted because he was trying to get </v>

1196
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:54.631
<v Speaker 2>her to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

1197
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:55.464
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1198
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1199
00:53:56.461 --> 00:54:00.060
<v Speaker 2>maybe it would be a no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't be enough.</v>

1200
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the scenario was,</v>

1201
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:03.563
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that it was essentially an</v>
<v Speaker 2>awkward sexual exchange between young </v>

1202
00:54:07.231 --> 00:54:08.064
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just a part of being a young </v>

1203
00:54:09.841 --> 00:54:11.540
<v Speaker 2>person who's having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're,</v>

1204
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:12.403
<v Speaker 2>you're a person and you're 18 years old </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever they were and you're in </v>

1205
00:54:14.611 --> 00:54:18.660
<v Speaker 2>college and you're having sex and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sort of a sexual scenario with a</v>

1206
00:54:18.661 --> 00:54:19.500
<v Speaker 2>new person.</v>

1207
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:21.900
<v Speaker 2>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been doing that?</v>

1208
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:22.973
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How good are you at it or you fight you </v>

1209
00:54:24.521 --> 00:54:26.940
<v Speaker 2>probably fucking terrible at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably awkward as Shit.</v>

1210
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.063
<v Speaker 2>You probably weird around women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't believe they like you don't </v>

1211
00:54:30.181 --> 00:54:32.670
<v Speaker 2>know why they like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're confused.</v>

1212
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you think you have to act a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>

1213
00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:36.210
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the finding yourself,</v>

1214
00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.173
<v Speaker 2>you adolescent use it before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do not have a fully developed </v>

1215
00:54:39.721 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 2>brain and it's a different and forget </v>
<v Speaker 2>even insects and stuff like that.</v>

1216
00:54:43.411 --> 00:54:45.810
<v Speaker 2>There's just things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many things did you do at 20?</v>

1217
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 2>We'd look back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1218
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:50.250
<v Speaker 2>what a douchey thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not how you treat someone.</v>

1219
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:50.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1220
00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.070
<v Speaker 2>so this young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was 19 at the time,</v>

1221
00:54:53.071 --> 00:54:54.870
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the college age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>

1222
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:57.390
<v Speaker 2>he's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kicked him out of school,</v>

1223
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.343
<v Speaker 2>they labeled him some sort of a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator and he's in this terrible </v>

1224
00:55:01.621 --> 00:55:02.830
<v Speaker 2>position where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:03.683
<v Speaker 2>he's suing the school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's gonna take a long time before </v>

1226
00:55:05.221 --> 00:55:06.054
<v Speaker 2>anything gets resolved and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know the whole story of the </v>

1227
00:55:09.151 --> 00:55:09.984
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the case is as he's representing </v>

1228
00:55:12.571 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 2>it and as no one's said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he held her down,</v>

1229
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:18.240
<v Speaker 2>no one said he tried to rape her and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one said he threatened violence.</v>

1230
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.073
<v Speaker 2>No one said anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her version of the story is that they </v>

1231
00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:24.840
<v Speaker 2>had some sort of a willing sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter and she just didn't want to go</v>

1232
00:55:24.841 --> 00:55:26.670
<v Speaker 2>any further and he asked her to and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>said no,</v>

1233
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.960
<v Speaker 2>and then it ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1234
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:31.890
<v Speaker 2>That is a normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just part of being a young person</v>

1235
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.530
<v Speaker 2>that's just part of being a young person</v>
<v Speaker 2>having sex,</v>

1236
00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.364
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're intoxicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a good idea to have sex </v>

1237
00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.030
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated kid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1238
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.983
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it a bunch and sure you have </v>

1239
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:43.400
<v Speaker 2>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1240
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Stop pretending you haven't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop pretending that a lot.</v>

1241
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.093
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of mistakes you make </v>

1242
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:49.860
<v Speaker 2>when you're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W why?</v>

1243
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:50.843
<v Speaker 2>Why are they so much bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's sex and there's something about </v>

1244
00:55:53.431 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 2>just using the word rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape.</v>

1245
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:56.783
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape is a particularly horrific cutting </v>

1246
00:56:00.631 --> 00:56:01.464
<v Speaker 2>word because of what a horrific crime it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and then to try to make everything </v>

1247
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:06.930
<v Speaker 2>else like it's literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the extent they go,</v>

1248
00:56:06.931 --> 00:56:08.100
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1249
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:10.350
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you punch someone in the arm and they</v>

1250
00:56:10.351 --> 00:56:11.184
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you committed or murder or something </v>

1251
00:56:12.181 --> 00:56:12.541
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1252
00:56:12.541 --> 00:56:13.374
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

1253
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.600
<v Speaker 2>You can't just throw that word at </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1254
00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worse than that because of race.</v>

1255
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>That's an assault is an actual egregious</v>
<v Speaker 2>offense.</v>

1256
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about people</v>

1257
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.820
<v Speaker 3>having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Cross,</v>

1258
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:27.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely calling.</v>

1259
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like calling a glance murder.</v>

1260
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's really,</v>

1261
00:56:31.571 --> 00:56:32.404
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was the idea of microaggressions and </v>

1262
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:35.434
<v Speaker 3>this is the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the whole thing that underpins </v>

1263
00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:37.834
<v Speaker 3>the philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I find really terrifying is that </v>

1264
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 3>the idea of micro aggression or social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice,</v>

1265
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:44.763
<v Speaker 3>it's like you take these terms like </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression or justice that meant </v>

1266
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 3>something and now you've made the mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>the opposite of what they mean.</v>

1267
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:53.440
<v Speaker 3>But microaggression is not an aggression</v>
<v Speaker 3>inherently.</v>

1268
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:54.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not an aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1269
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:55.463
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a normal part of human </v>

1270
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:56.824
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say something mean and I go like </v>

1271
00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.163
<v Speaker 3>this and I walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people do is that's a </v>

1272
00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.213
<v Speaker 3>microaggression and there's this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is why I find it to be such </v>

1273
00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:08.220
<v Speaker 3>that the issue of our time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost forget like,</v>

1274
00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's not the issue.</v>

1275
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I necessarily wanted to be the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our time.</v>

1276
00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:14.800
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping it would be like embracing </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarianism full on or something,</v>

1277
00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:15.634
<v Speaker 3>but it just seems to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you for free speech or against free </v>

1278
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 3>speech and free speech has such a Prereq</v>
<v Speaker 3>for everything.</v>

1279
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a prerequisite for everything about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1280
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:25.583
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the society we live in and everything </v>

1281
00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:29.140
<v Speaker 3>particularly like what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I do,</v>

1282
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.120
<v Speaker 3>everything we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't,</v>

1283
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.043
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I love in life is like comedy and </v>

1284
00:57:34.031 --> 00:57:34.864
<v Speaker 3>truth and you can't have either of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>without that free speech because </v>

1285
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.520
<v Speaker 3>possible can have this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>about free speech.</v>

1286
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't have this conversation if we</v>

1287
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:44.320
<v Speaker 3>were on a state sponsored program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't have this.</v>

1288
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.450
<v Speaker 3>If we were on a corporate sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>

1289
00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.313
<v Speaker 3>we'd likely couldn't have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation without being interrupted </v>

1290
00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:49.534
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or being lectured to or having some </v>

1291
00:57:50.591 --> 00:57:52.930
<v Speaker 3>conversation with someone who says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1292
00:57:52.931 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 3>you can't say the word nigger.</v>

1293
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to say it.</v>

1294
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Forget about living in the context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1295
00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say that noise with your mouth.</v>

1296
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:01.603
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Calling someone at not saying you </v>

1297
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:04.360
<v Speaker 3>are one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1298
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:05.560
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one can go,</v>

1299
00:58:05.561 --> 00:58:06.394
<v Speaker 3>but that's fucking retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what's the dumbest thing I've ever </v>

1300
00:58:08.261 --> 00:58:09.094
<v Speaker 3>heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that this was the rule and this is </v>

1301
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:12.350
<v Speaker 3>how everybody operates and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing where it's not.</v>

1302
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1303
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.120
<v Speaker 3>if we're living in a world of I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>commit a microaggression,</v>

1304
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't go down a path that might offend</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

1305
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:20.103
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need that freedom in order to find </v>

1306
00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:24.844
<v Speaker 3>anything interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing worth saying if you're </v>

1307
00:58:26.591 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 3>living in this world where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1308
00:58:27.761 --> 00:58:31.300
<v Speaker 3>I can't get outside of this box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I find that to be very,</v>

1309
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:36.070
<v Speaker 3>just very dangerous and I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in America,</v>

1310
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like we've had it too good </v>
<v Speaker 3>for too long,</v>

1311
00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 3>that people are removed from the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can lose all this shit.</v>

1312
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no respect for like,</v>

1313
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.540
<v Speaker 3>like what we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much different,</v>

1314
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 3>how much higher standard of living we </v>
<v Speaker 3>live than the vast,</v>

1315
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:50.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1316
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.630
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1317
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:55.270
<v Speaker 3>than most humans that are alive today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the vast majority of humans who have</v>

1318
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:56.450
<v Speaker 3>ever existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1319
00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.293
<v Speaker 3>it's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this from a Jordan Peterson </v>

1320
00:58:58.511 --> 00:58:59.320
<v Speaker 3>lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1321
00:58:59.320 --> 00:58:59.930
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1322
00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:01.780
<v Speaker 3>it was an 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95.</v>

1323
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:05.920
<v Speaker 3>The average American lived on a dollar a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day adjusted for modern inflation.</v>

1324
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 3>So in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95,</v>

1325
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.433
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1326
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:13.530
<v Speaker 3>like central Asia level poverty in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America and that's just everyone.</v>

1327
00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Before that living in backbreaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty was like,</v>

1328
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.300
<v Speaker 3>just life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just all of life.</v>

1329
00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 3>And it's like we figured something out </v>
<v Speaker 3>in these last less than 200 years,</v>

1330
00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:24.644
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we figured something or a little </v>

1331
00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:27.170
<v Speaker 3>more than 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've figured something out.</v>

1332
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I saying?</v>

1333
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1334
00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's less than 200 years.</v>

1335
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 3>We figured something out in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>industrial revolution that like now lets</v>

1336
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 3>us live up here on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like we can lose that and a lot</v>

1337
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 3>of it has to do with freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the whole thing to me is freedom.</v>

1338
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.880
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is that we embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1339
00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:42.550
<v Speaker 3>if you look in the year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1340
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you had on your show,</v>

1341
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Thaddeus Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's great,</v>

1342
00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:49.280
<v Speaker 3>I just did his podcast recently and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>put it this way,</v>

1343
00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:49.881
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he goes,</v>

1344
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:50.714
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the year 1800 [inaudible] I was </v>

1345
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:52.244
<v Speaker 3>talking about what an incredible thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19th century was and how it </v>

1346
00:59:54.651 --> 00:59:55.484
<v Speaker 3>transformed humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes to the year 1800 Americans </v>

1347
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:00.110
<v Speaker 3>are all making their own clothes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1348
01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 3>1,900</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans are shopping at macy's.</v>

1349
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1350
01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:06.730
<v Speaker 3>if you had said in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1351
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:08.480
<v Speaker 3>in the year 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>45 and been like,</v>

1352
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.910
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the next 65 years,</v>

1353
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:11.923
<v Speaker 3>slavery is going to be abolished in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>West and we're going to have an </v>

1354
01:00:14.121 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Speaker 3>industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1355
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:19.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like magic happen and that's why we</v>
<v Speaker 3>live the way we live today.</v>

1356
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:21.950
<v Speaker 3>And no one is even interested in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1357
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Like why do we have this much wealth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I like what you said.</v>

1358
01:00:25.691 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about freedom.</v>

1359
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:30.320
<v Speaker 3>And when you have a guy like Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanders who harps on and on about income</v>

1360
01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:31.320
<v Speaker 3>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1361
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.820
<v Speaker 3>I have a real issue with that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those blanket statements.</v>

1362
01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:36.950
<v Speaker 3>It sounds really good at a campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>

1363
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:40.970
<v Speaker 3>but freedom itself breeds income </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality.</v>

1364
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.823
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because freedom means you can do </v>

1365
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:43.574
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do very little or you could </v>

1366
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.490
<v Speaker 3>work like a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1367
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:47.630
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're,</v>

1368
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:49.370
<v Speaker 3>if here's the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1369
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 3>you do something for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>

1370
01:00:52.221 --> 01:00:53.054
<v Speaker 3>You get currency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you use that currency to buy things or </v>

1371
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:56.474
<v Speaker 3>to make sure you don't have to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>again by food and goods and take trips </v>

1372
01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:02.720
<v Speaker 3>and travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more you work,</v>

1373
01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:05.810
<v Speaker 3>the more you decide you want to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1374
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:08.300
<v Speaker 3>the more chances you have to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 3>their currency.</v>

1375
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.133
<v Speaker 3>If you do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is income inequality due to </v>

1376
01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:13.184
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean take away all the other factors </v>

1377
01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.304
<v Speaker 3>that might be in play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's racial discrimination or </v>

1378
01:01:19.381 --> 01:01:22.070
<v Speaker 3>sexual discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not denying that those things exist,</v>

1379
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.113
<v Speaker 3>but what I am saying is that the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are going to have income </v>

1380
01:01:26.361 --> 01:01:29.720
<v Speaker 3>equality in a capitalist society where </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody can do whatever they want.</v>

1381
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 3>You know people that is so counter to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we know about human behavior.</v>

1382
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.500
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

1383
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.060
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a fantasy person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't exist,</v>

1384
01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:41.530
<v Speaker 3>who has motivations outside of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outside of that,</v>

1385
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:42.583
<v Speaker 3>most people want some sort of reward for</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do and if everybody gets the </v>

1386
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:48.134
<v Speaker 3>same amount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking reward for working </v>

1387
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:53.330
<v Speaker 3>extra hard and that's not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to get Microsoft.</v>

1388
01:01:53.331 --> 01:01:55.210
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get IBM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1389
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just,</v>

1390
01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean they talk about fairness a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a strange concept,</v>

1391
01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:03.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just that somebody works </v>
<v Speaker 3>twice as hard and doesn't get more.</v>

1392
01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's not the right thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

1393
01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.800
<v Speaker 3>But like what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's like they,</v>

1394
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 3>they use the term so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's misleading about it?</v>

1395
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:12.950
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right that freedom </v>
<v Speaker 3>breeds inequality,</v>

1396
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:13.933
<v Speaker 3>but what's misleading about it is by </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people think like the poor get </v>

1397
01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 3>poorer and that is objective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a like objectively false,</v>

1398
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:22.150
<v Speaker 3>demonstrably false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that,</v>

1399
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make it out like the rich get </v>

1400
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:26.280
<v Speaker 3>richer and the poor get poorer like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>old saying,</v>

1401
01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:27.490
<v Speaker 3>but it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:29.740
<v Speaker 3>if you think it through like that can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really continue like that.</v>

1403
01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.733
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was going to have rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if the poor work hard and figured </v>

1404
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 3>they haven't possibility to escape </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever economic situation they're in,</v>

1405
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:39.624
<v Speaker 3>it is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with freedom and homeless people </v>

1406
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:42.503
<v Speaker 3>here live better than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than rich people in Third World </v>

1407
01:02:45.481 --> 01:02:46.314
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or certainly at least better than </v>

1408
01:02:47.251 --> 01:02:48.840
<v Speaker 3>average people in third world countries.</v>

1409
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>

1410
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:52.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that the inequality grows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like everything moves up.</v>

1411
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 3>The inequality grows up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is like what I just,</v>

1412
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.890
<v Speaker 3>what I can't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1413
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:59.160
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what I was saying before,</v>

1414
01:02:59.161 --> 01:02:59.994
<v Speaker 3>like if you have any concept of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're by far the richest freest </v>

1415
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:05.970
<v Speaker 3>human beings who have ever existed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>recorded human history,</v>

1416
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.833
<v Speaker 3>at least recorded human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what is going on in ancient </v>

1417
01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like a pro before engineered it.</v>

1418
01:03:11.611 --> 01:03:12.444
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1419
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.780
<v Speaker 3>but if you realize that we have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible amount,</v>

1420
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:15.810
<v Speaker 3>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1421
01:03:15.811 --> 01:03:17.400
<v Speaker 3>it's like just being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1422
01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:21.090
<v Speaker 3>we need all of these policies to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>give handouts to poor people.</v>

1423
01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:22.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually,</v>

1424
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 3>let's continue this train of getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>richer and richer and richer,</v>

1425
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:28.043
<v Speaker 3>which is not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what people like Bernie </v>

1426
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1427
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:31.471
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1428
01:03:31.471 --> 01:03:33.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie's got a hustle going on.</v>

1429
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:35.563
<v Speaker 3>So you find out it's a hustle when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out it's got a bunch of houses and </v>

1430
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:39.354
<v Speaker 3>his wife tried to buy up all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking land to expand the university </v>

1431
01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:44.580
<v Speaker 3>that she was running and she killed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole fucking school.</v>

1432
01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:45.683
<v Speaker 3>Like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about the fact that the </v>

1433
01:03:47.101 --> 01:03:48.450
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we haven't seen.</v>

1434
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.583
<v Speaker 3>First off he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made a million dollars off a book on </v>

1435
01:03:52.321 --> 01:03:55.500
<v Speaker 3>how it's wrong to be a millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like how are you not how can</v>

1436
01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:58.560
<v Speaker 3>anyone look at you like as a serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>leader when you did that?</v>

1437
01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.260
<v Speaker 3>So you saying what people want to hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is something,</v>

1438
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:03.030
<v Speaker 3>some truth to some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's saying.</v>

1439
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:03.893
<v Speaker 3>I think that the world would be a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>place if we had more social programs in </v>

1440
01:04:07.471 --> 01:04:08.304
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the world be a better place if </v>

1441
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.350
<v Speaker 3>college were free.</v>

1442
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:11.483
<v Speaker 3>If we think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't disagree with like the </v>

1443
01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:16.150
<v Speaker 3>thought behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're,</v>

1444
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.333
<v Speaker 3>all of these things would be better </v>
<v Speaker 3>suited in voluntary arrangements than </v>

1445
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.870
<v Speaker 3>some forced government monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do agree with you that like,</v>

1446
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.823
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like great schools to be very </v>

1447
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.640
<v Speaker 3>affordable or free if possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like everyone to be.</v>

1448
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.533
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Bernie Sanders certainly addressed </v>

1449
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.950
<v Speaker 3>some very real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he would point things out that were</v>

1450
01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 3>very real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he would be like,</v>

1451
01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they claim it's a great recovery,</v>

1452
01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.990
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 percent of the new wealth has gone to</v>

1453
01:04:36.991 --> 01:04:38.050
<v Speaker 3>the top three percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1454
01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:43.060
<v Speaker 3>like he either have some Jackie Mason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only do one thing,</v>

1455
01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.330
<v Speaker 3>two and that has to apply to every New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York Jew who's out there.</v>

1456
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.620
<v Speaker 3>But like so like there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't care if Bernie Sanders makes</v>

1457
01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:54.540
<v Speaker 3>a million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something like,</v>

1458
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:55.403
<v Speaker 3>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a million dollars while claiming </v>

1459
01:04:56.881 --> 01:04:59.880
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a moral issue that some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have so much what others have.</v>

1460
01:04:59.881 --> 01:05:02.490
<v Speaker 3>So little endorsing Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1461
01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:04.800
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know how you can have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can look at the guy who goes,</v>

1462
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:09.950
<v Speaker 3>the problem is incoming inequality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these and the banking cartel,</v>

1463
01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to vote for the candidate </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the big banks.</v>

1464
01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1465
01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:13.883
<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>

1466
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:16.740
<v Speaker 3>to me it would be if Ron Paul endorsed </v>
<v Speaker 3>mccain.</v>

1467
01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think the big banks sort</v>

1468
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>of were on both teams?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1469
01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:21.423
<v Speaker 1>Well not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they were on trump's </v>

1470
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:22.804
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's certainly been on every </v>

1471
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>other team now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1472
01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1473
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.193
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly.</v>

1474
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:28.143
<v Speaker 1>It's not even like the teams they run </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Treasury Department in the Federal </v>

1475
01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run the whole system.</v>

1476
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.823
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that Bernie Sanders never </v>
<v Speaker 1>had like a fiery speech about what </v>

1477
01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:36.184
<v Speaker 1>happened at the DNC about how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally conspired to ruin him and to </v>

1478
01:05:39.891 --> 01:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>take him out of the race with Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>

1479
01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>the DNC wanted hillary to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>

1480
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>They literally sabotaged him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1481
01:05:46.091 --> 01:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>they were very open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1482
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say they were very open </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

1483
01:05:48.341 --> 01:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Openly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lied and said,</v>

1484
01:05:49.631 --> 01:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a pick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the leaks that were weaponized.</v>

1485
01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really some of Russia did it.</v>

1486
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Russia ruined everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1487
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:58.583
<v Speaker 1>I actually remember it was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most surreal and I'm a guy who was </v>

1488
01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 1>always preaching about how full of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the media is,</v>

1489
01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:03.243
<v Speaker 1>but even I like this last year that'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>give the trump moment credit even I've </v>

1490
01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:07.660
<v Speaker 1>been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1491
01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was watching CNN and they had.</v>

1492
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.033
<v Speaker 1>They were playing clips from a Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton interview and talking about it </v>

1493
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.053
<v Speaker 1>and Hillary Clinton was claiming that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin a weaponized information </v>

1494
01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:26.220
<v Speaker 1>against Hillary Clinton and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing this and they never mentioned</v>

1495
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.633
<v Speaker 1>that the information is on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're breaking down this piece and </v>

1496
01:06:30.671 --> 01:06:31.504
<v Speaker 1>they never mentioned that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The information that was weaponized was </v>

1497
01:06:34.751 --> 01:06:39.751
<v Speaker 1>that CNN leaked debate questions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton before the debate.</v>

1498
01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Like you sit here talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermining democracy for a month.</v>

1499
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:48.220
<v Speaker 1>What could be more to under what could </v>
<v Speaker 1>do more to undermine democracy?</v>

1500
01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:49.323
<v Speaker 1>The debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that people actually watch </v>

1501
01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:51.814
<v Speaker 1>and vote on in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave Hillary Clinton the questions </v>

1502
01:06:53.981 --> 01:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>that were asked at the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know for a fact too,</v>

1503
01:06:56.171 --> 01:06:57.004
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there were more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know two questions were given to </v>

1504
01:06:58.301 --> 01:07:02.950
<v Speaker 1>her and that they were both asked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton take some doesn't have a</v>

1505
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a moral issue with that,</v>

1506
01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.510
<v Speaker 1>just takes them and pretends she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing the questions for the first time</v>

1507
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.180
<v Speaker 1>and the show that I'm watching describe.</v>

1508
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Talk about this on CNN that's talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the weaponized information and not</v>

1509
01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:18.661
<v Speaker 1>mentioning what the information was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show is called reliable sources.</v>

1510
01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a show where they break down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

1511
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:26.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's surreal to be watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then those same guys in CNN go,</v>

1512
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:31.000
<v Speaker 1>we've got an epidemic of fake news on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and you're like,</v>

1513
01:07:31.001 --> 01:07:31.834
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm living through a </v>

1514
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:35.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking simulation or what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is some nutty shit.</v>

1515
01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:35.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious when you watch the </v>

1516
01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:38.404
<v Speaker 1>strategies play out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for people who don't remember </v>

1517
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton before she ran against </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump was running against Barack Obama.</v>

1518
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:46.084
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when she was running against Barack </v>

1519
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:48.303
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things she did was she </v>

1520
01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 1>positioned herself as to be right of </v>
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

1521
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:52.143
<v Speaker 1>So more right than Obama was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that she did was </v>

1522
01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:00.190
<v Speaker 1>she was publicly stating that gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage was wrong.</v>

1523
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.293
<v Speaker 1>She was publicly stated that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes that marriage is a sacred </v>

1524
01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:03.904
<v Speaker 1>institution between a man and a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was her way of positioning </v>

1525
01:08:08.621 --> 01:08:09.454
<v Speaker 1>herself to the right of Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she would appeal to all the </v>

1526
01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:13.200
<v Speaker 1>religious nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>

1527
01:08:13.201 --> 01:08:15.120
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with going left.</v>

1528
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't want no more war</v>

1529
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.120
<v Speaker 2>in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these fags marrying each other and.</v>

1530
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:20.954
<v Speaker 2>But fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just me and Gary Been Married for </v>

1531
01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:26.990
<v Speaker 2>25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think it's right that they get to be</v>

1532
01:08:26.991 --> 01:08:29.150
<v Speaker 2>the same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are under Christ.</v>

1533
01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.240
<v Speaker 2>She will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She will.</v>

1534
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Just to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Obama was also against gay marriage</v>

1535
01:08:34.021 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 2>and that election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she absolutely,</v>

1536
01:08:35.331 --> 01:08:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he say how he.</v>

1537
01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:40.070
<v Speaker 2>He did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was these motherfuckers.</v>

1538
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:43.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like 51 percent approval rating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1539
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden they come to Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 2>53.</v>

1540
01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:46.531
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1542
01:08:46.531 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like right when it went right when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts being a wedge issue we can use</v>

1543
01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.170
<v Speaker 2>right when Obama was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1544
01:08:51.171 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>we need reelection and I didn't end in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of these wars and still open.</v>

1545
01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:55.754
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only way you could work is if </v>

1546
01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:59.600
<v Speaker 2>somebody gave you an earpiece and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fed you great lines.</v>

1552
01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.470
<v Speaker 2>they're like running like research on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.943
<v Speaker 2>The like Jamie's over there constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>googling and you have like a screen in </v>

1554
01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:20.714
<v Speaker 2>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know Howard stern used to have </v>

1555
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that with Jackie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The joke,</v>

1556
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:26.030
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is way back in the day.</v>

1557
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The jokes?</v>

1558
01:09:27.711 --> 01:09:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he did was he had a thing where you</v>

1559
01:09:29.931 --> 01:09:33.500
<v Speaker 2>would write on like an overhead </v>
<v Speaker 2>projector.</v>

1560
01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:34.503
<v Speaker 2>This was like a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a camera and he would see </v>

1561
01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:39.710
<v Speaker 2>the video of it on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would see the picture.</v>

1562
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:40.783
<v Speaker 2>So you had a funny line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would write down the funny line and </v>

1563
01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:43.874
<v Speaker 2>you would put it on the projector and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Howard would get it on his screen and </v>

1564
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that Jackie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joke man did because he was always.</v>

1565
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:50.930
<v Speaker 2>He was great at like one liners and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

1566
01:09:50.931 --> 01:09:51.764
<v Speaker 2>He knew a lot of jokes and so he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>give Howard like really funny things to </v>

1567
01:09:53.811 --> 01:09:54.644
<v Speaker 2>say any with juice it up and I did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackie Chair for a couple times when </v>

1568
01:09:58.401 --> 01:09:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Jackie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joke man quit.</v>

1569
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:00.913
<v Speaker 2>Jackie wanted like a million dollars a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year and they wouldn't give him a </v>

1570
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:04.060
<v Speaker 2>million dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would give them a 900,000.</v>

1571
01:10:04.061 --> 01:10:04.894
<v Speaker 2>He was like fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he left and so when he left they had </v>

1572
01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:07.634
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of guys sit in that chair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them was already and already </v>

1573
01:10:10.191 --> 01:10:11.024
<v Speaker 2>wound up taking that job and part of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>job was to feed Howard lines and like </v>

1574
01:10:15.471 --> 01:10:16.970
<v Speaker 2>that kid Benji.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really funny man.</v>

1575
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.823
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would write down stuff and feed </v>

1576
01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:20.114
<v Speaker 2>Howard funny lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he has a few guys on the side that </v>

1577
01:10:22.331 --> 01:10:23.164
<v Speaker 2>would toss some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what a politician </v>

1578
01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:26.474
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write us a politician like you're not </v>

1579
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:33.470
<v Speaker 2>going to get their full unadulterated </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas except for trump and that's one of</v>

1580
01:10:33.471 --> 01:10:37.700
<v Speaker 2>the things that was so refreshing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it was a shitty message,</v>

1581
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:38.833
<v Speaker 2>even though there's a poverty of words </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way he spoke and there was this </v>

1582
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:43.340
<v Speaker 2>clunkiness to it all.</v>

1583
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:46.280
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly as a clunkiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no question about that.</v>

1584
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:49.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very simplistic way of,</v>

1585
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 2>of speaking compared to what we're used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1586
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1587
01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:55.190
<v Speaker 2>like all the slogans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slogans,</v>

1588
01:10:55.191 --> 01:10:57.890
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is something about it.</v>

1589
01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:00.590
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he was as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you were saying,</v>

1590
01:11:00.591 --> 01:11:04.080
<v Speaker 2>like completely unrestrained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely on,</v>

1591
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:05.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something really interesting </v>

1592
01:11:05.781 --> 01:11:06.614
<v Speaker 2>about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole thing is really </v>

1593
01:11:07.941 --> 01:11:08.920
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

1594
01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like the most profoundly hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 2>and interesting moment ever.</v>

1595
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 2>And like no one wants to appreciate</v>

1596
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.200
<v Speaker 3>it because they're so dug into like one </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the other.</v>

1597
01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Nuclear War with Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1598
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.470
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of scary.</v>

1599
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.393
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more scary for the people in Seoul than </v>

1600
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:24.690
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still like that is scary.</v>

1601
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:28.380
<v Speaker 3>But the thing with trump is that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks and,</v>

1602
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:30.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1603
01:11:30.031 --> 01:11:30.864
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who hate trump hate him more </v>

1604
01:11:31.591 --> 01:11:33.610
<v Speaker 3>than any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone.</v>

1605
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a political leader hated</v>

1606
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 3>as much as the people who hate trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate him right now.</v>

1607
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:39.560
<v Speaker 3>No one in America for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1608
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.030
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one in my lifetime has in America has</v>

1609
01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:43.620
<v Speaker 3>even come close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are other countries where</v>

1610
01:11:43.621 --> 01:11:44.520
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1611
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:46.290
<v Speaker 3>dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1612
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that I'm sure.</v>

1613
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:49.630
<v Speaker 3>But like there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1614
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:51.023
<v Speaker 3>but trump has hated and I got to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest with if you ask people on the </v>

1615
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:54.294
<v Speaker 3>left why they hate him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they struggled to give you a </v>

1616
01:11:56.821 --> 01:11:58.770
<v Speaker 3>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest answer for it.</v>

1617
01:11:58.771 --> 01:11:59.604
<v Speaker 3>I mean they'll say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they say things like racism or </v>

1618
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:03.383
<v Speaker 3>bigotry or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say pa people were paying attention </v>

1619
01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:06.324
<v Speaker 3>to what he's doing.</v>

1620
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were worried about that.</v>

1621
01:12:09.691 --> 01:12:10.524
<v Speaker 3>Although I gotta say the EPA thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any of this is actually </v>

1622
01:12:13.561 --> 01:12:14.394
<v Speaker 3>the source of the trump patriot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is like we hate trump and </v>

1623
01:12:16.801 --> 01:12:17.634
<v Speaker 3>now what's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how we're going to get evidence </v>

1624
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:21.220
<v Speaker 3>against him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1625
01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.133
<v Speaker 3>the truth is what they'll say nine out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of 10 times if I present this to a left </v>

1626
01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:25.670
<v Speaker 3>wing person or I'll go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1627
01:12:25.671 --> 01:12:26.504
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's pretty much continuing all the </v>

1628
01:12:26.911 --> 01:12:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Obama policies or it's virtually the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

1629
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:34.020
<v Speaker 3>Which I think is one of the really big </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories of the trump era so far that how</v>

1630
01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:37.290
<v Speaker 3>much is the same since Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one wants to talk about big changes.</v>

1631
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:41.010
<v Speaker 3>There's been a big change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there are no changes.</v>

1632
01:12:41.011 --> 01:12:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Immigration Policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immigration policy.</v>

1633
01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:45.660
<v Speaker 3>He wrote one executive order by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>courts,</v>

1634
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:46.523
<v Speaker 3>but it hasn't really gone into effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the idea that he's promoting </v>

1635
01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.050
<v Speaker 3>his rhetoric is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different.</v>

1636
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:53.730
<v Speaker 3>No question about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's promotes different ideas.</v>

1637
01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:55.080
<v Speaker 3>His rhetoric is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different.</v>

1638
01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of like monetary policy,</v>

1639
01:12:57.691 --> 01:12:59.340
<v Speaker 3>fiscal policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy,</v>

1640
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:02.820
<v Speaker 3>the war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you're talking about immigration,</v>

1641
01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of like,</v>

1642
01:13:03.731 --> 01:13:04.564
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get,</v>

1643
01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting that in domestic policy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind,</v>

1644
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:07.584
<v Speaker 3>but yet far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well in foreign policy it speaking </v>

1645
01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:10.404
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was saying nine out of 10 </v>

1646
01:13:11.161 --> 01:13:12.300
<v Speaker 3>times the answer to me as they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1647
01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:14.590
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of your white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you were in,</v>

1648
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.260
<v Speaker 3>if you were in one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1649
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1650
01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:18.503
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups that's worried about being </v>

1651
01:13:19.201 --> 01:13:20.850
<v Speaker 3>deported,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would feel differently.</v>

1652
01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:22.890
<v Speaker 3>But the fact is that deportations are </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1653
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:23.803
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Under trump,</v>

1654
01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.160
<v Speaker 3>there were more under Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1655
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.053
<v Speaker 3>they're down now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few different arguments for </v>

1656
01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:29.830
<v Speaker 3>why that reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1657
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:33.030
<v Speaker 3>there have been a lot of arrests but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not deportations,</v>

1658
01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.013
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even that the narrative isn't fitting </v>

1659
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:37.223
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>

1660
01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Like what really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1661
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 3>what really drove what made people hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump was his rhetoric.</v>

1662
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.210
<v Speaker 3>It was all rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>

1663
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Obama was deporting lots of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama was bombing the crap out of him.</v>

1664
01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:49.734
<v Speaker 3>Obama was targeting families of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of and he was torturing like all these </v>

1665
01:13:52.201 --> 01:13:54.360
<v Speaker 3>things were happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't talk about it.</v>

1666
01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.373
<v Speaker 3>He spoke about it in a nice way and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump was like this unapologetic like </v>

1667
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:05.510
<v Speaker 3>white rich man who didn't play the PC </v>
<v Speaker 3>game and spoke of minorities.</v>

1668
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Not In like a glowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry,</v>

1669
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.380
<v Speaker 3>like minorities are better than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the evil white guy.</v>

1670
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:11.891
<v Speaker 3>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1671
01:14:11.891 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 3>we're</v>

1672
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.850
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never say we're great.</v>

1673
01:14:13.851 --> 01:14:15.030
<v Speaker 1>He would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1674
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>some nice things about minorities when </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked,</v>

1675
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:17.463
<v Speaker 1>but his central message was like our </v>
<v Speaker 1>teams great and this to me is I think </v>

1676
01:14:21.401 --> 01:14:26.401
<v Speaker 1>the reason why leftwing people's blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>boil was just so many pieces of evidence</v>

1677
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 1>that point to corruption with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many pieces of evidence that point to</v>

1678
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:31.803
<v Speaker 1>the idea that this guy is operating in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interest of himself and of big </v>

1679
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>business and then he's profiting in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge way off being the president and one</v>

1680
01:14:40.571 --> 01:14:41.404
<v Speaker 1>of the ways they're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they're not rolling back the </v>

1681
01:14:43.301 --> 01:14:44.134
<v Speaker 1>environmental protection agency </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards because they don't believe in </v>

1682
01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:47.644
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're rolling a backpack because it's </v>

1683
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 1>impeding business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's infuriating.</v>

1684
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:51.754
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people on the west scares the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit out of people when you have some </v>

1685
01:14:54.101 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 1>crazy old man who's just doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything for profit.</v>

1686
01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.353
<v Speaker 1>Some guy who wants to literally start </v>
<v Speaker 1>disc fights with basketball players and </v>

1687
01:15:04.931 --> 01:15:06.700
<v Speaker 1>the hosts from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing.</v>

1688
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:07.603
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the host from espn who had tweeted </v>

1689
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.823
<v Speaker 1>some stuff about him being a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>supremacist and then he asked for espn </v>

1690
01:15:14.801 --> 01:15:16.060
<v Speaker 1>to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1691
01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:17.530
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you didn't talk about her man?</v>

1692
01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.990
<v Speaker 1>He can't talk about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't.</v>

1693
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.930
<v Speaker 1>They literally can't say her name </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if he goes after a black woman,</v>

1694
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.120
<v Speaker 1>then it reinforces all these people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

1695
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Prejudice might know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1696
01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get what you're saying and just to the</v>

1697
01:15:28.841 --> 01:15:30.530
<v Speaker 1>point about corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

1698
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.920
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the nature of government.</v>

1699
01:15:32.921 --> 01:15:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever decision they're making is</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on what lobbyists is lobbying them</v>

1700
01:15:36.761 --> 01:15:39.460
<v Speaker 1>the harder and when it's all corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is just that,</v>

1701
01:15:39.461 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 1>that is not at all different with trump.</v>

1702
01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean like if you like the corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>under Obama was.</v>

1703
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama just went and collected $400,000</v>

1704
01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:55.441
<v Speaker 1>for a speech to a Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's in there just a couple of months</v>

1705
01:15:55.931 --> 01:15:56.320
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1706
01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't they all do that and once they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1707
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.863
<v Speaker 1>bomb is like you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you preside over the bailouts of the </v>

1708
01:16:01.511 --> 01:16:02.650
<v Speaker 1>banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started under Bush,</v>

1709
01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:04.420
<v Speaker 1>but continued under Obama and the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>

1710
01:16:04.421 --> 01:16:06.340
<v Speaker 1>the Fed policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really bailed them out.</v>

1711
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.293
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take all this money for your </v>

1712
01:16:08.891 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 1>campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you present,</v>

1713
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:11.740
<v Speaker 1>you vote every way that they want you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1714
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:15.010
<v Speaker 1>You preside over the biggest profits for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big bankers.</v>

1715
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:15.903
<v Speaker 1>You put them all around your </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and he'd get out and you </v>

1716
01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:19.730
<v Speaker 1>collect your check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like time to get rich now.</v>

1717
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Now some of them one check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get a ton of them.</v>

1718
01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.010
<v Speaker 1>As you think it's speaking everywhere.</v>

1719
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm wrong,</v>

1720
01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:25.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being too cynical.</v>

1721
01:16:25.841 --> 01:16:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Probably all of those bankers just </v>
<v Speaker 1>really loved the way Obama speaks.</v>

1722
01:16:28.931 --> 01:16:29.590
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1723
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:31.930
<v Speaker 1>he has a great speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's my problem.</v>

1724
01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:32.963
<v Speaker 1>That's not why they're paying them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton is not a great speaker </v>

1725
01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.393
<v Speaker 1>and they paid her shit tons of money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that Bernie </v>

1726
01:16:38.201 --> 01:16:40.180
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the transcripts and you know,</v>

1727
01:16:40.181 --> 01:16:42.010
<v Speaker 1>what a transcript.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

1728
01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't,</v>

1729
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:47.140
<v Speaker 1>but wikileaks did get their hands on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them in which she said something that</v>

1730
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:48.003
<v Speaker 1>kind of indicated why she didn't release</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transcripts because she actually </v>

1731
01:16:50.321 --> 01:16:53.320
<v Speaker 1>said I'm lying to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1732
01:16:53.321 --> 01:16:54.154
<v Speaker 1>not literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she basically said to all these </v>

1733
01:16:55.271 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 1>bankers to not be concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1734
01:16:57.191 --> 01:16:58.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she hurt public rhetoric at the time was</v>

1735
01:16:58.811 --> 01:16:59.644
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1736
01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:02.320
<v Speaker 1>no one's too big to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no banker too big to jail.</v>

1737
01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.393
<v Speaker 1>And then she basically said to them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this speech that wikileaks leak to the </v>

1738
01:17:05.861 --> 01:17:07.510
<v Speaker 1>transcript of where she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1739
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you have to take one public and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold</v>

1740
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.963
<v Speaker 3>a different position in private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she was basically assuring know that </v>

1741
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:14.683
<v Speaker 3>that's an unaltered now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's kind of like the same way </v>

1742
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:18.224
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that all of the emails are </v>

1743
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 3>legit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they've been presented.</v>

1744
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:24.980
<v Speaker 3>Even the Clintons aren't arguing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are legitimate.</v>

1745
01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:25.823
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody's really coming out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing that they're not legitimate and </v>

1746
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:28.874
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it seems too big from a legitimate </v>

1747
01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:31.184
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian assange is sort of shifting over </v>

1748
01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:35.870
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paying more and more aggressive,</v>

1749
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:37.940
<v Speaker 3>like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his position on things.</v>

1750
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:39.910
<v Speaker 3>He's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's more aggressive,</v>

1751
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:40.783
<v Speaker 3>more leaning one way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's bummed out that he's still </v>

1752
01:17:44.061 --> 01:17:45.350
<v Speaker 3>stuck over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1753
01:17:45.351 --> 01:17:47.510
<v Speaker 3>it's rotting him away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1754
01:17:47.511 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 3>But I think he's been kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent.</v>

1755
01:17:49.341 --> 01:17:50.174
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like changing their of like I feel like </v>

1756
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:56.570
<v Speaker 3>the Democrats to me and the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow them and the trump haters,</v>

1757
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 3>it's like insane how much they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed their possessions.</v>

1758
01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:00.063
<v Speaker 3>Like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian assange was exposing all this </v>

1759
01:18:01.221 --> 01:18:02.054
<v Speaker 3>bullshit under Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He exposes all the shit about Clinton </v>

1760
01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:05.270
<v Speaker 3>and Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>

1761
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:06.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from my perspective,</v>

1762
01:18:06.351 --> 01:18:07.184
<v Speaker 3>they're all part of the same network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's kind of exposing the same </v>

1763
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:10.184
<v Speaker 3>network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the Democrats became cold </v>

1764
01:18:12.141 --> 01:18:13.130
<v Speaker 3>warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1765
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.930
<v Speaker 3>like the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as trump got in,</v>

1766
01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.071
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1767
01:18:16.071 --> 01:18:19.070
<v Speaker 3>everything was CIA is taken without any </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence being project,</v>

1768
01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:19.701
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>presented.</v>

1769
01:18:19.701 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 3>And Russia is the evil threat of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1770
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:22.274
<v Speaker 3>And like when did you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys became Republicans from the </v>

1771
01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:27.040
<v Speaker 3>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just that quickly and then every.</v>

1772
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I even saw somebody today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's like the trump haters,</v>

1773
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:31.603
<v Speaker 3>like again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel however you feel about trump hatim </v>

1774
01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.760
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead and be against.</v>

1775
01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:35.361
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1776
01:18:35.361 --> 01:18:36.194
<v Speaker 3>I think it's terrible that he's telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>st people should be fired for speaking </v>

1777
01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:40.160
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's ridiculous.</v>

1778
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.230
<v Speaker 3>But I say these guys who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1779
01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:43.030
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want,</v>

1780
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:45.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk about patriotism and,</v>

1781
01:18:45.081 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 3>and like bashing trump for being a draft</v>
<v Speaker 3>dodger.</v>

1782
01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 3>He wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He dodged it a ton of.</v>

1783
01:18:51.210 --> 01:18:56.210
<v Speaker 3>If you did whatever you did to stay out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Vietnam War,</v>

1784
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 3>God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God bless you for staying away from that</v>

1785
01:18:59.481 --> 01:19:02.390
<v Speaker 3>fucking nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was started on a lie.</v>

1786
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:06.260
<v Speaker 3>That was like the most disgusting mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughter for profit.</v>

1787
01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:07.283
<v Speaker 3>I mean like if someone avoided that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're mad at him for avoiding </v>

1788
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:14.140
<v Speaker 3>going and killing some fucking poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in Southeast Asia.</v>

1789
01:19:14.141 --> 01:19:14.974
<v Speaker 3>But it's just the point that they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>grab him on the hypocrisy of being a </v>

1790
01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:19.880
<v Speaker 3>chicken hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like same as Dick Cheney.</v>

1791
01:19:19.881 --> 01:19:22.520
<v Speaker 3>They did it with him as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not because he is at,</v>

1792
01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:23.354
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for hitting someone for </v>

1793
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:26.090
<v Speaker 3>hypocrisy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're advocating a war,</v>

1794
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 3>hitting them on not wanting to fight a </v>
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>

1795
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:28.783
<v Speaker 3>but you're just mad at him for not being</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the same side of yours about police </v>

1796
01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:32.150
<v Speaker 3>brutality.</v>

1797
01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:35.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like finding out his character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pointing out who he is.</v>

1798
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:36.463
<v Speaker 3>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't abandon all of your principle </v>

1799
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.773
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not like JFK went over and fought </v>

1800
01:19:40.611 --> 01:19:42.350
<v Speaker 3>in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get what you're saying,</v>

1801
01:19:42.351 --> 01:19:43.184
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying if the left is going to </v>

1802
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:45.434
<v Speaker 3>say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of abandoning your own </v>

1803
01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:48.230
<v Speaker 3>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to bash someone for like</v>

1804
01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 3>a not fighting in the Vietnam war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of know what they're doing.</v>

1805
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:53.144
<v Speaker 3>They all do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to find something that you did </v>

1806
01:19:54.391 --> 01:19:56.780
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of questionable that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can politicize.</v>

1807
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1808
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just making the same thing with like</v>

1809
01:19:59.571 --> 01:20:01.520
<v Speaker 3>the Democrats becoming the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

1810
01:20:01.521 --> 01:20:02.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so whatever windows,</v>

1811
01:20:02.421 --> 01:20:03.254
<v Speaker 3>whatever gets you points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What really gets me with the Democrats </v>

1812
01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 3>with the left is how all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian size is a puppet</v>

1813
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.700
<v Speaker 2>of Russia now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for the longest time Wiki leaks was</v>

1814
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:16.730
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be the voice of honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This not,</v>

1815
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:17.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>non bipartisan sorta or bipartisan </v>

1816
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.153
<v Speaker 2>openminded group that's just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disseminate information they think is </v>

1817
01:20:26.491 --> 01:20:28.470
<v Speaker 2>critical to the American people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being denied.</v>

1818
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Like the casual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it called casualties?</v>

1819
01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:37.650
<v Speaker 2>What was that one video that they had?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a v,</v>

1820
01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:40.140
<v Speaker 2>one of the first videos was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what they called it,</v>

1821
01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:45.440
<v Speaker 2>but they had a footage from one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>gunships when those helicopters and they</v>

1822
01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:48.054
<v Speaker 2>showed these guys sort of casually </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about gunning down these </v>

1823
01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:51.144
<v Speaker 2>reporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought these reporters are </v>

1824
01:20:52.021 --> 01:20:54.990
<v Speaker 2>carrying guns and so they just opened </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire on them and gunned him down,</v>

1825
01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:55.824
<v Speaker 2>including lunch.</v>

1826
01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

1827
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:05.760
<v Speaker 2>but that sort of like they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They felt like they had some information</v>

1828
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:06.683
<v Speaker 2>that people weren't aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't allowed to see photos of </v>

1829
01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 2>caskets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't allowed to get the full.</v>

1830
01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:11.883
<v Speaker 2>They weren't allowed to have a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed opinion and what exactly is </v>

1831
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:18.600
<v Speaker 2>happening there and when they see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrors of war in that regard,</v>

1832
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:19.434
<v Speaker 2>like we see people like sort of casually</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about gunning down some people </v>

1833
01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:23.503
<v Speaker 2>and I think there are kids in their car </v>
<v Speaker 2>and well they shouldn't have brought </v>

1834
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:25.590
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1835
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:26.970
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the things they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

1836
01:21:26.971 --> 01:21:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Like that whole thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1837
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.060
<v Speaker 2>we are better off knowing that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what can happen if you just allow people</v>

1838
01:21:33.061 --> 01:21:36.150
<v Speaker 2>to just go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially some really ambiguous war</v>

1839
01:21:36.151 --> 01:21:38.130
<v Speaker 2>on terror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what wikileaks did for,</v>

1840
01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qliq stood for Chelsea Manning,</v>

1841
01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:43.200
<v Speaker 2>AK Bradley Manning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1842
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:44.183
<v Speaker 2>releasing this information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who is under a lot of people's </v>

1843
01:21:46.831 --> 01:21:47.641
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a patriot,</v>

1844
01:21:47.641 --> 01:21:48.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A whistleblower.</v>

1845
01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:51.300
<v Speaker 2>See something gets a hold of some stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

1846
01:21:51.301 --> 01:21:52.134
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys got to see this and gives it </v>

1847
01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:57.150
<v Speaker 2>out to wikileaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but try to give it out to other people.</v>

1848
01:21:57.151 --> 01:21:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't,</v>

1849
01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:01.080
<v Speaker 2>didn't he try or she tried to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York time?</v>

1850
01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:04.180
<v Speaker 3>I believe so I got rejected it and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>out into the same thing.</v>

1851
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:07.210
<v Speaker 3>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1852
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Chelsea Manning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bradley manning at the time,</v>

1853
01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.013
<v Speaker 3>paid quite a price for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 200 days in solitary </v>

1854
01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.930
<v Speaker 3>confinement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a really brutal price.</v>

1855
01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

1856
01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:20.680
<v Speaker 3>and exposed a ton of really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1857
01:22:20.681 --> 01:22:21.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1858
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:23.800
<v Speaker 3>what we learned from the Bradley Manning</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dump,</v>

1859
01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:24.851
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1860
01:22:24.851 --> 01:22:25.684
<v Speaker 3>like all this crazy shit about war </v>
<v Speaker 3>crimes and then like we learned about </v>

1861
01:22:28.931 --> 01:22:29.764
<v Speaker 3>how there were like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like US officials trying to influence </v>

1862
01:22:34.721 --> 01:22:38.580
<v Speaker 3>the British parliament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to influence a reporters and just</v>

1863
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:40.810
<v Speaker 3>all that shady shit that came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1864
01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:41.913
<v Speaker 3>and then again it becomes this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like integrity test for the mainstream </v>

1865
01:22:44.651 --> 01:22:46.450
<v Speaker 3>media or they just have no interest in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1866
01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:47.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they talk about it,</v>

1867
01:22:47.561 --> 01:22:50.170
<v Speaker 3>they'll talk about Chelsea manning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the story.</v>

1868
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:52.420
<v Speaker 3>The same snowden's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of it's ever like,</v>

1869
01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:53.343
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we learned some crazy shit that's going </v>

1870
01:22:54.821 --> 01:22:56.560
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what we are.</v>

1871
01:22:56.561 --> 01:22:57.520
<v Speaker 3>We're a nation of gossip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

1872
01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Copper next historic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Puerto Rico.</v>

1873
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:00.993
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy not standing up with his hand in </v>

1874
01:23:03.461 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>the correct position that lets know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are</v>

1875
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.173
<v Speaker 3>all on one mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is more important and even </v>

1876
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:11.194
<v Speaker 3>within that context and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like and this is where there's this </v>

1877
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:13.684
<v Speaker 3>weird disconnect between like there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the mainstream media and then all </v>

1878
01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:17.374
<v Speaker 3>of the alternative Internet media and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certainly a ton of bullshit in </v>

1879
01:23:20.111 --> 01:23:20.944
<v Speaker 3>the alternative Internet media world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of just straight up false stories </v>

1880
01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.073
<v Speaker 3>short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there are people also talking </v>

1881
01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:27.004
<v Speaker 3>about the truth there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas none of that seems to enter the </v>

1882
01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:30.100
<v Speaker 3>mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what doesn't.</v>

1883
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 3>What gets brought up online and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative media,</v>

1884
01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:34.540
<v Speaker 3>which should be at the center of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

1885
01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.500
<v Speaker 3>is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the the players didn't use to be on</v>

1886
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:40.940
<v Speaker 3>the field for the national anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the vast majority.</v>

1887
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:41.793
<v Speaker 3>It was 2009 or 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Defense Department cuts these huge </v>

1888
01:23:44.891 --> 01:23:45.724
<v Speaker 3>checks to the nfl and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden they get the players out on the </v>

1889
01:23:48.131 --> 01:23:49.990
<v Speaker 3>field so we can do this whole tribute </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1890
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:50.913
<v Speaker 3>And the military industrial complex has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been like working on taking this past </v>

1891
01:23:54.101 --> 01:23:55.750
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one sport in America,</v>

1892
01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.673
<v Speaker 3>which is already pretty like warring and</v>
<v Speaker 3>making sure we can use this as </v>

1893
01:24:00.221 --> 01:24:02.610
<v Speaker 3>propaganda to get Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1894
01:24:02.611 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 3>into this nationalistic pro military </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset.</v>

1895
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I like no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you a journalist?</v>

1896
01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Like how are you not interested in that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is it,</v>

1897
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:10.623
<v Speaker 3>how can Obama sign into the national </v>
<v Speaker 3>defense authorization act that he has </v>

1898
01:24:13.691 --> 01:24:17.740
<v Speaker 3>the right to detain American citizens </v>
<v Speaker 3>with no charges?</v>

1899
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.640
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1900
01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.100
<v Speaker 3>like Alex Jones is over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1901
01:24:21.101 --> 01:24:23.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he says some wild stuff,</v>

1902
01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:25.720
<v Speaker 3>but he is making a big deal about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is crazy.</v>

1903
01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.820
<v Speaker 3>And then the mainstream media just </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't think it's a big story.</v>

1904
01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:28.953
<v Speaker 3>How is it possible that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalist in honest journalist with </v>

1905
01:24:31.871 --> 01:24:34.210
<v Speaker 3>integrity and you don't think it's a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>store?</v>

1906
01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.850
<v Speaker 3>You don't look at that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's the story of my lifetime.</v>

1907
01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:37.983
<v Speaker 3>Obama just repealed habeas corpus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think it's the exact same </v>

1908
01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:44.030
<v Speaker 3>thing as what we were talking about with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in academia and on the left,</v>

1909
01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:47.710
<v Speaker 3>don't look at things that are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposition to the group.</v>

1910
01:24:47.711 --> 01:24:49.190
<v Speaker 3>Think of their ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1911
01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:52.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of that and it's like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing where it's like there's this,</v>

1912
01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:53.493
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like unspoken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unwritten pressure where you just kinda </v>

1913
01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:56.831
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1914
01:24:56.831 --> 01:24:57.664
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have this herd mentality and you </v>

1915
01:24:58.451 --> 01:25:01.570
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I step out here I get bashed and most</v>

1916
01:25:01.571 --> 01:25:03.850
<v Speaker 3>people don't want to get bashed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1917
01:25:03.851 --> 01:25:04.684
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about the people who </v>

1918
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:08.140
<v Speaker 3>are professors and and they're certainly</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1919
01:25:08.141 --> 01:25:09.290
<v Speaker 3>very smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of very,</v>

1920
01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.890
<v Speaker 3>very smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is a certain personality type,</v>

1921
01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:12.900
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that,</v>

1922
01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:13.733
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person who like that you go to </v>

1923
01:25:14.801 --> 01:25:15.550
<v Speaker 3>school your whole life.</v>

1924
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Then you go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go to Grad school,</v>

1925
01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:20.770
<v Speaker 3>then you teach and you basically just </v>
<v Speaker 3>been in college your whole life.</v>

1926
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.633
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That woman at the Berkeley protests </v>

1927
01:25:24.461 --> 01:25:26.890
<v Speaker 3>where she's screaming at the cops </v>

1966
01:28:15.021 --> 01:28:16.910
<v Speaker 1>like as a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just look at that and you're like,</v>

1971
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:30.870
<v Speaker 1>just look at her the way she's behaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a balance,</v>

1972
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:32.083
<v Speaker 1>but ilt person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was describing with the college </v>

1973
01:28:34.281 --> 01:28:36.670

<v Speaker 1>Like you're tapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:28:47.061 --> 01:28:47.894
<v Speaker 1>You tap out black belts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coral and then red belt is like Noam </v>

1980
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Chomsky,</v>

1982
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.593
<v Speaker 1>a red belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noam Chomsky is actually like an </v>

1983
01:28:55.131 --> 01:28:55.964
<v Speaker 1>intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lump them in with these </v>

1984
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:58.330
<v Speaker 1>top of right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1985
01:28:58.350 --> 01:29:00.110
<v Speaker 1>but he is talking to the top of the food</v>
<v Speaker 1>chain,</v>

1986
01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 1>left wing ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is like</v>

<v Speaker 2>some Hixon Gracie Shit,</v>

1989
01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 2>She's more of a Kung Fu person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got ineffective martial arts.</v>

1990
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:09.893
<v Speaker 2>She's got some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some shit that doesn't even really work </v>

1991
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:12.643
<v Speaker 2>for work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to get people with that </v>

1992
01:29:13.711 --> 01:29:16.440
<v Speaker 2>cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Touched was like a guy with like just an</v>

1993
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:17.274
<v Speaker 2>overhand right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could probably take you if like you'd </v>

1994
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.330
<v Speaker 2>like to see her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in an MMA fight with Cyborg.</v>

1995
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 2>She actually would believe that she had </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1996
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Cheese is still the most amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still to me,</v>

1997
01:29:27.341 --> 01:29:28.174
<v Speaker 2>nothing better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you've got over a bunch of near </v>

1998
01:29:29.361 --> 01:29:30.194
<v Speaker 2>Shell before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing better to me than </v>

1999
01:29:30.691 --> 01:29:34.290
<v Speaker 2>someone really believing in a martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>art that doesn't work and finding out in</v>

2000
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:35.124
<v Speaker 2>a fight modular doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing through the early UFC is </v>

2001
01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:39.030
<v Speaker 2>when it used to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll still,</v>

2002
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:40.540
<v Speaker 2>you'll find internet videos that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2003
01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:44.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's still going on in 2016 and 17 </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been some of the best videos ever,</v>

2004
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:46.980
<v Speaker 2>especially at China where they had that.</v>

2005
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:47.993
<v Speaker 2>One guy had to go into hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brained some fucking poor slob that </v>

2006
01:29:51.091 --> 01:29:53.880
<v Speaker 2>thought he knew Kung Fu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know some dude really thought he was</v>

2007
01:29:53.881 --> 01:29:55.020
<v Speaker 2>going to cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch this guy,</v>

2008
01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:58.020
<v Speaker 2>and he got he this Chinese kid who knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma,</v>

2009
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:02.310
<v Speaker 2>fuck this guy up and had to go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>hiding because so many people are mad at</v>

2010
01:30:02.311 --> 01:30:03.144
<v Speaker 2>him for using martial arts techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>that did not originate in China to sort </v>

2011
01:30:07.441 --> 01:30:09.770
<v Speaker 2>of denigrate Chinese martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2012
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Myth versus reality.</v>

2013
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:12.833
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are fighting against the exposing </v>

2014
01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:20.310
<v Speaker 2>of their bullshit nonsensical fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiger claws.</v>

2015
01:30:20.311 --> 01:30:21.144
<v Speaker 2>Shit like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've got an entire identity </v>

2016
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:23.223
<v Speaker 2>associated with this being real me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And want the guy who did is also </v>

2017
01:30:25.201 --> 01:30:26.034
<v Speaker 2>Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so China is apparently like Asia in </v>

2018
01:30:28.491 --> 01:30:29.324
<v Speaker 2>particular is where a lot of the martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts techniques that people use today </v>

2019
01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:32.843
<v Speaker 2>originated and they were sort of adapted</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were changed and they evolved </v>

2020
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:38.580
<v Speaker 2>particularly in Thailand.</v>

2021
01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:42.990
<v Speaker 2>They really started understanding how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick the legs and they became masters at</v>

2022
01:30:42.991 --> 01:30:43.824
<v Speaker 2>using the elbows and the knees more so </v>
<v Speaker 2>than and they did it through </v>

2023
01:30:46.351 --> 01:30:48.120
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really quite fascinating.</v>

2024
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.013
<v Speaker 2>They did it through gambling and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>having these competitions on a regular </v>

2025
01:30:53.041 --> 01:30:55.560
<v Speaker 2>basis where people will like nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years old,</v>

2026
01:30:55.561 --> 01:30:58.620
<v Speaker 2>they start fighting and they fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might have hundreds and hundreds of</v>

2027
01:30:58.621 --> 01:31:00.360
<v Speaker 2>fights in their career by the time they </v>
<v Speaker 2>retire.</v>

2028
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:04.260
<v Speaker 2>They developed a real acute </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what actually works and</v>

2029
01:31:04.261 --> 01:31:07.590
<v Speaker 2>what doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas these other worlds,</v>

2030
01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.040
<v Speaker 2>they didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have.</v>

2031
01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:13.110
<v Speaker 2>They weren't like this small island is </v>
<v Speaker 2>filled with hedonists that are gambling,</v>

2032
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 2>kicking each other in the legs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>betting on the guy kicking the guy.</v>

2033
01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:19.860
<v Speaker 2>That's really what develop that art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's other ones that sort of</v>

2034
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:24.861
<v Speaker 2>stayed in this non evolved state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as the material sort of got out</v>

2035
01:31:25.111 --> 01:31:28.230
<v Speaker 2>to all of the world and people started </v>
<v Speaker 2>to evolve into techniques,</v>

2036
01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:31.500
<v Speaker 2>it all coalesced together in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate fighting championship.</v>

2037
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.520
<v Speaker 2>And then we realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2038
01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:35.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a combination of these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't necessarily always work on every</v>

2039
01:31:35.761 --> 01:31:36.594
<v Speaker 2>individual and styles sort of straddles </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of determined interactions and </v>

2040
01:31:42.031 --> 01:31:44.970
<v Speaker 2>athletes determined whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is effective or ineffective as</v>

2041
01:31:44.971 --> 01:31:45.804
<v Speaker 2>much as the technique itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the athleticism and speed and power of </v>

2042
01:31:48.001 --> 01:31:48.834
<v Speaker 2>the practitioner is very important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all told these are the things that </v>

2043
01:31:51.751 --> 01:31:55.470
<v Speaker 2>we think are pretty effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the standard techniques.</v>

2044
01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new information.</v>

2045
01:31:57.121 --> 01:31:59.220
<v Speaker 2>But you figure out pretty quickly like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2046
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:02.620
<v Speaker 2>like wrestling and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crane kicks are not the same thing.</v>

2047
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:03.753
<v Speaker 2>One guy used Western boxing techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Moy Tai and wrestling and Jujitsu </v>

2048
01:32:08.321 --> 01:32:11.260
<v Speaker 2>and just beat the holy fuck or this </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor.</v>

2049
01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean did it like 10 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat the holy fuck out of this poor Kung</v>

2050
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Fu guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he had to go into hiding.</v>

2051
01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:17.853
<v Speaker 2>People didn't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to know this is white </v>

2052
01:32:19.691 --> 01:32:21.130
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white power.</v>

2053
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:24.400
<v Speaker 2>The white power guy goes in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets fucking merch by Anthony.</v>

2054
01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Joshua Electric Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is this possible?</v>

2055
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it happened.</v>

2056

<v Speaker 2>Do you not know who he is?</v>

2057
01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.240
<v Speaker 2>You know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in denial of this.</v>

2058
01:32:34.241 --> 01:32:36.520
<v Speaker 2>And so if they all came after Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joshua,</v>

2059
01:32:36.670 --> 01:32:38.920
<v Speaker 2>because he beat the shit out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>white power boxer.</v>

2060
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:42.100
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what's going on in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's take watch it here.</v>

2061

<v Speaker 2>Literally it happens all the like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 seconds.</v>

2068
01:33:00.931 --> 01:33:04.210

2074
01:33:13.211 --> 01:33:14.044
<v Speaker 2>going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must've believed that he was capable </v>

2075
01:33:15.611 --> 01:33:19.920
<v Speaker 2>of fending off attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agent and he's doing that crazy shit.</v>

01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:53.703
<v Speaker 2>He was doing this stuff before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the octagon warmup and it comes </v>

2092
01:33:56.351 --> 01:33:57.460
<v Speaker 2>out like doing it and you're like,</v>

2095
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.903
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like style of trying to block by like </v>

2096
01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.450
<v Speaker 2>hitting their hands with your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way Out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz is a record.</v>

2098
01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm remembering.</v>

2099
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm Tony Ferguson fighting this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a bad motherfucker and pride.</v>

2100
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:17.200
<v Speaker 2>And His name is cocooned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2101
01:34:17.201 --> 01:34:20.910
<v Speaker 2>And he used to fight like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up Tony Ferguson's record me.</v>

2102
01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:23.830
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find that video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Ferguson versus cocoon.</v>

2103
01:34:25.230 --> 01:34:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2104
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's he though of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2105
01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

2106
01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Tony Ferguson.</v>

2107
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:31.420
<v Speaker 2>He's been around for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2108
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:36.550
<v Speaker 2>totally lit him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it was was that cocoon was a guy</v>

2109
01:34:36.551 --> 01:34:37.384
<v Speaker 2>that had this crazy kick that he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw to the body and fuck a lot of </v>

2110
01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:41.254
<v Speaker 2>people up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was kind of a hybrid between a </v>

2111
01:34:42.971 --> 01:34:46.450
<v Speaker 2>front kick and a roundhouse kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some people would call it a 45.</v>

2112
01:34:46.650 --> 01:34:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cotsen,</v>

2113
01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Nora cocoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2114
01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:51.100
<v Speaker 2>And He came out him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2115
01:34:51.101 --> 01:34:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the fight you're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>of man.</v>

2116
01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you this guy pull up.</v>

2117
01:34:56.651 --> 01:34:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz is one of the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different guy.</v>

2118
01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I used to fight like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to walk forward like this.</v>

2119
01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:05.210
<v Speaker 2>The Guy I was like that it was a similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of style,</v>

2120
01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.073
<v Speaker 2>but the guy was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like real short too and I </v>

2121
01:35:07.251 --> 01:35:08.084
<v Speaker 2>mean Nick Diaz just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like the worst guy to fight with </v>

2122
01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:13.670
<v Speaker 2>that style because he's got like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris boxing so he just came in.</v>

2123
01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean just lit them up like next to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>last fight in his first run in the UFC.</v>

2124
01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:21.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's up way before this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2125
01:35:21.670 --> 01:35:22.503
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>in the UFC.</v>

2129

2142
01:35:57.831 --> 01:36:00.920
<v Speaker 2>walked into the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really strange.</v>

01:36:29.631 --> 01:36:31.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird one because cocoon.</v>

2155
01:36:31.461 --> 01:36:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had this weird style,</v>

2156
01:36:32.751 --> 01:36:33.584
<v Speaker 2>like almost like a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you would think of as a guy who </v>

2157
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:38.180
<v Speaker 2>knows karate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like move forward,</v>

2158
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:42.050
<v Speaker 2>like standing like totally square,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not sideways,</v>

2159
01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:43.093
<v Speaker 2>like moving forward in this weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would throw this kick and it </v>

2160
01:36:46.101 --> 01:36:48.890
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a front kick up the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like an angled front kick.</v>

2161
01:36:48.891 --> 01:36:51.860
<v Speaker 2>So he hit you with the ball was foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you throw it like a roundhouse kick,</v>

2162
01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:56.000
<v Speaker 2>which was one of the ways that they used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that in the old taekwondo way too.</v>

2163
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:59.150
<v Speaker 2>They would make impact with the ball of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the foot with a roundhouse kick,</v>

2164
01:36:59.151 --> 01:37:02.360
<v Speaker 2>like they would throw a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I got a book when I was a kid about</v>

2165
01:37:02.361 --> 01:37:03.194
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo techniques and this one old </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude would practice in the park by </v>

2166
01:37:06.831 --> 01:37:10.790
<v Speaker 2>kicking trees and the way he would kick </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees with the ball of his foot.</v>

2167
01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:14.720
<v Speaker 2>He throw a roundhouse kick and kick the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball of his foot into the tree.</v>

2168
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.220
<v Speaker 2>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really funny,</v>

2169
01:37:16.221 --> 01:37:17.054
<v Speaker 2>but because in one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things where you described </v>

2170
01:37:19.231 --> 01:37:20.064
<v Speaker 2>all various self defense techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he described what to do if you ever </v>

2171
01:37:22.821 --> 01:37:25.370
<v Speaker 2>threatened by someone and one thing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do is kick a tree.</v>

2172
01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:29.330
<v Speaker 2>So show them like if you kick a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you could do to them.</v>

2173
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.863
<v Speaker 2>It's probably an actually bad advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just to break your leg and then </v>

2174
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I'll just kick a tree.</v>

2175
01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:34.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

2176
01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:38.000
<v Speaker 2>if you're not used to getting countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if you can back that up,</v>

2177
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:40.130
<v Speaker 2>CV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back it up.</v>

2178
01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:41.700
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a ten second view.</v>

2179
01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:42.593
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2180
01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Cocoon was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2181
01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:49.790
<v Speaker 2>this is also another one of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>were go let that play.</v>

2182
01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Play out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little video you were just showing.</v>

2183
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:55.860
<v Speaker 2>He was one of those guys that was in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit ton of fights.</v>

2184
01:37:55.861 --> 01:37:56.694
<v Speaker 2>So see that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was back when he was competing and </v>

2185
01:37:58.381 --> 01:38:00.270
<v Speaker 2>karate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's Keoki.</v>

2186
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keoki Shin.</v>

2187
01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.490
<v Speaker 2>And so they fought with yogesh and </v>
<v Speaker 2>outfits on,</v>

2188
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 2>but they had an MMA fight and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a,</v>

2189
01:38:09.970 --> 01:38:14.100
<v Speaker 2>the referee was dressed up in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird sort of geisha outfit.</v>

2190
01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck's that guy wearing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But cocoon.</v>

2191
01:38:16.971 --> 01:38:17.804
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a like sort of a classic Japanese </v>

2192
01:38:19.711 --> 01:38:20.760
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stryker.</v>

2193
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:21.870
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's him right there.</v>

2194
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:22.733
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you got to think by the time these </v>

2195
01:38:25.051 --> 01:38:25.884
<v Speaker 2>guys got to the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had been trained so many fucking </v>

2196
01:38:28.141 --> 01:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially fighting in pride and k one.</v>

2197
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2198
01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Front kick to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right hand.</v>

2199
01:38:36.330 --> 01:38:37.590
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was due.</v>

2200
01:38:37.591 --> 01:38:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Dude is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check this out again,</v>

2201
01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch how I do this.</v>

2202
01:38:42.090 --> 01:38:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Just steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a different fight.</v>

2203
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:45.383
<v Speaker 2>Aau Tournament probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really crazy that these guys </v>

2204
01:38:50.551 --> 01:38:51.384
<v Speaker 2>would do this more than one time a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was what they did in pride a </v>

2205
01:38:54.091 --> 01:38:54.930
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2206
01:38:54.931 --> 01:38:57.210
<v Speaker 2>he just threw them off the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mat and pride.</v>

2207
01:38:57.211 --> 01:38:58.044
<v Speaker 2>They would fight several times a day </v>
<v Speaker 2>early UFC is as well and then it like </v>

2208
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:04.110
<v Speaker 2>eventually I think they started </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing like a lot of guys get injured</v>

2209
01:39:04.111 --> 01:39:04.944
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The craziest ideas like that stupid </v>

2210
01:39:06.391 --> 01:39:09.780
<v Speaker 2>movie warrior when they fought more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time in a week,</v>

2211
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.990
<v Speaker 2>like they fought once and they fought </v>
<v Speaker 2>again the next day.</v>

2212
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.863
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be worse than the same day</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably because you're like all the </v>

2213
01:39:14.671 --> 01:39:16.710
<v Speaker 2>soreness that like comes in two days </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

2214
01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:17.603
<v Speaker 2>Your fucking face is all swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say you have to have </v>

2215
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:22.140
<v Speaker 2>sunglasses everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely can't take a punch.</v>

2216
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole idea is so stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do that.</v>

2217
01:39:24.631 --> 01:39:27.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe they've done that a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of times throughout history,</v>

2218
01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:30.470
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a standard thing in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie warrior.</v>

2219
01:39:30.471 --> 01:39:31.304
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just added their own Hollywood </v>

2220
01:39:32.191 --> 01:39:33.380
<v Speaker 2>judges to the suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

2221
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:36.050
<v Speaker 2>let me just change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fight for the flavor,</v>

2222
01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:40.440
<v Speaker 2>and then the next day I'll grabbed my </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls.</v>

2223
01:39:41.170 --> 01:39:42.003
<v Speaker 2>That's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They added their own stupidity to it </v>

2224
01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:45.133
<v Speaker 2>just didn't even make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was totally unnecessary like </v>

2225
01:39:47.791 --> 01:39:49.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's you can't,</v>

2226
01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:50.123
<v Speaker 2>you're changing what martial arts are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to fit your narrative because </v>

2227
01:39:53.341 --> 01:39:54.300
<v Speaker 2>you're not a good writer.</v>

2228
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were a good writer,</v>

2229
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.510
<v Speaker 2>you would write about how it actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens and you'd make a story about how</v>

2230
01:40:00.511 --> 01:40:03.870
<v Speaker 2>it actually happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't create some fake thing that</v>

2231
01:40:03.871 --> 01:40:08.100
<v Speaker 2>you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So be several times in a day,</v>

2232
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:10.800
<v Speaker 2>twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two days in a row you'd be fucking meat.</v>

2233
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just give them super powers at this</v>

2234
01:40:13.351 --> 01:40:15.030
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give him like guns and stuff.</v>

2235
01:40:15.031 --> 01:40:16.640
<v Speaker 2>If you're listening to John Claude van </v>
<v Speaker 2>Damme,</v>

2236
01:40:16.770 --> 01:40:18.400
<v Speaker 2>you got to decide what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

2237
01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:19.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an excellent dramatic movie with Nick </v>

2238
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Nolte and Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's his name?</v>

2239
01:40:23.431 --> 01:40:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Who was another guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuck's his name?</v>

2240
01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.091
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2241
01:40:26.091 --> 01:40:26.491
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2242
01:40:26.491 --> 01:40:29.340
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The young guy who's a Bain,</v>

2243
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Tom Hardy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Hardy,</v>

2244
01:40:30.810 --> 01:40:32.390
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2245
01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:34.530
<v Speaker 2>It's him and Nick Nolte mean they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>

2246
01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:35.573
<v Speaker 2>but yet they put it in this stupid plot </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea where they have to fight in two </v>

2247
01:40:37.891 --> 01:40:38.491
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2248
01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:40.560
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just come on.</v>

2249
01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:41.543
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's annoying because it's like you're </v>

2250
01:40:42.421 --> 01:40:43.254
<v Speaker 2>making this world real and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something that's just my little </v>

2251
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:46.703
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:49.800
<v Speaker 2>World where I work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it makes me buy like super offended.</v>

2253
01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:50.873
<v Speaker 2>I'm super excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it impossible for someone like </v>

2254
01:40:52.201 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>you to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like if anyone</v>

2255
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.770
<v Speaker 1>who knows fighting Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way I will say,</v>

2256
01:40:56.771 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 1>and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when we talk about old school,</v>

2257
01:40:58.301 --> 01:40:59.320
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something like that.</v>

2258
01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm nostalgic for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't have it now.</v>

2259
01:41:01.841 --> 01:41:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It has to be the sport it is now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's evolved way past there,</v>

2260
01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:05.493
<v Speaker 1>but there was just something so cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the old ufc and there was </v>

2261
01:41:07.841 --> 01:41:08.674
<v Speaker 1>something about the conor versus floyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight that almost gave you that feeling </v>

2262
01:41:12.731 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 1>again of like these two guys from </v>
<v Speaker 1>different worlds going in there and like</v>

2263
01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:17.704
<v Speaker 1>how does this look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does a guy who doing mma striking </v>

2264
01:41:20.051 --> 01:41:22.810
<v Speaker 1>and fucking doing like capital Ada stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side,</v>

2265
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:23.833
<v Speaker 1>how does he go in there and buck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it turned out connor actually it </v>

2266
01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:26.411
<v Speaker 1>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

2267
01:41:26.411 --> 01:41:28.210
<v Speaker 1>you got a box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do any of that stuff.</v>

2268
01:41:28.230 --> 01:41:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Get destroyed.</v>

2269
01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 1>So I just went out there and boxed and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was an interesting.</v>

2270
01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:32.253
<v Speaker 1>Like I came out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was arguing with a lot of friends of </v>

2271
01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:36.610
<v Speaker 1>mine were like big boxing fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing against you guys.</v>

2272
01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.473
<v Speaker 1>God bless boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like as big a fan as I used to </v>

2273
01:41:39.761 --> 01:41:41.140
<v Speaker 1>bake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge MMA fan,</v>

2274
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.870
<v Speaker 1>but I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at mma,</v>

2275
01:41:43.871 --> 01:41:46.490
<v Speaker 1>the way you look at mma is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sport of fighting and,</v>

2276
01:41:46.491 --> 01:41:47.324
<v Speaker 1>and the original thing was always </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out who's better at fighting </v>

2277
01:41:49.271 --> 01:41:50.104
<v Speaker 1>and have these does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just hard for me to not look at </v>

2278
01:41:51.971 --> 01:41:56.971
<v Speaker 1>the fight with conor and floyd and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2279
01:41:57.490 --> 01:41:58.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when there was the first </v>

2280
01:41:58.571 --> 01:41:59.404
<v Speaker 1>Clinton I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis j Gomez said this to me is the </v>

2281
01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:02.770
<v Speaker 1>first clinch of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2282
01:42:02.771 --> 01:42:04.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where connor would destroy him.</v>

2283
01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:05.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you just sit there watching 10 </v>

2284
01:42:06.761 --> 01:42:10.510
<v Speaker 1>rounds of of a referee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving floyd mayweather's life.</v>

2285
01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Like every few seconds the referee comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and goes,</v>

2286
01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me save your life.</v>

2287
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Don't let me save your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're the greatest effort this,</v>

2288
01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:19.750
<v Speaker 1>but you need even under your rules with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your gloves and your this,</v>

2289
01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:20.763
<v Speaker 1>you need a ref to keep coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saving your life every few seconds and </v>

2290
01:42:23.531 --> 01:42:25.940
<v Speaker 1>you'd see it like every time they they </v>
<v Speaker 1>clenched.</v>

2291
01:42:25.941 --> 01:42:26.774
<v Speaker 1>Like connor would immediately almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>just instinctually just kind of take us </v>

2292
01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:30.154
<v Speaker 1>back and like step over here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here is where I can hit you and </v>

2293
01:42:32.681 --> 01:42:35.080
<v Speaker 1>you can't hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would just cover up and bend over.</v>

2294
01:42:35.290 --> 01:42:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Like literally bend over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy come saved my life buddy.</v>

2295
01:42:38.190 --> 01:42:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's just hard to not watch that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2296
01:42:40.541 --> 01:42:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he wanted to,</v>

2297
01:42:41.771 --> 01:42:43.600
<v Speaker 1>he would jump on his back and choke them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>

2298
01:42:43.650 --> 01:42:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And even in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in your sport,</v>

2299
01:42:45.850 --> 01:42:49.220
<v Speaker 1>like he went 10 rounds and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know mayweather.</v>

2300
01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I know what may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether did was brilliant and he dragged</v>

2301
01:42:51.461 --> 01:42:53.320
<v Speaker 1>him in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he played it safe and perfectly,</v>

2302
01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:54.333
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a part of the plan to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>that upper cut on the chin that </v>

2303
01:42:56.081 --> 01:42:57.970
<v Speaker 1>definitely wasn't a part of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2304
01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and also I think there's boxers punch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot harder than MMA guys do and there's,</v>

2305
01:43:01.941 --> 01:43:02.774
<v Speaker 1>there's truth to that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Connor's power didn't translate in </v>

2306
01:43:05.021 --> 01:43:08.770
<v Speaker 1>the way that MMA fans thought it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just not quite as fluid.</v>

2307
01:43:08.771 --> 01:43:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And also I think he was probably very </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous.</v>

2308
01:43:11.410 --> 01:43:12.243
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's fighting literally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest fighter of all time and his </v>

2309
01:43:14.171 --> 01:43:17.950
<v Speaker 1>first professional boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

2310
01:43:17.951 --> 01:43:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And yet he's still got it to the 10th </v>
<v Speaker 1>round it flow.</v>

2311
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2312
01:43:20.850 --> 01:43:21.683
<v Speaker 1>this is why I said I said I gave her a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very small chance of winning a boxing </v>

2313
01:43:26.201 --> 01:43:27.011
<v Speaker 1>match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small.</v>

2314
01:43:27.011 --> 01:43:27.844
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it was like 94 percent that</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd would beat the shit out of Canada </v>

2315
01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:32.373
<v Speaker 1>the way he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the economy would eventually get </v>

2316
01:43:34.061 --> 01:43:36.010
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy who did the best assessment</v>

2317
01:43:36.011 --> 01:43:36.844
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2318
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.890
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion was John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Donahoe.</v>

2319
01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:41.740
<v Speaker 1>John Danaher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a brilliant Jujitsu coach,</v>

2320
01:43:41.741 --> 01:43:44.590
<v Speaker 1>is also brilliant mma coach because get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep understanding of it.</v>

2321
01:43:44.591 --> 01:43:47.740
<v Speaker 1>He basically spelled out exactly what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen because of all the times</v>

2322
01:43:47.741 --> 01:43:52.220
<v Speaker 1>he's seen a boxer's sparring with elite </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial artists that the mixed martial</v>

2323
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:53.053
<v Speaker 2>arts does well for a few rounds because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes awhile for the box and to </v>

2324
01:43:55.881 --> 01:43:59.760
<v Speaker 2>figure out the timing and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiency and fluidity of the box.</v>

2325
01:43:59.770 --> 01:44:00.603
<v Speaker 2>It starts to take over the ring </v>
<v Speaker 2>generalship the understanding of this </v>

2326
01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:03.373
<v Speaker 2>one isolated particular discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they dominate and that's exactly </v>

2327
01:44:06.711 --> 01:44:07.544
<v Speaker 2>what happened to a it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I said is I think there's a 94 </v>

2328
01:44:10.731 --> 01:44:11.564
<v Speaker 2>percent chance that floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just boxes the shit out of conor </v>

2329
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:14.834
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a four percent chance that </v>

2330
01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:17.834
<v Speaker 2>connor catches him with like an apricot </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it did in the first round and </v>

2331
01:44:19.851 --> 01:44:23.030
<v Speaker 2>actually stuns them and hurts them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then swarms on him and takes him out.</v>

2332
01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:23.933
<v Speaker 2>Connor has got ferocious power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's whether or not he executed that </v>

2333
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:28.790
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he has an mma,</v>

2334
01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:30.980
<v Speaker 2>whether he felt he could drain his gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>tank like that,</v>

2335
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:32.840
<v Speaker 2>especially with two months worth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

2336
01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:33.853
<v Speaker 2>not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough to get in shape for a 12 </v>

2337
01:44:35.211 --> 01:44:37.250
<v Speaker 2>round boxing match against the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all time,</v>

2338
01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:42.700
<v Speaker 2>but there was a 100 percent chance that </v>
<v Speaker 2>connor nukes him in a fucking mma fight.</v>

2339
01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:44.793
<v Speaker 2>Nukes him like I would be willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally 100 [inaudible] Floyd's not </v>

2340
01:44:48.201 --> 01:44:49.034
<v Speaker 2>going to knock them out with one punch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Conecuh kick his fucking legs out </v>

2341
01:44:51.741 --> 01:44:53.660
<v Speaker 2>from under him before we got even close </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to punch them.</v>

2342
01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:56.270
<v Speaker 2>And if they did get to a clinch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they absolutely would,</v>

2343
01:44:56.271 --> 01:45:00.260
<v Speaker 2>connor would ragdoll him to the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>and beat his fucking brains in before he</v>

2344
01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:01.490
<v Speaker 2>strangled him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent,</v>

2345
01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.380
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you just look,</v>

2346
01:45:03.381 --> 01:45:04.214
<v Speaker 2>if you just take out even grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you that I just thought as </v>

2347
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:10.370
<v Speaker 2>a master of range and he's got excellent</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks and if he can kick the shit out of</v>

2348
01:45:10.371 --> 01:45:11.204
<v Speaker 2>him and stay out of the area where he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just stay out of his punching range and </v>

2349
01:45:13.731 --> 01:45:16.250
<v Speaker 2>kick him in the legs and the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed if he can clench,</v>

2350
01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:17.690
<v Speaker 2>if you don't break them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he coaches,</v>

2351
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:19.910
<v Speaker 2>he show nice the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're done fucked.</v>

2352
01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.073
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked in elbows to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to tie you up in the back of </v>

2353
01:45:23.091 --> 01:45:25.340
<v Speaker 2>the head and smash you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has that ever happened?</v>

2354
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:26.030
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never.</v>

2355
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:27.920
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the fuck to do when </v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy's doing that.</v>

2356
01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:29.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to deal with those </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>

2357
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:30.343
<v Speaker 2>The face like when Anderson Silva fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up rich Franklin to win the title when </v>

2358
01:45:33.101 --> 01:45:33.934
<v Speaker 2>you just plumb the back of his head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just start smashing these in his face </v>

2359
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:38.150
<v Speaker 2>and he was clear that rich really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

2360
01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:39.043
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have an answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an amazing thing because that </v>

2361
01:45:41.061 --> 01:45:41.894
<v Speaker 2>was one of those moments like everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mma world thought rich was the </v>

2362
01:45:44.211 --> 01:45:45.044
<v Speaker 2>best or not mma world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in the UFC world kind of like </v>

2363
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:49.570
<v Speaker 2>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're.</v>

2364
01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:52.400
<v Speaker 2>That's why I correct myself because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who knew the MMA scene better and</v>

2365
01:45:52.401 --> 01:45:54.440
<v Speaker 2>pride and that stuff knew what Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 2>Silva was,</v>

2366
01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:58.070
<v Speaker 2>but like the average fan of the UFC had </v>
<v Speaker 2>just been.</v>

2367
01:45:58.190 --> 01:45:59.023
<v Speaker 2>We hadn't really seen Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't seen one or two tapes of pride </v>

2368
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:03.760
<v Speaker 2>and I would say I saw him like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2369
01:46:03.850 --> 01:46:07.010
<v Speaker 2>It's on the one where you got ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ankle locked real quick because I didn't</v>

2370
01:46:07.011 --> 01:46:07.844
<v Speaker 2>really know how good Anderson Silva was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw I'd seen him beat Carlos Newton </v>

2371
01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:12.170
<v Speaker 2>and that was like all I had on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

2372
01:46:12.171 --> 01:46:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I have rich Franklin will probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the third type is the pride fights.</v>

2373
01:46:16.281 --> 01:46:20.570
<v Speaker 2>The thing was when he got out of pride </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then fighting in a cage wars or cage</v>

2374
01:46:20.571 --> 01:46:21.860
<v Speaker 2>warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck was that?</v>

2375
01:46:21.861 --> 01:46:23.990
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the one you're talking to the</v>

2376
01:46:23.991 --> 01:46:24.824
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that it's an English </v>

2377
01:46:26.211 --> 01:46:28.250
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

2378
01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:29.593
<v Speaker 2>I want to say cage wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that cage warrior the fuck </v>

2379
01:46:32.631 --> 01:46:33.464
<v Speaker 2>do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2380
01:46:33.650 --> 01:46:36.590
<v Speaker 2>he went over there and just started </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people you can people.</v>

2381
01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:38.800
<v Speaker 2>So like I hadn't seen any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of that,</v>

2382
01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:39.643
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess most of UFC fans hadn't seen </v>

2383
01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:43.310
<v Speaker 2>that either and they thought rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>Franklin is the champ.</v>

2384
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:44.623
<v Speaker 2>Beat up a bunch of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The odds were actually I'm in innocence </v>

2385
01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:47.931
<v Speaker 2>favor though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2386
01:46:47.931 --> 01:46:48.764
<v Speaker 2>what are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the weird ones where the odds </v>

2387
01:46:50.641 --> 01:46:52.380
<v Speaker 2>makers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he fought Chris Leben,</v>

2388
01:46:52.381 --> 01:46:55.590
<v Speaker 2>he was a slight favorite looney his </v>
<v Speaker 2>first UFC fight and I was like,</v>

2389
01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:57.023
<v Speaker 2>get ready for some crazy shit because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker's on a totally </v>

2390
01:46:59.791 --> 01:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>different level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2391
01:47:00.721 --> 01:47:01.554
<v Speaker 2>I knew him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen him fight Jorge Rivera and Lee </v>

2392
01:47:04.230 --> 01:47:05.063
<v Speaker 2>Marie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him hit Tony Ferguson with a step </v>

2393
01:47:06.511 --> 01:47:10.350
<v Speaker 2>in upper cut elbow that he had practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a pillow at home.</v>

2394
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.333
<v Speaker 2>He made his wife hold a pillow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice this technique because he </v>

2395
01:47:14.051 --> 01:47:14.884
<v Speaker 2>wanted to use it in his fights in as </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaches wouldn't hold the pads for them </v>

2396
01:47:16.681 --> 01:47:18.000
<v Speaker 2>because they thought it was ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>

2397
01:47:18.001 --> 01:47:18.570
<v Speaker 2>is this true?</v>

2398
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:19.403
<v Speaker 2>I think I remember hearing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was like in between </v>

2399
01:47:20.881 --> 01:47:22.190
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to one of his coaches,</v>

2400
01:47:22.191 --> 01:47:23.160
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's open.</v>

2401
01:47:23.161 --> 01:47:23.881
<v Speaker 2>I think it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

2402
01:47:23.881 --> 01:47:25.580
<v Speaker 2>forget about this stupid technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dammit.</v>

2403
01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be there.</v>

2404
01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the case.</v>

2405
01:47:28.190 --> 01:47:30.810
<v Speaker 2>You were worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucked up Tony Ferguson before that.</v>

2406
01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.250
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I was able to get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

2407
01:47:32.251 --> 01:47:34.320
<v Speaker 2>it's because he wasn't turning 21st.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

2408
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:37.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm 20 Franklin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony fryklund sorry,</v>

2409
01:47:37.690 --> 01:47:38.970
<v Speaker 2>my apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty percent.</v>

2410
01:47:39.130 --> 01:47:39.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fought Tony Franklin and he hit him </v>

2411
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:45.570
<v Speaker 2>with the standing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stepping in upper cut with the elbow and</v>

2412
01:47:45.571 --> 01:47:48.690
<v Speaker 2>he was just like another level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe three,</v>

2413
01:47:48.691 --> 01:47:51.480
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five levels above Franklin at the time.</v>

2414
01:47:51.650 --> 01:47:53.520
<v Speaker 2>It was just so infrequent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a real veteran.</v>

2415
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Franklin was in one of the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have c's that I ever worked in.</v>

2416
01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 97.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was there.</v>

2417
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:03.300
<v Speaker 2>And so that was like his debut in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

2418
01:48:03.301 --> 01:48:04.134
<v Speaker 2>I was there when he had his debut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Anderson was just lightened him on </v>

2419
01:48:06.781 --> 01:48:09.330
<v Speaker 2>fire before he decided to step in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>upper cut them.</v>

2420
01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:12.000
<v Speaker 2>But I just knew he was on it just such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different level.</v>

2421
01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:16.830
<v Speaker 2>But that was a really important learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment for mma because people knew like,</v>

2422
01:48:16.831 --> 01:48:17.664
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get in a fight and a guy is a </v>

2423
01:48:19.681 --> 01:48:22.320
<v Speaker 2>more Thai practitioner on the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva,</v>

2424
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.650
<v Speaker 2>you better learn how to deal with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn clinch.</v>

2425
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:30.860
<v Speaker 2>So here's Anderson versus a Tony </v>
<v Speaker 2>Franklin and this is Anderson in,</v>

2426
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:31.703
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe his prime ever because he hadn't </v>

2427
01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:38.190
<v Speaker 2>taken on all the damage and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy fights that he had in the UFC.</v>

2428
01:48:38.191 --> 01:48:42.600
<v Speaker 2>And by the time he got to Chris Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was in his thirties.</v>

2429
01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:43.443
<v Speaker 2>He's getting older or his body was </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to not perform the way it used </v>

2430
01:48:46.891 --> 01:48:51.020
<v Speaker 2>to and then obviously he fucked up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stood in front of Weidmann,</v>

2431
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:53.070
<v Speaker 2>got left hooked in the head while I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>clowning them.</v>

2432
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:54.143
<v Speaker 2>Then it's a lot tougher to come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're 40 now they've taken these </v>

2433
01:48:56.521 --> 01:48:57.354
<v Speaker 2>losses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's time back then was so fucking </v>

2434
01:48:59.491 --> 01:49:02.370
<v Speaker 2>tight and it was just so levels above </v>
<v Speaker 2>what everyone else was doing.</v>

2435
01:49:02.371 --> 01:49:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just did.</v>

2436
01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Didn't belong in there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look how he's moving around.</v>

2437
01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:07.434
<v Speaker 2>Just sort of like feeling out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony trying to find out what Tony's </v>

2438
01:49:10.141 --> 01:49:12.720
<v Speaker 2>capable of trying to decide when to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

2439
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean he really is like a spider </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's setting up the web and he's</v>

2440
01:49:17.641 --> 01:49:18.474
<v Speaker 2>moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually it's going to sting you and </v>

2441
01:49:19.651 --> 01:49:23.520
<v Speaker 2>you know it's come in and you know by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time you're moving at him,</v>

2442
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:24.451
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2443
01:49:24.451 --> 01:49:25.284
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two starts kicking you and now he's </v>

2444
01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:27.720
<v Speaker 2>coming after you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit Bitch.</v>

2445
01:49:27.930 --> 01:49:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Now you know there's a big difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two of you and it just feels</v>

2446
01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:32.790
<v Speaker 2>like even if you don't know anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>about fighting,</v>

2447
01:49:32.791 --> 01:49:35.460
<v Speaker 2>you just know there's levels here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can just see it.</v>

2448
01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Everything he does in this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like fucking picture perfect.</v>

2449
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:43.560
<v Speaker 2>He steps in and look at this beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thai clinch clenched his,</v>

2450
01:49:43.570 --> 01:49:46.650
<v Speaker 2>his control of the neck and head was </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular.</v>

2451
01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

2452
01:49:47.581 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>and it's bigger</v>

2453
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:49.023
<v Speaker 1>than all these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stronger than them like knees to the </v>

2454
01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:51.610
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2455
01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:54.250
<v Speaker 1>And Franklin is fucking throwing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2456
01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:55.180
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing his best.</v>

2457
01:49:55.181 --> 01:49:57.070
<v Speaker 1>He was a warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd see it when he would be.</v>

2458
01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:58.780
<v Speaker 1>When he went up and fought at two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>

2459
01:49:58.781 --> 01:50:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And he'd be in the clench with honor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forrest griffin,</v>

2460
01:50:01.291 --> 01:50:02.980
<v Speaker 1>like these guys couldn't do anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2461
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:04.220
<v Speaker 1>So these guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2462
01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:05.883
<v Speaker 1>he's already fucked here because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating a bunch of really hard shots to </v>

2463
01:50:08.161 --> 01:50:11.380
<v Speaker 1>the body and even though he's moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay and he's like really compromised.</v>

2464
01:50:11.381 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 1>He'll look at that beautiful right hook </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then left kick,</v>

2465
01:50:14.290 --> 01:50:15.123
<v Speaker 1>left low kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Anderson fought a lot from the </v>

2466
01:50:17.291 --> 01:50:18.124
<v Speaker 1>southpaw stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could fight from any position he </v>

2467
01:50:19.361 --> 01:50:20.194
<v Speaker 1>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he fought a lot from the southpaw </v>

2468
01:50:21.041 --> 01:50:21.874
<v Speaker 1>stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also an advantage to a lot of </v>

2469
01:50:23.021 --> 01:50:23.854
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much mma guys make it </v>

2470
01:50:25.301 --> 01:50:30.301
<v Speaker 1>look like me and Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His arm's gone limp.</v>

2471
01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's this boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

2472
01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is nuts.</v>

2473
01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.540
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the way he moves.</v>

2474
01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Watch them step in here though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2475
01:50:43.011 --> 01:50:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this</v>

2476
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:51.770
<v Speaker 1>step in elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First time ever in MMA.</v>

2477
01:50:53.190 --> 01:50:55.130
<v Speaker 1>That was Anderson in his prime and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

2478
01:50:55.131 --> 01:50:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And it was one of those moments where a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly you have like,</v>

2479
01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.353
<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot in watching mma where </v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone comes in and beat someone </v>

2480
01:51:01.911 --> 01:51:02.744
<v Speaker 1>else at their strength and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reorganize your mind where you're </v>

2481
01:51:05.841 --> 01:51:06.201
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2482
01:51:06.201 --> 01:51:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I thought that guy was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Franco was like,</v>

2483
01:51:09.210 --> 01:51:12.470
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got really great hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a really good striker.</v>

2484
01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And then a guy like that lets you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2485
01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:16.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like another world when,</v>

2486
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like levels.</v>

2487
01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:18.313
<v Speaker 1>You got these guys like the Chinese Kung</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fu guy and then you have all these </v>

2488
01:51:21.861 --> 01:51:22.694
<v Speaker 1>different levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these steps along the way in the </v>

2489
01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:26.144
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got like Moitai of </v>

2490
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:29.203
<v Speaker 1>Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you got like Moitai of Sand </v>

2491
01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Chai in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like several levels,</v>

2492
01:51:32.511 --> 01:51:36.890
<v Speaker 1>past Anderson Pool cow and rob deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramon Ramon dekkers.</v>

2493
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And Rob came in and all the greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2494
01:51:39.801 --> 01:51:40.371
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ernesto,</v>

2495
01:51:40.371 --> 01:51:42.320
<v Speaker 1>who's these guys are like even further </v>
<v Speaker 1>past that,</v>

2496
01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these crazy,</v>

2497
01:51:43.791 --> 01:51:45.290
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy levels to this thing.</v>

2498
01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see a guy like Anderson you see</v>

2499
01:51:49.250 --> 01:51:53.370
<v Speaker 1>just for the first time it was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC where you have like legitimate world</v>

2500
01:51:53.371 --> 01:51:55.560
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not the best ever and more Thai,</v>

2501
01:51:55.561 --> 01:51:58.970
<v Speaker 1>but legitimate worldclass Moitai skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching them fight.</v>

2502
01:51:58.971 --> 01:52:00.710
<v Speaker 1>That's like a professional Moy Thai </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

2503
01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2504
01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:06.350
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason I think because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on its own,</v>

2505
01:52:06.351 --> 01:52:07.184
<v Speaker 1>it works better in a real fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the grappling stuff in mma like </v>

2506
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:11.623
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got very high level grapplers pretty </v>

2507
01:52:13.881 --> 01:52:14.381
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2508
01:52:14.381 --> 01:52:15.214
<v Speaker 1>I mean from the first UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the best Jujitsu guys at the </v>

2509
01:52:17.121 --> 01:52:20.510
<v Speaker 1>time or were at least one of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the gracies.</v>

2510
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:22.610
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2511
01:52:22.611 --> 01:52:25.400
<v Speaker 1>you got Olympic level wrestlers in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly.</v>

2512
01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:26.271
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

2513
01:52:26.271 --> 01:52:27.104
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't too long before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dan Severn and Mark Coleman and </v>

2514
01:52:29.031 --> 01:52:32.090
<v Speaker 1>guys like that who had like legit </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling credits came in.</v>

2515
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:36.200
<v Speaker 1>But it took a long time before you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really,</v>

2516
01:52:36.201 --> 01:52:40.940
<v Speaker 1>really high level striker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he got Maury Smith was the guy,</v>

2517
01:52:40.970 --> 01:52:42.650
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was really the first was the first.</v>

2518
01:52:42.651 --> 01:52:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to that,</v>

2519
01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 1>go back to that fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that's</v>

2520
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:46.993
<v Speaker 2>interesting to point out as Bas rutten </v>
<v Speaker 2>was one of the early guys to strewn was </v>

2521
01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 2>after Maurice where there weren't too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many besides that,</v>

2522
01:52:51.861 --> 01:52:52.694
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys were like a few who actually </v>

2523
01:52:54.591 --> 01:52:56.840
<v Speaker 2>because it took so much to learn all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other shit.</v>

2524
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.823
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the difference between boss and </v>

2525
01:52:58.551 --> 01:52:59.384
<v Speaker 2>Maurice was that Maurice was more of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactician and boss was a destroyer and </v>

2526
01:53:02.850 --> 01:53:06.740
<v Speaker 2>he's like an intelligent animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would just like attack like vicious,</v>

2527
01:53:07.150 --> 01:53:09.290
<v Speaker 2>ferocious striking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2528
01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:11.930
<v Speaker 2>but real aggressive but also very </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical as well.</v>

2529
01:53:11.931 --> 01:53:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Maurice is much more clever like</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg kick dependent,</v>

2530
01:53:16.011 --> 01:53:16.844
<v Speaker 2>like Maurice is actually on a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>level in terms of like professional </v>

2531
01:53:18.981 --> 01:53:21.470
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then boss boss didn't have like a lot of</v>

2532
01:53:21.471 --> 01:53:23.900
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maurice was a world champion,</v>

2533
01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:24.973
<v Speaker 2>but boss had that Holland style and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an MMA fighter he was one of the first </v>

2534
01:53:28.581 --> 01:53:30.950
<v Speaker 2>guys that we ever saw that kick so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hard.</v>

2535
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:32.083
<v Speaker 2>But if you watch this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you learn is like what conor </v>

2536
01:53:34.911 --> 01:53:35.744
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What conor mcgregor figured out is that </v>

2537
01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.593
<v Speaker 2>what holds a lot of these guys back his </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and see if you look at Tony </v>

2538
01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Franklin as he's moving towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson,</v>

2539
01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:46.040
<v Speaker 2>his movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very limited like he can't.</v>

2540
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:48.830
<v Speaker 2>He can't cover distance quick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to make these little hop steps,</v>

2541
01:53:48.831 --> 01:53:52.310
<v Speaker 2>hop steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just slide in and blast things.</v>

2542
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:53.263
<v Speaker 2>Connor is fluid with his movement in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to the point where he can step </v>

2543
01:53:57.411 --> 01:54:00.710
<v Speaker 2>forward and obviously wouldn't be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that with Anderson Silva,</v>

2544
01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:05.500
<v Speaker 2>but he can step forward and step in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>step out like when he fought a Joseph,</v>

2545
01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.353
<v Speaker 2>although one of the most important parts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that fight was that Aldo was trying </v>

2546
01:54:10.161 --> 01:54:12.830
<v Speaker 2>to figure out the movement of Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like go to go to that fight.</v>

2547
01:54:12.831 --> 01:54:13.664
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Aldo versus conor mcgregor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what connor was doing so good was </v>

2548
01:54:17.571 --> 01:54:20.030
<v Speaker 2>sliding forward and sliding back.</v>

2549
01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:22.070
<v Speaker 2>There's like that one moment because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very short fight,</v>

2550
01:54:22.071 --> 01:54:22.904
<v Speaker 2>but there's the one moment where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>faints a thing and jumps back right </v>

2551
01:54:24.951 --> 01:54:25.784
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>

2552
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:29.460
<v Speaker 2>See how sleep pod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look how like he.</v>

2553
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:32.860
<v Speaker 2>He's in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's moving a lot and it's.</v>

2554
01:54:32.970 --> 01:54:34.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

2555
01:54:34.431 --> 01:54:35.264
<v Speaker 2>slides back and drops the fucking left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammer on his chin and it's that </v>

2556
01:54:38.631 --> 01:54:41.690
<v Speaker 2>movement that's so critical in a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>high level.</v>

2557
01:54:41.691 --> 01:54:42.524
<v Speaker 2>If I look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how fluid he slides back and </v>

2558
01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:44.923
<v Speaker 2>launches that punch at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting to me too because </v>

2559
01:54:47.211 --> 01:54:50.000
<v Speaker 2>it was a different intensity in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement than like when he fought.</v>

2560
01:54:50.001 --> 01:54:50.834
<v Speaker 2>Other guys like Chad Mendez matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he respected what Al Alto </v>

2561
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.923
<v Speaker 2>throws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alto throws heat and especially in that </v>

2562
01:54:55.901 --> 01:54:59.230
<v Speaker 2>first round when Aldo is furious at you </v>
<v Speaker 2>for disrespecting them.</v>

2563
01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Like he knows he's coming with like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb,</v>

2564
01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.280
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just but superior movement.</v>

2565
01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:08.450
<v Speaker 2>It's also new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unorthodox movement bloom.</v>

2566
01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:09.793
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing that shit and karate </v>

2567
01:55:11.541 --> 01:55:13.000
<v Speaker 2>tournaments forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2568
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:15.740
<v Speaker 2>But people hadn't figured it out in MMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

2569
01:55:15.741 --> 01:55:16.574
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>connor had done with his stance and his </v>

2570
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:20.233
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it resembles what you see in </v>

2571
01:55:21.771 --> 01:55:25.190
<v Speaker 2>the karate point tournaments where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would leap in and drop a shot on you and</v>

2572
01:55:25.191 --> 01:55:27.710
<v Speaker 2>leap out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't fighting stationary.</v>

2573
01:55:27.711 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 2>People like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although that just charged forward,</v>

2574
01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:33.890
<v Speaker 2>but although got used to fighting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that man fitting more Thai guys and that</v>

2575
01:55:33.891 --> 01:55:36.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of mma look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the wrestling look.</v>

2576
01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:37.481
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2577
01:55:37.481 --> 01:55:40.720
<v Speaker 2>it's really fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just on this kind of evolution was a um.</v>

2578
01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

2579
01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>A hutto the</v>

2580
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.990
<v Speaker 1>guy who fought Demetrius Johnson who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2581
01:55:45.991 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 1>who just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who fights like him now.</v>

2582
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.160
<v Speaker 1>He all the sudden he adopted this style </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

2583
01:55:50.161 --> 01:55:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this style gives people real problems.</v>

2584
01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's like I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe I'm wrong about this,</v>

2585
01:55:57.061 --> 01:55:59.700
<v Speaker 1>but it reminds me a little bit of almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mochida type thing,</v>

2586
01:56:00.050 --> 01:56:00.883
<v Speaker 1>but it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this weird karate kind of thing </v>

2587
01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:07.740
<v Speaker 1>that it's like this weird evolution wake</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have all the other shit.</v>

2588
01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:08.753
<v Speaker 1>And what connor does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also got really good traditional </v>

2589
01:56:10.231 --> 01:56:11.320
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2590
01:56:11.321 --> 01:56:14.740
<v Speaker 1>like not a lot of MMA guys couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 rounds with me whether they,</v>

2591
01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:16.133
<v Speaker 1>he's also got boxing so he can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mix it up with like traditional boxing </v>

2592
01:56:19.891 --> 01:56:20.724
<v Speaker 1>attacks and this crazy other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's crazy about him is he'll be </v>

2593
01:56:23.251 --> 01:56:27.090
<v Speaker 1>like throwing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these crazy spinning like cartwheel</v>

2594
01:56:27.091 --> 01:56:28.940
<v Speaker 1>kicks and then he'll just have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2595
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:29.783
<v Speaker 1>two that was like perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which that's new to mma or we haven't </v>

2596
01:56:32.461 --> 01:56:33.630
<v Speaker 1>seen a lot of that in the past.</v>

2597
01:56:33.630 --> 01:56:35.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's titles,</v>

2598
01:56:35.610 --> 01:56:36.443
<v Speaker 1>those kicks are longer too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with something that </v>

2599
01:56:38.461 --> 01:56:41.760
<v Speaker 1>reaches much further than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional Moitai techniques or,</v>

2600
01:56:41.761 --> 01:56:44.570
<v Speaker 1>or straight boxing techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing sidekicks.</v>

2601
01:56:44.610 --> 01:56:45.443
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His head is so far away from you when </v>

2602
01:56:46.891 --> 01:56:48.360
<v Speaker 1>he's throwing a side kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he lands,</v>

2603
01:56:48.361 --> 01:56:50.670
<v Speaker 1>if he's touching you in the chest or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sidekick,</v>

2604
01:56:50.890 --> 01:56:53.430
<v Speaker 1>there's no opportunity for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterpunch he's way over there.</v>

2605
01:56:53.431 --> 01:56:55.680
<v Speaker 1>He's bent sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His head is way out of reach.</v>

2606
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:56.783
<v Speaker 1>He might be able to catch them with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick if he comes forward after he drops </v>

2607
01:56:59.251 --> 01:57:01.320
<v Speaker 1>the sidekick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in range,</v>

2608
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but you might get pushed back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of factors involved.</v>

2609
01:57:04.051 --> 01:57:05.400
<v Speaker 1>The fight and the guy who fights like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2610
01:57:05.610 --> 01:57:06.443
<v Speaker 1>And so who does figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he just dropped some bombs on </v>

2611
01:57:09.241 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Wilson has that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2612
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:11.581
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2613
01:57:11.581 --> 01:57:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2614
01:57:13.190 --> 01:57:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Demetrius Johnson is like head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders above,</v>

2615
01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:16.350
<v Speaker 1>above everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

2616
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And he made quick work of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was like,</v>

2617
01:57:19.021 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 1>at least to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little like glimpse of like,</v>

2618
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:22.343
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe if this guy is this good a </v>

2619
01:57:23.241 --> 01:57:24.150
<v Speaker 1>grappler in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is figuring,</v>

2620
01:57:24.151 --> 01:57:26.520
<v Speaker 1>striking out like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's the guy who could,</v>

2621
01:57:26.521 --> 01:57:27.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like be a good,</v>

2622
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:30.060
<v Speaker 1>a good contender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may may happen very well.</v>

2623
01:57:30.061 --> 01:57:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might challenge them one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what Henry Cejudo represents is like</v>

2624
01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:35.423
<v Speaker 1>extreme talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real sponge for knowledge and </v>

2625
01:57:37.531 --> 01:57:38.364
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's got a guy that's in his </v>

2626
01:57:40.111 --> 01:57:41.040
<v Speaker 1>division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the king.</v>

2627
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:42.120
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

2628
01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:42.954
<v Speaker 1>the greatest martial arts of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anybody that's </v>

2629
01:57:45.001 --> 01:57:45.834
<v Speaker 1>been a better representation of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible in modern martial arts better </v>

2630
01:57:49.411 --> 01:57:51.240
<v Speaker 1>than mighty mouse because he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get hit.</v>

2631
01:57:51.241 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 1>And He fucks everybody up and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit him,</v>

2632
01:57:53.281 --> 01:57:54.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's coming at you.</v>

2633
01:57:54.151 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And then all of sudden he's over here.</v>

2634
01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got a knee in your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you got punched in the face and</v>

2635
01:57:58.141 --> 01:57:59.580
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck's happening.</v>

2636
01:57:59.581 --> 01:58:00.414
<v Speaker 1>All the sudden you're on your back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dropping hammer fists on you and </v>

2637
01:58:02.461 --> 01:58:04.080
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you're reacting to that,</v>

2638
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:05.310
<v Speaker 1>he's gotten in an arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2639
01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:07.020
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck just happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2640
01:58:07.021 --> 01:58:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to argue with the emerald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2641
01:58:08.850 --> 01:58:11.280
<v Speaker 1>he fights like he's a specialist at </v>
<v Speaker 1>every discipline.</v>

2642
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like,</v>

2643
01:58:12.571 --> 01:58:15.690
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you feel like he could beat all the</v>

2644
01:58:15.691 --> 01:58:19.110
<v Speaker 1>specialists at their discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like what George St Pierre used</v>

2645
01:58:19.111 --> 01:58:20.090
<v Speaker 1>to kind of do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2646
01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do modern,</v>

2647
01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:22.693
<v Speaker 1>modern MMA and more dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not going to decisions destroying </v>

2648
01:58:25.381 --> 01:58:26.214
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's about to break the record if you </v>

2649
01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:29.660
<v Speaker 1>already have about to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2650
01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:30.503
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2651
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:31.680
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2652
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't grant him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman knocked out Anderson Silva.</v>

2653
01:58:34.501 --> 01:58:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Nobody saw that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy sport.</v>

2654
01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:37.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2655
01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:38.550
<v Speaker 1>it is a crazy sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2656
01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:41.820
<v Speaker 1>it seems like nobody can escape it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2657
01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:42.883
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like it takes the toughest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most invincible person you can think of </v>

2658
01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:46.983
<v Speaker 1>as like Anderson Silva was a Ninja in </v>
<v Speaker 1>untouchable Ninja and then you see him </v>

2659
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:52.540
<v Speaker 1>crying in the center of the ring with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shattered,</v>

2660
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:53.621
<v Speaker 1>shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>

2661
01:58:53.621 --> 01:58:54.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>split up Shinbo.</v>

2662
01:58:54.850 --> 01:58:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like it's chocolate dal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all these landscapes.</v>

2663
01:58:58.180 --> 01:58:59.920
<v Speaker 1>They came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw junior dos Santos,</v>

2664
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 1>drop a bomb on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came the Alaska isn't came collapsed.</v>

2665
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:03.244
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2666
01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And then Kane can get Kale and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>junior dos Santos at that point.</v>

2667
01:59:06.761 --> 01:59:07.541
<v Speaker 1>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2668
01:59:07.541 --> 01:59:08.374
<v Speaker 1>after that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're living in junior dos </v>

2669
01:59:09.431 --> 01:59:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Santos has world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those guys destroyed everyone.</v>

2670
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.273
<v Speaker 1>And then to watch him get nuked by Cain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rematch can you just came back </v>

2671
01:59:16.031 --> 01:59:16.864
<v Speaker 1>and beat the fuck out of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can the first fight really probably </v>

2672
01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:19.984
<v Speaker 1>should have been fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was the first big fight on Fox </v>

2673
01:59:22.210 --> 01:59:24.370
<v Speaker 1>and he had a fucked up Neiman and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't move.</v>

2674
01:59:24.371 --> 01:59:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only one out of the way,</v>

2675
01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:28.810
<v Speaker 1>his only two losses were when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming off an injury.</v>

2676
01:59:28.811 --> 01:59:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was coming off an injury </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Fabrizio overdo as well.</v>

2677
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:32.803
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he was always coming off injuries </v>

2678
01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:35.230
<v Speaker 1>by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that as a problem?</v>

2679
01:59:35.231 --> 01:59:36.450
<v Speaker 1>But the real problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Breo,</v>

2680
01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:38.800
<v Speaker 1>for doing fight was that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare in Mexico City.</v>

2681
01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Mexico City is at 7,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 feet above sea level,</v>

2682
01:59:42.850 --> 01:59:43.683
<v Speaker 1>which is where I was in Utah last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine if you didn't train </v>

2683
01:59:47.111 --> 01:59:49.210
<v Speaker 1>there that you could be adapted to it.</v>

2684
01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:51.370
<v Speaker 1>The way for Breesa was because for he </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>

2685
01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.353
<v Speaker 1>he was there for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a couple months at sea level </v>

2686
01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:59.410
<v Speaker 1>training doing his entire camp in Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way,</v>

2687
01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:00.453
<v Speaker 1>even above 7,500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got up to the eight </v>

2688
02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:03.760
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2689
02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:07.450
<v Speaker 1>that's the house seemed in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that made a big difference.</v>

2690
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Pretty hard to argue because cane is </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as being the cardio care.</v>

2691
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Fabrizio knock on his cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what he's known for.</v>

2692
02:00:14.261 --> 02:00:15.860
<v Speaker 1>He's not known for being like the Cardio</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2693
02:00:15.861 --> 02:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>and to see him at last time it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2694
02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:19.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's almost.</v>

2695
02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like cain had so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence in his cardio because this is</v>

2696
02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>what he's been known for since like </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he got into the UFC,</v>

2697
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:25.723
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got this unbelievable tank that he </v>

2698
02:00:27.041 --> 02:00:27.471
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2699
02:00:27.471 --> 02:00:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll be fine with that and it.</v>

2700
02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2701
02:00:30.250 --> 02:00:32.440
<v Speaker 1>But I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know he's an injury case,</v>

2702
02:00:32.441 --> 02:00:33.274
<v Speaker 1>but like the Cain Velasquez that showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to ufc 200 that fought a travis </v>

2703
02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any heavyweight beating that</v>

2704
02:00:40.271 --> 02:00:40.781
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2705
02:00:40.781 --> 02:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I dunno for breach shall beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2706
02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he would be able to beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>them again.</v>

2707
02:00:44.231 --> 02:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is for eco,</v>

2708
02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.060
<v Speaker 1>his striking improved radically hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got long reach.</v>

2709
02:00:49.061 --> 02:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>He's a big tall guy and he's strong as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

2710
02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>And if you could take him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good God damn luck.</v>

2711
02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:55.593
<v Speaker 1>Everybody found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's another argument for anybody </v>

2712
02:00:57.371 --> 02:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>being the greatest heavyweight of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time besides cane,</v>

2713
02:00:59.921 --> 02:01:00.754
<v Speaker 1>it's fabrizio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabrizio might have a better argument </v>

2714
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>because fabricio submitted all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greats.</v>

2715
02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:08.530
<v Speaker 1>He submitted fate or million inco </v>
<v Speaker 1>submitted minotauro.</v>

2716
02:01:08.531 --> 02:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Nogueira submitted Cain Velasquez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2717
02:01:11.010 --> 02:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>fabrizio submitted fucking everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some amazing ones.</v>

2718
02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Amazing runs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2719
02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:18.880
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't get killed by Steve Bay and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting out of composure,</v>

2720
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>he was fighting very emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's chasing steep a.</v>

2721
02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got wild.</v>

2722
02:01:23.261 --> 02:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>He was in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to fucking get after it,</v>

2723
02:01:25.421 --> 02:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pumped up there in Brazil.</v>

2724
02:01:27.370 --> 02:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>He's the heavyweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fired up,</v>

2725
02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:30.693
<v Speaker 1>but I think he might've underestimated </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a bad motherfucker steep meo trick </v>

2726
02:01:33.581 --> 02:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>is and how the steep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could do the same thing.</v>

2727
02:01:35.531 --> 02:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Connor did slide away and drop that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hand,</v>

2728
02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>like pays a fucking elite</v>

2729
02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a monster.</v>

2730
02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:42.613
<v Speaker 2>He's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I slept on him a little bit too </v>

2731
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:46.250
<v Speaker 2>much for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

2732
02:01:46.251 --> 02:01:47.140
<v Speaker 2>you see it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2733
02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.350
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's proved it like it was last minute,</v>

2734
02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.040
<v Speaker 2>but I was blown away by how reckless a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot about that.</v>

2735
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just charged them like </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight on.</v>

2736
02:01:56.061 --> 02:01:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Charge them as a dangerous way to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>any MMA fighter.</v>

2737
02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like modern day.</v>

2738
02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:01.513
<v Speaker 2>He made a mistake and I think he made </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mistake because you got caught </v>

2739
02:02:03.381 --> 02:02:04.214
<v Speaker 2>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got clip before that and he </v>

2740
02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:06.644
<v Speaker 2>got emotional because he got clipped and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tried to really ramp it up and </v>

2741
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:10.343
<v Speaker 2>overcompensate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you watch that fight before </v>

2742
02:02:12.111 --> 02:02:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Steve Bay knocks him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He catches him a couple times.</v>

2743
02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pays a sharp boxer.</v>

2744
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:17.833
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very sharp hands and he catches you on </v>

2745
02:02:19.201 --> 02:02:20.310
<v Speaker 2>the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2746
02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:21.153
<v Speaker 2>we could put people away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he's putting everybody away </v>

2747
02:02:22.671 --> 02:02:24.680
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put Away Alistair overeem.</v>

2748
02:02:24.710 --> 02:02:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Arguably the greatest strike or whoever </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought in mma,</v>

2749
02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k one Grand Prix champion.</v>

2750
02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Strikeforce dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped and got right back up.</v>

2751
02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:33.533
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2752
02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:36.230
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking animal.</v>

2753
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:37.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I was talking to him after the </v>

2754
02:02:38.121 --> 02:02:39.200
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought he got kicked.</v>

2755
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't even remember he got punched.</v>

2756
02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.440
<v Speaker 2>It was all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2757
02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:44.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually it wasn't sure if he's like,</v>

2758
02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:45.433
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that one.</v>

2759
02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them felt they want.</v>

2760
02:02:50.001 --> 02:02:52.390
<v Speaker 2>He's the highest level so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2761
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Steve Bay in his athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ability to move,</v>

2762
02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:55.963
<v Speaker 2>his ability to overcome obstacles like </v>
<v Speaker 2>junior had kicked the shit out of his </v>

2763
02:02:58.401 --> 02:02:59.234
<v Speaker 2>leg to the point we had this giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hematoma on his shin and he's still </v>

2764
02:03:01.701 --> 02:03:03.170
<v Speaker 2>knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2765
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:05.210
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a very interesting fight.</v>

2766
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:06.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was super quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like a lot of actions super </v>

2767
02:03:07.791 --> 02:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I do the more.</v>

2768
02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to see a healthy cane come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fight.</v>

2769
02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:13.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the extent of his </v>

2770
02:03:14.271 --> 02:03:15.104
<v Speaker 2>injuries are and why he's been sidelined</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long and you'd have to talk to him </v>

2771
02:03:17.601 --> 02:03:20.180
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm hoping is that I know a lot</v>

2772
02:03:20.181 --> 02:03:22.070
<v Speaker 2>of it was back issues and shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

2773
02:03:22.071 --> 02:03:23.720
<v Speaker 2>He had shoulder surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knee surgery,</v>

2774
02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:26.210
<v Speaker 2>back surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had several surgeries,</v>

2775
02:03:26.211 --> 02:03:30.830
<v Speaker 2>so it's just that style is so aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so physically dependent.</v>

2776
02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just so fucking overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of it is mental toughness,</v>

2777
02:03:35.901 --> 02:03:38.060
<v Speaker 2>the mental toughness to push past </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

2778
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes your body just can't keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2779
02:03:40.641 --> 02:03:42.620
<v Speaker 2>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in general,</v>

2780
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.730
<v Speaker 2>probably every high level MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC fighter at this point.</v>

2781
02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.593
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing to their body when </v>

2782
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:50.480
<v Speaker 2>they're putting their body through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a lot for,</v>

2783
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:51.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

2784
02:03:51.370 --> 02:03:54.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like really pushing yourself to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute limit constantly.</v>

2785
02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Then as you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his style is particularly,</v>

2786
02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:58.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of physical,</v>

2787
02:03:58.221 --> 02:04:02.630
<v Speaker 2>physical and he comes from a chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's notoriously a very,</v>

2788
02:04:02.631 --> 02:04:03.464
<v Speaker 2>very tough case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are like known for like </v>

2789
02:04:05.811 --> 02:04:08.600
<v Speaker 2>getting in wars and like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really training hard.</v>

2790
02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:09.713
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure all of that shit doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad because if Cain cain had such </v>

2791
02:04:13.251 --> 02:04:14.084
<v Speaker 2>amazing cardio and great footwork and </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful striking technique as well as </v>

2792
02:04:17.331 --> 02:04:19.160
<v Speaker 2>like real elite wrestling technique.</v>

2793
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:22.670
<v Speaker 2>If cain fought more in a mighty mouse </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

2794
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:23.743
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of the reasons what made </v>
<v Speaker 2>mighty mouse so good is that like if </v>

2795
02:04:26.181 --> 02:04:29.120
<v Speaker 2>cain used his cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in like a blunt way,</v>

2796
02:04:29.121 --> 02:04:30.680
<v Speaker 2>but more in a surgical way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2797
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:32.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if cane,</v>

2798
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:34.910
<v Speaker 2>like in the junior dos Santos fight in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

2799
02:04:34.911 --> 02:04:35.744
<v Speaker 2>he caught them like real early in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and clipped him with a right hand </v>

2800
02:04:38.851 --> 02:04:41.230
<v Speaker 2>and heard them rock them and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to mall them.</v>

2801
02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:43.040
<v Speaker 2>She has got all over him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amalgam,</v>

2802
02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:44.940
<v Speaker 2>but he took a lot of damage in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

2803
02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:45.983
<v Speaker 2>They both did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both hit each other and he came </v>

2804
02:04:47.310 --> 02:04:50.430
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly dominated the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't.</v>

2805
02:04:50.610 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the way mighty mouse does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mighty mouse doesn't get hit.</v>

2806
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:56.580
<v Speaker 2>He's there and then he's here and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting hit,</v>

2807
02:04:56.850 --> 02:04:57.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he's on your clench and then </v>

2808
02:04:58.681 --> 02:04:59.514
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a need in the chin and then </v>

2809
02:05:00.001 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting elbowed and then boom,</v>

2810
02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:04.930
<v Speaker 2>you're getting tripped and then if he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing things,</v>

2811
02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:09.840
<v Speaker 2>he's got this repertoire of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities that no one else has.</v>

2812
02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Whereas cain just had this ferocious </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude,</v>

2813
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:18.630
<v Speaker 2>powerful striking and ungodly cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is common at your bitch.</v>

2814
02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

2815
02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

2816
02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:22.130
<v Speaker 3>One of the things may whether it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

2817
02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.033
<v Speaker 3>I see him like in a few different </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviews leading up to the conor </v>

2818
02:05:25.011 --> 02:05:26.420
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just talking about the fee,</v>

2819
02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:27.493
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy thing that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost seem like fans like the guy </v>

2820
02:05:30.711 --> 02:05:34.730
<v Speaker 3>who takes a lot of head damage more like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like the guy who avoids those</v>

2821
02:05:34.731 --> 02:05:35.564
<v Speaker 3>wars and avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you sit there and look at </v>

2822
02:05:37.851 --> 02:05:41.300
<v Speaker 3>the way Mohammed Ali left and the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>floyd mayweather's leaving.</v>

2823
02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

2824
02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:43.131
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2825
02:05:43.131 --> 02:05:45.770
<v Speaker 3>The fans love rope a dope more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

2826
02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of hard to argue with that.</v>

2827
02:05:48.590 --> 02:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>floyd going out,</v>

2828
02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:50.293
<v Speaker 2>beating conor is really the perfect way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it too because he really didn't </v>

2829
02:05:53.151 --> 02:05:53.984
<v Speaker 2>take much damage and that fight took one</v>
<v Speaker 2>good solid upper cut in the first round </v>

2830
02:05:56.571 --> 02:05:57.404
<v Speaker 2>and then Kinda like took over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He gets his big 50th win and then </v>

2831
02:06:00.441 --> 02:06:02.810
<v Speaker 2>really gets to show that it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>about boxing.</v>

2832
02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:04.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not about slugging and standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2833
02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:07.400
<v Speaker 2>but when people talk about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't talk about them with the same</v>

2834
02:06:07.401 --> 02:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>reverence that they talk about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arturo Gotti and micky ward made because</v>

2835
02:06:10.941 --> 02:06:11.774
<v Speaker 2>they were more entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the people that get entertained by </v>

2836
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:16.690
<v Speaker 2>the style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fighter,</v>

2837
02:06:16.730 --> 02:06:18.290
<v Speaker 2>the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy slugger.</v>

2838
02:06:18.291 --> 02:06:19.290
<v Speaker 2>They love those guys.</v>

2839
02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:21.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all love those guys.</v>

2840
02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:21.681
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2841
02:06:21.681 --> 02:06:24.800
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't love Travis Browne versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrei Arlovski like a fight like that.</v>

2842
02:06:24.801 --> 02:06:26.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like the grant and to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like,</v>

2843
02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:29.900
<v Speaker 3>to see somebody come back after getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2844
02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:32.120
<v Speaker 3>like there's something incredible about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2845
02:06:32.121 --> 02:06:32.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2846
02:06:32.710 --> 02:06:33.543
<v Speaker 3>it's an amazing thing that mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you were talking about a </v>

2847
02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:36.013
<v Speaker 3>steeping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing whether it was a kick or a </v>

2848
02:06:36.591 --> 02:06:37.424
<v Speaker 3>punch is this amazing thing that mma </v>
<v Speaker 3>does where you find out someone's true </v>

2849
02:06:40.491 --> 02:06:43.550
<v Speaker 3>character when they're in a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2850
02:06:43.551 --> 02:06:45.140
<v Speaker 3>and like how they come and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

2851
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>But if you are that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2852
02:06:48.681 --> 02:06:49.514
<v Speaker 3>it's just a little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's human elements involved </v>

2853
02:06:51.171 --> 02:06:52.550
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like you got a family,</v>

2854
02:06:52.551 --> 02:06:53.384
<v Speaker 3>you've got kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to think for the rest of your </v>

2855
02:06:54.351 --> 02:06:56.810
<v Speaker 3>life you want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how can you argue with floyd?</v>

2856
02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:57.673
<v Speaker 3>I mean the guy made the most money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>took the least damage and as the best </v>

2857
02:07:02.001 --> 02:07:04.370
<v Speaker 3>record on you argue with that</v>

2858
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:05.383
<v Speaker 2>and figured out a way to neutralize </v>
<v Speaker 2>really dangerous people like Canelo </v>

2859
02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Alvarez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2860
02:07:10.341 --> 02:07:12.820
<v Speaker 2>forget about the conor fight who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>congress,</v>

2861
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:13.663
<v Speaker 2>obviously outmatched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at his fights with </v>

2862
02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:19.010
<v Speaker 2>really elite knockout artists like manny</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacquiao neutralized him,</v>

2863
02:07:19.190 --> 02:07:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Canelo Alvarez neutralized him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2864
02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:21.913
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everybody fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought a freestyle that was more </v>

2865
02:07:26.121 --> 02:07:28.810
<v Speaker 2>entertaining because you wanted him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose his,</v>

2866
02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:29.693
<v Speaker 2>like his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brilliance was that he got you to </v>

2867
02:07:31.251 --> 02:07:32.084
<v Speaker 2>hate him so that you would buy a fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping that the guy was going to kick </v>

2868
02:07:34.731 --> 02:07:35.760
<v Speaker 2>his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2869
02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I remember doing this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2870
02:07:38.770 --> 02:07:40.210
<v Speaker 3>I was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on a radio show,</v>

2871
02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:41.131
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2872
02:07:41.131 --> 02:07:41.964
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Stan called into was like MMA </v>

2873
02:07:44.321 --> 02:07:46.690
<v Speaker 3>radio show on Sirius radio that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to use me on sometimes.</v>

2874
02:07:46.691 --> 02:07:49.330
<v Speaker 3>And Brian Stan called and I remember he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just talking about like,</v>

2875
02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:51.093
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the topic was at first it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like Joe Silva had just left and he </v>

2876
02:07:53.081 --> 02:07:55.560
<v Speaker 3>wasn't matchmaking anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he started talking about how like,</v>

2877
02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:57.160
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how tough the job is,</v>

2878
02:07:57.190 --> 02:07:58.023
<v Speaker 3>a matchmaking and how much it fucks with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you when someone gets knocked out real </v>

2879
02:08:00.311 --> 02:08:01.031
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're like,</v>

2880
02:08:01.031 --> 02:08:02.560
<v Speaker 3>and maybe I shouldn't have made that </v>
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>

2881
02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:03.820
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you kind of feel like,</v>

2882
02:08:03.821 --> 02:08:05.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I threw someone in the wrong time.</v>

2883
02:08:05.770 --> 02:08:06.700
<v Speaker 3>And I was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

2884
02:08:06.701 --> 02:08:09.610
<v Speaker 3>that's a human element I really never </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about in that job.</v>

2885
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:11.890
<v Speaker 3>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about GSP coming back.</v>

2886
02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:13.030
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2887
02:08:13.031 --> 02:08:13.864
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think GSP each come back </v>

2888
02:08:14.771 --> 02:08:15.604
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's he got to prove and what's it </v>

2889
02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:17.290
<v Speaker 3>going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2890
02:08:17.291 --> 02:08:19.420
<v Speaker 3>why risk the brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2891
02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:20.643
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like this weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you never think about that as a </v>

2892
02:08:22.001 --> 02:08:22.834
<v Speaker 3>fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you start meeting the guys and </v>

2893
02:08:23.951 --> 02:08:24.784
<v Speaker 3>they actually become people like I met </v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael bisbing and Lewis does it show </v>

2894
02:08:27.551 --> 02:08:28.750

<v Speaker 3>with his live touring.</v>

2938
02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:59.090
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2939
02:09:59.230 --> 02:10:02.690
<v Speaker 3>he did a fucking great job on all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff leading up to conor conference.</v>

2940
02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:03.603
<v Speaker 3>Like he was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like the only mma analysts who </v>

2941
02:10:05.141 --> 02:10:06.590
<v Speaker 3>was in there kind of breaking shit down.</v>

2942
02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:08.920
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like why?</v>

2943
02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:09.843
<v Speaker 3>So all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that to just have one or two more </v>

2944
02:10:11.861 --> 02:10:16.120
<v Speaker 3>fights and maybe take some real band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really see one thing if he really wanted</v>

2945
02:10:16.121 --> 02:10:16.954
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if he was obsessed and that's what </v>

2946
02:10:18.611 --> 02:10:19.444
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to win the heavyweight title </v>

2947
02:10:21.071 --> 02:10:23.140
<v Speaker 3>and that was 100 percent of his focus </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

2948
02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:24.603
<v Speaker 3>But he wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe it was when he first </v>

2949
02:10:27.191 --> 02:10:30.040
<v Speaker 3>started his career and often times your </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation shifts.</v>

2950
02:10:30.070 --> 02:10:33.070
<v Speaker 3>You get knocked out a few times and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had been knocked out several.</v>

2951
02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 3>By then he got knocked</v>

2952
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:37.010
<v Speaker 2>out by Minotauro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got knocked out by big Ben Rothwell.</v>

2953
02:10:37.011 --> 02:10:40.730
<v Speaker 2>He got smashed by Travis Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got knocked out by Roy Nelson.</v>

2954
02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:41.593
<v Speaker 2>And these are out cold knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like there was so many of them and I </v>

2955
02:10:44.871 --> 02:10:45.704
<v Speaker 2>was seeing it so often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then towards the end I was noticing </v>

2956
02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:52.740
<v Speaker 2>just a lack of enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the same as those.</v>

2957
02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:56.210
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the same fire that allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to knock out Mirko Cro,</v>

2958
02:10:56.211 --> 02:10:59.000
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the same sort of intensity.</v>

2959
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.863
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you told me last time I was on the show </v>

2960
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:05.300
<v Speaker 2>that you've experienced that a smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys have a tougher time.</v>

2961
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:06.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coming back from getting knocked out </v>

2962
02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:09.680
<v Speaker 2>because I found that really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's part of the case with him.</v>

2963
02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:10.743
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to avoid knowing the </v>

2964
02:11:11.421 --> 02:11:12.650
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2965
02:11:12.651 --> 02:11:13.484
<v Speaker 2>most certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're a person who being you </v>

2966
02:11:15.951 --> 02:11:16.784
<v Speaker 2>can be a smart person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just compartmentalize things and </v>

2967
02:11:18.441 --> 02:11:19.274
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to control the </v>
<v Speaker 2>variables in your mind and just be </v>

2968
02:11:21.441 --> 02:11:22.610
<v Speaker 2>refocused on what you're doing.</v>

2969
02:11:22.610 --> 02:11:24.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not to say that people come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't smart,</v>

2970
02:11:25.130 --> 02:11:26.050
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2971
02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:27.013
<v Speaker 2>I mean people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not to say also that people who </v>

2972
02:11:28.401 --> 02:11:29.234
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who fight aren't smart because a lot of </v>

2973
02:11:30.681 --> 02:11:32.270
<v Speaker 2>people think of fighters is not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

2974
02:11:32.271 --> 02:11:33.104
<v Speaker 2>I think that's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people who </v>

2975
02:11:35.421 --> 02:11:36.254
<v Speaker 2>fight who aren't smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the people who excel have </v>

2976
02:11:38.961 --> 02:11:43.070
<v Speaker 2>exceptional mind power as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical power.</v>

2977
02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:47.920
<v Speaker 2>I think some of them are like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a guy like a dominant Cruz.</v>

2978
02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:50.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's guys like that,</v>

2979
02:11:50.051 --> 02:11:50.884
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stands by saying I'm very intelligent </v>

2980
02:11:51.921 --> 02:11:52.754
<v Speaker 2>guy and then when you go to champions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mighty mouse is super smart and </v>

2981
02:11:54.641 --> 02:11:55.474
<v Speaker 2>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very articulate guy and it doesn't show </v>

2982
02:11:57.411 --> 02:11:58.990
<v Speaker 2>any damage at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2983
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are some meat heads also </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

2984
02:12:01.190 --> 02:12:01.730
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2985
02:12:01.730 --> 02:12:02.900
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly like a mix.</v>

2986
02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:03.830
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2987
02:12:04.070 --> 02:12:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Carlos condit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's another one.</v>

2988
02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:07.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys who fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2989
02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:10.670
<v Speaker 2>that just aren't like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys who were just like</v>

2990
02:12:10.671 --> 02:12:14.560
<v Speaker 2>super aggressive and they just do well </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they kick ass and you know,</v>

2991
02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:20.170
<v Speaker 2>the guys who know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing traumatic brain injury,</v>

2992
02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:23.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand the consequences are,</v>

2993
02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:25.373
<v Speaker 2>they're unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless there's some new medical </v>

2994
02:12:26.541 --> 02:12:29.210
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough that allows you to heal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cte,</v>

2995
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:31.070
<v Speaker 2>which is super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super possible.</v>

2996
02:12:31.130 --> 02:12:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well absolutely.</v>

2997
02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you described the medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakthroughs we have now 50 years ago,</v>

2998
02:12:36.081 --> 02:12:38.280
<v Speaker 2>you'd be talking about magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2999
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:39.163
<v Speaker 2>my buddy Steve Graham was on the US ski </v>
<v Speaker 2>team like in the 19 eighties and he had </v>

3000
02:12:44.511 --> 02:12:46.890
<v Speaker 2>scars when I first met him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had already had like,</v>

3001
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say he's had more than 20 knee</v>

3002
02:12:50.751 --> 02:12:51.584
<v Speaker 2>surgeries and I think I'm being super </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative because I think it's way </v>

3003
02:12:54.081 --> 02:12:54.914
<v Speaker 2>more than that.</v>

3004
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:55.813
<v Speaker 2>I think he literally had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's had 50 surgeries including eye </v>

3005
02:12:59.001 --> 02:13:00.930
<v Speaker 2>surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3006
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:03.290
<v Speaker 2>he's had shoulder surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3007
02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:07.010
<v Speaker 2>But when I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his knees were so fucked up.</v>

3008
02:13:07.011 --> 02:13:07.844
<v Speaker 2>He had these big slices up and down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of his knees where they had opened </v>

3009
02:13:11.301 --> 02:13:14.360
<v Speaker 2>him up and tried to screw things back </v>
<v Speaker 2>together again from skiing,</v>

3010
02:13:14.361 --> 02:13:19.361
<v Speaker 2>just mangling his knees in the old days </v>
<v Speaker 2>of skiing and those same operations.</v>

3011
02:13:19.551 --> 02:13:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Today I have one on this knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even see the scar.</v>

3012
02:13:22.131 --> 02:13:25.760
<v Speaker 2>It's little tiny dots because they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it arthroscopically and they put it in a</v>

3013
02:13:25.761 --> 02:13:29.420
<v Speaker 2>cadaver unit and healed in six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing Jujitsu again.</v>

3014
02:13:29.421 --> 02:13:31.610
<v Speaker 2>No pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no loss of range of motion.</v>

3015
02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Everything feels</v>

3016
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:33.173
<v Speaker 3>stronger than I felt before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like that's just the medical science </v>

3017
02:13:35.731 --> 02:13:36.564
<v Speaker 3>that occurred in 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years from his operation to my </v>

3018
02:13:40.201 --> 02:13:42.120
<v Speaker 3>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it gonna be 20 years from now,</v>

3019
02:13:42.121 --> 02:13:42.954
<v Speaker 3>it's totally possible they'll develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of stem cell technique to </v>

3020
02:13:45.031 --> 02:13:46.500
<v Speaker 3>regenerate brain tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3021
02:13:46.501 --> 02:13:47.334
<v Speaker 3>Well this is why it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy the bulb in human history </v>

3022
02:13:49.501 --> 02:13:50.131
<v Speaker 3>where at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're like,</v>

3023
02:13:50.131 --> 02:13:50.964
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can just not kill each other for </v>

3024
02:13:52.411 --> 02:13:56.310
<v Speaker 3>like another couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might do some really beautiful,</v>

3025
02:13:56.311 --> 02:13:57.670
<v Speaker 3>amazing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3026
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Like we really might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might.</v>

3027
02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:00.533
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that one of our big threats </v>

3028
02:14:02.391 --> 02:14:03.870
<v Speaker 3>is North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3029
02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Because that represents like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oldest styles of running a country ever.</v>

3030
02:14:08.250 --> 02:14:09.830
<v Speaker 3>And it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3031
02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:11.250
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3032
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:14.370
<v Speaker 3>I think trump's been really bad on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that issue.</v>

3033
02:14:14.371 --> 02:14:15.270
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking,</v>

3034
02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:16.140
<v Speaker 3>that is terrifying.</v>

3035
02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:18.990
<v Speaker 3>I was really happy when you had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Malice on because I've learned a</v>

3036
02:14:18.991 --> 02:14:21.000
<v Speaker 3>lot about North Korea from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3037
02:14:21.001 --> 02:14:23.420
<v Speaker 3>He knows so much about his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dear readers,</v>

3038
02:14:23.421 --> 02:14:24.360
<v Speaker 3>excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yes,</v>

3039
02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:28.590
<v Speaker 3>it's an excellent book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's just a fascinating human being.</v>

3040
02:14:28.730 --> 02:14:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got it.</v>

3041
02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:29.941
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3042
02:14:29.941 --> 02:14:31.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we were saying before,</v>

3043
02:14:31.741 --> 02:14:32.574
<v Speaker 3>like it's like a hostage situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the guy holding the hostages has </v>

3044
02:14:36.151 --> 02:14:36.984
<v Speaker 3>nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes that like a very different </v>

3045
02:14:38.761 --> 02:14:39.594
<v Speaker 3>type of hostage situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any shooting them in the sky but also </v>

3046
02:14:42.901 --> 02:14:44.370
<v Speaker 3>duds over Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3047
02:14:44.371 --> 02:14:46.890
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there also is like people,</v>

3048
02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:47.753
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media which just absolutely has a </v>

3049
02:14:50.671 --> 02:14:54.420
<v Speaker 3>blind spot for the military industrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex and the horror of American wars.</v>

3050
02:14:54.630 --> 02:14:57.300
<v Speaker 3>So you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get the full picture.</v>

3051
02:14:57.301 --> 02:14:58.134
<v Speaker 3>I think like to me it's very logical why</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's shooting off rockets left and </v>

3052
02:15:02.011 --> 02:15:02.220
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3053
02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:03.053
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean self preservation is a pretty </v>

3054
02:15:06.601 --> 02:15:10.620
<v Speaker 3>obvious motivator and people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gaddafi who come out and say,</v>

3055
02:15:10.710 --> 02:15:11.311
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3056
02:15:11.311 --> 02:15:12.144
<v Speaker 3>you international community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said you don't want us to have </v>

3057
02:15:13.951 --> 02:15:15.600
<v Speaker 3>nuclear arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then will disarm.</v>

3058
02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:18.060
<v Speaker 3>We'll end our nuclear program where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

3059
02:15:18.061 --> 02:15:18.894
<v Speaker 3>We move in there and throw them out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get the ends up getting sodomized to </v>

3060
02:15:21.571 --> 02:15:22.321
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3061
02:15:22.321 --> 02:15:23.910
<v Speaker 3>So that's like if you're this guy you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3062
02:15:23.911 --> 02:15:26.350
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to not go that route </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3063
02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:27.184
<v Speaker 3>So now I'm going to show you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and basically he's showing you I can </v>

3064
02:15:29.311 --> 02:15:30.144
<v Speaker 3>fucking nuke South Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can nuke these fucking places if you </v>

3065
02:15:32.881 --> 02:15:34.040
<v Speaker 3>come at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3066
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:34.861
<v Speaker 3>that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3067
02:15:34.861 --> 02:15:35.694
<v Speaker 3>he's a madman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's totally a madman who's holding </v>

3068
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:42.830
<v Speaker 3>people hostage and it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are like certain,</v>

3069
02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:44.640
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a hostage situation,</v>

3070
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:46.343
<v Speaker 3>there are some reasonable ways to handle</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and some ridiculous ways to handle </v>

3071
02:15:50.041 --> 02:15:50.520
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3072
02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.080
<v Speaker 3>So like when you have a hostage </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

3073
02:15:52.081 --> 02:15:56.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it's reasonable to negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the guy.</v>

3074
02:15:56.970 --> 02:15:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I think it's reasonable to take them out</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a shot.</v>

3075
02:15:59.430 --> 02:16:01.710
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone has a shot and like too many,</v>

3076
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:03.120
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people won't be hurt,</v>

3077
02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:04.650
<v Speaker 3>we can take them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take the shot.</v>

3078
02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:08.220
<v Speaker 3>What you don't do is stand outside and </v>
<v Speaker 3>start talking shit.</v>

3079
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:10.400
<v Speaker 3>So the guy who's got the hostages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3080
02:16:10.410 --> 02:16:11.243
<v Speaker 3>Know if trump's not thinking of it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything other than like a Rosie </v>

3081
02:16:14.610 --> 02:16:15.380
<v Speaker 3>O'donnell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3082
02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:18.000
<v Speaker 3>He talks shit about Rosie O'donnell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's calling the sky rocket man?</v>

3083
02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like with Rosie O'Donnell.</v>

3084
02:16:19.770 --> 02:16:20.610
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

3085
02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:21.800
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm no,</v>

3086
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:23.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm no fan of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something,</v>

3087
02:16:23.251 --> 02:16:24.084
<v Speaker 3>I kind of get a thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a kick out of how he'd Piss off </v>

3088
02:16:26.850 --> 02:16:28.290
<v Speaker 3>people who I'm not a huge fan of.</v>

3089
02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:31.810
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Hillary.</v>

3090
02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:34.390
<v Speaker 3>When she did the things he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Hillary.</v>

3091
02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 3>I love the nicknames until it was rocket</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3092
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:39.040
<v Speaker 3>I was really into the nicky nicknames </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

3093
02:16:39.041 --> 02:16:40.240
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Buddy,</v>

3094
02:16:40.241 --> 02:16:42.700
<v Speaker 3>this isn't funny anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's got nukes.</v>

3095
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.620
<v Speaker 3>But there's the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3096
02:16:44.650 --> 02:16:45.251
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>

3097
02:16:45.251 --> 02:16:48.090
<v Speaker 3>it was a morning Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cohost,</v>

3098
02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Mika Brzezinski shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she made a thing and on the show were</v>

3099
02:16:52.641 --> 02:16:53.474
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a picture on Time magazine </v>

3100
02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:55.413
<v Speaker 3>with trump with like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with his hands under his arms and she </v>

3101
02:16:57.791 --> 02:17:00.130
<v Speaker 3>made a joke on the show and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3102
02:17:00.131 --> 02:17:01.510
<v Speaker 3>how come he doesn't want to show his </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands?</v>

3103
02:17:01.511 --> 02:17:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Maybe because they're teeny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3104
02:17:03.770 --> 02:17:05.600
<v Speaker 3>That was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She made the sentinel essentially.</v>

3105
02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:06.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a little Dick joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3106
02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:08.740
<v Speaker 3>that's what she was making herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Donald Trump,</v>

3107
02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:12.220
<v Speaker 3>like immediately tweets out I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about her and he goes,</v>

3108
02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:13.570
<v Speaker 3>when she was at my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3109
02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:15.130
<v Speaker 3>when she was at my party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had,</v>

3110
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:17.410
<v Speaker 3>she had scars from the facelift.</v>

3111
02:17:17.630 --> 02:17:20.810
<v Speaker 3>She's still bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bleeding from the face looks for that.</v>

3112
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:22.780
<v Speaker 3>They asked me to sit with her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did not go.</v>

3113
02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:23.281
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3114
02:17:23.281 --> 02:17:26.980
<v Speaker 3>So it's this thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then of course the media goes right into</v>

3115
02:17:26.981 --> 02:17:29.500
<v Speaker 3>the mode of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you insult a woman's,</v>

3116
02:17:29.501 --> 02:17:30.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like looks and it's like,</v>

3117
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:33.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you can't take the heat,</v>

3118
02:17:33.461 --> 02:17:34.294
<v Speaker 3>get out of the fucking Dick joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then people were like actual </v>

3119
02:17:38.831 --> 02:17:41.900
<v Speaker 3>journalists like grown up people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>consider themselves journalists.</v>

3120
02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I saw reporting a week later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been confirmed that Mika Brzezinski</v>

3121
02:17:45.241 --> 02:17:47.050
<v Speaker 3>wasn't even at that event and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>

3122
02:17:47.890 --> 02:17:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking idiots.</v>

3123
02:17:49.151 --> 02:17:51.640
<v Speaker 3>This isn't a real thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just getting her back.</v>

3124
02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:53.500
<v Speaker 3>Like she hit him and he's hitting her </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

3125
02:17:53.501 --> 02:17:54.071
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3126
02:17:54.071 --> 02:17:54.904
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're vain enough to be having </v>

3127
02:17:56.771 --> 02:17:57.604
<v Speaker 3>plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably you're not going out while </v>

3128
02:17:59.141 --> 02:18:01.540
<v Speaker 3>you're still bleeding from the plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

3129
02:18:01.630 --> 02:18:04.330
<v Speaker 3>But like it's the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I kind of liked that about trump,</v>

3130
02:18:04.331 --> 02:18:04.961
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3131
02:18:04.961 --> 02:18:07.270
<v Speaker 3>finally someone being unapologetic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being like,</v>

3132
02:18:07.350 --> 02:18:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with you hardcore because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's stupid and childish and like,</v>

3133
02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:12.953
<v Speaker 3>are you fucking dumb?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beneath being the president of the </v>

3134
02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:17.103
<v Speaker 3>United States and this idea that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to make up a story about a woman </v>

3135
02:18:19.781 --> 02:18:20.614
<v Speaker 3>bleeding from plastic surgery to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>over because she said you have little </v>

3136
02:18:23.711 --> 02:18:25.440
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some weak bitch.</v>

3137
02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you repeat it back to me,</v>

3138
02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:28.640
<v Speaker 3>it does sound like some wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sweet.</v>

3139
02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:30.520
<v Speaker 3>If that was your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a second.</v>

3140
02:18:30.521 --> 02:18:31.354
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was your friend and one of your </v>

3141
02:18:32.681 --> 02:18:34.700
<v Speaker 3>friends was making fun of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3142
02:18:34.701 --> 02:18:35.534
<v Speaker 3>you had small hands and so you went on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>radio show or podcast and may not the </v>

3143
02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:44.070
<v Speaker 3>whole story about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>

3144
02:18:44.071 --> 02:18:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So far.</v>

3145
02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3146
02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:46.540
<v Speaker 3>So I'll agree with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>

3147
02:18:46.570 --> 02:18:50.560
<v Speaker 3>it is kind of a bitch move 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll agree with you.</v>

3148
02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:51.453
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really happen even so I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>get where you could say it's kind of a </v>

3149
02:18:55.001 --> 02:18:56.620
<v Speaker 3>bitch move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you should be above this,</v>

3150
02:18:56.770 --> 02:18:57.603
<v Speaker 3>but I get what I enjoy about it is if </v>
<v Speaker 3>then everybody else like the like 95 </v>

3151
02:19:02.861 --> 02:19:03.694
<v Speaker 3>percent of the mainstream media's </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction is how could you attack a </v>

3152
02:19:05.951 --> 02:19:10.330
<v Speaker 3>woman's looks like how you dummies that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'll think next time about.</v>

3153
02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:11.373
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the thing that Mika feels </v>

3154
02:19:12.731 --> 02:19:16.420
<v Speaker 3>entitled to make a small Dick joke and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then feels entitled the next day to play</v>

3155
02:19:16.421 --> 02:19:17.254
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you insulting a woman's looks like </v>

3156
02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:21.460
<v Speaker 3>it's actually worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3157
02:19:21.490 --> 02:19:24.520
<v Speaker 3>If he was telling the truth because what</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's saying,</v>

3158
02:19:24.521 --> 02:19:27.530
<v Speaker 3>he has no control over his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No control over her head with the of his</v>

3159
02:19:27.531 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 3>hands and he was</v>

3160
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.903
<v Speaker 1>born with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she does have control over whether </v>

3161
02:19:30.291 --> 02:19:32.990
<v Speaker 1>or not she's so vain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She lets a doctors stick a tube down her</v>

3162
02:19:32.991 --> 02:19:33.824
<v Speaker 1>throat and cut her half alive body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stitch it tighter to give the illusion </v>

3163
02:19:37.761 --> 02:19:38.990
<v Speaker 1>of youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3164
02:19:38.991 --> 02:19:39.824
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what a lot of it didn't </v>

3165
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:42.583
<v Speaker 1>really happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it did happen and he was talking </v>

3166
02:19:45.111 --> 02:19:47.510
<v Speaker 1>about that after she was talking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it makes sense.</v>

3167
02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:49.460
<v Speaker 1>What doesn't make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

3168
02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I get,</v>

3169
02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do agree with you the point you made,</v>

3170
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:54.620
<v Speaker 1>so I will walk back that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

3171
02:19:54.621 --> 02:19:55.454
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a shitty move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's just something I did like </v>

3172
02:19:58.011 --> 02:20:01.310
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he's willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's like fighting back against the</v>

3173
02:20:01.311 --> 02:20:02.144
<v Speaker 1>PC authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I do see as a really big fucking </v>

3174
02:20:04.581 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

3175
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't see this as like a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that's annoying.</v>

3176
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:08.383
<v Speaker 1>Like I think it's a really big problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't care about the dignity of </v>

3177
02:20:10.851 --> 02:20:13.490
<v Speaker 1>the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that being undermined as much as</v>

3178
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:13.730
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3179
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:14.563
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the whole idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's dignity to this bullshit job </v>

3180
02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:19.430
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate.</v>

3181
02:20:19.431 --> 02:20:21.980
<v Speaker 1>So I liked that being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that aspect of trump do.</v>

3182
02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:22.863
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about when board Dang </v>

3183
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:26.120
<v Speaker 1>got shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they asked him at the airport.</v>

3184
02:20:26.121 --> 02:20:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Just one of them tmz things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk through the airport,</v>

3185
02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:29.653
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had to cook for Kim Jong Un and </v>

3186
02:20:31.311 --> 02:20:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you serve?</v>

3187
02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It goes hemlock and they lease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking bordain throw away.</v>

3188
02:20:37.401 --> 02:20:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Funny punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just good chef humor right there.</v>

3189
02:20:40.941 --> 02:20:43.520
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at all the comments and so</v>

3190
02:20:43.521 --> 02:20:44.354
<v Speaker 1>many of them were using Hashtag Potus to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about potus that way and to talk </v>

3191
02:20:48.930 --> 02:20:50.450
<v Speaker 1>mean they were talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the king,</v>

3192
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:51.560
<v Speaker 1>like these sheep.</v>

3193
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:54.680
<v Speaker 1>But they also switched sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Obama people in the trump.</v>

3194
02:20:54.681 --> 02:20:56.990
<v Speaker 1>People are so happy to just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just literally one day.</v>

3195
02:20:57.070 --> 02:20:57.903
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take that position and I'll take </v>

3196
02:20:58.551 --> 02:20:59.930
<v Speaker 1>this position now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

3197
02:21:00.030 --> 02:21:01.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no feeling of like,</v>

3198
02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:02.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a little bit weird.</v>

3199
02:21:02.451 --> 02:21:03.284
<v Speaker 1>I was literally three days ago lecturing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people about how he's our president and </v>

3200
02:21:07.011 --> 02:21:10.190
<v Speaker 1>now I'm like not my president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't feel any,</v>

3201
02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:11.113
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3202
02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's this thing that I go,</v>

3203
02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:15.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember you said this and I've quoted</v>

3204
02:21:15.141 --> 02:21:17.840
<v Speaker 1>this many times on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem,</v>

3205
02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:20.530
<v Speaker 1>my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a plug in a problem.</v>

3206
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I would have a part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no more alliteration.</v>

3207
02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:26.630
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if you were quoting </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone or this was years originally,</v>

3208
02:21:26.631 --> 02:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but you were describing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3209
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.983
<v Speaker 1>the occupy Wall Street movement and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>use the white blood cells as the way to </v>

3210
02:21:32.781 --> 02:21:33.540
<v Speaker 1>describe them.</v>

3211
02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:34.373
<v Speaker 1>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've been quoting someone else when </v>

3212
02:21:35.151 --> 02:21:35.630
<v Speaker 1>you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3213
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:38.030
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it was years originally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember hearing you say this,</v>

3214
02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:39.093
<v Speaker 1>I think it was mine when I was saying is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously there's a disease and </v>

3215
02:21:41.721 --> 02:21:42.554
<v Speaker 1>they don't know exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the white blood cells are moving in </v>

3216
02:21:44.841 --> 02:21:48.320
<v Speaker 1>and they're surrounding this infection </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's trying to figure out what it is.</v>

3217
02:21:48.321 --> 02:21:49.154
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like such a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy and it applies to occupy Wall </v>

3218
02:21:52.371 --> 02:21:53.204
<v Speaker 1>Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also applied to like the tea party </v>

3219
02:21:53.931 --> 02:21:55.850
<v Speaker 1>movement in some other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're right,</v>

3220
02:21:55.851 --> 02:21:56.601
<v Speaker 1>the point of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3221
02:21:56.601 --> 02:22:00.170
<v Speaker 1>a white blood cell does not understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the complexity of a virus.</v>

3222
02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:02.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have the cure for a virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have like that.</v>

3223
02:22:03.050 --> 02:22:07.340
<v Speaker 1>But it knows corruption rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the thing.</v>

3224
02:22:07.341 --> 02:22:08.174
<v Speaker 1>It's like corrupt and rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that a lot of the trump </v>

3225
02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:13.640
<v Speaker 1>thing is that too.</v>

3226
02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:14.953
<v Speaker 1>It's like white blood cells and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that this pc authoritarian thing </v>

3227
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:22.610
<v Speaker 1>that trump fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they know that's the virus and this</v>

3228
02:22:22.611 --> 02:22:27.611
<v Speaker 1>is to them the most anti audit report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has half fake people.</v>

3229
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:30.503
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that to me today and I posted it </v>

3230
02:22:31.861 --> 02:22:33.930
<v Speaker 1>on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy with the results.</v>

3231
02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:37.310
<v Speaker 1>You're doing way better than trump's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way better than that motherfucker.</v>

3232
02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any fake people on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

3233
02:22:39.691 --> 02:22:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're the president,</v>

3234
02:22:41.731 --> 02:22:43.980
<v Speaker 1>you automatically get like a shit ton of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake people.</v>

3235
02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:45.353
<v Speaker 1>Billionaire gop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patron behind trump's social media bot </v>

3236
02:22:47.791 --> 02:22:48.511
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:22:48.511 --> 02:22:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Of course he has a media bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3238
02:22:50.671 --> 02:22:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Why would he not use that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3239
02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:54.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just like to him that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool,</v>

3240
02:22:54.301 --> 02:22:55.134
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when the Samurai's refuse to </v>

3241
02:22:56.431 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 1>adopt gun pile gunfire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they refuse to adopt firearms.</v>

3242
02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:01.793
<v Speaker 1>That fuck that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're using bows and arrows and swords </v>

3243
02:23:03.631 --> 02:23:04.464
<v Speaker 1>like men and they got gone down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the end of the Japanese empire </v>

3244
02:23:08.161 --> 02:23:08.994
<v Speaker 1>as we knew it at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just aged version of what Kodak </v>

3245
02:23:11.941 --> 02:23:12.900
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3246
02:23:12.901 --> 02:23:13.351
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3247
02:23:13.351 --> 02:23:15.000
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kodak was when digital came out,</v>

3248
02:23:15.001 --> 02:23:15.631
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

3249
02:23:15.631 --> 02:23:17.580
<v Speaker 1>we don't really like digital will be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film guys.</v>

3250
02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you guys go with digital and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>after awhile they tried.</v>

3251
02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:24.000
<v Speaker 1>They'll put out to digital cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then this cameras were on phones.</v>

3252
02:23:24.510 --> 02:23:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you missed the whole thing.</v>

3253
02:23:25.711 --> 02:23:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You were an industry leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3254
02:23:27.091 --> 02:23:27.924
<v Speaker 1>you went way behind the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're the number one typewriter </v>

3255
02:23:29.851 --> 02:23:31.350
<v Speaker 1>distributor now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it means.</v>

3256
02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:34.350
<v Speaker 1>If you are running for President Dave </v>
<v Speaker 1>Smith and you don't use a Bot army,</v>

3257
02:23:34.351 --> 02:23:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll be very disappointed in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

3258
02:23:35.911 --> 02:23:36.744
<v Speaker 1>how can I give you my support if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even willing to use a bot army when </v>

3259

<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

<v Speaker 1>To your point.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>crap.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>running against the previous four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Kanye West Administration and </v>

<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will be Kanyi will have established </v>

3276
02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:11.393
<v Speaker 1>colony in Africa and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will have read designed Calabasas in </v>

3277
02:24:15.421 --> 02:24:20.421
<v Speaker 1>Africa and they'll all be just driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and bentleys and shit and duck in</v>

3278
02:24:20.611 --> 02:24:21.444
<v Speaker 1>Lyons.</v>

3279
02:24:21.470 --> 02:24:22.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is though.</v>

3280
02:24:22.921 --> 02:24:23.754
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like seems anything seems </v>

3281
02:24:25.651 --> 02:24:29.260
<v Speaker 1>plausible show will live into reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a thing that it is like a,</v>

3282
02:24:29.310 --> 02:24:33.000
<v Speaker 1>like Andrew Breitbart said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I've realized over the last</v>

3283
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.030
<v Speaker 1>year is that a politics is downstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>from culture.</v>

3284
02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the truth.</v>

3285
02:24:37.021 --> 02:24:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I completely missed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3286
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:39.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not completely,</v>

3287
02:24:39.991 --> 02:24:40.824
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely underplayed how </v>
<v Speaker 1>important the culture is and how that </v>

3288
02:24:43.051 --> 02:24:44.250
<v Speaker 1>really dictates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3289
02:24:44.251 --> 02:24:46.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

3290
02:24:46.111 --> 02:24:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you went to like,</v>

3291
02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:48.560
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3292
02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:51.060
<v Speaker 1>central Africa tomorrow and went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>

3293
02:24:51.061 --> 02:24:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I changed the minimum wage law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3294
02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:54.300
<v Speaker 1>things will be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3295
02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:56.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cultural element that you have</v>

3296
02:24:56.581 --> 02:25:00.030
<v Speaker 1>to account for also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Donald trump thing.</v>

3297
02:25:00.031 --> 02:25:02.120
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>

3298
02:25:02.190 --> 02:25:03.330
<v Speaker 1>what's so interesting to me is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3299
02:25:03.331 --> 02:25:04.164
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like trump's a buffoon and he's a </v>

3300
02:25:05.281 --> 02:25:06.114
<v Speaker 1>cartoon.</v>

3301
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally a cartoon like he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the color of his skin,</v>

3302
02:25:11.131 --> 02:25:12.870
<v Speaker 1>the color of his hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you watch CNN,</v>

3303
02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:16.530
<v Speaker 1>the fitting suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight body like crazy hair.</v>

3304
02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:19.620
<v Speaker 1>You're watching the news and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoon character comes on,</v>

3305
02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:23.040
<v Speaker 1>but in this weird way he's had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to like hold up a mirror.</v>

3306
02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:26.950
<v Speaker 1>The rest of American society is also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire,</v>

3307
02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:30.580
<v Speaker 1>so he's an undeniably a winner and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as we decide,</v>

3308
02:25:30.730 --> 02:25:32.710
<v Speaker 1>hard to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then on top of that,</v>

3309
02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:33.723
<v Speaker 1>he's unapologetic and that's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>we all admire because we all wish we </v>

3310
02:25:36.821 --> 02:25:39.400
<v Speaker 1>could do that because we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that pisses off the</v>

3311
02:25:39.401 --> 02:25:40.234
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3312
02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:41.453
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I think is right at the heart of </v>

3313
02:25:42.731 --> 02:25:45.490
<v Speaker 1>why they hate trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I'm fascinated by and</v>

3314
02:25:45.491 --> 02:25:46.324
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think being an unapologetic </v>

3315
02:25:48.281 --> 02:25:51.010
<v Speaker 1>white man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] rubs the left wrong.</v>

3316
02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3317
02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.800
<v Speaker 1>you can be a white man and you can be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ally,</v>

3318
02:25:54.250 --> 02:25:56.260
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta be you gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Down here,</v>

3319
02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:58.540
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't be like up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be like,</v>

3320
02:25:58.600 --> 02:25:59.433
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an opinion and this is how I </v>

3321
02:26:00.101 --> 02:26:01.360
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be down here.</v>

3322
02:26:01.361 --> 02:26:02.194
<v Speaker 1>Like I have an opinion and I know my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion's been overrepresented on his </v>

3323
02:26:04.181 --> 02:26:05.014
<v Speaker 1>Jamie kill scenes taken enough heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go after him again on </v>

3324
02:26:08.381 --> 02:26:10.690
<v Speaker 1>this podcast like you just did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw what he did.</v>

3325
02:26:11.970 --> 02:26:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Will welcome Jamie back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will do.</v>

3326
02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I will come back and he did some silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3327
02:26:18.791 --> 02:26:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Got a little carried away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3328
02:26:20.350 --> 02:26:22.060
<v Speaker 1>People make bad decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a.</v>

3329
02:26:22.090 --> 02:26:25.330
<v Speaker 1>He got influenced by a silly ideology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3330
02:26:25.331 --> 02:26:26.164
<v Speaker 1>and it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he did some great work for </v>

3331
02:26:27.761 --> 02:26:28.594
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a fucking speech that he </v>

3332
02:26:29.741 --> 02:26:31.600
<v Speaker 1>did in front of this giant thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>

3333
02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was doing this,</v>

3334
02:26:33.971 --> 02:26:38.840
<v Speaker 1>a speech about about Donald Trump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>about black lives matter and it was rick</v>

3335
02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:41.500
<v Speaker 1>really well worded stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you agree with it or not.</v>

3336
02:26:41.501 --> 02:26:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Like he did good work inside that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little sort of paradigm.</v>

3337
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I met Jamie Kilstein when I was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand new comedian,</v>

3338
02:26:50.130 --> 02:26:53.320
<v Speaker 1>like just starting standup comedy and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

3339
02:26:53.430 --> 02:26:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me like doing things that were really</v>

3340
02:26:56.681 --> 02:26:57.514
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was on the road with Stan hope </v>

3341
02:26:58.061 --> 02:26:59.180
<v Speaker 1>and like to me that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3342
02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made it,</v>

3343
02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:01.083
<v Speaker 1>like that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're doing the thing that we all </v>

3344
02:27:02.321 --> 02:27:03.154
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was just super kind and helpful </v>

3345
02:27:06.581 --> 02:27:07.414
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a young comment and so I always </v>

3346
02:27:08.441 --> 02:27:10.960
<v Speaker 1>just have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person,</v>

3347
02:27:10.961 --> 02:27:11.794
<v Speaker 1>I like Jamie and all the things I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like about Jamie where we like seeing </v>

3348
02:27:14.231 --> 02:27:17.440
<v Speaker 1>him on your show or seeing something he </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted or something like that.</v>

3349
02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:20.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's like as a person I always liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and then the public persona,</v>

3350
02:27:20.861 --> 02:27:22.720
<v Speaker 1>like he knows a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apologies,</v>

3351
02:27:22.721 --> 02:27:23.790
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be happy to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3352
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:24.663
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think we're all vulnerable to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain extent and we're vulnerable to </v>

3353
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.863
<v Speaker 1>like if you tap into a vein and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>success with a certain way of behaving </v>

3354
02:27:33.191 --> 02:27:34.024
<v Speaker 1>and thinking and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put blinders on because this is </v>

3355
02:27:37.001 --> 02:27:37.834
<v Speaker 1>benefiting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we see that financially with </v>

3356
02:27:39.461 --> 02:27:42.280
<v Speaker 1>people were talking about before you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that culturally,</v>

3357
02:27:42.281 --> 02:27:43.114
<v Speaker 1>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think Jamie tapped into like the </v>

3358
02:27:44.381 --> 02:27:49.330
<v Speaker 1>social vein of success in this very </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme ideology,</v>

3359
02:27:49.331 --> 02:27:53.140
<v Speaker 1>this extreme feminist male feminist ally</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>

3360
02:27:53.350 --> 02:27:56.290
<v Speaker 1>the denial of the differences between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the men,</v>

3361
02:27:56.291 --> 02:27:59.800
<v Speaker 1>the women in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like he's a cliche and a lot of</v>

3362
02:27:59.801 --> 02:28:00.401
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3363
02:28:00.401 --> 02:28:01.234
<v Speaker 1>Because he's a small guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very slight and you always see a </v>

3364
02:28:05.201 --> 02:28:06.970
<v Speaker 1>small guy who a Vegan and a feminist.</v>

3365
02:28:06.970 --> 02:28:07.461
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3366
02:28:07.461 --> 02:28:09.490
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those guys.</v>

3367
02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:12.070
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you fall into these weird sort</v>

3368
02:28:12.071 --> 02:28:15.820
<v Speaker 1>of predetermined patterns of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these categories and he just was a black</v>

3369
02:28:15.821 --> 02:28:17.140
<v Speaker 1>belt at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3370
02:28:17.290 --> 02:28:21.290
<v Speaker 1>but also banging chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out you can't,</v>

3371
02:28:21.410 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 1>you can't be in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also like plus eight.</v>

3372
02:28:23.390 --> 02:28:24.930
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so crazy me.</v>

3373
02:28:24.931 --> 02:28:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the ultimate feminist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves women,</v>

3374
02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:28.363
<v Speaker 1>top to bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the actual issue that </v>

3375
02:28:29.601 --> 02:28:31.700
<v Speaker 1>they had with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know either,</v>

3376
02:28:31.850 --> 02:28:33.110
<v Speaker 1>but I will say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3377
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:34.003
<v Speaker 1>That he hangs out in that social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior crowd that he was hanging out </v>

3378
02:28:36.951 --> 02:28:37.784
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will throw out the rape word for </v>

3379
02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:41.433
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at someone the wrong way </v>

3380
02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:47.120
<v Speaker 1>and they'll call that rape and what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>accused Jamie have was inappropriate and</v>

3381
02:28:47.121 --> 02:28:48.920
<v Speaker 1>manipulative behavior toward women.</v>

3382
02:28:50.570 --> 02:28:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally means trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted.</v>

3383
02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:53.413
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not even exaggerating if you go </v>

3384
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:58.610
<v Speaker 1>to them to this in this social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior world,</v>

3385
02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:00.230
<v Speaker 1>if you were to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3386
02:29:00.231 --> 02:29:02.450
<v Speaker 1>why don't we like get outta here and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to my place and you're like,</v>

3387
02:29:02.451 --> 02:29:03.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't go.</v>

3388
02:29:03.141 --> 02:29:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

3389
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:05.660
<v Speaker 1>She said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you said,</v>

3390
02:29:05.661 --> 02:29:06.910
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

3391
02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:09.710
<v Speaker 1>That is inappropriate manipulative </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

3392
02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:10.773
<v Speaker 1>Skeptics conference and a man in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator asked a woman if she wanted to </v>

3393
02:29:15.831 --> 02:29:16.664
<v Speaker 1>come to his room and have some coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she did a whole speech the next day </v>

3394
02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:20.893
<v Speaker 1>about how men should not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're with a woman alone and it's </v>

3395
02:29:24.981 --> 02:29:28.490
<v Speaker 1>late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not ask them to coffee because you're</v>

3396
02:29:28.491 --> 02:29:29.324
<v Speaker 1>going to imply that this woman is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger and make her feel uncomfortable </v>

3397
02:29:32.511 --> 02:29:34.370
<v Speaker 1>and all this crazy shit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3398
02:29:34.371 --> 02:29:35.630
<v Speaker 1>so a guy was trying to fuck you.</v>

3399
02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that happen all the time like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3400
02:29:38.101 --> 02:29:38.934
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making a speech about this t </v>

3401
02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:43.310
<v Speaker 1>trying to control the behavior of men to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where they're not mad anymore,</v>

3402
02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:44.713
<v Speaker 1>is shaped them and formed them into some</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird sort of pc version of you would </v>

3403
02:29:48.471 --> 02:29:50.870
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No biological difference between the men</v>

3404
02:29:50.871 --> 02:29:54.740
<v Speaker 1>and the women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men being only allies and like what?</v>

3405
02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is so weird and like,</v>

3406
02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:58.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always these people who seem to be </v>

3407
02:30:00.531 --> 02:30:01.364
<v Speaker 1>so resentful and angry at the male </v>
<v Speaker 1>female relationship and interplay and </v>

3408
02:30:07.401 --> 02:30:10.250
<v Speaker 1>like ankle and God wanted to fuck you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so horrible.</v>

3409
02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Coincidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost always not attractive.</v>

3410
02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It's you don't see a lot of tens walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around going like,</v>

3411
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:17.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so unfair.</v>

3412
02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:17.953
<v Speaker 1>There's a few that snuck in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see a ton of them like </v>

3413
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:21.541
<v Speaker 1>publicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3414
02:30:21.541 --> 02:30:22.374
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing is like the sheriffs </v>

3415
02:30:23.061 --> 02:30:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Clark's that's right.</v>

3416
02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:26.870
<v Speaker 1>And they put them right up front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put them right up front,</v>

3417
02:30:26.890 --> 02:30:29.540
<v Speaker 1>like see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at her tits,</v>

3418
02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:33.020
<v Speaker 1>giant tits and a little waist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking feminist.</v>

3419
02:30:33.050 --> 02:30:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Well the truth is if you want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a conversation,</v>

3420
02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:38.060
<v Speaker 1>a real honest conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege,</v>

3421
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:39.403
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who has privileged and who doesn't </v>

3422
02:30:40.641 --> 02:30:43.220
<v Speaker 1>have privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean hot chick privilege,</v>

3423
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:45.590
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty shit is pretty strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3424
02:30:45.610 --> 02:30:46.443
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot chicks walk around in a different </v>

3425
02:30:47.961 --> 02:30:48.794
<v Speaker 1>world than regular women and men do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just a different thing and </v>

3426
02:30:52.191 --> 02:30:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the nature of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3427
02:30:54.261 --> 02:30:56.300
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like who human beings are,</v>

3428
02:30:56.301 --> 02:30:57.134
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear her complaining about it </v>

3429
02:30:58.821 --> 02:31:01.280
<v Speaker 1>as much because she's winning at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this exchange.</v>

3430
02:31:01.281 --> 02:31:02.114
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women have to sort of keep their mouth </v>

3431
02:31:03.241 --> 02:31:07.550
<v Speaker 1>shut about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to like kind of wanting to get away</v>

3432
02:31:07.551 --> 02:31:09.470
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're working on our end over here.</v>

3433
02:31:10.950 --> 02:31:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3434
02:31:11.540 --> 02:31:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I saw this a tweet this woman put out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that said a pro tip if you,</v>

3435
02:31:16.611 --> 02:31:17.444
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ever date a man who doesn't </v>

3436
02:31:18.531 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 1>identify as a feminist.</v>

3437
02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:22.380
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so crazy.</v>

3438
02:31:22.980 --> 02:31:25.090
<v Speaker 2>That's such a crazy thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3439
02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:26.093
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro tip is one of the Douchey is things </v>

3440
02:31:28.081 --> 02:31:29.700
<v Speaker 2>you could ever say and not say something</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

3441
02:31:30.060 --> 02:31:32.640
<v Speaker 2>If you say pro tip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you say after that,</v>

3442
02:31:32.641 --> 02:31:35.800
<v Speaker 2>better be proposed truss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's Jesus Christ.</v>

3443
02:31:35.810 --> 02:31:37.760
<v Speaker 2>See pro tip and you're serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3444
02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:40.820
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking condescending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry person from the jump.</v>

3445
02:31:41.250 --> 02:31:44.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's very rarely a very successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>pro who's giving me this protest.</v>

3446
02:31:44.860 --> 02:31:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>

3447
02:31:45.650 --> 02:31:48.350
<v Speaker 2>the idea of every man that you date </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be a feminist.</v>

3448
02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every man date shouldn't be a person who</v>

3449
02:31:51.471 --> 02:31:53.510
<v Speaker 2>discriminates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

3450
02:31:53.570 --> 02:31:56.510
<v Speaker 2>They should be openminded tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be egalitarian,</v>

3451
02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:57.673
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that they have to subscribe</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a feminist ideology that this can't </v>

3452
02:32:00.191 --> 02:32:05.090
<v Speaker 2>just be fair and honest and curious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have real conversations with you.</v>

3453
02:32:05.091 --> 02:32:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Open and objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good enough.</v>

3454
02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:08.533
<v Speaker 2>Now they have to identify with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology that the only way you could </v>

3455
02:32:11.961 --> 02:32:12.794
<v Speaker 2>ever have equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true equality within the sexes of the </v>

3456
02:32:14.691 --> 02:32:16.610
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identifies as being a feminist.</v>

3457
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what feminism is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feminism is not supportive.</v>

3458
02:32:20.091 --> 02:32:20.924
<v Speaker 2>Women know feminism is total uniformity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's no discrimination </v>

3459
02:32:26.631 --> 02:32:28.160
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And until that happens,</v>

3460
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:29.150
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a feminist.</v>

3461
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And feminism to me is like,</v>

3462
02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:34.700
<v Speaker 3>like modern day feminism at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a hate group.</v>

3463
02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:36.740
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know how else to describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3464
02:32:36.741 --> 02:32:37.574
<v Speaker 3>They're just a hate group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you take them at their </v>

3465
02:32:39.471 --> 02:32:40.520
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3466
02:32:40.521 --> 02:32:41.354
<v Speaker 3>the way you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take any hate group at their </v>

3467
02:32:42.561 --> 02:32:43.460
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3468
02:32:43.461 --> 02:32:44.211
<v Speaker 3>and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3469
02:32:44.211 --> 02:32:45.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not a hate group.</v>

3470
02:32:45.381 --> 02:32:46.214
<v Speaker 3>We just care about white people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people's rights and the white </v>

3471
02:32:48.291 --> 02:32:49.100
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blah Blah.</v>

3472
02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:49.940
<v Speaker 3>And then you're Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3473
02:32:49.941 --> 02:32:50.774
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let me come to a meeting and then </v>

3474
02:32:51.981 --> 02:32:53.210
<v Speaker 3>by like that meet and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3475
02:32:53.211 --> 02:32:55.290

<v Speaker 3>at this meeting.</v>

3476
02:32:55.291 --> 02:32:56.124
<v Speaker 3>We're not hate group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just think that all straight white </v>

3477
02:32:57.591 --> 02:32:59.990
<v Speaker 3>men are trash until proven otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3478
02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:00.853
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you want to be there and you're </v>

3479
02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.710
<v Speaker 3>of that group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better first,</v>

3480
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:04.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3481
02:33:04.580 --> 02:33:05.413
<v Speaker 3>like confessed to your original sin for </v>
<v Speaker 3>being and be guilty the whole time and </v>

3482
02:33:08.751 --> 02:33:09.584
<v Speaker 3>be constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3483
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:11.990
<v Speaker 3>kind of repenting and then you can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3484
02:33:12.020 --> 02:33:12.790
<v Speaker 3>But even with them,</v>

3485
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:14.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3486
02:33:14.111 --> 02:33:14.944
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of women that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they don't want is some fucking </v>

3487
02:33:17.801 --> 02:33:19.810

<v Speaker 2>creepy sexual shit to them.</v>

3489
02:33:21.731 --> 02:33:24.820
<v Speaker 2>And they have to absorb it because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to move up the corporate ladder and</v>

3490
02:33:24.821 --> 02:33:26.800
<v Speaker 2>they're discriminated sexually in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>office space.</v>

3491
02:33:26.890 --> 02:33:28.740
<v Speaker 2>They're discriminated when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3492
02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:29.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3493
02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:34.300
<v Speaker 2>promotions and raises and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the position in the company that's.</v>

3494
02:33:34.390 --> 02:33:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3495
02:33:35.090 --> 02:33:35.923
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3497
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:41.330
<v Speaker 2>working in an office filled with fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

3498
02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:43.010
<v Speaker 2>think about trying to have sex with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

3499
02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:44.560
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3500
02:33:44.561 --> 02:33:45.394
<v Speaker 3>And there are certain struggles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like guys are unaware of the or maybe </v>

3501
02:33:48.611 --> 02:33:50.590

<v Speaker 3>you don't know what it's like to walk </v>

3503
02:33:53.561 --> 02:33:57.820
<v Speaker 3>around life as like a tiny hot chick </v>
<v Speaker 3>that men just constantly want to fuck.</v>

3504
02:33:57.821 --> 02:34:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that comes from being catcalled</v>

3505
02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:03.053
<v Speaker 3>you know when they first came out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that video that went viral of the chip </v>

3506
02:34:05.050 --> 02:34:05.883
<v Speaker 3>being catcalled around New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first reaction was I thought it was </v>

3507
02:34:07.751 --> 02:34:09.800
<v Speaker 3>very interesting and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you go,</v>

3508
02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:12.760
<v Speaker 3>if you're a guy who doesn't cat call </v>
<v Speaker 3>checks,</v>

3509
02:34:12.761 --> 02:34:13.594
<v Speaker 3>which is like the category I fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just not my style of getting </v>

3510
02:34:16.091 --> 02:34:17.920
<v Speaker 3>laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never thought of just be like,</v>

3511
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:20.380
<v Speaker 3>let me get that ass Motha like as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked by me.</v>

3512
02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:22.830
<v Speaker 3>But that did roll off the tongue kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally.</v>

3513
02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:23.673
<v Speaker 3>So maybe I should try try that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that'll get me a little more and </v>

3514
02:34:26.041 --> 02:34:26.874
<v Speaker 3>made me get it nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting to see that because </v>

3515
02:34:30.401 --> 02:34:30.821
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3516
02:34:30.821 --> 02:34:32.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as a guy who doesn't do that,</v>

3517
02:34:32.891 --> 02:34:35.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only category of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>unaware of it.</v>

3518
02:34:36.450 --> 02:34:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Me Know how they made that video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out later.</v>

3519
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:40.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did find out later,</v>

3520
02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:44.350
<v Speaker 3>please tell everybody like hours and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours of footage.</v>

3521
02:34:44.351 --> 02:34:48.190
<v Speaker 3>They basically went all day long and </v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately took footage of black</v>

3522
02:34:48.191 --> 02:34:49.024
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went around in circles in this </v>

3523
02:34:50.890 --> 02:34:55.030
<v Speaker 3>black neighborhood in Harlem and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times Square in these two areas.</v>

3524
02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:57.160
<v Speaker 3>And they basically got a lot of black </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

3525
02:34:57.460 --> 02:34:58.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking,</v>

3526
02:34:59.010 --> 02:34:59.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3527
02:34:59.910 --> 02:35:00.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to uh,</v>

3528
02:35:00.810 --> 02:35:02.500
<v Speaker 3>a very attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very attractive.</v>

3529
02:35:03.090 --> 02:35:05.620
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crime of the century,</v>

3530
02:35:06.010 --> 02:35:07.030
<v Speaker 3>but at least it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3531
02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:09.550
<v Speaker 3>I do think there's something to be said </v>
<v Speaker 3>for like,</v>

3532
02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:10.091
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3533
02:35:10.091 --> 02:35:10.924
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the experience of </v>

3534
02:35:11.441 --> 02:35:12.530
<v Speaker 3>getting cat called is.</v>

3535
02:35:12.730 --> 02:35:15.010
<v Speaker 3>This might be pissing off some women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

3536
02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:15.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

3537
02:35:15.610 --> 02:35:16.443
<v Speaker 3>let's look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's also lots of struggles </v>

3538
02:35:19.301 --> 02:35:21.820
<v Speaker 3>of men that women don't necessarily know</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

3539
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:22.743
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with feminists is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in modern feminist is that they're not </v>

3540
02:35:25.061 --> 02:35:26.110
<v Speaker 3>going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3541
02:35:26.111 --> 02:35:28.450
<v Speaker 3>we both have struggled here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's have a conversation.</v>

3542
02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:31.050
<v Speaker 3>We're not like we're humanists were </v>
<v Speaker 3>people lists,</v>

3543
02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:31.983
<v Speaker 3>let's have a cup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

3544
02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:32.853
<v Speaker 3>were feminists were on this team and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to talk about our struggles </v>

3545
02:35:35.861 --> 02:35:39.550
<v Speaker 3>and lecture you about it and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>never discuss the opposite.</v>

3546
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:42.940
<v Speaker 3>The truth and the past gets so perverted</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>

3547
02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:43.793
<v Speaker 3>they'd speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The past was all just oppressive gender </v>

3548
02:35:45.731 --> 02:35:47.590
<v Speaker 3>roles toward women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like A.</v>

3549
02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:48.453
<v Speaker 3>Actually in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were oppressive gender roles for </v>

3550
02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:51.073
<v Speaker 3>everybody in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very debatable who they were </v>

3551
02:35:53.561 --> 02:35:57.280
<v Speaker 3>more oppressive for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in my grandmothers and grandfathers</v>

3552
02:35:57.281 --> 02:35:58.114
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressive gender roles landed my </v>

3553
02:35:59.381 --> 02:36:02.340
<v Speaker 3>grandfather in combat fighting and war </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>

3554
02:36:02.341 --> 02:36:04.000
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3555
02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:05.080
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3556
02:36:05.081 --> 02:36:07.690
<v Speaker 3>the men didn't have any struggles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the women didn't know about.</v>

3557
02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Like again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we technologically advanced,</v>

3558
02:36:09.941 --> 02:36:10.774
<v Speaker 3>we don't need those gender roles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we did need for lots of years </v>

3559
02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:16.810
<v Speaker 3>before technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way for humans to survive.</v>

3560
02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:18.033
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go go for a hundred years ago and say </v>

3561
02:36:19.361 --> 02:36:20.920
<v Speaker 3>let's abolish gender roles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3562
02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:21.983
<v Speaker 3>what's it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have kids until you </v>

3563
02:36:23.861 --> 02:36:25.150
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three of them died from polio.</v>

3564
02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what that was the point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Google memo.</v>

3565
02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:32.330
<v Speaker 2>There's still things that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitate towards that or male with more</v>

3566
02:36:32.331 --> 02:36:36.290
<v Speaker 2>frequency than they do with are female </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have these aberrations,</v>

3567
02:36:36.291 --> 02:36:37.124
<v Speaker 2>these women that want to be mma fighters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these men that want to be florists </v>

3568
02:36:39.770 --> 02:36:40.603
<v Speaker 2>and you have all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different people in between and </v>

3569
02:36:43.050 --> 02:36:43.883
<v Speaker 2>to try to get equality and that was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that was so </v>

3570
02:36:46.761 --> 02:36:47.594
<v Speaker 2>frustrating about people is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not saying that women shouldn't be </v>

3571
02:36:49.821 --> 02:36:51.110
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't be equal.</v>

3572
02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:52.093
<v Speaker 2>We're saying they're not equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not equally represented in this </v>

3573
02:36:54.890 --> 02:36:58.040
<v Speaker 2>particular field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This particular discipline.</v>

3574
02:36:58.350 --> 02:37:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Now let's explore why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3575
02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:01.153
<v Speaker 2>Things that I thought was so crazy about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the google memo was that the guy had </v>

3576
02:37:03.411 --> 02:37:08.411
<v Speaker 2>like a page and a half of like dedicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what would be a way to get women more</v>

3577
02:37:08.721 --> 02:37:09.554
<v Speaker 2>interested in tech and he had all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>citations for all these different </v>

3578
02:37:12.591 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 2>studies that he was quoting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they reprinted it and several</v>

3579
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:18.860
<v Speaker 3>sources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they remove the citations and they,</v>

3580
02:37:18.861 --> 02:37:20.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would put like these,</v>

3581
02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:21.093
<v Speaker 3>they take these quotes out of context </v>
<v Speaker 3>and highlight them and make them larger </v>

3582
02:37:23.841 --> 02:37:25.940
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I find strange to be like,</v>

3583
02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:26.813
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read part of that thing and it seems </v>

3584
02:37:28.191 --> 02:37:29.024
<v Speaker 3>fairly reasonable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I saw it very misrepresented in the </v>

3585
02:37:31.401 --> 02:37:33.110
<v Speaker 3>way people were talking about it on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>news.</v>

3586
02:37:33.310 --> 02:37:34.143
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like it's just this weird thing </v>

3587
02:37:36.051 --> 02:37:36.801
<v Speaker 3>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3588
02:37:36.801 --> 02:37:37.970
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do like,</v>

3589
02:37:37.971 --> 02:37:41.240
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equality is what exactly do we even mean</v>

3590
02:37:41.241 --> 02:37:41.601
<v Speaker 3>by that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3591
02:37:41.601 --> 02:37:42.434
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the equality under the law or something </v>

3592
02:37:43.281 --> 02:37:43.650
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3593
02:37:43.650 --> 02:37:44.483
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3594
02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:45.141
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3595
02:37:45.141 --> 02:37:48.230
<v Speaker 3>like men and women are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men are different.</v>

3596
02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Like you and I are different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3597
02:37:50.001 --> 02:37:50.834
<v Speaker 3>way more about politics than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know way more about hunting elk </v>

3598
02:37:53.331 --> 02:37:54.290
<v Speaker 3>and shit like that.</v>

3599
02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:55.213
<v Speaker 3>Well that's always going to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an equal thing because we're </v>

3600
02:37:57.411 --> 02:37:58.244
<v Speaker 3>not mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a huge gap to close on your El </v>

3601
02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:01.780
<v Speaker 3>content knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get at it.</v>

3602
02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:02.623
<v Speaker 3>I tried to get out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one that I'm probably </v>

3603
02:38:04.671 --> 02:38:06.970
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dipped my toes into.</v>

3604
02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:09.770
<v Speaker 3>So absorbed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3605
02:38:09.771 --> 02:38:10.604
<v Speaker 3>but you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the case with all of it is like </v>

3606
02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:14.233
<v Speaker 3>snowflakes I've been working on </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different and have different </v>

3607
02:38:16.101 --> 02:38:16.934
<v Speaker 3>and the idea that equality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you'll never have that have any </v>

3608
02:38:19.401 --> 02:38:21.740
<v Speaker 3>true science and then the thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3609
02:38:22.390 --> 02:38:23.223
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with women it seems like feminist </v>

3610
02:38:24.351 --> 02:38:25.184
<v Speaker 3>basically like they almost well bashing </v>
<v Speaker 3>men and bashing the traditional kind of </v>

3611
02:38:28.761 --> 02:38:29.594
<v Speaker 3>masculine gender role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also seem to embrace it and want </v>

3612
02:38:34.941 --> 02:38:36.910
<v Speaker 3>that for women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if men are,</v>

3613
02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:38.990
<v Speaker 3>they really want it for transgender </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3614
02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:40.363
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets super slippery </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the left wants really classic </v>

3615
02:38:43.131 --> 02:38:45.610
<v Speaker 3>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Transgender People.</v>

3616
02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:46.753
<v Speaker 3>When Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's painting his toes and wearing high </v>

3617
02:38:49.701 --> 02:38:53.720
<v Speaker 3>heels and short skirts and it gets a tit</v>
<v Speaker 3>job,</v>

3618
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:56.270
<v Speaker 3>gets his jaw sod down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3619
02:38:56.271 --> 02:38:59.600
<v Speaker 3>you can't just be a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got to be looking woman.</v>

3620
02:38:59.601 --> 02:39:02.240
<v Speaker 3>You got to be a woman with a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>facial surgery.</v>

3621
02:39:02.270 --> 02:39:04.010
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we go,</v>

3622
02:39:04.011 --> 02:39:04.821
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3623
02:39:04.821 --> 02:39:06.350
<v Speaker 3>you're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go,</v>

3624
02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:07.213
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a girl embraces those classic gender </v>

3625
02:39:09.081 --> 02:39:11.510
<v Speaker 3>roles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like wearing high heels and short skirts</v>

3626
02:39:11.511 --> 02:39:14.650
<v Speaker 3>and her tits are pushed together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3627
02:39:14.690 --> 02:39:15.523
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're falling into this classic gender </v>

3628
02:39:17.001 --> 02:39:17.960
<v Speaker 3>trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3629
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if a woman said,</v>

3630
02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:20.443
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a housewife and like raise </v>

3631
02:39:21.231 --> 02:39:23.270
<v Speaker 3>my kids and live a traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle,</v>

3632
02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:26.260
<v Speaker 3>or if I'm going to move for my husband </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>

3633
02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:30.200
<v Speaker 3>a married man and you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well for you go girl.</v>

3634
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:33.140
<v Speaker 3>And you see the same thing happen where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they literally the same thing.</v>

3635
02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:35.890
<v Speaker 3>They'll hate if a man does the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you had read,</v>

3636
02:39:35.910 --> 02:39:36.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3637
02:39:36.730 --> 02:39:40.370
<v Speaker 3>a feminist article about mma seven years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

3638
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:41.503
<v Speaker 3>it would have been all about toxic </v>
<v Speaker 3>masculinity and male aggression and all </v>

3639
02:39:44.841 --> 02:39:45.674
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as Ronda Rousey was doing </v>

3640
02:39:46.581 --> 02:39:46.970
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3641
02:39:46.970 --> 02:39:48.500
<v Speaker 3>that's our girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go do it.</v>

3642
02:39:48.570 --> 02:39:51.050
<v Speaker 3>If dirty comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive comedy,</v>

3643
02:39:51.110 --> 02:39:51.591
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3644
02:39:51.591 --> 02:39:52.670
<v Speaker 3>fuck that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your mail.</v>

3645
02:39:52.671 --> 02:39:53.930
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as amy Schumer is doing it,</v>

3646
02:39:53.931 --> 02:39:54.764
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>

3647
02:39:55.010 --> 02:39:59.210
<v Speaker 3>Like they love for a woman to do all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that they always said they hate.</v>

3648
02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:00.373
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy thing is like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll say these things where it's </v>

3649
02:40:02.031 --> 02:40:02.581
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3650
02:40:02.581 --> 02:40:03.940
<v Speaker 3>like women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3651
02:40:04.070 --> 02:40:06.010
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women are uh,</v>

3652
02:40:06.610 --> 02:40:07.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever percentage,</v>

3653
02:40:07.851 --> 02:40:10.850
<v Speaker 3>like 51 percent of the population and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're only like 10 percent of Congress</v>

3654
02:40:10.851 --> 02:40:12.150
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just making these numbers up.</v>

3655
02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Something like in that ballpark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there'll be</v>

3656
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:15.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is a problem.</v>

3657
02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:15.991
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3658
02:40:15.991 --> 02:40:18.420
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm all for freedom so if there's</v>

3659
02:40:18.421 --> 02:40:20.220
<v Speaker 1>any barrier in someone's way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that out of there.</v>

3660
02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:21.173
<v Speaker 1>But if people are free and like men </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to go be politicians and women </v>

3661
02:40:24.691 --> 02:40:26.530
<v Speaker 1>more choose to go into like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3662
02:40:26.531 --> 02:40:27.364
<v Speaker 1>like nursing and like these other light </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like maternalistic fields that </v>

3663
02:40:30.481 --> 02:40:32.370
<v Speaker 1>women go into a lot and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3664
02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:35.010
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you sure?</v>

3665
02:40:35.011 --> 02:40:37.170
<v Speaker 1>The answer is just that they should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like men.</v>

3666
02:40:37.171 --> 02:40:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe this is like saying something</v>
<v Speaker 1>better about women,</v>

3667
02:40:39.691 --> 02:40:40.524
<v Speaker 1>like men are going on or like going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruling over other people and women are </v>

3668
02:40:43.381 --> 02:40:44.214
<v Speaker 1>going into like a nurturing field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe the fact that women </v>

3669
02:40:46.141 --> 02:40:50.670
<v Speaker 1>prioritize family over money is not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad thing that needs to be reorganized.</v>

3670
02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:52.033
<v Speaker 1>Great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be some women that choose </v>

3671
02:40:53.581 --> 02:40:54.414
<v Speaker 1>to pursue a career at the very highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of capitalism and there's gonna </v>

3672
02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:01.260
<v Speaker 1>be some that have zero interest in doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3673
02:41:01.530 --> 02:41:02.363
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same with men as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just we can't deny the patterns </v>

3674
02:41:06.781 --> 02:41:07.614
<v Speaker 1>that we see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we should figure out is like are </v>

3675
02:41:09.661 --> 02:41:14.070
<v Speaker 1>there barriers if there's bears unjust </v>
<v Speaker 1>barriers to keep women from things.</v>

3676
02:41:14.071 --> 02:41:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure there are those things we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should concentrate on.</v>

3677
02:41:17.010 --> 02:41:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But concentrating on leveling the number</v>

3678
02:41:19.261 --> 02:41:22.920
<v Speaker 1>of people in Congress and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially sexual affirmative action.</v>

3679
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:26.060
<v Speaker 1>You want to get more women in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions because you think they have.</v>

3680
02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.800
<v Speaker 1>How many women do you have running?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you get to Hillary Clinton.</v>

3681
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean like we want a woman to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

3682
02:41:30.571 --> 02:41:31.404
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about a lying old lady who faints a </v>

3683
02:41:33.151 --> 02:41:34.350
<v Speaker 1>lot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that one?</v>

3684
02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

3685
02:41:35.911 --> 02:41:36.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's ridiculous.</v>

3686
02:41:36.901 --> 02:41:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what you got when you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get only women.</v>

3687
02:41:39.361 --> 02:41:40.680
<v Speaker 1>You got that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3688
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:42.420
<v Speaker 1>so what the fuck do you want to do now?</v>

3689
02:41:42.690 --> 02:41:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Because what you're doing is you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just decide that you only want,</v>

3690
02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:48.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want 50 percent men,</v>

3691
02:41:48.121 --> 02:41:50.310
<v Speaker 1>50 percent women in all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about coal mining?</v>

3692
02:41:50.670 --> 02:41:53.550
<v Speaker 1>You want to have 50 percent of women who</v>
<v Speaker 1>die had fucking coal mining accidents.</v>

3693
02:41:53.551 --> 02:41:56.220
<v Speaker 1>You know the disproportionate number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>men who die on the job.</v>

3694
02:41:56.430 --> 02:41:57.610
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's staggering.</v>

3695
02:41:57.611 --> 02:42:00.530
<v Speaker 1>But that's my point with the feminist </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing where it's kind of this,</v>

3696
02:42:00.531 --> 02:42:01.680
<v Speaker 1>this is why it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be like,</v>

3697
02:42:01.681 --> 02:42:03.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just for equality.</v>

3698
02:42:03.210 --> 02:42:03.721
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3699
02:42:03.721 --> 02:42:04.554
<v Speaker 1>well if you're just for equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come I never hear about how the </v>

3700
02:42:06.541 --> 02:42:07.374
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workplace death rate is like </v>

3701
02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:10.590
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean disproportionately,</v>

3702
02:42:10.591 --> 02:42:12.180
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like over 90 percent.</v>

3703
02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Then about prison sentencing differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3704
02:42:15.050 --> 02:42:16.620
<v Speaker 1>These are major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major things,</v>

3705
02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but people die or get thrown in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

3706
02:42:19.441 --> 02:42:21.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't come up at all because it's</v>

3707
02:42:21.121 --> 02:42:21.954
<v Speaker 1>like if it's black men they look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's right then and only then </v>

3708
02:42:24.571 --> 02:42:25.081
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

3709
02:42:25.081 --> 02:42:25.914
<v Speaker 1>but then of course it's also gotta be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the white racism white male and </v>

3710
02:42:28.930 --> 02:42:30.220
<v Speaker 1>that's linked with the fee.</v>

3711
02:42:30.450 --> 02:42:32.340
<v Speaker 1>The woman's struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the black struggle,</v>

3712
02:42:32.341 --> 02:42:34.020
<v Speaker 1>like they've kind of piggybacked onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3713
02:42:34.050 --> 02:42:39.050
<v Speaker 1>They should take it back on to Lbgtq w.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they kind of are.</v>

3714
02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:41.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hear that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

3715
02:42:41.091 --> 02:42:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I heard one person on Msnbc and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

3716
02:42:44.161 --> 02:42:44.994
<v Speaker 1>we just care about the rights of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of women and minorities and lgbt people </v>

3717
02:42:48.511 --> 02:42:50.490
<v Speaker 1>and immigrants and something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3718
02:42:50.580 --> 02:42:53.910
<v Speaker 1>just say not white men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I just save you some time?</v>

3719
02:42:54.130 --> 02:42:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Say Not Straight CIS white men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't everyone else your name in them</v>

3720
02:42:58.771 --> 02:43:00.300
<v Speaker 1>all in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just say it like,</v>

3721
02:43:00.301 --> 02:43:01.134
<v Speaker 1>just cut to the chase just for time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're doing it to align </v>

3722
02:43:02.971 --> 02:43:03.804
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it to align themselves </v>

3723
02:43:04.921 --> 02:43:07.020
<v Speaker 1>with other people that are going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>their back and agree with them when they</v>

3724
02:43:07.021 --> 02:43:10.860
<v Speaker 1>go to war with it that way because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth behind them,</v>

3725
02:43:10.930 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 1>like what you said before,</v>

3726
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:13.690
<v Speaker 3>that where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's any barriers,</v>

3727
02:43:13.691 --> 02:43:14.524
<v Speaker 3>let's remove that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you get to a certain point </v>

3728
02:43:15.431 --> 02:43:16.870
<v Speaker 3>where you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're being honest,</v>

3729
02:43:16.871 --> 02:43:20.270
<v Speaker 3>there are no real barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no real barriers to,</v>

3730
02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:22.030
<v Speaker 3>to and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3731
02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:23.800
<v Speaker 3>and if there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go after them.</v>

3732
02:43:23.801 --> 02:43:25.810
<v Speaker 3>But just on the big picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like talking about things,</v>

3733
02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:30.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're like a woman who really wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something in 2017 in a first world</v>

3734
02:43:31.661 --> 02:43:33.280
<v Speaker 3>country like the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

3735
02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:36.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are laws against paying,</v>

3736
02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:38.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman less than a man at the same job.</v>

3737
02:43:38.801 --> 02:43:41.550
<v Speaker 3>There are all these rules that are lots </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who will like,</v>

3738
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:43.400
<v Speaker 3>like actually bend over backwards </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

3739
02:43:43.401 --> 02:43:46.030
<v Speaker 3>They're really looking to have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3740
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity.</v>

3741
02:43:46.871 --> 02:43:47.704
<v Speaker 3>Like corporations really love diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone in show business knows that's </v>

3742
02:43:50.171 --> 02:43:52.360
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

3743
02:43:52.361 --> 02:43:54.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see a real barrier.</v>

3744
02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:56.050
<v Speaker 3>But then when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they can't find one,</v>

3745
02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:59.350
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll kind of create this barrier that</v>

3746
02:43:59.351 --> 02:44:00.184
<v Speaker 3>you can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we give people a bunch of freedom </v>

3747
02:44:02.231 --> 02:44:03.910
<v Speaker 3>and then women make certain choices in </v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

3748
02:44:03.911 --> 02:44:04.744
<v Speaker 3>make certain choices in this leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on average men making 23 percent more </v>

3749
02:44:07.661 --> 02:44:09.100
<v Speaker 3>than women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they go,</v>

3750
02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:10.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

3751
02:44:10.751 --> 02:44:11.471
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no barrier.</v>

3752
02:44:11.471 --> 02:44:12.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just women making choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

3753
02:44:12.671 --> 02:44:13.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's this,</v>

3754
02:44:14.290 --> 02:44:17.590
<v Speaker 3>this barrier called Patriarchy that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow,</v>

3755
02:44:17.700 --> 02:44:18.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've got to like,</v>

3756
02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:22.380
<v Speaker 3>it's because these women have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialized into thinking that they're.</v>

3757
02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:25.840
<v Speaker 3>So then they'll find this thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't prove or disprove.</v>

3758
02:44:25.841 --> 02:44:27.850
<v Speaker 3>You can't test it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of like.</v>

3759
02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:29.720
<v Speaker 3>But we live in a rape culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3760
02:44:29.770 --> 02:44:31.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like fighting terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war on terror.</v>

3761
02:44:31.541 --> 02:44:32.470
<v Speaker 3>It's the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3762
02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:33.430
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's just an idea,</v>

3763
02:44:33.431 --> 02:44:35.110
<v Speaker 3>I guess we're always fighting that idea.</v>

3764
02:44:35.890 --> 02:44:36.723
<v Speaker 3>And until women assume the power </v>
<v Speaker 3>position and there's a disproportion of </v>

3765
02:44:40.660 --> 02:44:41.493
<v Speaker 3>number of women in Congress and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportionate number of women who are </v>

3766
02:44:44.141 --> 02:44:46.390
<v Speaker 3>police officers and women who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>judges,</v>

3767
02:44:46.410 --> 02:44:47.243
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her lawyers and when they were in all </v>

3768
02:44:48.551 --> 02:44:49.384
<v Speaker 3>positions of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if men feel the heavy boot of the </v>

3769
02:44:52.391 --> 02:44:55.900
<v Speaker 3>oppressive woman until then until fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3770
02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:57.940
<v Speaker 3>And it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all so ridiculous.</v>

3771
02:44:58.570 --> 02:45:00.710
<v Speaker 3>It's just all so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what?</v>

3772
02:45:00.711 --> 02:45:05.170
<v Speaker 3>What area of life is there where things </v>
<v Speaker 3>are proportionately representative while</v>

3773
02:45:05.171 --> 02:45:06.860
<v Speaker 3>black people in basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3774
02:45:06.870 --> 02:45:08.970
<v Speaker 3>not unproportionate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying proportionately.</v>

3775
02:45:09.270 --> 02:45:11.110
<v Speaker 3>So they don't make up 13 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball.</v>

3776
02:45:11.111 --> 02:45:11.944
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they make,</v>

3777
02:45:12.010 --> 02:45:13.300
<v Speaker 3>they make up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like where,</v>

3778
02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:16.600
<v Speaker 3>where do you find racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to even that out.</v>

3779
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:17.470
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3780
02:45:17.530 --> 02:45:21.070
<v Speaker 3>More white people and Asians and whites </v>
<v Speaker 3>and down a little bit.</v>

3781
02:45:21.130 --> 02:45:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Make it easier to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3782
02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:24.850
<v Speaker 3>More black people in hockey.</v>

3783
02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:28.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's all just so it's all so fucking</v>

3784
02:45:28.511 --> 02:45:32.580
<v Speaker 3>like we should celebrate the differences</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have and just don't be.</v>

3785
02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:34.720
<v Speaker 3>Don't be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3786
02:45:34.730 --> 02:45:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Now let's say don't be sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be racist,</v>

3787
02:45:36.791 --> 02:45:37.624
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get Brownie points just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're a chick you don't know </v>

3788
02:45:40.241 --> 02:45:41.074
<v Speaker 3>and you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't get into this thing where </v>

3789
02:45:42.161 --> 02:45:42.994
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know it's like I've heard like </v>

3790
02:45:44.981 --> 02:45:45.814
<v Speaker 3>people particularly like a left wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>leading feminists or like female comics </v>

3791
02:45:51.461 --> 02:45:52.294
<v Speaker 3>who are feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I know several of them out without </v>

3792
02:45:56.890 --> 02:45:58.300
<v Speaker 3>calling out by name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3793
02:45:58.480 --> 02:45:59.620
<v Speaker 3>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard and they'll,</v>

3794
02:45:59.650 --> 02:46:01.840
<v Speaker 3>they'll get very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of them said to me once they go,</v>

3795
02:46:01.841 --> 02:46:02.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

3796
02:46:02.261 --> 02:46:04.030
<v Speaker 3>you're whole thing is just that you hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

3797
02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:04.993
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3798
02:46:05.250 --> 02:46:06.083
<v Speaker 3>but it's like hate women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you saw women say that to </v>

3799
02:46:07.961 --> 02:46:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Brian and you?</v>

3800
02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Nobody said it was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3801
02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:12.170
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that before.</v>

3802
02:46:12.171 --> 02:46:17.171
<v Speaker 3>And every woman that said that I hated </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a great response because it was a</v>

3803
02:46:18.261 --> 02:46:19.540
<v Speaker 3>stupid argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

3804
02:46:19.541 --> 02:46:22.310
<v Speaker 3>She was just like saying like a blanket </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement.</v>

3805
02:46:22.311 --> 02:46:23.490
<v Speaker 3>You hate women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3806
02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:25.370
<v Speaker 3>no you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just go.</v>

3807
02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:29.330
<v Speaker 3>I challenged a lot of people on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the left who,</v>

3808
02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:32.150
<v Speaker 3>who talk about race or sexism in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3809
02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:33.013
<v Speaker 3>I just challenge you to to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertain the possibility for like one </v>

3810
02:46:37.701 --> 02:46:38.534
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertain the possibility that you're </v>

3811
02:46:40.611 --> 02:46:41.444
<v Speaker 3>not right about all of this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the correct position is to treat </v>

3812
02:46:44.330 --> 02:46:46.670
<v Speaker 3>everybody equal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I know that sounds really,</v>

3813
02:46:46.671 --> 02:46:48.800
<v Speaker 3>really wild and out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not taking into account my white</v>

3814
02:46:48.801 --> 02:46:49.634
<v Speaker 3>privilege and the history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just entertain for one second the </v>

3815
02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:52.034
<v Speaker 3>possibility that the correct answer is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to treat everybody equal and not judge </v>

3816
02:46:54.831 --> 02:46:55.700
<v Speaker 3>them based on their race.</v>

3817
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:57.710
<v Speaker 3>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you entertain that for one second,</v>

3818
02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:59.000
<v Speaker 3>you'll start realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3819
02:46:59.001 --> 02:47:00.470
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's true,</v>

3820
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:02.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm really the one being the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

3821
02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>out to a show and be like,</v>

3840
02:47:47.810 --> 02:47:52.060

<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think this way.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you are on team women.</v>

3842
02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:56.653
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just seems to me that there's a lot </v>

3843
02:47:58.311 --> 02:47:59.780
<v Speaker 3>of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3844
02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:01.053
<v Speaker 3>That shit where it's like you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>project this thing that you see racism </v>

3845
02:48:04.581 --> 02:48:05.414
<v Speaker 3>everywhere or you see sexism everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all I really see is you fucking </v>

3846
02:48:08.631 --> 02:48:09.464
<v Speaker 3>lecturing people based on race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In their mind they're allowed to do it </v>

3847
02:48:11.721 --> 02:48:14.690
<v Speaker 3>the same way Cain Velasquez allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have brown pride and his chest.</v>

3848
02:48:14.970 --> 02:48:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda the same thing.</v>

3849
02:48:16.370 --> 02:48:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're disenfranchised or marginalized,</v>

3850
02:48:20.391 --> 02:48:21.560
<v Speaker 3>so you're allowed to stay.</v>

3851
02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:22.423
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're not you playing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim card as a woman and you're </v>

3852
02:48:25.371 --> 02:48:27.110
<v Speaker 3>allowed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to support my girl.</v>

3853
02:48:27.450 --> 02:48:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Like I was talking about this on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the day.</v>

3854
02:48:28.941 --> 02:48:31.880
<v Speaker 3>I saw a bumper sticker on a car and said</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls kick ass.</v>

3855
02:48:32.170 --> 02:48:34.100
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them,</v>

3856
02:48:34.630 --> 02:48:36.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them are lazy slobs equity.</v>

3857
02:48:36.730 --> 02:48:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Going to align yourself with 150 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>women just in this country alone.</v>

3858
02:48:39.981 --> 02:48:40.814
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying if a guy had a bumper </v>

3859
02:48:42.351 --> 02:48:44.300
<v Speaker 3>sticker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it said boys kick ass.</v>

3860
02:48:44.660 --> 02:48:45.493
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow that guy and find out where he's </v>

3861
02:48:46.731 --> 02:48:48.650
<v Speaker 3>been fucking these kids because first of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

3862
02:48:48.651 --> 02:48:51.410
<v Speaker 3>you'd never say boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boys kick ass.</v>

3863
02:48:51.411 --> 02:48:52.770
<v Speaker 3>You put that into your bumper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sit.</v>

3864
02:48:52.771 --> 02:48:54.530
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd pull them over.</v>

3865
02:48:54.531 --> 02:48:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Let me see your license.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do you live,</v>

3866
02:48:55.851 --> 02:48:57.050
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do for a living?</v>

3867
02:48:57.270 --> 02:49:00.050
<v Speaker 3>What's that bumper sticker about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck do you mean by that?</v>

3868
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't need like I almost feel like</v>

3869
02:49:02.391 --> 02:49:05.140
<v Speaker 3>an asshole sometimes where I preface </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything with a disclaimer like,</v>

3870
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying this and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just want it to be clear</v>

3871
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.620
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not saying there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptions to the rule,</v>

3872
02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:14.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's also kind of strange to me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to celebrate women,</v>

3873
02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:16.770
<v Speaker 1>why are you celebrating such a masculine</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality?</v>

3874
02:49:16.890 --> 02:49:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3875
02:49:18.090 --> 02:49:18.923
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are white players who are great </v>

3876
02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:20.730
<v Speaker 1>basketball players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3877
02:49:20.850 --> 02:49:23.580
<v Speaker 1>There are the Levitsky was an amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball player,</v>

3878
02:49:23.710 --> 02:49:26.760
<v Speaker 1>but if I just wrote some like white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people kick ass at basketball,</v>

3879
02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:27.953
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well actually that movie tone in </v>

3880
02:49:30.511 --> 02:49:32.550
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women don't kick ass in general.</v>

3881
02:49:32.730 --> 02:49:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a male thing to do.</v>

3882
02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying there's not exceptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>

3883
02:49:37.021 --> 02:49:37.854
<v Speaker 1>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're writing white people kick ass in </v>

3884
02:49:39.271 --> 02:49:40.860
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of misleading,</v>

3885
02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:41.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3886
02:49:41.791 --> 02:49:42.624
<v Speaker 1>there's that thing that's coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie with Steve Carell where he </v>

3887
02:49:44.761 --> 02:49:45.594
<v Speaker 1>plays a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that man who had a basketball tennis </v>

3888
02:49:47.431 --> 02:49:50.490
<v Speaker 1>match against Billie Jean King and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like barely ranked,</v>

3889
02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:51.393
<v Speaker 1>who's terrible tennis player and he fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billie Jean King up and it was and he </v>

3890
02:49:54.121 --> 02:49:56.160
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of mocking her the whole way and it</v>

3891
02:49:56.161 --> 02:49:57.940
<v Speaker 1>was like a real hallmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3892
02:49:57.960 --> 02:49:58.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just played professional tennis </v>

3893
02:50:02.461 --> 02:50:03.294
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't the best and Billie Jean </v>

3894
02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:05.213
<v Speaker 1>King was the best woman in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they played and the Steve Carell </v>

3895
02:50:07.861 --> 02:50:10.050
<v Speaker 1>character beater is now was not what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

3896
02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3897
02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting them conflated with Renee </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richards,</v>

3898
02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:16.253
<v Speaker 1>the guy who used to be a man and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>became a transgender woman and starts </v>

3899
02:50:19.011 --> 02:50:22.110
<v Speaker 1>stomping everybody in tennis is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible as a man.</v>

3900
02:50:22.290 --> 02:50:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And then it became a woman who was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the best of the world,</v>

3901
02:50:24.890 --> 02:50:28.140
<v Speaker 1>but there's no biological difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even without a penis,</v>

3902
02:50:28.141 --> 02:50:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you still stomping on it again is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>so funny because once you.</v>

3903
02:50:31.330 --> 02:50:32.163
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much this stuff starts </v>

3904
02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:37.130
<v Speaker 1>undermining their own arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy Jean King One.</v>

3905
02:50:37.390 --> 02:50:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that wrong.</v>

3906
02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:40.460
<v Speaker 1>So I got wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Renee Richard One.</v>

3907
02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I could fuse.</v>

3908
02:50:42.210 --> 02:50:43.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3909
02:50:43.290 --> 02:50:44.100
<v Speaker 1>what was the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3911
02:50:46.350 --> 02:50:47.183
<v Speaker 1>And Steve Carell plays them really well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and movie same Steve Corral who played </v>

3912
02:50:51.150 --> 02:50:55.740
<v Speaker 1>that crazy guy in that wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a really great job with a story.</v>

3913
02:50:55.770 --> 02:50:59.090
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy story that espn 30 for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side too.</v>

3914
02:50:59.110 --> 02:51:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3915
02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:01.373
<v Speaker 1>not a good in the sense that the stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just such a compelling unbelievable </v>

3916
02:51:04.801 --> 02:51:05.790
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

3918
02:51:08.341 --> 02:51:10.790
<v Speaker 1>character and then you watch the video </v>

3924
02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's comedy though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is always kind of his acting,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the older guy.</v>

3931
02:51:36.390 --> 02:51:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Fuck John McEnroe mock McEnroe said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3932
02:51:39.900 --> 02:51:41.490
<v Speaker 1>and they let us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let him into it.</v>

3933
02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:44.430
<v Speaker 1>He said he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started by saying Serena was the best</v>

3934
02:51:44.431 --> 02:51:47.370
<v Speaker 1>female player and then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why female?</v>

3935
02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

02:51:48.661 --> 02:51:49.494
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think she's the best female </v>

3938
02:51:50.911 --> 02:51:51.361
<v Speaker 1>player goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3939
02:51:51.361 --> 02:51:53.060
<v Speaker 1>why female?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not say male egos?</v>

3940
02:51:53.130 --> 02:51:53.963
<v Speaker 1>Because the men are way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was literally just answering the </v>

3941
02:51:56.911 --> 02:51:57.744
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started off giving this woman in </v>

3942
02:51:59.150 --> 02:52:01.420
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the story I remember.</v>

3943
02:52:01.470 --> 02:52:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Didn't serina play against an unranked </v>
<v Speaker 1>male player?</v>

3944
02:52:04.930 --> 02:52:05.763
<v Speaker 1>She did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to play when they were </v>

3945
02:52:06.701 --> 02:52:08.010
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she,</v>

3946
02:52:08.290 --> 02:52:09.123
<v Speaker 1>she played against some guy that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story and the guy kicked her ass and </v>

3947
02:52:11.861 --> 02:52:12.880
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3948
02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:15.880
<v Speaker 1>It just seems to me to be this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I kind of look at,</v>

3949
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:16.743
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're talking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalizations here and there are </v>

3950
02:52:18.521 --> 02:52:20.200
<v Speaker 1>exceptions like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3951
02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3952
02:52:21.430 --> 02:52:22.263

<v Speaker 1>a Rhonda Rousey could beat the shit out </v>

3953
02:52:23.711 --> 02:52:27.460
<v Speaker 1>of me as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a bad example,</v>

3954
02:52:27.461 --> 02:52:28.510
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3955
02:52:28.570 --> 02:52:31.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just making the point that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have this stereotype that men are</v>

3956
02:52:31.931 --> 02:52:33.250
<v Speaker 1>stronger than women or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3957
02:52:33.251 --> 02:52:35.250
<v Speaker 1>There are exceptions to the rule if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

3958
02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:36.250
<v Speaker 1>And there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

3959
02:52:36.450 --> 02:52:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I still use Ronda Rousey even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not championing more,</v>

3960
02:52:38.741 --> 02:52:40.900
<v Speaker 1>she's just still got that ring to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3961
02:52:41.020 --> 02:52:42.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying there are exceptions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule.</v>

3962
02:52:42.940 --> 02:52:43.773
<v Speaker 1>There are exceptions and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to treat someone based on a group </v>

3963
02:52:46.871 --> 02:52:49.710
<v Speaker 1>dynamic is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ignorant like to.</v>

3964
02:52:49.870 --> 02:52:52.660
<v Speaker 1>But if you're going to like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think there are differences between</v>

3965
02:52:52.661 --> 02:52:53.494
<v Speaker 1>men and women generally speaking and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe that it's like if we're </v>

3966
02:52:56.411 --> 02:52:57.244
<v Speaker 1>going to celebrate women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's kind of odd that we </v>

3967
02:52:59.531 --> 02:53:02.650
<v Speaker 1>have to celebrate the most masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievements of women.</v>

3968
02:53:02.800 --> 02:53:03.633
<v Speaker 1>It's like celebrating them kicking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are these things that I feel like </v>

3969
02:53:06.041 --> 02:53:09.730
<v Speaker 1>women are superior to men in that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>very impressed by them.</v>

3970
02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think women.</v>

3971
02:53:11.290 --> 02:53:12.123
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me stop you because you think that </v>

3972
02:53:12.910 --> 02:53:16.840
<v Speaker 1>running a corporation is masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you think that being involved in</v>

3973
02:53:16.841 --> 02:53:17.674
<v Speaker 1>any creative endeavor is masculine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that being involved in anything </v>

3974
02:53:19.960 --> 02:53:22.810
<v Speaker 1>in tech is masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what they're talking about.</v>

3975
02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:23.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was more responding to the women kick </v>

3976
02:53:25.751 --> 02:53:27.580
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just stupid bumper sticker.</v>

3977
02:53:27.610 --> 02:53:28.011
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3978
02:53:28.011 --> 02:53:31.290
<v Speaker 1>It is really a group thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my issue with it was if,</v>

3979
02:53:31.370 --> 02:53:33.650
<v Speaker 1>if you see things like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I just did,</v>

3980
02:53:33.660 --> 02:53:34.493
<v Speaker 1>but the element I'm responding to is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kick ass to me it just seems to be </v>

3981
02:53:36.431 --> 02:53:39.280
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a masculine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm describing that as masculine.</v>

3982
02:53:39.310 --> 02:53:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just one silly stupid bumper.</v>

3983
02:53:41.660 --> 02:53:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Like to say those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3984
02:53:43.441 --> 02:53:43.991
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3985
02:53:43.991 --> 02:53:45.430
<v Speaker 1>But I just think there's something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3986
02:53:45.431 --> 02:53:46.264
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like the nurturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of femininity is almost like </v>

3987
02:53:49.361 --> 02:53:50.194
<v Speaker 1>denigrated and the ass kissy asked kicky</v>
<v Speaker 1>element is like his praise where it's </v>

3988
02:53:55.051 --> 02:53:58.660
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm talking kicking ass and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nurture and I'm talking men,</v>

3989
02:53:58.661 --> 02:54:03.160
<v Speaker 1>verse women in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just broad speaking like I tend to think</v>

3990
02:54:03.161 --> 02:54:05.680
<v Speaker 1>of one being male and one being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>

3991
02:54:05.730 --> 02:54:06.563
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To wrap this all up and bring it all </v>

3992
02:54:07.420 --> 02:54:08.253
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd all be better off male </v>

3993
02:54:10.031 --> 02:54:10.811
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>White,</v>

3994
02:54:10.811 --> 02:54:11.621
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian,</v>

3995
02:54:11.621 --> 02:54:13.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we just reasonable nice people,</v>

3996
02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:14.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the real problem is that we </v>

3997
02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:16.773
<v Speaker 1>lock off as we've been discussing all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day into these camps and we are on </v>

3998
02:54:21.401 --> 02:54:22.234
<v Speaker 1>camp white male and we are on camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackmail or camp gay or transgender or </v>

3999
02:54:27.300 --> 02:54:28.133
<v Speaker 1>camp woman and we just locked into these</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies and we hate anybody else </v>

4000
02:54:31.361 --> 02:54:32.194
<v Speaker 1>different and we have these divisive </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we say like all white men </v>

4001
02:54:36.011 --> 02:54:38.090
<v Speaker 1>are trash unless proven otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4002
02:54:38.091 --> 02:54:39.430
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of crazy shit.</v>

4003
02:54:39.430 --> 02:54:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're setting it up.</v>

4004
02:54:40.721 --> 02:54:41.860
<v Speaker 1>So the guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

4005
02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:43.000
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you come in,</v>

4006
02:54:43.001 --> 02:54:44.460
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

4007
02:54:44.830 --> 02:54:45.663
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just being a reasonable </v>

4008
02:54:46.841 --> 02:54:48.970
<v Speaker 1>normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not enough reasonable,</v>

4009
02:54:48.971 --> 02:54:49.804
<v Speaker 1>normal people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so women are constantly dealing with </v>

4010
02:54:51.011 --> 02:54:51.844
<v Speaker 1>assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they develop these kinds of behavior </v>

4011
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:54.423
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think about men as being these </v>

4012
02:54:56.561 --> 02:54:57.394
<v Speaker 1>intrusive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty people just want to get in your </v>

4013
02:54:59.201 --> 02:55:00.034
<v Speaker 1>pants and really don't care about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're manipulative and they just </v>

4014
02:55:01.551 --> 02:55:03.460
<v Speaker 1>want to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which when do you say it,</v>

4015
02:55:03.470 --> 02:55:04.303
<v Speaker 1>I mean that it's somewhat true to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe and then men think of women as </v>

4016
02:55:06.621 --> 02:55:08.570
<v Speaker 1>being manipulative too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always looking for the bigger,</v>

4017
02:55:08.571 --> 02:55:09.404
<v Speaker 1>better deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where they're going to fuck </v>

4018
02:55:10.491 --> 02:55:14.000
<v Speaker 1>their personal trainer while you're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and we think about getting divorced</v>

4019
02:55:14.001 --> 02:55:16.260
<v Speaker 1>and losing all your money because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were too stupid.</v>

4020
02:55:16.290 --> 02:55:17.930
<v Speaker 1>You didn't sign a prenuptial agreement.</v>

4021
02:55:17.930 --> 02:55:18.763
<v Speaker 1>She has some kick ass attorney and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked and we all know guys who </v>

4022
02:55:21.651 --> 02:55:25.100
<v Speaker 1>have experienced that before too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she lies about you beating the kids</v>

4023
02:55:25.101 --> 02:55:27.350
<v Speaker 1>and then she gets full custody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all real,</v>

4024
02:55:27.351 --> 02:55:29.290
<v Speaker 1>but then the good stuff is all real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To know what I mean.</v>

4025
02:55:29.291 --> 02:55:32.540
<v Speaker 1>It's real and that does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also like the chick who</v>

4026
02:55:32.541 --> 02:55:34.190
<v Speaker 1>just like gives a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4027
02:55:34.191 --> 02:55:36.650
<v Speaker 1>like the security and competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never had to go be great.</v>

4028
02:55:36.651 --> 02:55:37.484
<v Speaker 1>There's the guy who does support his </v>
<v Speaker 1>chick through like her endeavors and </v>

4029
02:55:40.011 --> 02:55:40.311
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4030
02:55:40.311 --> 02:55:41.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you got it,</v>

4031
02:55:41.531 --> 02:55:41.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

4032
02:55:41.961 --> 02:55:44.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like that shouldn't in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricane in Houston.</v>

4033
02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Kind of put some perspective on that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me where it's like,</v>

4034
02:55:46.821 --> 02:55:47.654
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you see just like all these </v>

4035
02:55:48.321 --> 02:55:49.154
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Antifa versus Nazis as the </v>

4036
02:55:50.571 --> 02:55:52.360
<v Speaker 1>state of the country and then you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

4037
02:55:52.390 --> 02:55:55.550
<v Speaker 1>this horrible hurricane happened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the acts of kindness after,</v>

4038
02:55:55.551 --> 02:55:56.660
<v Speaker 1>when you see these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4039
02:55:56.720 --> 02:55:58.000
<v Speaker 1>like young guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4040
02:55:58.030 --> 02:56:00.380
<v Speaker 1>like these group of like 20 year olds </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they were,</v>

4041
02:56:00.381 --> 02:56:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I saw took.</v>

4042
02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:01.873
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like a motor boats down to </v>

4043
02:56:04.041 --> 02:56:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Houston and are pulling old people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their homes and you're like,</v>

4044
02:56:06.981 --> 02:56:08.080
<v Speaker 1>God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

4045
02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Like that's our country too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4046
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.823
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it,</v>

4047
02:56:10.870 --> 02:56:12.860
<v Speaker 1>it's all like the Nazis are our country </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

4048
02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:14.080
<v Speaker 1>But that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our country,</v>

4049
02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:17.390
<v Speaker 1>that is also as people responding to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very real problem,</v>

4050
02:56:17.391 --> 02:56:18.224
<v Speaker 1>we're really unites people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like they have to help each </v>

4051
02:56:19.851 --> 02:56:20.684
<v Speaker 1>other because it's a weird problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time we're separated from </v>

4052
02:56:22.791 --> 02:56:23.624
<v Speaker 1>each other by buildings and cars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this weird alienation we have </v>

4053
02:56:26.601 --> 02:56:27.434
<v Speaker 1>with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why places of </v>

4054
02:56:29.361 --> 02:56:30.194
<v Speaker 1>high density you get much more liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies or liberal in terms of </v>

4055
02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:34.760
<v Speaker 1>accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>

4056
02:56:34.761 --> 02:56:35.594
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of that to a </v>

4057
02:56:37.700 --> 02:56:40.490
<v Speaker 1>democratic versus conservative or left </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing versus conservative.</v>

4058
02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:44.060
<v Speaker 1>But these big population culture is </v>
<v Speaker 1>people interact with each other more.</v>

4059
02:56:44.270 --> 02:56:46.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get the same kind of racism,</v>

4060
02:56:46.341 --> 02:56:47.174
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get less and it's less accepted I </v>

4061
02:56:48.861 --> 02:56:49.694
<v Speaker 1>think in like maybe say New York City </v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably anywhere because in New </v>

4062
02:56:52.850 --> 02:56:53.661
<v Speaker 1>York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Manhattan,</v>

4063
02:56:53.661 --> 02:56:55.850
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got to interact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not saying you don't encounter it.</v>

4064
02:56:55.851 --> 02:56:58.790
<v Speaker 1>You certainly do sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White racism,</v>

4065
02:56:58.791 --> 02:57:00.590
<v Speaker 1>black racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna encounter racism,</v>

4066
02:57:00.610 --> 02:57:04.310
<v Speaker 1>pizza flaw in human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing that we're talking</v>

4067
02:57:04.311 --> 02:57:06.410
<v Speaker 1>about with the assholes of the Tiki </v>
<v Speaker 1>torches.</v>

4068
02:57:06.630 --> 02:57:07.463
<v Speaker 1>It's a flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone likes to feel like they're the </v>

4069
02:57:08.991 --> 02:57:09.824
<v Speaker 1>best and my team is the best at my local</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar is the best and my aunt makes the </v>

4070
02:57:13.371 --> 02:57:16.250
<v Speaker 1>best chili towns and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4071
02:57:16.251 --> 02:57:17.990
<v Speaker 1>your aunt does not make the world's Best</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chili.</v>

4072
02:57:17.991 --> 02:57:19.130
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4073
02:57:19.170 --> 02:57:19.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4074
02:57:19.910 --> 02:57:22.310
<v Speaker 1>the odds are very against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say it's a very,</v>

4075
02:57:22.311 --> 02:57:24.320
<v Speaker 1>very low chance to prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people.</v>

4076
02:57:24.350 --> 02:57:25.183
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people want to feel that way and so </v>

4077
02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:28.173
<v Speaker 1>there will always be these certain kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of in group preference things where </v>

4078
02:57:30.420 --> 02:57:31.000
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

4079
02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:32.240
<v Speaker 1>But like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

4080
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I do think like growing up in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>City,</v>

4081
02:57:34.911 --> 02:57:35.744
<v Speaker 1>you also just see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the beautiful thing that we </v>

4082
02:57:37.551 --> 02:57:39.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking lost in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sucks,</v>

4083
02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:43.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's like freedom does fucking bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>people together and capitalism,</v>

4084
02:57:43.671 --> 02:57:44.504
<v Speaker 1>even though it's become a dirty word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all that shit brings people </v>

4085
02:57:45.951 --> 02:57:46.700
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4086
02:57:46.700 --> 02:57:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a Jew and I can go in a New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City Street and put my hand out and</v>

4087
02:57:50.211 --> 02:57:51.044
<v Speaker 1>like a Muslim guy comes and picks me up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drops me off at home and just use </v>

4088
02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:56.470
<v Speaker 1>uber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you wasting your time with all that?</v>

4089
02:57:56.540 --> 02:57:57.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>

4090
02:57:57.321 --> 02:57:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I really do use Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Uber,</v>

4091
02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing lyft and now I just switched</v>

4092
02:58:02.551 --> 02:58:03.384
<v Speaker 1>over to uber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel bad that Uber was getting </v>

4093
02:58:04.441 --> 02:58:05.274
<v Speaker 1>locked out of London?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to step up and help out </v>

4094
02:58:06.540 --> 02:58:07.130
<v Speaker 1>uber?</v>

4095
02:58:07.130 --> 02:58:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they're locked out of Austin.</v>

4096
02:58:10.081 --> 02:58:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I think Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin,</v>

4097
02:58:11.251 --> 02:58:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they left there.</v>

4098
02:58:12.541 --> 02:58:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I think they're locked out of London </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

4099
02:58:14.071 --> 02:58:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I think the marriage you said that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they operate socks fuck off.</v>

4100
02:58:17.220 --> 02:58:18.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

4101
02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I love anything that undermines </v>
<v Speaker 1>government monopoly.</v>

4102
02:58:20.860 --> 02:58:23.430
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that was great that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermined that home medallion thing.</v>

4103
02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:24.273
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think technology that undermines the </v>

4104
02:58:25.921 --> 02:58:27.570
<v Speaker 1>government is the most beautiful thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

4105
02:58:27.571 --> 02:58:29.910
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ways app,</v>

4106
02:58:30.250 --> 02:58:30.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4107
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:31.623
<v Speaker 1>they have that now in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you if there's a camera on </v>

4108
02:58:34.381 --> 02:58:37.200
<v Speaker 1>the next red light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you if there's a cop on the</v>

4109
02:58:37.201 --> 02:58:38.970
<v Speaker 1>highway waiting the check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4110
02:58:38.971 --> 02:58:39.804
<v Speaker 1>like there'll be like police ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's literally the system where </v>

4111
02:58:41.551 --> 02:58:44.070
<v Speaker 1>the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops will sit there and wait for someone</v>

4112
02:58:44.071 --> 02:58:44.880
<v Speaker 1>to come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4113
02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:46.380
<v Speaker 1>speeding so they can come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4114
02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:48.390
<v Speaker 1>extort you for some money and understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that works.</v>

4115
02:58:48.660 --> 02:58:50.490
<v Speaker 1>The waste thing that it's just people </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling in.</v>

4116
02:58:50.491 --> 02:58:53.850
<v Speaker 1>So cops calling fake cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that,</v>

4117
02:58:53.851 --> 02:58:56.730
<v Speaker 1>but I know that I knew that it was other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people calling in very upset because the</v>

4118
02:58:56.731 --> 02:59:01.080
<v Speaker 1>police officers actually call in fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>cop on the side of the road calls.</v>

4119
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.943
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is that doing?</v>

4120
02:59:01.950 --> 02:59:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Making people drive the speed limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucks it up.</v>

4121
02:59:04.060 --> 02:59:05.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crying wolf.</v>

4122
02:59:05.250 --> 02:59:07.200
<v Speaker 1>So you basically just don't believe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much anymore.</v>

4123
02:59:07.220 --> 02:59:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought there was something really</v>

4124
02:59:08.941 --> 02:59:12.110
<v Speaker 1>beautiful about that server protect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to know.</v>

4125
02:59:12.140 --> 02:59:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the third thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protect and rule and take you out.</v>

4126
02:59:18.060 --> 02:59:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

4127
02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:20.033
<v Speaker 1>I thought when they first did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a beautiful thing that you're </v>

4128
02:59:21.631 --> 02:59:22.381
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because look,</v>

4129
02:59:22.381 --> 02:59:23.640
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

4130
02:59:23.641 --> 02:59:25.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you tell them there's a cop ahead,</v>

4131
02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:27.570
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to do is make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not speeding.</v>

4132
02:59:27.570 --> 02:59:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the only trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially it's doing what you would</v>

4133
02:59:30.241 --> 02:59:31.074
<v Speaker 1>claim the law wants you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just doing it in a way where the </v>

4134
02:59:32.761 --> 02:59:34.740
<v Speaker 1>state doesn't fucking extort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4135
02:59:34.830 --> 02:59:35.930
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they'll start going out,</v>

4136
02:59:35.931 --> 02:59:37.860
<v Speaker 1>we've got to fuck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not let that work.</v>

4137
02:59:37.920 --> 02:59:38.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll eventually figure out a way </v>

4138
02:59:39.631 --> 02:59:40.464
<v Speaker 1>around that or we're going to get to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>point I think in our lifetimes where </v>

4139
02:59:43.081 --> 02:59:43.914
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where it's headed and I </v>

4140
02:59:45.901 --> 02:59:48.180
<v Speaker 1>think that's gonna solve a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues socially,</v>

4141
02:59:48.430 --> 02:59:49.740
<v Speaker 1>a lot of very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's politically,</v>

4142
02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:50.633
<v Speaker 1>we're going to understand motivations </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind things in a way like maybe </v>

4143
02:59:53.131 --> 02:59:56.190
<v Speaker 1>motivations will seem color coded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is when someone's envious,</v>

4144
02:59:56.210 --> 02:59:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you literally see green with some new </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

4145
02:59:58.471 --> 03:00:01.280
<v Speaker 1>We're all running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're sit like,</v>

4146
03:00:01.290 --> 03:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>we've already started to see it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's much,</v>

4147
03:00:04.471 --> 03:00:05.304
<v Speaker 1>much harder.</v>

4148
03:00:05.400 --> 03:00:06.233
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much harder for people to pull off </v>

4149
03:00:07.861 --> 03:00:08.694
<v Speaker 1>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was much harder for Hillary Clinton </v>

4150
03:00:09.780 --> 03:00:10.613
<v Speaker 1>to pull off then for traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics in the past because they're </v>

4151
03:00:12.331 --> 03:00:13.164
<v Speaker 1>leaking everything online now and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just harder for the government or the </v>

4152
03:00:15.661 --> 03:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>big corporations have the media to </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince you of this narrative.</v>

4153
03:00:18.691 --> 03:00:19.524
<v Speaker 1>It's getting harder and harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we haven't figured out exactly how </v>

4154
03:00:21.661 --> 03:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>to move it in a good direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it is.</v>

4155
03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>You see the control that they have being</v>
<v Speaker 1>undermined.</v>

4156
03:00:27.781 --> 03:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>The control of the mainstream media is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being undermined.</v>

4157
03:00:29.941 --> 03:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>The control of certain universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's already gone.</v>

4158
03:00:32.221 --> 03:00:33.054
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet has sort of eroded all the </v>

4159
03:00:34.441 --> 03:00:35.274
<v Speaker 1>control of mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN is now called fake news a million </v>

4160
03:00:38.791 --> 03:00:39.624
<v Speaker 1>times a day all throughout the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you look at these people constantly </v>

4161
03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president calls it fake.</v>

4162
03:00:44.490 --> 03:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4163
03:00:45.691 --> 03:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

4164
03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you say like a w when you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>it earlier in the show with Fox News had</v>

4165
03:00:49.891 --> 03:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>had a monopoly on right wing news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's fucking over.</v>

4166
03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the bench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro comes and shows.</v>

4167
03:00:56.700 --> 03:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Look at the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing does.</v>

4168
03:00:58.021 --> 03:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

4169
03:00:58.960 --> 03:00:59.793
<v Speaker 1>Fox News as a big competitor on their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their hands now and all these other </v>

4170
03:01:02.291 --> 03:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>guys at crowder and all these guys were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like huge and all of the.</v>

4171
03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>If you look at like and Jordan who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

4172
03:01:07.590 --> 03:01:08.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he calls himself a classic British </v>

4173
03:01:10.061 --> 03:01:10.894
<v Speaker 1>liberal and it looks at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a sort of a different </v>

4174
03:01:12.851 --> 03:01:13.684
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more of a pragmatic sort of more </v>

4175
03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:18.633
<v Speaker 1>conservative pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably closest to what is called </v>

4176
03:01:21.941 --> 03:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Libertarian in the American School of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

4177
03:01:24.430 --> 03:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>The classical liberal people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>disingenuously call him outright.</v>

4178
03:01:29.080 --> 03:01:29.913
<v Speaker 1>It's just so freaking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the thing where it's like </v>

4179
03:01:31.661 --> 03:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>everyone to the right of Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a Nazi.</v>

4180
03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's just these words don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even mean anything and he just installed</v>

4181
03:01:36.790 --> 03:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>so it's like people shouting in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and it's like Lion Hillary,</v>

4182
03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you take the most fucked up word you</v>

4183
03:01:42.551 --> 03:01:45.310
<v Speaker 1>can think of to justify the legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

4184
03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And then culturally you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh by the way,</v>

4185
03:01:46.931 --> 03:01:47.764
<v Speaker 1>that word applies to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like women are getting raped on </v>

4186
03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>college campus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we get the law passed.</v>

4187
03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the real problems with the</v>

4188
03:01:53.291 --> 03:01:54.124
<v Speaker 1>guy like Donald Donald trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he boils things down to these </v>

4189
03:01:56.291 --> 03:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>slogans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they boil things down to slogans in</v>

4190
03:01:58.541 --> 03:02:01.600
<v Speaker 1>return and we just have a fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you throwing rocks at each other?</v>

4191
03:02:01.690 --> 03:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the amazing things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and the moment is that trump comes</v>

4192
03:02:05.321 --> 03:02:07.690
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like this simplistic buffoon,</v>

4193
03:02:07.900 --> 03:02:10.030
<v Speaker 1>and in every in the normal mind you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4194
03:02:10.031 --> 03:02:10.864
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point he's going to meet a a </v>

4195
03:02:12.371 --> 03:02:13.204
<v Speaker 1>professional who will embarrass him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start to realize after a while </v>

4196
03:02:15.971 --> 03:02:16.271
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4197
03:02:16.271 --> 03:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>there's just no professional plans.</v>

4198
03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Neither did Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all.</v>

4199
03:02:20.290 --> 03:02:21.123
<v Speaker 1>They were all completely empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between him versus </v>

4200
03:02:23.261 --> 03:02:24.094
<v Speaker 1>Hillary versus what we just had with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitt Romney versus Obama to really </v>

4201
03:02:27.431 --> 03:02:32.431
<v Speaker 1>reasonable well spoken people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished and quite intelligent,</v>

4202
03:02:32.711 --> 03:02:34.360
<v Speaker 1>and while the one of them believes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense,</v>

4203
03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both believe in nonsense.</v>

4204
03:02:36.690 --> 03:02:37.523
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of them believes in like one of </v>

4205
03:02:40.211 --> 03:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>those magical underwear at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential debate with them.</v>

4206
03:02:44.250 --> 03:02:44.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to.</v>

4207
03:02:44.921 --> 03:02:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Or it goes straight to like a cabin in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

4208
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:49.930
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay there with no satellite</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>

4209
03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:51.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the rule is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only get to have your wives that we </v>

4210
03:02:54.461 --> 03:02:55.294
<v Speaker 1>sling back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope we have this blow back this way </v>

4211
03:02:57.401 --> 03:03:01.220
<v Speaker 1>and I hope I don't mean I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to emerge between now and 20</v>

4212
03:03:01.221 --> 03:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>slash 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's gonna have to be someone that's</v>

4213
03:03:04.451 --> 03:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4214
03:03:05.170 --> 03:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>What's going to be have to be someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we look at and go,</v>

4215
03:03:07.811 --> 03:03:08.644
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a viable alternative to what </v>

4216
03:03:10.091 --> 03:03:10.924
<v Speaker 1>we're currently dealing with and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably shouldn't say shit for a long </v>

4217
03:03:13.301 --> 03:03:14.134
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should probably just build up and </v>

4218
03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>prepare and just constantly say I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

4219
03:03:19.150 --> 03:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

4220
03:03:20.531 --> 03:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's any bringing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing back together.</v>

4221
03:03:22.810 --> 03:03:23.643
<v Speaker 1>The United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we might be going our separate </v>

4222
03:03:25.811 --> 03:03:26.644
<v Speaker 1>ways in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think we might be headed toward </v>

4223
03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>some type of Soviet style breakup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4224
03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>like where some of the countries still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

4225
03:03:35.921 --> 03:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>but we're not all a part of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

4226
03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>

4227
03:03:39.281 --> 03:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>I look at these two trends that I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

4228
03:03:41.471 --> 03:03:43.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one is that content,</v>

4229
03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and this to me is the biggest moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue of our time,</v>

4230
03:03:44.921 --> 03:03:45.754
<v Speaker 1>but the continued growth of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just like gets like we live </v>

4231
03:03:49.601 --> 03:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>under choice happens just like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

4232
03:03:51.521 --> 03:03:52.354
<v Speaker 1>universal growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to get bigger and stronger </v>

4233
03:03:53.471 --> 03:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>every year pretty much always seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

4234
03:03:55.841 --> 03:03:56.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that government,</v>

4235
03:03:56.651 --> 03:03:58.130
<v Speaker 1>unlike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like corporations always want</v>

4236
03:03:58.130 --> 03:03:58.963
<v Speaker 3>to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them go out of business but </v>

4237
03:03:59.661 --> 03:04:01.670
<v Speaker 3>they always want to get bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>governments,</v>

4238
03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:03.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can force you to pay them.</v>

4239
03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:07.330
<v Speaker 3>So it's a lot easier for them to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is our most advanced society.</v>

4240
03:04:07.331 --> 03:04:08.380
<v Speaker 3>Start as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4241
03:04:08.381 --> 03:04:11.240
<v Speaker 3>a constitution with a somewhat limited </v>
<v Speaker 3>government and then it grows.</v>

4242
03:04:11.241 --> 03:04:14.780
<v Speaker 3>And that was the big appeal of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only appeal drain the swamp.</v>

4243
03:04:14.781 --> 03:04:16.700
<v Speaker 3>This is what it was then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of it was,</v>

4244
03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:18.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it was,</v>

4245
03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:19.033
<v Speaker 3>was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of draining the swamp is good </v>

4246
03:04:20.001 --> 03:04:22.370
<v Speaker 3>and not fighting these wars anymore I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is really great.</v>

4247
03:04:22.850 --> 03:04:25.480
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have this thing where we,</v>

4248
03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:26.433
<v Speaker 3>we live under the biggest government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most powerful government in the history </v>

4249
03:04:29.121 --> 03:04:30.160
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4250
03:04:30.260 --> 03:04:32.480
<v Speaker 3>there's never been a government that </v>
<v Speaker 3>spends $4,000,000,000,000</v>

4251
03:04:32.481 --> 03:04:34.280
<v Speaker 3>that can drone bomb anyone on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

4252
03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:35.000
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4253
03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:36.950
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have bases all over the world,</v>

4254
03:04:37.340 --> 03:04:38.173
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of different countries or at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least well over 100 and everything is </v>

4255
03:04:43.671 --> 03:04:45.320
<v Speaker 3>going up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean every budget,</v>

4256
03:04:45.321 --> 03:04:46.154
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush spent the most effort then Obama </v>

4257
03:04:47.061 --> 03:04:49.040
<v Speaker 3>spent the most ever trump will outspend </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama,</v>

4258
03:04:49.070 --> 03:04:52.910
<v Speaker 3>no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of the major major problems that</v>

4259
03:04:52.911 --> 03:04:53.744
<v Speaker 3>I see are our direct result of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the longest wars in American </v>

4260
03:04:56.061 --> 03:04:56.894
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass incarceration rate spying on </v>

4261
03:04:59.421 --> 03:05:01.410
<v Speaker 3>all of our citizens record debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4262
03:05:01.411 --> 03:05:04.310
<v Speaker 3>like all of these things are a result of</v>
<v Speaker 3>government being way too big and way too</v>

4263
03:05:04.311 --> 03:05:06.380
<v Speaker 3>out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then at the same time,</v>

4264
03:05:06.560 --> 03:05:07.393
<v Speaker 3>while we're like spending ourselves too </v>
<v Speaker 3>far into debt way to extended </v>

4265
03:05:10.161 --> 03:05:13.220
<v Speaker 3>militarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the culture is also completely decaying.</v>

4266
03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:15.620
<v Speaker 3>And we're more at war with each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than we've ever been.</v>

4267
03:05:15.621 --> 03:05:17.240
<v Speaker 3>And like I said before we go from like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4268
03:05:17.241 --> 03:05:22.000
<v Speaker 3>a Buckley Vidal debate to trump Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>

4269
03:05:22.140 --> 03:05:25.610
<v Speaker 3>We've had a jerry springer culture and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now we've got a jerry springer president</v>

4270
03:05:25.611 --> 03:05:27.920
<v Speaker 3>to go with it and I just see this </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture breaking up.</v>

4271
03:05:28.040 --> 03:05:28.873
<v Speaker 3>The government getting too big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how this all works out so </v>

4272
03:05:32.361 --> 03:05:37.100
<v Speaker 3>that like we're all friends again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'd love for someone to maybe spoken</v>

4273
03:05:37.101 --> 03:05:39.620
<v Speaker 3>like a true white man.</v>
