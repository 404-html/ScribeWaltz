1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>It's authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sweet.</v>

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm just now getting over the hurricane</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Shannon Briggs.</v>

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 2>It came through this with a storm of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go champ.</v>

5
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 2>He's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is a maniac.</v>

6
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.751
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad we can get you in here today</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained to everybody.</v>

9
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't know Chris produced and</v>

10
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 2>what'd you direct it and produce it in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger,</v>

11
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.280
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster and prescription thugs and</v>

12
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:30.520
<v Speaker 2>prescription thugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is particularly important because</v>

13
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it was about the prescription</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry and the,</v>

14
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.940
<v Speaker 2>the how many people get hooked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had experience with it.</v>

15
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

16
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 2>we've all known people in the last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that have had problems with</v>

17
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:43.900
<v Speaker 2>prescription pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want her to come in and talk</v>

18
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:44.734
<v Speaker 2>about Kratom</v>

19
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while back when I was actually hooked</v>

21
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>on pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for a way to get off of</v>

22
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>how it's searched the internet every day</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a way to get clean and sober.</v>

23
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>And I came across this thing called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom and I said,</v>

24
00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>are they sell it at these head shops and</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

25
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>back then I wasn't really familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head shop singing or anything like</v>

27
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I actually,</v>

28
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never found it.</v>

29
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I never went out and sought it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

30
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:10.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after going through Rehab,</v>

31
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I had heard about it a couple more times</v>
<v Speaker 1>from some people I've heard about people</v>

32
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>taking it to get off of opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a plant,</v>

33
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a 100 percent natural plant comes</v>

34
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand,</v>

36
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia,</v>

37
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>that's where they grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been used for like 2000 years.</v>

38
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works sort of like an opioid,</v>

39
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a plant,</v>

40
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has these properties that have</v>

41
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 1>helped people bridge the gap when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get off of opiates so they don't have</v>

42
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>withdrawals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it also does is help relieve pain</v>

43
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>and it also helps with anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps with,</v>

44
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 1>elevates your mood and it does all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>great things.</v>

46
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>But the government now wants to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a schedule one drug.</v>

47
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.190
<v Speaker 1>But so you're saying it's not a drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

48
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's semantics.</v>

50
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you classify something that's</v>

51
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>been around for 2000 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever done any studies on it</v>

52
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>being a drug and no one's ever done any</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies on it.</v>

53
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been some,</v>

54
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>there's been actually a lot of studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it being a supplement,</v>

55
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but they aren't like these FDA approved</v>
<v Speaker 1>double blind placebo studies that</v>

56
00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>they're requiring for it to be on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>market as a normal supplement.</v>

57
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.403
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.030
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Speaker 1>has psychoactive properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll elevate your mood.</v>

61
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So would just talk about Alpha brain are</v>
<v Speaker 1>some nootropics.</v>

62
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It'll work like that and it will elevate</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mood.</v>

63
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the real distinction</v>

64
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>is between high and elevation of mood or</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

65
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the difference is really there,</v>

66
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't make you feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I smoked pot.</v>

67
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>It's more like I had a good cup of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

68
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fired up back in the day when it</v>

69
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>used to take pre workout supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caffeine and ephedrine kind of feels</v>

70
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like fired up and ready to</v>

71
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 1>go and I don't feel pain.</v>

72
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.570
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting to create them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets you fired up.</v>

73
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I would've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've thought it would've melted</v>

74
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 2>you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have zero experience or that you have</v>

75
00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 2>some here now and you could drive in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is</v>

76
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 3>that they tell you not to operate heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy machinery and things like that.</v>

77
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 3>But I've never had a problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually take it to drive.</v>

78
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow I'm leaving for Thanksgiving.</v>

79
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I had to drive six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's your ass.</v>

80
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking Kratom before I get in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>car to go because it actually helps me</v>

81
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 3>focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It relieves the pain.</v>

82
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

83
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 3>that sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

84
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it mimics the effects of opioids,</v>

85
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opiates.</v>

86
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 3>But it also elevates you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well sure.</v>

87
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 3>So like if you don't know if you've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken oxycotton or a vicodin or any of</v>

88
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 3>those things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times when people take that,</v>

89
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:38.420
<v Speaker 3>they feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

90
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.330
<v Speaker 3>they're indestructible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took violin and I think it was viking</v>

91
00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 3>in once when I had my first knee surgery</v>
<v Speaker 3>in [inaudible] 93.</v>

92
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hated it.</v>

93
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 3>I took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took it literally one time and I guess</v>

94
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:51.890
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

95
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's different for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was vodka didn't,</v>

96
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 3>it might've been percosets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever the doctor gave me for</v>

97
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took the pills.</v>

98
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

99
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I feel so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

100
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be in pain that field as</v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb.</v>

101
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of times,</v>

102
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 3>like what happened with me is I came out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of anesthesia from a surgery and I was</v>

103
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 3>all doped up on the drugs and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even know it,</v>

104
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 3>so it just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kept going,</v>

105
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I never,</v>

106
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 3>I never stopped getting high from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time I was in the hospital for like six</v>

107
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.250
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

108
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it was like,</v>

109
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opiates were real big problem.</v>

110
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 3>They were ruining my life.</v>

111
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 3>They were destroying me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that I got sober a two and a half</v>

112
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 3>years ago and I started taking Kratom I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel great.</v>

113
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Like everything in my entire career is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going skyrocketing,</v>

114
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 3>things are going great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I relationship,</v>

115
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend's great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just everything's been been good so I</v>

116
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 3>can't really see the badness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they decided to make this a</v>

117
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 3>schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one drug,</v>

118
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.510
<v Speaker 3>we decided to make a documentary about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and show the world what it,</v>

119
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 3>what it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems really bizarre that you would</v>

120
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 3>have a problem with drugs and then this</v>
<v Speaker 3>would help you.</v>

121
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Like I would think that if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with drugs you would want to</v>

122
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 3>stay away from anything that's sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

123
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 3>But a big part of addiction you got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember is that we relapse relapse if</v>

124
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 3>you can have something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It actually helps with alcohol</v>

125
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 3>withdrawals and alcohol cravings.</v>

126
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.730
<v Speaker 3>So if we have something that will help</v>
<v Speaker 3>me to not crave those things or even</v>

127
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 3>think about them and also not feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why should I have to be in pain?</v>

128
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

129
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You in pain right now?</v>

130
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Not right now because I took them before</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came here,</v>

131
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 3>but I would normally be in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>arthritic pain.</v>

132
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just and you have arthritis just</v>

133
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:27.724
<v Speaker 3>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

134
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Double.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

135
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Double hip replacement surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need both of my knees done,</v>

136
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.000
<v Speaker 3>my shoulder shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

137
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 3>kinda everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of pretty beat up and so for me</v>

138
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 3>it just works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

139
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 3>my brother who was also a power lifter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he takes it as well before he trains and</v>

140
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 3>he really loves it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes it before he lifts weights.</v>

141
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

142
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 3>And he's trying to bench 600 pounds so</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not like,</v>

143
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 3>it's not like he's using a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

144
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 3>He's your brother's a gorilla and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing it.</v>

145
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.490
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so strange to me.</v>

146
00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 3>And this is all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad we didn't talk before this</v>

147
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 3>podcast because I had a thought in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>head of what this stuff is.</v>

148
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.430
<v Speaker 3>And you changing it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

149
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 3>you think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

150
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was probably just a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that people could relieve pain</v>

151
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 3>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I felt like if someone was going to</v>

152
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 3>describe it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were going to tell me</v>

153
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 3>about an opiate type of effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it just mellows you out,</v>

154
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't hurt you.</v>

155
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 3>There are different strains of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a strain called Bali,</v>

156
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 3>which is supposed to be good for anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of calm you down.</v>

157
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a strand called green melee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like sort of get.</v>

158
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that is a good pre</v>
<v Speaker 3>workout,</v>

159
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 3>but they're all kind of the same thing.</v>

160
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have the same alkaloids.</v>

161
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Kratom has 27 alkaloids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at it,</v>

162
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 3>it actually has alkaloids that worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>like opiate stay attached to opiate</v>

163
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 3>receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not in the same way.</v>

164
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.720
<v Speaker 3>If you look at oxycotton when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>attaches,</v>

165
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 3>they went opiate receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like,</v>

166
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stuck in there.</v>

167
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like screwed in basically if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about like a screw and opiate</v>

168
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 3>recite screwed in there so tight that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could never just pull it out,</v>

169
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to unscrew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with um,</v>

170
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.420
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the Kratom though,</v>

171
00:06:58.421 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 3>it kind of like balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it Kinda like drifts around the top of</v>

172
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 3>that opiate receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

173
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't attach it nearly as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that opiates attach a thousand</v>

174
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 3>times greater to the opiate receptor</v>
<v Speaker 3>than anything found in nature and</v>

175
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 3>Kratom's found in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

176
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 3>But what about heroin?</v>

177
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Like the actual poppy seed is found in</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>

178
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.763
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

179
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 3>and they have to do stuff to it to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

180
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin.</v>

181
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 3>They have to do stuff with a coca leaves</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make cocaine.</v>

182
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:25.020
<v Speaker 3>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

183
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 3>it's like marijuana and Kratom are</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the two most similar things.</v>

184
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 3>And when I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

185
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 3>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

186
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Senator Mark Pocan last week about a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the one that wrote a letter to</v>

187
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 3>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to keep Kratom legal.</v>

188
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

189
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 3>it should be allowed for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said to him,</v>

190
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about marijuana?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

191
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 3>I just think it should all be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was the first time I was ever in</v>

192
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 3>the presence of somebody that works for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government saying that they think</v>

193
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 3>that weed and Kratom and all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be illegal.</v>

194
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 3>And it's because he had a good head on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his shoulders about the problems that</v>

195
00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 3>people face every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

196
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I live in this gray area.</v>

197
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a lot of pain.</v>

198
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 3>But I don't want to take opiates and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have to take opiates.</v>

199
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 3>So where's the pressure coming from to</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn this stuff into a schedule one drug</v>

200
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 3>if there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's no negative response by the</v>

201
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not having people die of</v>

202
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 3>overdoses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there an ld 50 rate on this stuff?</v>

203
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.003
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at,</v>

204
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.520
<v Speaker 3>you know where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is the ld 50 explained.</v>

205
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 3>Probably explained to people lethal dose</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 50 percent.</v>

206
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Meaning if you take 50 rats and you give</v>
<v Speaker 3>them a pound of this shit,</v>

207
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 3>50 of them are 25 die at a certain show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've heard about,</v>

208
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been no deaths from marijuana,</v>

209
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom is the same thing.</v>

210
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no deaths.</v>

211
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 3>There have been zero deaths and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there have actually been 15 deaths that</v>

212
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 3>have been brought to the FDA and the dea</v>
<v Speaker 3>is attention.</v>

213
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 3>Those 15 that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually went and interviewed one of</v>

214
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:52.790
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the mothers.</v>

215
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 3>The kid was on three psych meds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was withdrawn.</v>

216
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 3>He was</v>

217
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>honored withdrawing from three different</v>
<v Speaker 1>psych meds.</v>

218
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I have a black box warning that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warning,</v>

219
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might commit suicide basically,</v>

220
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>and this kid committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't die from a Kratom overdose.</v>

221
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>He died from committing suicide and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother wants to blame Kratom.</v>

222
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

223
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>the psych meds had anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

224
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to say that Kratom had</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with it.</v>

225
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I really call for with Kratom</v>

226
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 1>is just more research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I want people to put in the money</v>

227
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>to do the research to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is safe and let's see if we can</v>

228
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.570
<v Speaker 1>solve this opiod epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can crack down,</v>

229
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically lower the amount of opiate</v>

230
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>prescriptions we have in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read an article the other day.</v>

231
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>One in seven people in America are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be affected with addiction problems.</v>

232
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

233
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 1>One in seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means somebody in your family,</v>

234
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

235
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Somebody in your family will be affected</v>
<v Speaker 1>by it and that's 10 percent.</v>

236
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

237
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>That's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

238
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And not everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that everybody gets addicted</v>

239
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 1>that are affected by addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My girlfriend was really affected by</v>

240
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.230
<v Speaker 1>addiction because when she met me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taking drugs and drinking every</v>

241
00:10:05.231 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

242
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big effect on,</v>

243
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>especially on women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

244
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>It's tough thing to handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can understand this woman whose</v>

245
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 1>son died being to understand her remorse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and looking to point the blame at</v>

246
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times people are reluctant</v>

247
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 1>to point the blame towards something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a doctor prescribed and they'll</v>

248
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:25.950
<v Speaker 1>automatically say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

249
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>it probably wasn't that.</v>

250
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.760
<v Speaker 1>It was probably this other thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not regulated.</v>

251
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.500
<v Speaker 1>You know what she said to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

252
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pray for you because I know</v>

253
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:37.470
<v Speaker 1>you're taking Kratom and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pray for you that you're okay.</v>

254
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to pray for me.</v>

256
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been taking it for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

257
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think that people just get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and I feel bad for her.</v>

258
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that,</v>

259
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she can't just realize that,</v>

260
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can't look at the research and see,</v>

261
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I went and interviewed her,</v>

262
00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:54.901
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

263
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure if Kratom killed them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is after a gigantic,</v>

264
00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.631
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

266
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:03.900
<v Speaker 1>they mount this gigantic media coverage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this story,</v>

267
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this was all over and now and now,</v>

268
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 1>like two years later after the damage</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been done,</v>

269
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>she's kind of coming back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

270
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.760
<v Speaker 1>she already did the damage like that.</v>

272
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these deaths are the reason why the dea</v>

273
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 1>wants to ban it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

274
00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:19.940
<v Speaker 1>the dea though is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of effort?</v>

275
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do a scientific analysis of</v>

276
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:25.460
<v Speaker 1>creative and they break it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find they don't find anything toxic</v>

277
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they know?</v>

278
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Melvin Patterson,</v>

279
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>he's the spokesman for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the dea.</v>

280
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 1>And when I talked to Melvin Patterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he told me is that they lean on the</v>

281
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 1>FDA a lot for these kinds of decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

282
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 1>So they go to the FDA and they asked the</v>
<v Speaker 1>FDA,</v>

283
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>can you give us an eight point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some sort of a thing that they</v>

284
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:45.240
<v Speaker 1>have in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an eight point inspection to</v>

285
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>make sure that this drug is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

286
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it is dangerous,</v>

287
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:51.810
<v Speaker 1>it's deemed dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take it off the market based on</v>

288
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 1>the FDA's research.</v>

289
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So the dea had asked the FDA for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight point inspection,</v>

290
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 1>the FDA never went ahead and did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the DEA got upset and said,</v>

291
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna abandon any way because</v>

292
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>we're waiting on you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a big uproar.</v>

293
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 1>There was 100,000 people signed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>petition partly due to to you tweeting</v>

294
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 1>about it and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a Guy Andrew Turner,</v>

295
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 1>he tweeted you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an Iraq war vet.</v>

296
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should see his video.</v>

297
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 1>He can't even speak without Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cannot talk normal without Kratom.</v>

298
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 1>He speaks with all these ticks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitches in his face due to they think</v>

299
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe ptsd and some other problems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had affected him.</v>

300
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 1>And now he takes Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those twitches all go away.</v>

301
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>He did a video on youtube that was kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of amazing.</v>

302
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 1>He stopped taking it for six days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see all these twitches are</v>

303
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>evidence and then he goes back on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom and they all disappeared.</v>

304
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

305
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.790
<v Speaker 1>So who's pressuring the dea to turn this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff into a schedule one drug.</v>

306
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And why schedule one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a,</v>

307
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of patents that are on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alkaloids that are in the plant.</v>

308
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 1>So I think that big Pharma would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place to look.</v>

309
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>They have a couple patents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to basically take this,</v>

310
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually,</v>

311
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.601
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

312
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at it as being that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why make,</v>

313
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 1>why make the organic kratom illegal in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to turn this into a more powerful</v>

314
00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 1>drug?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that they can extract some of</v>

315
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:19.870
<v Speaker 1>these alkaloids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

316
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>There's two alkaloids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metallothionein,</v>

317
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and the other one is like seven hydroxy</v>
<v Speaker 1>metallothionein.</v>

318
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 1>It's too technical for anybody to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about,</v>

319
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:29.770
<v Speaker 1>but there's two alkaloids that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>really care about that help with opiate</v>

320
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>withdrawals and help with pain.</v>

321
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And those are the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually just want to ban the two</v>

322
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 1>alkaloids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that because it's in</v>

323
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 1>the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to ban the whole plant.</v>

324
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:39.491
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

325
00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you said it the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said making something else illegal.</v>

326
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

327
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do to the people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

328
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 1>five states just legalized marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to throw people in jail</v>

329
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 1>for Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

330
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about this new</v>

331
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:57.640
<v Speaker 1>administration when it comes to men may</v>
<v Speaker 1>various reasons,</v>

332
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm worried about them when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to being compromised by big Pharma.</v>

333
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

334
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:06.580
<v Speaker 1>it's just a such a business oriented</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and he's bringing all</v>

335
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 1>these old dudes over there right out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV show.</v>

336
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>The strain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the vampire dudes that are hanging</v>

337
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 1>out with the Nazis.</v>

338
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm looking at all these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mike Pence and all these old dudes.</v>

339
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:18.180
<v Speaker 1>He's bringing in with these archaic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

340
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.630
<v Speaker 1>They're all against gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

341
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

342
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping that maybe trump would</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring in some people that would be</v>

343
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 1>opposite of his thinking and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just hasn't happened.</v>

344
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>So he was a Democrat for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Donald Trump was always a</v>

345
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:34.890
<v Speaker 1>democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean him running as a Republican is</v>

346
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.590
<v Speaker 1>kind of odd if you look at this history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's going all in with a lot of</v>

347
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.010
<v Speaker 1>these people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are deeply opposed to</v>

348
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:47.011
<v Speaker 1>marijuana legalization federally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that stuff is very counterintuitive</v>

349
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 1>and counter progressive and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana legalization,</v>

350
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 1>we've been reading a lot about that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be what a lot of people</v>

351
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 1>think might be a mess because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it recreational opens it up to</v>

352
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Marlborough and all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that make tobacco products to</v>

353
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 1>now start selling cannabis and a turn it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into what we already have.</v>

354
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

355
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not opposed to them making it</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial because I feel like the more</v>

356
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:15.710
<v Speaker 1>people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better we're all going to be sure.</v>

357
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>

358
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:18.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

359
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your upload who'd brew,</v>

360
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.940
<v Speaker 1>but I really think it's a it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

361
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can call it a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is,</v>

362
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 1>it is a component of life that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people calmer,</v>

363
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 1>makes people happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes people more sensitive.</v>

364
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's better for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 100 percent against it ever since</v>

365
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I was in college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had just thought like a</v>

366
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.801
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

367
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

368
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and steroids.</v>

370
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I thought marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids were the,</v>

371
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 1>were the devil and come to find out it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the drugs that the doctors actually</v>

372
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 1>prescribe us that are the devil that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to look out for.</v>

373
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not necessarily to say the</v>

374
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:50.300
<v Speaker 1>devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They help a lot of people,</v>

375
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>but we have to be very careful about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're putting in our bodies that</v>

376
00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>our doctors give us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't just say,</v>

377
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor said it's fine and just take</v>

378
00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:59.000
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I got addicted to</v>

379
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.890
<v Speaker 1>opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people want to say,</v>

380
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll get it on instagram all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Bro,</v>

381
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 1>it's your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

382
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:06.350
<v Speaker 1>It's all your fault and they know</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing about addiction.</v>

383
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not anybody's fault.</v>

384
00:16:08.661 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 1>These things happen because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive,</v>

385
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these drugs were designed to make you</v>

386
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:14.120
<v Speaker 1>addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to say,</v>

387
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:16.130
<v Speaker 1>it's my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of ridiculous because the drug</v>

388
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 1>was actually designed so people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooked on it.</v>

389
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just didn't outrun it.</v>

390
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.620
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not run it.</v>

391
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

392
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like some people out run it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from it.</v>

393
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.560
<v Speaker 1>You should have been stronger brew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

394
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Speaker 1>How many people have to get fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted before you recognize that it's</v>

395
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 1>a problem instead of the giant problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country?</v>

396
00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:37.100
<v Speaker 1>We lose a person to addiction every 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes in this country.</v>

397
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Accidental overdoses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've said that several times on</v>

398
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 1>your show and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say it enough.</v>

399
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this giant opiod epidemic and we</v>

400
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 1>have something here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our film,</v>

402
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to make a documentary</v>

403
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:52.000
<v Speaker 1>about this and in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 1>we show a guy who has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a,</v>

405
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 1>not a huge habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but six vicodin a day habit and he cuts</v>

406
00:16:58.161 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 1>that down to zero using Kratom and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched that,</v>

407
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that process because I feel like that's</v>

408
00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 1>important to show that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

409
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 1>you can actually do this now if we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are really,</v>

410
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 1>really addicted to heroin and really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really addicted to these other drugs,</v>

411
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>they might need something like suboxone.</v>

412
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And then Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 1>like we don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know.</v>

414
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Kelly done,</v>

415
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.740
<v Speaker 1>who owns the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>urban ice that we were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking to,</v>

417
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 1>he actually bought a farm up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington and it's his intent if people</v>

418
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:28.130
<v Speaker 1>don't have money to go to rehab or do</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they can come up and visit him,</v>

419
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get Kratom he's actually a licensed</v>

420
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 1>therapists and all that stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

421
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this grassroots movement to um,</v>

422
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.040
<v Speaker 1>to try to get people to even try Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've been trying to do is</v>

423
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:43.681
<v Speaker 1>get people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

424
00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just try it.</v>

425
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you said with marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more people that try it,</v>

426
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:49.750
<v Speaker 1>the better off we'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really feel that with Kratom to</v>

427
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 1>making me want to try it now.</v>

428
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.400
<v Speaker 1>What is the name up Kratom plant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does the plant look like?</v>

429
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of looks like,</v>

430
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a poison ivy plant.</v>

431
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he can maybe pull one up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

432
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.010
<v Speaker 1>but it basically just looks like just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any other plant,</v>

433
00:18:06.011 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 1>shiny green leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think I even heard about it</v>

434
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 1>until maybe a couple of years ago and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know how to pronounce it until a</v>

435
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 1>month ago while people say Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom,</v>

436
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.520
<v Speaker 1>tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomato,</v>

437
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:15.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

438
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've rarely heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think someone gave me some after a</v>

439
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:20.110
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day I'm more wrong,</v>

440
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that looks like or it goes,</v>

441
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.600
<v Speaker 1>it kind of happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody will say,</v>

442
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 1>hey here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try this,</v>

443
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:27.110
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never trust that either,</v>

444
00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 1>but for me what happened to me is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

445
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of friends in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

446
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 1>in this world of fitness and whatever.</v>

447
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And so I just ended up talking to a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that try a lot of different</v>

448
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after I got done with the opiates,</v>

449
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I was on Dr drew show and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you should try advil and tylenol</v>

450
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>and combination that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than an opiate for your pain,</v>

451
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.650
<v Speaker 1>for your chronic pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

452
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started trying that.</v>

453
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Then I get a phone call from my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's lives in England who tells me he</v>

454
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:57.330
<v Speaker 1>just had a kidney transplant because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the insights he was taken.</v>

455
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.840
<v Speaker 1>So now he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatories which</v>

456
00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:02.070
<v Speaker 1>are advil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

457
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advil and tylenol.</v>

458
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.160
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had a kidney transplant.</v>

459
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:08.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that that was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily happen to me,</v>

461
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but I was taking like 10 advil a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.113
<v Speaker 1>that could happen.</v>

463
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Then how many will your friend tig?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said about 20 and he was in new</v>

464
00:19:16.401 --> 00:19:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Bain addict before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he doesn't know if it's a new Bain.</v>

465
00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blah,</v>

466
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.621
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

467
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:21.150
<v Speaker 1>So you're getting all these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought like,</v>

468
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking 10 advil and tylenol a day</v>

469
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 1>because I was taking them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination.</v>

470
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.150
<v Speaker 1>That just can't be good for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

471
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.700
<v Speaker 1>So my friend Kelly hit me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

472
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:31.130
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should try this plant.</v>

473
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.020
<v Speaker 1>It might help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was your first experience with.</v>

474
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 1>My first experience was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my friend Kelly was a very serious</v>

475
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:41.010
<v Speaker 1>about this and he wants to help a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

476
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.160
<v Speaker 1>He said I'll fly to Sacramento.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living up by my brother at the</v>

477
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:46.650
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he flew out to Sacramento to see me.</v>

478
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 1>He gave me some Kratom.</v>

479
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 1>He went to his hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to my house.</v>

480
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I had just been filming with my brother</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like five hours straight.</v>

481
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.840
<v Speaker 1>And my arthritis was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at its worst point,</v>

482
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.650
<v Speaker 1>like the worst it could possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that from standing?</v>

483
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Standing up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get beat up,</v>

485
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm also standing on concrete floors</v>

486
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:05.200
<v Speaker 1>and gyms and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was just like,</v>

487
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.430
<v Speaker 1>beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took the Kratom and then he came over</v>

488
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.050
<v Speaker 1>later that day to talk to me and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

489
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm in.</v>

490
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel any pain right now.</v>

491
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:17.370
<v Speaker 1>No pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it took a good two or three months</v>

492
00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 1>for me to really get into it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I might tell you now and you might</v>

493
00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:21.990
<v Speaker 1>go home and try this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

494
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody say,</v>

495
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:23.431
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

496
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work,</v>

497
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 1>but then for some reason you'll go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it and then he'd go back to it and go</v>

498
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 1>back to it and all of a sudden like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a miracle.</v>

499
00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>

500
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it was for me.</v>

501
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that's how it's gonna be</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.</v>

502
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in any pain,</v>

503
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.640
<v Speaker 1>so if I took it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just to get fucked up.</v>

504
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevate your mood to elevate my mood.</v>

505
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty happy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get more elevated.</v>

506
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll do something silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

507
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:45.940
<v Speaker 1>you might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know,</v>

508
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 1>but also helps with that lowers your</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood pressure.</v>

509
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 3>It helps with anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

510
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:49.601
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

511
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:49.961
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

512
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can look at it for several health</v>

513
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:54.040
<v Speaker 3>band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't get you to a point where</v>

514
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 3>you can't drive or you don't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>type.</v>

515
00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 3>I should probably get responsible and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say it hasn't gotten me to that point.</v>

516
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 3>Hasn't gotten you to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have.</v>

517
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I have taken too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

518
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.520
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me one of them packets and tell me</v>

519
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.170
<v Speaker 3>like how much you're supposed to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

520
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.160
<v Speaker 3>if it's all gonna be relative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

521
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 3>You would take one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you weight?</v>

522
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.890
<v Speaker 3>One Ninety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200?</v>

523
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the range of 200,</v>

524
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.960
<v Speaker 3>so 200.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I take six of them that I worked up</v>

525
00:21:19.961 --> 00:21:21.720
<v Speaker 3>to six of them pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

526
00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I would say this is a packet of pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

527
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.340
<v Speaker 3>Now now crate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a lot of times it's taken in a</v>

528
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 3>powder form but it tastes disgusting so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't handle the powder so I just take</v>

529
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 3>the capsules.</v>

530
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody gave me an a powder form and</v>

531
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin.</v>

532
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to hear something really</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

533
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to speak at an AA meeting</v>

534
00:21:40.301 --> 00:21:43.240
<v Speaker 3>the other day and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a phone call from,</v>

535
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 3>from somebody at the AA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I took some right now.</v>

536
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:47.310
<v Speaker 3>How much should I take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take two.</v>

537
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

538
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:49.954
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

539
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to speak at an AA meeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got a phone call from a good</v>

540
00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:55.660
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

541
00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm confused now because I'm not sure if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sober.</v>

542
00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're taking Kratom I'm taking</v>

543
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Kratom and it affects your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I need to worry that you're</v>

544
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:06.370
<v Speaker 3>fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're worried that I'm fucking up and</v>

545
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:06.881
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

546
00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:09.460
<v Speaker 3>it actually hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it hurt.</v>

547
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.130
<v Speaker 3>It hurt to hear that from somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 3>like helped me get sober.</v>

548
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 3>It really hurt my feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

549
00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to sound like a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like hurt my feelings to hear like,</v>

550
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not sober from people.</v>

551
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:21.190
<v Speaker 3>I really looked up to him and I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand their worry.</v>

552
00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There I,</v>

553
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 3>it's so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like you're doing a heroin</v>

554
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:26.210
<v Speaker 3>substitute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

555
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Natural heroin substance and it's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>called,</v>

556
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>herbal heroin.</v>

557
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:31.810
<v Speaker 3>So I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see their concern.</v>

558
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.440
<v Speaker 3>So is that maybe the same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>concern that led the dea to take a close</v>

559
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:37.900
<v Speaker 3>look at this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I mean if you look at it,</v>

560
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone wants to worry that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dea is in bed with big Pharma and it's</v>

561
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:45.610
<v Speaker 3>all about business and they're really</v>
<v Speaker 3>here to screw over the American people.</v>

562
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Keep these legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural things away from us.</v>

563
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.560
<v Speaker 3>But I had the same sort of reservations.</v>

564
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know until you came in here</v>

565
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that you could operate</v>

566
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 3>cars on it and it doesn't fuck with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you take it before a drive.</v>

567
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I would've never imagined that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do want to stay in the area,</v>

568
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.460
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to be here and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>irresponsible.</v>

569
00:23:06.461 --> 00:23:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't think every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say,</v>

570
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.890
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody should take credit.</v>

571
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

572
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I feel like I know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's safe enough to try.</v>

573
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's safe enough for anybody to,</v>

574
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 3>to try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've seen it.</v>

575
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I've seen any in thousands of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

576
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 3>that are using it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get emails everyday from people that</v>

577
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:27.610
<v Speaker 3>take Kratom because we're doing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary and you know as well,</v>

578
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:30.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I feel that media has the power to</v>

579
00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:32.260
<v Speaker 3>change your world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like what you do,</v>

580
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 3>what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually have a voice and we have a</v>

581
00:23:34.721 --> 00:23:36.880
<v Speaker 3>power that can change people's minds.</v>

582
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 3>My film bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

583
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:40.210
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely changed people's minds on</v>

584
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did,</v>

585
00:23:41.261 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 3>it changed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gave me a view into it that I'd never</v>

586
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.750
<v Speaker 3>before and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a.</v>

587
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 3>was it an hbo real sports did a whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing on steroids.</v>

588
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.063
<v Speaker 3>Real sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

589
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were essentially saying,</v>

590
00:23:56.571 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 3>where's the body's like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's talking about people dying</v>

591
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 3>from steroid overdoses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

592
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 3>it's not what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're dying from pain pills.</v>

593
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to tell you how I turned</v>
<v Speaker 3>around on marijuana.</v>

594
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Joe Rogan experience listening to</v>

595
00:24:09.831 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 3>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

596
00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:12.740
<v Speaker 3>that's why I said media is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's.</v>

597
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 3>We can change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can change things.</v>

598
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I was dead set against it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it was for losers.</v>

599
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:17.901
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

600
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan smokes pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not so bad.</v>

601
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:22.490
<v Speaker 3>So I started doing the research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I just jumped in and</v>

602
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:24.980
<v Speaker 3>started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've done the research and I know</v>

603
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:25.990
<v Speaker 3>enough that it's.</v>

604
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.750
<v Speaker 3>That it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

605
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 3>we know it's 100 percent safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

606
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you could definitely take too much of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

607
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Just like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take too much kratom.</v>

608
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.230
<v Speaker 3>You can get too fucking high and freak</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

609
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if just get a little bit high,</v>

610
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.940
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ma.</v>

611
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Marijuana and Kratom or both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're both miracle plants.</v>

612
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 3>They're both plants that are put here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

613
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you believe in God,</v>

614
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

615
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 3>these things were put here on the planet</v>
<v Speaker 3>for us to use,</v>

616
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.380
<v Speaker 3>to heal ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to feel better.</v>

617
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.000
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

618
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 3>I think we have a big aversion in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country to people being able to feel</v>

619
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:57.440
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anything,</v>

620
00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:58.503
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

621
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 3>taking Kratom I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you feel better.</v>

622
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Like why is that a crime?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be fine.</v>

623
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:03.141
<v Speaker 3>And she'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

624
00:25:03.141 --> 00:25:05.480
<v Speaker 3>we have alcohol on the market that makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>people feel better.</v>

625
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.900
<v Speaker 3>We have cigarettes and tobacco and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes people feel better and they get a</v>

626
00:25:08.901 --> 00:25:11.990
<v Speaker 3>little buzz from it or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not Kratom like what's the big deal?</v>

627
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a reluctance to indulgence in</v>

628
00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 3>some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

629
00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Like we're worried about indulging in</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

630
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 3>something pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's bad for you.</v>

631
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

632
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.101
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kratom,</v>

633
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:23.870
<v Speaker 3>I heard that makes you high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

634
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:25.450
<v Speaker 3>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would it be wrong?</v>

635
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.240
<v Speaker 3>What would be so bad with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good feeling for a lot of</v>

636
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:29.990
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

637
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't see that that's so bad to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of euphoria,</v>

638
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now being high on cocaine or crack or</v>

639
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a completely different story.</v>

640
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking about like a little</v>

641
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 3>elevation in your mood.</v>

642
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference between being</v>

643
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 3>high and being impaired short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

644
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 3>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put those two together and they're</v>

645
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:52.760
<v Speaker 3>always in the same category for some</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange reason and they don't</v>

646
00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:56.420
<v Speaker 3>necessarily have to be like a nice cup</v>
<v Speaker 3>of coffee gets you high.</v>

647
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made it.</v>

648
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drink a cup of coffee in the morning</v>

649
00:25:59.131 --> 00:26:02.240
<v Speaker 3>and I start slap my hands together and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to start doing shit.</v>

650
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I drank that little caveman coffee,</v>

651
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.690
<v Speaker 3>sure I'd be bouncing off the walls</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's so strong and it's.</v>

652
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

653
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:12.440
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it should be legal and I think</v>

654
00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 3>that you know of Kratom is in the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>league as coffee and starbucks is the</v>

655
00:26:16.851 --> 00:26:18.620
<v Speaker 3>biggest business in our country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>

656
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Why is it so bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So since the people like people that are</v>

657
00:26:22.491 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 3>sober and then are helping you with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

658
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:26.980
<v Speaker 3>they have concerns about it and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that are going to.</v>

659
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.410
<v Speaker 3>It seems like this is a drug or a plant</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say,</v>

660
00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.310
<v Speaker 3>that just does not have enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough data,</v>

661
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.140
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not enough research.</v>

662
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would like,</v>

663
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:38.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

664
00:26:38.331 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 3>every time there's been an epidemic in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country,</v>

665
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.290
<v Speaker 3>we had a polio outbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

666
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 3>And our president was affected by it.</v>

667
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So what did we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We decided,</v>

668
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:47.280
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more polio.</v>

669
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's fix the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why the government doesn't</v>

670
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:50.851
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

671
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 1>we're losing a person every 19 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is way more serious than polio.</v>

672
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Why are we not putting funding into</v>
<v Speaker 1>researching things like Kratom?</v>

673
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 1>There's other things that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom to why aren't we researching</v>

674
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.240
<v Speaker 1>these things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another plant called Aka Uma and</v>

675
00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 1>other plant called soursop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's several plants that are,</v>

676
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.300
<v Speaker 1>that are like Kratom and do they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar things?</v>

677
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we study those to stop the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths,</v>

678
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.510
<v Speaker 1>to like slow it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:27:15.511 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a dent and the deaths from opiod</v>

680
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why the government</v>

681
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:21.840
<v Speaker 1>can't fund that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

682
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 1>What are these other plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aka Uma and what was the other one?</v>

683
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.730
<v Speaker 1>One's called Aka Uma and one's called</v>
<v Speaker 1>soursop.</v>

684
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:30.180
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why even know about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because what happens as soon as</v>

685
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 1>something gets banned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look for the next thing,</v>

686
00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.483
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

687
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're a step ahead.</v>

688
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what those things do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know we like as soon as,</v>

689
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom was band,</v>

690
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:41.740
<v Speaker 1>we were on the Internet looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

691
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is like it because I don't</v>

692
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:45.690
<v Speaker 1>want to have to deal without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

693
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it was you that tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and um,</v>

694
00:27:47.901 --> 00:27:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I might retweet it or just read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you tweeted something about someone</v>

695
00:27:52.201 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 1>getting arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some big drug bust where they</v>

696
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:57.720
<v Speaker 1>busted him for Creighton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't even illegal.</v>

697
00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that,</v>

698
00:27:58.681 --> 00:28:01.140
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a guy I think,</v>

699
00:28:01.141 --> 00:28:02.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe because that,</v>

700
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.200
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's neighbor has had it out for</v>

701
00:28:04.201 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sorta like had it out for them and</v>

702
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 1>they saw these big green bags of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought was drugs at his house and</v>

703
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:11.700
<v Speaker 1>the cops went to write it and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

704
00:28:11.701 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not sure what this is,</v>

705
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to have to arrest you.</v>

706
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

707
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:18.720
<v Speaker 1>It took causes like a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty weird problem.</v>

708
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:21.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing was when they made it illegal,</v>

709
00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I had two giant boxes of Kratom sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my garage and all I could think about</v>

710
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.281
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

711
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 1>the cops are going to come here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to bust me because they</v>

712
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 1>know I'm doing a documentary about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be,</v>

713
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mark man.</v>

714
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.800
<v Speaker 1>But I decided that like no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

715
00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I was going to keep those boxes in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>garage and I wasn't gonna worry about it</v>

716
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:40.800
<v Speaker 1>because I figured like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to come arrest me?</v>

717
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how stupid that would look because</v>

718
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 1>that's all going into the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really have a fear that other</v>

719
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:49.680
<v Speaker 1>people have because I feel like I put</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything on camera and put everything</v>

720
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.000
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

721
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.240
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

722
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is serious,</v>

723
00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:56.370
<v Speaker 1>like the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vet I was talking about,</v>

724
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.580
<v Speaker 1>he can't live without Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do?</v>

725
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Take it away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do in the meantime?</v>

726
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:01.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

727
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:03.660
<v Speaker 1>if we ban it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

728
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.300
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do with that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

729
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Like where's she going to go back on</v>
<v Speaker 1>opiates to the VA hospital.</v>

730
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Like it's fuck what a weird situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we really need you.</v>

731
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Chris Documentary is actually important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

732
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:19.890
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>

733
00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:24.720
<v Speaker 1>It's very important because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just about Kratom is about how the Dea</v>

734
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.780
<v Speaker 1>and the FDA protect the interest of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal government and they keep the</v>

735
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 1>money all in the pool to themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want anybody else in.</v>

736
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like it's just greed.</v>

737
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.120
<v Speaker 1>It's total greed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

738
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Has nothing to do with it being</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

739
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're definitely more aware of that kind</v>

740
00:29:40.801 --> 00:29:45.490
<v Speaker 1>of and those kinds of compromises where</v>
<v Speaker 1>these companies compromise various</v>

741
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 1>branches of the government for their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal interest.</v>

742
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And this Kratom is a perfect example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because so many people including me</v>

743
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 1>know almost nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird one.</v>

744
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:59.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one where they almost got in</v>

745
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.870
<v Speaker 1>like before people could understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

746
00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 1>what exactly it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is rare in 2016.</v>

747
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 1>There's something like that available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never had anything like this.</v>

748
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:11.020
<v Speaker 1>The Dea has never seen a reply like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

749
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:14.290
<v Speaker 1>There was 100,000 people that signed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>petition,</v>

750
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 1>but one thing that I need to get out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to everybody,</v>

751
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.260
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one way we can keep this legal and</v>

752
00:30:20.261 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 1>keep other things legal as well is</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody needs to go to a website that</v>

753
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:24.940
<v Speaker 1>the dea is set up.</v>

754
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It's called Kratom comments.org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just Kra tlm comments.org.</v>

755
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.500
<v Speaker 1>You can go there and you can leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

756
00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 1>up to 5,000 word message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about Kratom and it doesn't</v>

757
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:40.060
<v Speaker 1>have to be from somebody who takes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could just be like,</v>

758
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this should,</v>

759
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast and I,</v>

760
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I really feel this needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>researched more and you know,</v>

761
00:30:45.871 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you feel needs to be said.</v>

762
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You can just say it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

763
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:54.910
<v Speaker 1>like I went on and I left a comment</v>
<v Speaker 1>about why I use it and what I like about</v>

764
00:30:54.911 --> 00:30:58.300
<v Speaker 1>it and I feel like everybody that does</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to do that or they're not doing</v>

765
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 1>their job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that put that back up</v>

766
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:00.911
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

767
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:02.470
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says December 20,</v>

768
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 1>first December,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first deadline.</v>

769
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Submit your comments now what is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadline?</v>

770
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:07.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

771
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was a pain in the ass and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept texting you because I was like,</v>

772
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:13.150
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we get on before this deadline?</v>

773
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important that people know</v>

774
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 1>that there's a deadline for these</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments and it's in a couple days.</v>

775
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 1>It's December first and if you make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment by December first,</v>

776
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 1>the dea has to read it like they have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

777
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.580
<v Speaker 1>So even if you write a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jibberish they have to read it,</v>

778
00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of funny now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't,</v>

779
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 1>don't do that though folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go,</v>

780
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.010
<v Speaker 1>he's on Kratom and Kenny can't spell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

781
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.860
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to look at all of them.</v>

782
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 1>So if we can get 10,000 comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's maybe half that right</v>

783
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:41.260
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your show is so powerful.</v>

784
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 1>If we can get 10,000 comments then this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to stay legal.</v>

785
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was supposed to be scheduled one.</v>

786
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.920
<v Speaker 1>They had a plan to make a schedule one a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while ago.</v>

787
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dea only has one option.</v>

788
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.380
<v Speaker 1>The only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The DEA has an emergency scheduling.</v>

789
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.360
<v Speaker 1>So there was a drug called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of flocker?</v>

790
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.710
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie can you look up Flocka Fla kkr</v>

791
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 1>because you have to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flocka was a drug in Florida where</v>

792
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:07.760
<v Speaker 1>everybody was going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like smashing shit and like</v>

793
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.530
<v Speaker 1>they were like smashing through their</v>
<v Speaker 1>car windows and jumping on cars and they</v>

794
00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:15.610
<v Speaker 1>were like zombies and that got banned</v>
<v Speaker 1>like immediately and nobody.</v>

795
00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.560
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was nobody that stuck up know</v>

796
00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:20.880
<v Speaker 1>produce killer drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

797
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Well that was something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you made him crazy.</v>

798
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:23.884
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

799
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Well you see like what some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do like paypal,</v>

800
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 1>God that goes on there on Flakka is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>real?</v>

801
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.600
<v Speaker 1>But see what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

802
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a synthetic drug,</v>

803
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.940
<v Speaker 1>so I think Kratom gets lumped in with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these synthetic drugs like spice and</v>

804
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Flocka that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this guy jumps into the back of</v>

805
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

806
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

807
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck this is someone on</v>

808
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Flocka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

809
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like that movie it goes flying</v>

810
00:32:55.581 --> 00:32:58.010
<v Speaker 1>off the car back into the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

811
00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.413
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

812
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.950
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I not getting this guy smashing?</v>

813
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.220
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

814
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 1>that's like the most entertaining video</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen.</v>

815
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 1>So even if it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it,</v>

816
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:15.230
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was a drug that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling in head shops down in Florida</v>

817
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.400
<v Speaker 1>and it got banned within like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

818
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.530
<v Speaker 1>a couple months of it being always</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Florida guys always handled</v>

819
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gateway to demonic possession.</v>

820
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that seems like that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am legend.</v>

821
00:33:28.401 --> 00:33:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll fucking crazy things from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the will smith movie monsters.</v>

822
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy jumped on this guy's hood</v>

823
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:35.930
<v Speaker 1>and he's trying to shake them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happened?</v>

824
00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:37.520
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that when we sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

825
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they sell in,</v>

826
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 1>in head shops like old spice members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spice was a synthetic marijuana.</v>

827
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.920
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

828
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:47.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they're unregulated.</v>

829
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody know that spice just came on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the market.</v>

830
00:33:49.521 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 1>There was no regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were selling in head shops.</v>

831
00:33:51.981 --> 00:33:54.590
<v Speaker 1>They were getting away for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody puts this stuff on the</v>

832
00:33:54.591 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 1>market to get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when Kratom was put it on the</v>

833
00:33:57.021 --> 00:33:58.820
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't put on the market to get away</v>

834
00:33:58.821 --> 00:33:59.730
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

835
00:33:59.731 --> 00:34:01.010
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been in like,</v>

836
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:04.670
<v Speaker 1>the problem is like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a law in America called the act.</v>

837
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a to Shay is basically the dietary</v>

838
00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:10.490
<v Speaker 1>supplement health something act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

839
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.190
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically what it does is anything</v>

840
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that was on the market before 1994 gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfathered in and is illegal</v>

841
00:34:18.711 --> 00:34:20.450
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like even if they didn't do the</v>

842
00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:24.860
<v Speaker 1>research on it or whatever before 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that Orrin hatch</v>

843
00:34:24.861 --> 00:34:27.470
<v Speaker 1>put in place to kind of keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement industry,</v>

844
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:28.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helped to supplement companies.</v>

845
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help us as a consumer because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what we're getting because</v>

846
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

847
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

848
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 1>that the Shea Act says if there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement on the market before 1994,</v>

849
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:43.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it needs to stay legal and flow and</v>

850
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:46.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom has been sold in Florida.</v>

851
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.770
<v Speaker 1>They've been selling it for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

852
00:34:48.771 --> 00:34:51.740
<v Speaker 1>they've been selling it before 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm actually just trying,</v>

853
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually went to the freedom of</v>

854
00:34:53.631 --> 00:34:58.631
<v Speaker 1>Information Act and summons the records</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw in the records for importation of</v>

855
00:34:59.301 --> 00:35:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if we can prove that Kratom's been</v>

856
00:35:00.861 --> 00:35:03.320
<v Speaker 1>imported to the United States before</v>
<v Speaker 1>1994,</v>

857
00:35:03.321 --> 00:35:05.230
<v Speaker 1>we have a pretty solid case to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

858
00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gets grandfathered in just like</v>

859
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:07.910
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

860
00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 1>So we grandfathered in as a nutritional</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>

861
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.541
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

862
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're gonna make it harder</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

863
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure like if we have the proof,</v>

864
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just going at at full blast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

865
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you go out something with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you got and he,</v>

866
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 1>and you look down every avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find something.</v>

867
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like a,</v>

868
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a lawyer right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

869
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.020
<v Speaker 1>What a strange predicament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very unusual that there's</v>

870
00:35:30.021 --> 00:35:32.810
<v Speaker 1>something that's this well loved by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are taking it.</v>

871
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:35.660
<v Speaker 1>But so little is known about it by most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

872
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 1>including me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say something that's very</v>

873
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are against Kratom are</v>

874
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:42.880
<v Speaker 1>just against the fact that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know a lot about it there.</v>

875
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.890
<v Speaker 1>There's very few people that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dead set against it.</v>

876
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a congresswoman down in Florida</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's dead set against it because they</v>

877
00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 1>want to boost their election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>

878
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 1>they want people to vote for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they say,</v>

879
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took this off the street.</v>

880
00:35:57.061 --> 00:35:59.430
<v Speaker 1>We saved your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like she doesn't really know nothing</v>

881
00:35:59.431 --> 00:36:02.900
<v Speaker 1>about Kratom like to make it illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has she said about it?</v>

882
00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.733
<v Speaker 1>Does she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

883
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.520
<v Speaker 1>she told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

884
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 1>You didn't interview her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed her down in Florida and</v>

885
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 1>she told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

886
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to a mother who,</v>

887
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 1>whose baby was born addicted to Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

888
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 1>that's going to change you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

889
00:36:16.711 --> 00:36:19.740
<v Speaker 1>can you get me that mother's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>address and phone numbers so we can</v>

890
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:21.320
<v Speaker 1>contact her a?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

891
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:21.691
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

892
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:23.520
<v Speaker 1>We'll get around to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never produced that.</v>

893
00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:26.670
<v Speaker 1>We've asked them for aiming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There really was a mother who was</v>

894
00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 1>addicted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've asked three or four times and we</v>

895
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:31.980
<v Speaker 1>haven't gotten it however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however I did an interview,</v>

896
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 1>a girl in Washington dc who said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>her baby was born,</v>

897
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.630
<v Speaker 1>she was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her baby was born addicted to opiates</v>

898
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.420
<v Speaker 1>and that was a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing that she had to go</v>

899
00:36:42.421 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 1>through and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now she takes Kratom and she's fine</v>

900
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and she's not going to relapse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll be fine and her daughter ended up</v>

901
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:50.010
<v Speaker 1>being fine and stuff like that.</v>

902
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.430
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is like these opiates</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what people will be born addicted to</v>

903
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:54.871
<v Speaker 1>Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

904
00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 1>they're looking down the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking down the wrong rabbit</v>

905
00:36:57.991 --> 00:36:58.390
<v Speaker 1>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

906
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:59.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

907
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.810
<v Speaker 1>So does Kratom have any potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive side effects?</v>

908
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Is that we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell.</v>

909
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

910
00:37:07.011 --> 00:37:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you.</v>

911
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.920
<v Speaker 1>How often do you take it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take it usually every day,</v>

912
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 1>but I can give you some anecdotal</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that I went to Thailand for two</v>

913
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 1>weeks a couple months ago and I had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking Kratom for four months straight.</v>

914
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Then I had a two week in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were actually shooting a kickboxer</v>

915
00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.050
<v Speaker 1>movie and after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

916
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 1>after I got back from Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

917
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't Jonesing for Kratom like I,</v>

918
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take it for two weeks because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal there.</v>

919
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 1>So there was a reason it is illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

920
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the last,</v>

921
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.340
<v Speaker 1>like I've never been to Thailand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>last thing I want to do is show up to</v>

922
00:37:38.341 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Thailand and end up in Thai prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

923
00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:43.260
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't sound fun now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound fun at all.</v>

924
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.081
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

925
00:37:44.081 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I was like maybe maybe they don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this seriously there and maybe it's</v>

926
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:48.090
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not bringing it.</v>

927
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 1>But it is illegal over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

928
00:37:50.491 --> 00:37:51.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal in Thailand,</v>

929
00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's illegal in Thailand.</v>

930
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:54.590
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting because we</v>

931
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 1>looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what they call it.</v>

932
00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like a kind of a tie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tie name.</v>

933
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 1>But the reason why it's illegal in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand is because it was cutting into</v>

934
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:07.120
<v Speaker 1>the opium profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

935
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:11.910
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is people probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same pressure over here.</v>

936
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hills just happened in the forties,</v>

937
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.990
<v Speaker 1>1942 or three.</v>

938
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:21.380
<v Speaker 1>They a ban Kratom and they wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically kept it illegal because</v>

939
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:23.150
<v Speaker 1>it was cutting into the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people,</v>

940
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.770
<v Speaker 1>people were taking it instead of opium</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of heroin.</v>

941
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same thing that's gonna</v>

942
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 1>happen in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be different in this</v>

943
00:38:31.801 --> 00:38:33.450
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to solve a problem.</v>

944
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

945
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 1>is opium legal and Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's illegal,</v>

946
00:38:38.291 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but like I think even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like they just try to get it gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom Kratom out so that nobody was</v>

948
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:44.831
<v Speaker 1>taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

949
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the people that were profiting off of</v>

950
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 1>freedoms more illegal than opium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

951
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

952
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.610
<v Speaker 1>What a weird rabbit hole this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

953
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.241
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

954
00:38:59.241 --> 00:39:02.560
<v Speaker 1>to me the whole thing is interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I completely get the other side.</v>

955
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody taking something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unsafe.</v>

956
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to market something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsafe,</v>

957
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 1>but I don't make a dime from selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom.</v>

958
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

959
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:11.740
<v Speaker 1>You're not selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not where my income comes from.</v>

960
00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:13.170
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not going to sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

961
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not something where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

962
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I can make billions of dollars off this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just go.</v>

963
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody would have a an interest in</v>

964
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 1>not promoting something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive,</v>

965
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:25.840
<v Speaker 1>it would be a guy like you as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate knowledge of what it's like to</v>

966
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:27.600
<v Speaker 1>be addictive and under the spell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

967
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I think addiction needs to be looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a certain way though,</v>

968
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 1>where you look at addiction and you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

969
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to coffee.</v>

970
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 1>It's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

971
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:37.940
<v Speaker 1>like what is that going to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

972
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem being like people are</v>

973
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:41.890
<v Speaker 1>addicted to coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's right.</v>

974
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.590
<v Speaker 1>There really is no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addicted to coffee,</v>

975
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:46.990
<v Speaker 1>addicted to sugar will lead to problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road.</v>

976
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 1>But not a problem today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addicted to cigarettes,</v>

977
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 1>lead to problems down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not a problem today.</v>

978
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't really know.</v>

979
00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 1>There's not any long term studies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that Kratom is good in the long</v>

980
00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.460
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not any interest studies,</v>

981
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.450
<v Speaker 1>but we can go by the evidence that we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

982
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've done a lot of studies in</v>

983
00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 1>mice and all the studies and in mice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like none of the mice die,</v>

984
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the.</v>

985
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the number one opiate addiction</v>

986
00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:14.600
<v Speaker 1>study they did was at a university of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

987
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.900
<v Speaker 1>it's all miss whatever that Mississippi.</v>

988
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.430
<v Speaker 1>So Ole Miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

989
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Christopher mccurdy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that are doing the research</v>

990
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 1>and he really feels that this could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the savior for the opiod epidemic.</v>

991
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.030
<v Speaker 1>He feels that they need to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

992
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.140
<v Speaker 1>He feels they need to extract it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it stronger and that would be used</v>

993
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:35.140
<v Speaker 1>for the opiate epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I said I think there is</v>

994
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:39.220
<v Speaker 1>potential for it to be studied as both a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary supplement and as a drug,</v>

995
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 1>because if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can make something out of Kratom</v>

996
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.620
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna help a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

997
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.850
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the big.</v>

998
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't really see it as a big problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

999
00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.200
<v Speaker 1>if it could be both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1000
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.090
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let them make their money and</v>

1001
00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:53.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but keep it legal for us.</v>

1002
00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.990
<v Speaker 1>So in doing your documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you,</v>

1003
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.750
<v Speaker 1>what have you learned about the push to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to make it illegal?</v>

1004
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did it all start?</v>

1005
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.550
<v Speaker 1>It all started I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1006
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.660
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did it start?</v>

1007
00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Started?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like over the summer.</v>

1008
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I actually started doing the documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit before it.</v>

1009
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe if people she should know</v>

1010
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:12.580
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is something.</v>

1011
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:14.740
<v Speaker 1>So you were doing it just to let people</v>
<v Speaker 1>know about it.</v>

1012
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And then along the way it started to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened.</v>

1013
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.890
<v Speaker 1>He was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I started doing it going</v>

1014
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.660
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this going to be a movie or is this</v>

1015
00:41:22.661 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 1>more like an infomercial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is,</v>

1016
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.780
<v Speaker 1>what is this going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 1>like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be like an</v>

1018
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:30.010
<v Speaker 1>infomercial because I'm not selling it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making money off of it.</v>

1019
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be something that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest about what product does.</v>

1020
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 3>And so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ban and the controversy is the best</v>

1021
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 3>thing that could ever happen because now</v>
<v Speaker 3>people know about it and they're aware</v>

1022
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 3>as long as it doesn't get banned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're okay.</v>

1023
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.550
<v Speaker 3>You have a knack for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1024
00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.970
<v Speaker 3>we think about it like in prescription</v>
<v Speaker 3>thugs,</v>

1025
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:51.971
<v Speaker 3>you're making this documentary on pill</v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction and then you get hurt during</v>

1026
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 3>the middle of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started taking pills and become addicted</v>

1027
00:41:54.981 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 3>to pills during the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary on pill addiction.</v>

1028
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.030
<v Speaker 3>How many there are blessed or cursed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1029
00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1030
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.840
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might fucking manifested or</v>

1031
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:03.674
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1032
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I hope not because actually the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary is about cancer.</v>

1033
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the reason I'm doing that,</v>

1034
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 3>the reason I do all my documentaries is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

1035
00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:13.790
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have the power to change the way</v>

1036
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 3>people think and we have the power to</v>
<v Speaker 3>open up people's minds about things that</v>

1037
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 3>they might not know about well and also</v>
<v Speaker 3>explore things.</v>

1038
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 3>You're very good at exploring things in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very objective way,</v>

1039
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 3>in a very honest way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's so important in</v>

1040
00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:31.400
<v Speaker 3>today's day and age because it's so hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know where,</v>

1041
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.760
<v Speaker 3>why a person's promoting something in</v>
<v Speaker 3>one way or not promoting something in</v>

1042
00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:37.700
<v Speaker 3>another way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1043
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 3>what is the interest behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the motivation behind it?</v>

1044
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to know that there's a guy like you</v>

1045
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:45.980
<v Speaker 3>who's doing this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just completely honest and open and raw</v>

1046
00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:46.880
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

1047
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:48.320
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well thank you.</v>

1048
00:42:48.321 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like number one,</v>

1049
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 3>be being respected by somebody like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just means so much to me because,</v>

1050
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:56.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all my life I'll ever wanted to do is</v>

1051
00:42:56.721 --> 00:42:58.220
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted to prove myself.</v>

1052
00:42:58.221 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 3>I always thought I had to prove myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a kid.</v>

1053
00:43:00.231 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this or that,</v>

1054
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like these movies just kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of automatically do that for me.</v>

1055
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.120
<v Speaker 3>I think you've been like automatically</v>
<v Speaker 3>validating like everything I've tried to</v>

1056
00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:09.050
<v Speaker 3>do my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1057
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be a big feature film maker</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make Arnold Schwarzenegger movies</v>

1058
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.770
<v Speaker 3>and that couldn't be the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the furthest thing from my mind</v>

1059
00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 3>right now is to make movies that are big</v>
<v Speaker 3>action movies that are mindless.</v>

1060
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.050
<v Speaker 3>I want to make big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1061
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.070
<v Speaker 3>big documentaries that are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1062
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.480
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting as life goes on and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1063
00:43:26.481 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 3>you change and evolve and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your motivations changed.</v>

1064
00:43:30.021 --> 00:43:31.990
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recommend your movies still.</v>

1065
00:43:31.991 --> 00:43:32.880
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1066
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.840
<v Speaker 3>particularly the prescription thugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of this.</v>

1067
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Speaker 3>So many issues that have come up over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last,</v>

1068
00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like the last couple of decades</v>

1069
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:44.510
<v Speaker 3>in this country are just unprecedented</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers of people that are addicted to</v>

1070
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:46.070
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1071
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of million people</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking around completely checked out</v>

1072
00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.750
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1073
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.780
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it definitely needs to be.</v>

1074
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>

1075
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:59.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't wrap my mind around why the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government hasn't stepped in and said we</v>

1076
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:02.000
<v Speaker 3>have to fight this opioid epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're getting paid off.</v>

1077
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't the government putting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making the companies that make</v>

1078
00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 3>oxycontin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for example,</v>

1079
00:44:06.591 --> 00:44:07.880
<v Speaker 3>purdue Pharma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>purdue,</v>

1080
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Pharma admitted like we got all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people addicted.</v>

1081
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.980
<v Speaker 3>We lied to doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they admitted it and they got fined.</v>

1082
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.760
<v Speaker 3>But the fine was only like a little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of what they made you get fined</v>

1083
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:19.130
<v Speaker 3>200 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even if you get fined a billion</v>

1084
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made $8,000,000,000.</v>

1085
00:44:20.211 --> 00:44:22.520
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even feel it because you're</v>

1086
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Speaker 3>going to make another billion next year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after that actually call it the</v>

1087
00:44:25.821 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 3>price of doing business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They build into those fines into,</v>

1088
00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the product.</v>

1089
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 3>So they know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1090
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 3>we're probably going to get fined on</v>

1091
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.370
<v Speaker 1>this for 400 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just build it into the cost of the</v>

1092
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:35.941
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1093
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an insane system that we have here</v>

1094
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 1>for products that are supposed to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1095
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also this disingenuous thing that</v>

1096
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:44.880
<v Speaker 1>politicians do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretend they're looking out for the</v>

1097
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:45.720
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet,</v>

1098
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.420
<v Speaker 1>how are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you haven't heard a single</v>

1099
00:44:48.421 --> 00:44:51.060
<v Speaker 1>politician in decades?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say a word about cigarettes?</v>

1100
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Obama got into office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was smoking cigarettes,</v>

1101
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.990
<v Speaker 1>got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>

1102
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 1>that's half a million people just in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country die prematurely every year</v>

1103
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1104
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:01.021
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1105
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:03.660
<v Speaker 1>if we look at tobacco and we look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with tobacco,</v>

1106
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.680
<v Speaker 1>what's the big problems with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put all these chemicals in the</v>

1107
00:45:06.681 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 1>tobacco and if they could just pan that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

1108
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think actual natural tobacco is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bad for you?</v>

1109
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people are dying from cigars?</v>

1110
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot.</v>

1111
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:16.681
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that I know.</v>

1112
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it's abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you get crazy with it,</v>

1113
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:21.690
<v Speaker 1>but that's kinda like wine and the wine</v>
<v Speaker 1>is great.</v>

1114
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:24.120
<v Speaker 1>But if you drink wine like four or five</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottles a day,</v>

1115
00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.450
<v Speaker 1>you're going to kill your liver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1116
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just like so many things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>

1117
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 1>like wine and wine feels like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Kratom has this sort of self</v>

1118
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:33.900
<v Speaker 1>limiting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like wine.</v>

1119
00:45:33.901 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 1>You could drink too much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it feels so shitty and it's like</v>

1120
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Kratom is kind of the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as you take too much of it,</v>

1121
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you'll just feel so crappy that year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to know never to do that</v>

1122
00:45:44.251 --> 00:45:45.290
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does it do?</v>

1123
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.650
<v Speaker 1>How does it make you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crappy,</v>

1124
00:45:46.651 --> 00:45:49.530
<v Speaker 1>because you said yes too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just stomach aches,</v>

1125
00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.090
<v Speaker 1>nausea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1126
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I say so I guess I should,</v>

1127
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I should mentioned that.</v>

1128
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.390
<v Speaker 1>What I actually took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it was Kratom when</v>

1129
00:45:57.391 --> 00:45:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I took was a product and I'll never do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this again.</v>

1130
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:01.250
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like some extract as somebody</v>

1131
00:46:01.251 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 1>gave me and I tried it and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me sick.</v>

1132
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.240
<v Speaker 1>So it could have been way stronger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular Kratom.</v>

1133
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 1>There could have been something else in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1134
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 1>but that's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my first like,</v>

1135
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be smart about this.</v>

1136
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the packaging and a lot,</v>

1137
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big problem with Kratom is most of the</v>

1138
00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:19.800
<v Speaker 1>cranium that's on the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the only company in the entire</v>

1139
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:23.190
<v Speaker 1>country or world that packages credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a dietary supplement.</v>

1140
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Every other supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look on the back,</v>

1141
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 1>it'll say right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for human consumption.</v>

1142
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.610
<v Speaker 1>That's problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can they.</v>

1143
00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Can people buy this right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.693
<v Speaker 1>They could buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1145
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.820
<v Speaker 1>for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1146
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this company is from Vegas so that</v>

1147
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.240
<v Speaker 1>they do a lot of business in Vegas to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in health food stores in Vegas.</v>

1148
00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Explain it to people so they could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>an.</v>

1149
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you nor I have any stake in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this at all.</v>

1150
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 1>This is called urban ice urban ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>organics.</v>

1151
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.000
<v Speaker 1>They have a website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:46:48.001 --> 00:46:51.220
<v Speaker 1>They have a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's urban ice organics.com or</v>

1153
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.970
<v Speaker 1>urbanites.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure if they tell you the</v>

1154
00:46:53.971 --> 00:46:55.830
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1155
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any like head shop should have Kratom</v>

1156
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they saw a lot of this in Vegas.</v>

1157
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:03.520
<v Speaker 1>So in Vegas it's all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1158
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.490
<v Speaker 1>but you know what the other thing we</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

1159
00:47:05.491 --> 00:47:09.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like why are they making illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who owns this company made a lot</v>

1160
00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:10.680
<v Speaker 1>of money off of it and I'm sure you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1161
00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of dollars.</v>

1162
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.100
<v Speaker 1>So like when you make millions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars,</v>

1163
00:47:14.101 --> 00:47:15.390
<v Speaker 1>people want to know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>

1164
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 1>you didn't go through the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we are.</v>

1165
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Kelly and I were just talking like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process to make something a,</v>

1166
00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary supplement is a long arduous</v>

1167
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.500
<v Speaker 1>process and I feel like Kratom may need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go through that process because like</v>

1168
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.740
<v Speaker 1>we don't have enough information on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it hadn't been studied.</v>

1169
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of something that slipped</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the cracks.</v>

1170
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody really knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that popular and it's been</v>

1171
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 1>around for 2000 years and no one ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to say,</v>

1172
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a dietary supplement.</v>

1173
00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now these other ones that you were</v>

1174
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other ones when you were saying if</v>

1175
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 1>this gets illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1176
00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.050
<v Speaker 1>there's similar name those again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it against?</v>

1177
00:47:51.051 --> 00:47:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Our esop I think is one of them and Aka</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yuma,</v>

1178
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:55.840
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's Japanese or</v>

1179
00:47:55.841 --> 00:47:58.690
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Aka Uma and soursop.</v>

1180
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1181
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I've just read about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a similar effect.</v>

1182
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says.</v>

1183
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>

1184
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 1>But there haven't been as popular so</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

1185
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1186
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they're not as popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it probably not as good or</v>

1187
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:14.110
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know man.</v>

1188
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:19.230
<v Speaker 1>So what do we have isolated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the pressure to try to get</v>

1189
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:22.510
<v Speaker 1>it illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've kept trying to isolate,</v>

1191
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked to the people that are</v>

1192
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 1>against it and their congress people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are against it are grieving parents</v>

1193
00:48:31.481 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 1>that are against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1194
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:33.971
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1195
00:48:33.971 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 1>like nobody in big Pharma is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out and say,</v>

1196
00:48:35.891 --> 00:48:37.670
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make this a drug and</v>

1197
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:38.580
<v Speaker 1>screw all you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1198
00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:41.800
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to really say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really when you get into</v>

1199
00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were just in Washington for a</v>

1200
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 1>week and everything so shady and</v>
<v Speaker 1>underhanded in my mind,</v>

1201
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 1>like all these people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are working together.</v>

1202
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.740
<v Speaker 1>They're all in cahoots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1203
00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:53.800
<v Speaker 1>like everything's in everything seemed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>

1204
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>

1205
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.990
<v Speaker 1>the congressman that I talked to mark</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pocan from Wisconsin,</v>

1206
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.410
<v Speaker 1>a marijuana and create them or both</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal there and he's kind of fighting</v>

1207
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 1>for it to be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

1208
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the only congress people I</v>
<v Speaker 1>met that was willing to go to bat for</v>

1209
00:49:07.691 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we need more congress people</v>

1210
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are looking out for the citizens.</v>

1211
00:49:13.181 --> 00:49:15.610
<v Speaker 1>So there are state laws against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1212
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.730
<v Speaker 1>there's six states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that I've Ban Kratom.</v>

1213
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I think they're Wisconsin's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1214
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama,</v>

1215
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 1>and I'll remember the rest of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a couple of states where</v>

1216
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 1>it's band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do they cite when they say</v>

1217
00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's deaths,</v>

1218
00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.630
<v Speaker 1>deaths and danger and kids taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1219
00:49:34.631 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 1>everything's about protecting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>children and saving the children.</v>

1220
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:39.880
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of the people in the Kratom</v>

1221
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.713
<v Speaker 1>Industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never said like,</v>

1222
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's age restrict this,</v>

1223
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.150
<v Speaker 1>let's make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1224
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.410
<v Speaker 1>21 and over 18 and over are 25 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>

1225
00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:47.253
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1226
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want to do.</v>

1227
00:49:48.881 --> 00:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Like no one's even the FDA has never</v>
<v Speaker 1>even come and taught like it's</v>

1228
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:55.240
<v Speaker 1>impossible and this is the big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to talk to the FDA or</v>

1229
00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:56.850
<v Speaker 1>dea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just spoke to the,</v>

1230
00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:01.900
<v Speaker 1>the spokesman for the dea last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Melvin Patterson and I said,</v>

1231
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.570
<v Speaker 1>hey Mr Patterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would really like to come down and do</v>

1232
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 1>an interview with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1233
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry we don't do that and I want to say</v>

1234
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:11.150
<v Speaker 1>about you work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

1235
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 1>we pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pay their salaries.</v>

1236
00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I know people here that will done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I think there just needs to be</v>

1237
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:19.360
<v Speaker 1>more transparency 100 percent in the dea</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the FDA.</v>

1238
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:22.090
<v Speaker 1>You can't find out the FDA's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>

1239
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't find out anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1240
00:50:24.011 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Like when you try to do research on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to find out,</v>

1241
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's doing what or whatever,</v>

1242
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.880
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of transparency</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why documentary film makers</v>

1243
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 3>like me have to use like the freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of Information Act where if we</v>

1244
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:38.350
<v Speaker 3>request something from the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1245
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 3>they have to give it to us and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that really helps us.</v>

1246
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 3>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about what a rabbit hole</v>

1247
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:45.950
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a weird rabbit hole for you</v>

1248
00:50:45.951 --> 00:50:47.650
<v Speaker 3>to have started this out as something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1249
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're finding this plant to be</v>

1250
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:51.050
<v Speaker 3>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see all these people that are</v>

1251
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 3>benefiting from it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1252
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.590
<v Speaker 3>this is a great subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to let the world know about it.</v>

1253
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:56.860
<v Speaker 3>And then as you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's theirs.</v>

1254
00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 3>You start feeling this dark push for it</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be scheduled one and,</v>

1255
00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:03.500
<v Speaker 3>and just start making illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that journey been like?</v>

1256
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm weird.</v>

1257
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:09.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm scary a little bit because</v>

1258
00:51:09.291 --> 00:51:11.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started this thing and I thought it</v>

1259
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:13.640
<v Speaker 3>was just going to go down to two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1260
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:16.640
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were going to maybe make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it illegal and then you know,</v>

1261
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:18.450
<v Speaker 3>maybe we have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

1262
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.330
<v Speaker 3>once you make something a schedule one</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug,</v>

1263
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:22.060
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ask The people matter.</v>

1264
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.110
<v Speaker 3>The marijuana people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to take it off the</v>

1265
00:51:24.111 --> 00:51:25.280
<v Speaker 3>schedule one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1266
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 3>it can happen but it's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that the idea is not to get</v>

1267
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 3>it there in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was talking about the dea</v>

1268
00:51:31.611 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 3>removing marijuana from schedule one</v>
<v Speaker 3>this summer and they backed out of it.</v>

1269
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:37.940
<v Speaker 3>They were just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read some more about that today.</v>

1270
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:39.700
<v Speaker 3>That's still kind of up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1271
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Well they got close to it and they said</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to reconsider it and</v>

1272
00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 3>apparently a lot of people were very</v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful.</v>

1273
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.220
<v Speaker 3>They thought this is gonna be at</v>
<v Speaker 3>scheduled ones.</v>

1274
00:51:46.221 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No medicinal value.</v>

1275
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean they've shown marijuana to cure</v>
<v Speaker 3>some forms of cancer to say there's no</v>

1276
00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:55.100
<v Speaker 3>medicinal value for it is completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

1277
00:51:55.101 --> 00:52:00.101
<v Speaker 3>We need to start dumping our money into</v>
<v Speaker 3>researching these plants because like</v>

1278
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.410
<v Speaker 3>how like look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have these Pharma companies and I</v>

1279
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:05.960
<v Speaker 3>don't know if you've seen this shell on</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery where they show you how they</v>

1280
00:52:05.961 --> 00:52:08.600
<v Speaker 3>come up with new drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They basically take like there's a</v>

1281
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:11.870
<v Speaker 3>machine and it's like this fucking robot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it takes like every fucking</v>

1282
00:52:11.871 --> 00:52:16.700
<v Speaker 3>substance in the world and combines it</v>
<v Speaker 3>until like it makes millions and</v>

1283
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 3>millions of different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of fucking like things,</v>

1284
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of drugs and then they</v>

1285
00:52:22.731 --> 00:52:25.730
<v Speaker 3>start testing it on like every different</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease to see if it works.</v>

1286
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:28.250
<v Speaker 3>So it's like it's like shooting in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark.</v>

1287
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like they have no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're like there's a machine that</v>

1288
00:52:31.361 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 3>will just make a drug and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out if it works on something</v>

1289
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.130
<v Speaker 3>rather than like we already know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kratom works for this,</v>

1290
00:52:37.131 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 3>this and this and we already know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana works for this,</v>

1291
00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:39.740
<v Speaker 3>this and this.</v>

1292
00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Why not put the money into studying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than the shooting in the dark,</v>

1293
00:52:42.801 --> 00:52:46.200
<v Speaker 3>making some weird combination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that?</v>

1294
00:52:46.201 --> 00:52:46.611
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1295
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to find that sounds almost like</v>

1296
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a.</v>

1297
00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.690
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1298
00:52:53.691 --> 00:52:56.770
<v Speaker 3>the like they use those algorithms to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to work the stock market.</v>

1299
00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 3>That's something similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just throwing numbers up.</v>

1300
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of them to come out</v>

1301
00:53:01.941 --> 00:53:02.721
<v Speaker 3>real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1302
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:06.170
<v Speaker 3>I know a dude who had a stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a young guy from Vioxx.</v>

1303
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.400
<v Speaker 3>That stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1304
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:10.020
<v Speaker 3>You probably know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arthritis,</v>

1305
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:11.360
<v Speaker 3>arthritis medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1306
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I know the guy in his thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the Fuck Australian.</v>

1307
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.773
<v Speaker 3>That stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1309
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.180
<v Speaker 3>that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pulled it off the market.</v>

1310
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pulled that off the market.</v>

1311
00:53:18.741 --> 00:53:23.741
<v Speaker 3>I think there was 55,000 deaths from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vioxx and Kratom zero.</v>

1312
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird marijuana.</v>

1313
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.020
<v Speaker 3>How many strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1314
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.510
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's A.</v>

1315
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:33.270
<v Speaker 3>There's a business in selling people</v>
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>

1316
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:35.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in a twisted world we live in.</v>

1317
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 3>People are going to keep that from</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's in pain is ridiculous.</v>

1318
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping that as time goes on,</v>

1319
00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 3>we're slowly starting to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is impossible for your doctor to know</v>

1320
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:48.300
<v Speaker 3>all the ramifications and repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1321
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Involved in any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any drug.</v>

1322
00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's just no way.</v>

1323
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 3>I was just on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctors with a doctor whose son was</v>

1324
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 3>taking Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he found his son was a drug addict and</v>

1325
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 3>he kind of found out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then his son said,</v>

1326
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:03.450
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get off all the heroin.</v>

1327
00:54:03.451 --> 00:54:06.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start taking Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said his son has been on Kratom</v>

1328
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:08.160
<v Speaker 3>now for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1329
00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 3>like six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been sober.</v>

1330
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:14.250
<v Speaker 3>He had been happier than he's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this doctor is 100 percent down with</v>

1331
00:54:14.251 --> 00:54:14.400
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1332
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.370
<v Speaker 3>And he was on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctors with me and he was arguing</v>

1333
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.480
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1334
00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.500
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy from a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that show intervention.</v>

1335
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.370
<v Speaker 3>One of the dudes from intervention was</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the doctors with us arguing like,</v>

1336
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:27.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get addicted to Kratom all the</v>

1337
00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:28.621
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1338
00:54:28.621 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a marketing guy.</v>

1339
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Like these people in Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you gotta understand.</v>

1340
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.050
<v Speaker 3>The reason why if you Google Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehabs come up is because rehabs have</v>

1341
00:54:37.051 --> 00:54:39.120
<v Speaker 3>marketing teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to get as many people</v>

1342
00:54:39.121 --> 00:54:42.360
<v Speaker 3>into the doors as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they tell you Kratom's bad and they</v>

1343
00:54:42.361 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 3>put it on their website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Narcan on is a big a rehab center.</v>

1344
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:49.500
<v Speaker 3>They're owned by scientologists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all over the Kratom thing saying</v>

1345
00:54:49.501 --> 00:54:50.130
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1346
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:51.900
<v Speaker 3>are you addicted to Kratom?</v>

1347
00:54:51.901 --> 00:54:52.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just like,</v>

1348
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.280
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the people that get addicted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>

1349
00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:56.700
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Rehab,</v>

1350
00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I've been in rehab that with people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were there for marijuana and you want to</v>

1351
00:55:00.841 --> 00:55:01.800
<v Speaker 3>just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1352
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:03.150
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you doing here?</v>

1353
00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Like number celebrity rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1355
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 3>but people do have a problem with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's okay.</v>

1356
00:55:09.301 --> 00:55:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Like you can go to rehab for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So going for Kratom is no different than</v>

1357
00:55:14.281 --> 00:55:16.300
<v Speaker 3>going for like depression or some</v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling.</v>

1358
00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.180
<v Speaker 3>You have to go to rehab for gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't,</v>

1359
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:20.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why they're marketing it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1360
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of sadistic in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're looking for people that are</v>

1361
00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:25.350
<v Speaker 3>on Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that to,</v>

1362
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if.</v>

1363
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know why they.</v>

1364
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Well they don't have any personal</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience with it.</v>

1365
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're not as nefarious as we</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it is.</v>

1366
00:55:32.911 --> 00:55:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they just ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1367
00:55:34.171 --> 00:55:35.760
<v Speaker 3>And the and the good rehabs aren't doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1368
00:55:35.761 --> 00:55:37.950
<v Speaker 3>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I went cliffside Malibu,</v>

1369
00:55:37.951 --> 00:55:40.590
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a Kratom thing on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>website because there are legitimate</v>

1370
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.873
<v Speaker 3>rehab center.</v>

1371
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:45.870
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about celebrity rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when Eric Roberts was on.</v>

1372
00:55:45.871 --> 00:55:49.470
<v Speaker 3>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else has shaken throwing up</v>

1373
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:51.120
<v Speaker 3>and sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric Roberts sitting there with a</v>

1374
00:55:51.121 --> 00:55:53.940
<v Speaker 3>newspaper or a cup of Costco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get slippers on.</v>

1375
00:55:53.941 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 3>He was just in there for pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1376
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no withdrawal.</v>

1377
00:55:57.811 --> 00:55:59.350
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1378
00:55:59.351 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 3>they go with what does it feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1379
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I feel fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1380
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:06.780
<v Speaker 3>I just don't have weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the problem with when you tell</v>

1381
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:09.030
<v Speaker 3>somebody that they have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start thinking,</v>

1382
00:56:09.031 --> 00:56:10.170
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem.</v>

1383
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:13.740
<v Speaker 3>If you ever had a cop behind you and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>never did anything.</v>

1384
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.370
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're like looking at both hands on</v>

1385
00:56:16.371 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 3>the wheel and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like it has my license.</v>

1386
00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.510
<v Speaker 3>My license is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pay my insurance,</v>

1387
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a gun in his.</v>

1388
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Why am I afraid of</v>

1389
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.480
<v Speaker 2>fucking freaking out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I speeding?</v>

1390
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Not going the speed limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile there's something.</v>

1391
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:30.040
<v Speaker 2>If someone tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1392
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.380
<v Speaker 2>you've got a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a problem,</v>

1393
00:56:32.381 --> 00:56:34.210
<v Speaker 2>you might not think you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got a problem.</v>

1394
00:56:34.211 --> 00:56:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Like fucking got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's my problem?</v>

1395
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Your problem is Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your problem is sex,</v>

1396
00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:41.410
<v Speaker 2>or your problem is whatever the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1397
00:56:41.411 --> 00:56:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're addicted to exercise.</v>

1398
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.130
<v Speaker 2>If someone could tell you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1399
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 2>and then most of us are at least a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little insecure,</v>

1400
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.370
<v Speaker 2>almost everybody I know is at least a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little insecure and as soon as someone</v>

1401
00:56:51.371 --> 00:56:52.700
<v Speaker 2>accuses you of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all,</v>

1402
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 2>you start considering the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1403
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:55.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1404
00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes you try to hide it</v>

1405
00:56:57.141 --> 00:56:57.871
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1406
00:56:57.871 --> 00:56:58.704
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my,</v>

1407
00:56:58.770 --> 00:56:59.421
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1408
00:56:59.421 --> 00:57:00.650
<v Speaker 1>as an addict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1409
00:57:00.651 --> 00:57:01.130
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1410
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:02.630
<v Speaker 1>not now they're onto me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better really,</v>

1411
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.360
<v Speaker 1>really hide this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation one day with my</v>

1412
00:57:05.361 --> 00:57:06.800
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget it.</v>

1413
00:57:06.801 --> 00:57:08.540
<v Speaker 1>My Dad is like the nicest person in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1414
00:57:08.541 --> 00:57:10.790
<v Speaker 1>You've seen him in the movies and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1415
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out of money.</v>

1416
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my forties and I'm out of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1417
00:57:14.961 --> 00:57:16.610
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1418
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Because I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was a drug addict so my dad said</v>

1419
00:57:19.221 --> 00:57:20.840
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's wrong with you,</v>

1420
00:57:20.841 --> 00:57:23.390
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're a drug addict or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic or something,</v>

1421
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:26.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's no reason why a guy in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years old,</v>

1422
00:57:26.571 --> 00:57:28.370
<v Speaker 1>she'd be out of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1423
00:57:28.371 --> 00:57:29.570
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>

1424
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And that was that conversation that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about three months before I went to</v>

1425
00:57:34.341 --> 00:57:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like that was the conversation.</v>

1426
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:37.810
<v Speaker 1>It was that conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1427
00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it was my dad being disappointed in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like that conversation that</v>

1428
00:57:41.451 --> 00:57:44.300
<v Speaker 1>really sort of shook me to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody telling me I had a</v>

1429
00:57:44.301 --> 00:57:46.970
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of shook me to the core because</v>

1430
00:57:46.971 --> 00:57:48.830
<v Speaker 1>he yelled at me when he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never yelled at me.</v>

1431
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well sometimes that's all you need is</v>

1432
00:57:51.711 --> 00:57:53.690
<v Speaker 2>one person's opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who you really love.</v>

1433
00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boot and the asked from dad.</v>

1434
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you go shit.</v>

1435
00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.180
<v Speaker 1>And my dad's been through everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1436
00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:01.600
<v Speaker 1>he's had cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's add his half of the intestine</v>

1437
00:58:01.601 --> 00:58:04.060
<v Speaker 1>pulled out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had all these issues and they're</v>

1438
00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:06.940
<v Speaker 1>not due to drugs or alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes me feel even more guilty</v>

1439
00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.280
<v Speaker 1>because like my issues are just due to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I'm doing.</v>

1440
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1441
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except arthritis.</v>

1442
00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm feeling it now.</v>

1443
00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something's going on.</v>

1444
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Got a boner now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that happen?</v>

1445
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Probably warning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No shit man.</v>

1446
00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I wish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1447
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:24.970
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just uh,</v>

1448
00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1449
00:58:26.371 --> 00:58:27.440
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1450
00:58:27.441 --> 00:58:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not negatively affected me in any</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1451
00:58:29.871 --> 00:58:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel slow or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was assuming it was.</v>

1452
00:58:34.191 --> 00:58:35.024
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally today,</v>

1453
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:38.060
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I'm talking to you about this,</v>

1454
00:58:38.061 --> 00:58:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do no research because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally wanted to just go in with my</v>

1455
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:45.380
<v Speaker 2>ignorance so that I can question you</v>
<v Speaker 2>from ignorance.</v>

1456
00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:48.130
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to do research,</v>

1457
00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:51.040
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of biased right off the bat</v>

1458
00:58:51.041 --> 00:58:51.990
<v Speaker 1>from Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>

1459
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.790
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you search Kratom,</v>

1460
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:57.340
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times what comes up are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rehab centers that are paying to be</v>

1461
00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.300
<v Speaker 2>or let's try it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you type in Kratom band,</v>

1462
00:59:00.301 --> 00:59:02.730
<v Speaker 2>you'll get more of a across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and down,</v>

1463
00:59:02.731 --> 00:59:04.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try it with being because</v>

1464
00:59:04.701 --> 00:59:08.010
<v Speaker 2>I've been using windows so let's see if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the same thing</v>

1465
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:14.040
<v Speaker 2>mark and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big is not bad man.</v>

1466
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any problems with bang.</v>

1467
00:59:15.991 --> 00:59:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kratom read on Amazon Dot Com.</v>

1468
00:59:18.931 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 2>See they try to sell you it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I have a,</v>

1475
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.220
<v Speaker 3>my buddy Anthony Roberts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1476
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:35.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was doing bigger,</v>

1477
00:59:35.421 --> 00:59:36.101
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>

1478
00:59:36.101 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 3>it was like this dude that would always</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit me up online about stuff.</v>

1479
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 3>And he kind of knew everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I hired him to work on this movie as</v>

1480
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a researcher and a writer and he's</v>

1481
00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:46.490
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been teaching me a lot about how to</v>

1482
00:59:46.491 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 3>find stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1484
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 3>to say about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Effects of drugs.</v>

1485
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 3>So it's [inaudible] dot org.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The effects of drug abuse.</v>

1486
00:59:56.271 --> 00:59:59.540
<v Speaker 3>It says Kratom is a relatively new drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the US and Europe and has been used</v>

1487
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:03.650
<v Speaker 3>for many years in Southeast Asia as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti dye or real medicine.</v>

1488
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.870
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really,</v>

1489
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that.</v>

1490
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people.</v>

1491
01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:11.210
<v Speaker 3>So you get diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take Kratom a painkiller and a</v>

1492
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:14.900
<v Speaker 3>recreational drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kratom is the popular name for a tree</v>

1493
01:00:14.901 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Speaker 3>and the drug comes from its leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The drug may be bought in leaf form,</v>

1494
01:00:18.891 --> 01:00:22.670
<v Speaker 3>but in this country is more likely pur</v>
<v Speaker 3>purchased as a capsule with a powdered</v>

1495
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:26.640
<v Speaker 3>leaf material or chopped up in the form</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a leaf that can be used for a tea</v>

1496
01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.411
<v Speaker 3>over smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:00:27.411 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 3>This says t on it that people make</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual 10 make tea out of it.</v>

1498
01:00:30.471 --> 01:00:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it tastes terrible.</v>

1499
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:34.550
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1500
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 3>pretty bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1501
01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:40.220
<v Speaker 3>it says the effects of Kratom come on</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather quickly and last between five and</v>

1502
01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:42.800
<v Speaker 3>seven hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although high doses can last longer.</v>

1503
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:46.190
<v Speaker 3>It's heavily promoted as illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>undetectable safe drug that can be used</v>

1504
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.390
<v Speaker 3>to come off stronger drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not illegal the United States,</v>

1505
01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:55.280
<v Speaker 3>but the breakdown products of Kratom can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be detected in some drug tests.</v>

1506
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for people that work at ups or</v>

1507
01:00:57.411 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen that happen now.</v>

1508
01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:01.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's true.</v>

1509
01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:02.440
<v Speaker 3>They might be scaring you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1510
01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.910
<v Speaker 3>probably trying to get you to join.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it will show up on a drug</v>

1511
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:05.810
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an opiate.</v>

1512
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:07.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1513
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.240
<v Speaker 3>same ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says the breakdown products of Kratom</v>

1514
01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.030
<v Speaker 3>can be detected with some drug dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1515
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe some drug tests that are looking</v>

1516
01:01:15.701 --> 01:01:16.030
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1517
01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.960
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a specific drug test that looks</v>

1518
01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:19.260
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1519
01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:20.960
<v Speaker 3>that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will go in and look,</v>

1520
01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look forward just Kratom and that's what</v>

1521
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they use when somebody</v>

1522
01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:26.540
<v Speaker 3>commits suicide or whatever it makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1523
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

1524
01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.660
<v Speaker 3>is there Kratom in their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their system or whatever,</v>

1525
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's 15 deaths from Kratom at 14</v>

1526
01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:37.700
<v Speaker 3>to 15 deaths are all polypharmacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means we've taken several</v>

1527
01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 3>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of the time it's like</v>

1528
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.600
<v Speaker 3>polypharmacy.</v>

1529
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.211
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1530
01:01:41.211 --> 01:01:45.080
<v Speaker 3>they were taking Xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vicodin and Kratom and you're like,</v>

1531
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.140
<v Speaker 3>why would you blame it on the Kratom it</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like the least,</v>

1532
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.850
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1533
01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>agregious of all of them,</v>

1534
01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:52.910
<v Speaker 3>if it's only in combination with other</v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceuticals,</v>

1535
01:01:52.911 --> 01:01:54.640
<v Speaker 3>that sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1536
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:56.390
<v Speaker 3>that's like marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1537
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1538
01:01:57.981 --> 01:01:59.870
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows how many people have died on</v>

1539
01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:04.190
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and other drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny that you bring up Thailand</v>

1540
01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:06.800
<v Speaker 3>because they're using Thailand as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>example here.</v>

1541
01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:11.980
<v Speaker 3>More than 13,000 people were arrested</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Kratom related crimes in Thailand.</v>

1542
01:02:12.591 --> 01:02:14.100
<v Speaker 3>That's just because it's illegal in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand.</v>

1543
01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:16.610
<v Speaker 3>The leader of the opiod industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they conveniently ignore that,</v>

1544
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:21.910
<v Speaker 3>so the drug is abused for it's abused</v>
<v Speaker 3>for its sedative or stimulating effects,</v>

1545
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.630
<v Speaker 3>not used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says abused.</v>

1546
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Will say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is I.</v>

1547
01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that like taking a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1548
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:30.960
<v Speaker 3>I think if I took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1549
01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 3>50 pills a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll be abusing it.</v>

1550
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:36.630
<v Speaker 3>I maybe take six pills a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe at the most 10.</v>

1551
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Then you're even the term pill is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird word because what you did</v>

1552
01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:42.630
<v Speaker 3>basically taking this powder plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the term drug is a weird word.</v>

1554
01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:47.730
<v Speaker 3>If you went back and read that statement</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just read and substituted the</v>

1555
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 3>word plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't sound bad at all.</v>

1556
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.440
<v Speaker 3>The plant comes as a powder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The plant is this,</v>

1557
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:53.400
<v Speaker 3>the plant does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't sound bad,</v>

1558
01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:56.760
<v Speaker 3>but when you use the word drug of course</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit in a corner.</v>

1559
01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs such a weird word because it</v>

1560
01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.250
<v Speaker 3>covers too many different effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1561
01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 3>covers stimulants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressants.</v>

1562
01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:07.140
<v Speaker 3>So here's what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person using this drug may expect or</v>

1563
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.440
<v Speaker 3>may not expect or want the following</v>
<v Speaker 3>undesirable effects of Kratom edginess,</v>

1564

<v Speaker 3>nervousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vomiting can be severe,</v>

1565
01:03:14.611 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 3>prolonged nausea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be severe,</v>

1566
01:03:16.591 --> 01:03:18.600

1567
01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:20.220
<v Speaker 3>constipation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delusions,</v>

1568
01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:22.590
<v Speaker 3>lithology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respiratory depression,</v>

1569
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 3>tremors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive or combative behavior,</v>

1570
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:28.080
<v Speaker 3>psychotic episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinations and paranoia.</v>

1571
01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:32.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a big thing you just mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 3>that respiratory depression and has not</v>

1572
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:34.800

<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1573
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:39.310
<v Speaker 3>and that's what kills people with oxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about hallucinations to people who</v>

1578
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:51.930
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I can say that I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced are like people that feel</v>

1579
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 3>better and are in better moods.</v>

1589
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.270

<v Speaker 3>So the research these workers out in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fields that were,</v>

1592
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.500

01:04:48.571 --> 01:04:51.510
<v Speaker 3>congresspeople and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and other people that are fighting</v>

1599
01:04:51.511 --> 01:04:53.490
<v Speaker 3>against this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to use that as a fact.</v>

1600
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Here's where it gets really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Withdrawal effects of them are very</v>

1601
01:04:56.911 --> 01:05:01.911
<v Speaker 3>similar to those of opiate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like heroin or prescription painkillers.</v>

1602
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Let's hear those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the withdrawal effects.</v>

1603
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was anti-diarrhea.</v>

1604
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Make up your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1605
01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.880
<v Speaker 3>muscle pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it's good for pain.</v>

1606
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1607
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1608
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Muscle tremors or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or jerking.</v>

1609
01:05:15.631 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 3>You were saying the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1610
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:17.853
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vet</v>

1611
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>all his muscle jerking and twitching</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes away.</v>

1612
01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>They're seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a side effect.</v>

1613
01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Riff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restlessness and sleeplessness.</v>

1614
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Does it help you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1615
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

1616
01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't like really stayed up all</v>

1617
01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:31.924
<v Speaker 1>night on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1618
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let you know,</v>

1619
01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>there's adverse effects to everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could possibly ingest.</v>

1620
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's more like let's take a big group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these adverse effects and see which</v>

1621
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.990
<v Speaker 1>ones occur more often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>when people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really,</v>

1623
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:50.020
<v Speaker 1>it really hasn't been shown across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board to do all these things to</v>

1624
01:05:50.021 --> 01:05:51.080
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1625
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>So like there was one guy that was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom for three years and they said</v>

1626
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.550
<v Speaker 1>he's got to be addicted to Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to study him and we're going</v>

1627
01:05:57.551 --> 01:05:59.970
<v Speaker 1>to see what happens when we take them</v>
<v Speaker 1>off credit,</v>

1628
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he gets off Kratom.</v>

1629
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So he gets off Kratom and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to him,</v>

1630
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:05.440
<v Speaker 1>what he had a runny nose.</v>

1631
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asked Gary.</v>

1632
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 1>That was the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only,</v>

1633
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.180
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that he complained about</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like a runny nose here in large font</v>

1634
01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:18.210
<v Speaker 1>it says narcan can help the person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is addicted to Kratom in large words and</v>

1635
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:24.040
<v Speaker 1>then it goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why have you drunk has different</v>

1636
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:25.780
<v Speaker 1>effects?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

1637
01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:29.920
<v Speaker 1>The route back to sobriety is much the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same from person to person.</v>

1638
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recovery must include release relief</v>

1639
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 1>from incessant cravings and you're the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginnings of Rehab.</v>

1640
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what we said about,</v>

1641
01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.280
<v Speaker 1>we were talking actually heard your</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and you brought me up on a,</v>

1642
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>on another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1643
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.490
<v Speaker 1>on another one of your podcasts and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about time.</v>

1644
01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.220
<v Speaker 1>The amount of time it takes to get sober</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I still,</v>

1645
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I still believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1646
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:55.860
<v Speaker 1>I still believe like it takes time and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>still be short,</v>

1647
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.850
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that we have to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

1648
01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't just take this and get off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opiates,</v>

1649
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.520
<v Speaker 1>you take this and you go to Aa meetings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go to,</v>

1650
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1651
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>counseling,</v>

1652
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.910
<v Speaker 1>go to counseling.</v>

1653
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:08.890
<v Speaker 1>You go to a therapist and go talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1654
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.010
<v Speaker 1>You talk to them about why you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get off the drugs and you tell them</v>

1655
01:07:12.011 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 1>you've taken us and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1656
01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:15.550
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can solve this problem,</v>

1657
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1658
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>let's not be stupid about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I went to the doctor and I got one</v>

1659
01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.660
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was addicted to opiates and I</v>

1660
01:07:22.661 --> 01:07:24.730
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would drive around my car crying.</v>

1661
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I'd be crying saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want help,</v>

1662
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother was dying from this.</v>

1663
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I knew he was going to die from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it.</v>

1664
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.800
<v Speaker 1>So I was driving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would cry and be like,</v>

1665
01:07:32.801 --> 01:07:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need rehab.</v>

1666
01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I need help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>

1667
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Every Rehab I called was like $4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$6,000,</v>

1668
01:07:37.991 --> 01:07:40.570
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't have the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time I was a drug addict,</v>

1669
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was broke.</v>

1670
01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.300
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had known about something like this</v>

1671
01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.450
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have completely changed the</v>

1672
01:07:46.451 --> 01:07:48.190
<v Speaker 1>person I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have,</v>

1673
01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have lost five or six years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1674
01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

1675
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

1676
01:07:56.470 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird when you're a grown adult</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden you find out about</v>

1677
01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>something that's been around for</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

1678
01:08:02.441 --> 01:08:03.430
<v Speaker 1>It's been helping people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1679
01:08:03.431 --> 01:08:05.860
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to pay attention to how the fuck</v>

1680
01:08:05.861 --> 01:08:09.190
<v Speaker 1>did this one for me being like the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did bigger,</v>

1681
01:08:09.191 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>

1682
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>always talking about supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1683
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I missed it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1684
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:14.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1685
01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I know about every supplement on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

1686
01:08:15.701 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I know everything</v>

1687
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.280
<v Speaker 3>on it makes every supplement that's out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1688
01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what they do,</v>

1689
01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:22.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1690
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed it.</v>

1691
01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.140
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is really fascinating.</v>

1692
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.970
<v Speaker 3>It's just really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fascinating.</v>

1693
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:34.240
<v Speaker 3>So now we're in this state where the dea</v>
<v Speaker 3>held off it scheduled one distinction</v>

1694
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:37.580
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to designate it as a</v>

1695
01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:42.581
<v Speaker 3>schedule one and the dea isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this big monster and everybody</v>

1696
01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:44.601
<v Speaker 3>thinks everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1697
01:08:44.601 --> 01:08:49.601
<v Speaker 3>the dea and the dea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe from what I've gathered from</v>

1698
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 3>this whole situation is a data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not happy about what happened.</v>

1699
01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:55.990
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1700
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:59.000
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't aware that this many people</v>

1701
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.690
<v Speaker 3>use Kratom and are happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they really didn't know.</v>

1702
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's as dvs as people</v>

1703
01:09:05.901 --> 01:09:07.340
<v Speaker 3>think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was a big,</v>

1704
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:07.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1705
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:11.120
<v Speaker 3>and now it definitely could be something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is pushed by big Pharma,</v>

1706
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.590
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like the way that the dea has</v>
<v Speaker 3>reacted so far has been,</v>

1707
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty normal.</v>

1708
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Pretty reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1709
01:09:18.831 --> 01:09:19.581
<v Speaker 3>Reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1710
01:09:19.581 --> 01:09:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been like,</v>

1711
01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:21.020
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1712
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.100
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>

1714
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really hope people listen to this.</v>

1715
01:09:27.381 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Get to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give it to give the address that one</v>

1716
01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:32.480
<v Speaker 3>more time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's credit kratom comments.org Kratom</v>

1718
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.560
<v Speaker 3>And so December first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once December first rolls around,</v>

1719
01:09:42.561 --> 01:09:47.390
<v Speaker 3>which is right around the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens if they get a bunch of</v>

1720
01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.690
<v Speaker 3>notes and I mean they have to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000,</v>

1721
01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.740
<v Speaker 3>is that what it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't have to get any certain number,</v>

1722
01:09:51.741 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 3>but I think if they get $10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's the number we were at.</v>

1723
01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where you were aiming for,</v>

1724
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.821
<v Speaker 3>was aiming for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1725
01:09:56.821 --> 01:09:57.930

1726
01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.430
<v Speaker 3>I've actually become friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people in this Kratom community</v>

1727
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.540
<v Speaker 3>and it's not the kind of people that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would think like,</v>

1728
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

1729
01:10:05.121 --> 01:10:08.030

<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

1745
01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:48.110
<v Speaker 3>this is a really important issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

1746
01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:49.760
<v Speaker 3>when is your documentary going to come</v>

<v Speaker 3>out early next year.</v>

1748
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:55.250
<v Speaker 3>So just a matter of how fast we can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>it together.</v>

1749
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 3>So we're almost done shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1750
01:10:57.621 --> 01:11:00.860
<v Speaker 3>So now it's just the editing process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also are you going to wait</v>

1751
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:03.170
<v Speaker 3>around to see what happens after</v>
<v Speaker 3>December first?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1753
01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:04.341
<v Speaker 3>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll wait around.</v>

1754
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:06.530
<v Speaker 3>We're going to start editing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're starting editing right now.</v>

1755
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.130
<v Speaker 3>So basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1756
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.070
<v Speaker 3>if things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1757
01:11:10.071 --> 01:11:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders is one of the guys who</v>
<v Speaker 3>signed the Kratom letter.</v>

1758
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to.</v>

1759
01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.590
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of an amazing guy to me.</v>

1760
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I would love to pick his brain about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and see what he thinks.</v>

1761
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's impossible now these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1762
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:25.740
<v Speaker 3>but you never know when you might get</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes with Bernie at a rally</v>

1763
01:11:25.741 --> 01:11:26.450
<v Speaker 3>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1764
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:28.960
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to continue to try to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1765
01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.870
<v Speaker 3>those bigger names that we wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

1766
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I think they're important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Orrin Hatch's involved in this.</v>

1767
01:11:33.421 --> 01:11:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Orrin Hatch is a senator from Utah</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been very involved in the dietary</v>

1768
01:11:37.411 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 3>supplements for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

1769
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.200
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1770
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.970
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd like to get his opinion on it and</v>

1771
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

1772
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:43.920
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of crazy.</v>

1773
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I would hope that the dea and the FDA</v>
<v Speaker 3>would listen to this interview and like</v>

1774
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.210
<v Speaker 3>sit with us and do an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got one.</v>

1775
01:11:50.211 --> 01:11:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to like,</v>

1776
01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>just let them speak their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do interviews where I go in,</v>

1777
01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 3>in an ambush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

1778
01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:57.540
<v Speaker 3>I let them speak their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1779
01:11:57.541 --> 01:11:58.600
<v Speaker 3>you don't at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1780
01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I took it probably an hour ago,</v>

1781
01:12:00.871 --> 01:12:02.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long?</v>

1782
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.020
<v Speaker 3>I take it 15 minutes into the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's A.</v>

1783
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1784
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'd have like a mild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very mild stimulant sort of effect that</v>

1785
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.440
<v Speaker 3>I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1786
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1787
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to be concerned with.</v>

1788
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 3>You're not dying know it doesn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1789
01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really like I've taken some</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff before I,</v>

1790
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 3>I was in Colorado this weekend and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>took a lot of edibles.</v>

1791
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

1792
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Those fucking people aren't screwing</v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

1793
01:12:34.681 --> 01:12:36.340
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going deep in Colorado.</v>

1794
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard you are a special.</v>

1795
01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Talking about edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was amazing.</v>

1796
01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 3>So was pretty sensitive to them too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1797
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:43.560
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno man.</v>

1798
01:12:43.561 --> 01:12:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm more sensitive than Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz that like,</v>

1799
01:12:46.861 --> 01:12:48.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm on that level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like 300 milligrams.</v>

1800
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

1801
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:50.543
<v Speaker 3>That's what you take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1802
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even do it because they just</v>

1803
01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:53.550
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to take too much of it.</v>

1804
01:12:53.710 --> 01:12:55.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one time I did a podcast with Sam Harris</v>

1805
01:12:55.861 --> 01:13:00.420
<v Speaker 3>recently and I have this spray that is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand milligrams,</v>

1806
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.210
<v Speaker 3>like I guess it's a thousand milligrams</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the whole bottle,</v>

1807
01:13:03.211 --> 01:13:04.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1808
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly how to spray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the more mild version.</v>

1809
01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:13.941
<v Speaker 3>This one's 175 milligrams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which think it's like 20 milligrams of</v>

1810
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:18.270
<v Speaker 3>pump or 10 milligram between 10 and 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams of pumped depending on how</v>

1811
01:13:18.271 --> 01:13:19.680
<v Speaker 3>strong the stuff that makes sense.</v>

1812
01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 3>This is jumbo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jumbo makes a bunch of great stuff.</v>

1813
01:13:23.851 --> 01:13:27.690
<v Speaker 3>All organic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to get data dispensary.</v>

1814
01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:30.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll hook you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the uh,</v>

1815
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:32.670
<v Speaker 3>hey you want me to do is take this one</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spray.</v>

1816
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get crazy.</v>

1817
01:13:34.231 --> 01:13:35.700
<v Speaker 3>You know what's weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1818
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1819
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.160
<v Speaker 3>I like this stuff better because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so used to taking things like that.</v>

1820
01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also feel like I don't want to get</v>

1821
01:13:43.681 --> 01:13:46.050
<v Speaker 3>back into the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend would flip out if I</v>

1822
01:13:46.051 --> 01:13:49.590
<v Speaker 3>started smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to use some like edible stuff and</v>

1823
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.470
<v Speaker 3>play around with this and see if it</v>
<v Speaker 3>works for pain and stuff like that to me</v>

1824
01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:54.470
<v Speaker 3>is something that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very viable.</v>

1825
01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:55.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that funny?</v>

1826
01:13:55.261 --> 01:13:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Where people worry about like smoking is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1827
01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.680
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's smoking drugs,</v>

1828
01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.830
<v Speaker 3>but if you're spraying breath spray</v>
<v Speaker 3>under your tongue,</v>

1829
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:02.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1830
01:14:02.881 --> 01:14:04.230
<v Speaker 3>he's just relieving pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1831
01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I just think we need to open our minds</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a lot of these substances that are</v>

1832
01:14:07.471 --> 01:14:08.730
<v Speaker 3>out there that can help us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1833
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:12.440
<v Speaker 3>it's great to say don't take anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the world that we live in</v>

1834
01:14:12.441 --> 01:14:12.670
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1835
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well CBDS,</v>

1836
01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 3>CBDS are great because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive at all.</v>

1837
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1838
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Shannon Briggs was just in earlier so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's helped him tremendously.</v>

1839
01:14:21.181 --> 01:14:23.570
<v Speaker 3>CBD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pot that'll know that fucked up,</v>

1840
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:27.080
<v Speaker 3>so you carry care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1841
01:14:27.081 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference being the editable</v>

1842
01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:32.260
<v Speaker 3>version of marijuana has a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>different psychoactive effect too.</v>

1843
01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 3>That's why a lot of people think they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting spiked.</v>

1844
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:36.760
<v Speaker 3>Like they'll eat a pot cookie and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll think,</v>

1845
01:14:36.761 --> 01:14:39.040
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody put an acid in this because</v>

1846
01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:43.000
<v Speaker 3>it's really psychedelic and the way it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>processed by the body,</v>

1847
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:48.270
<v Speaker 3>your liver produces this metabolite</v>
<v Speaker 3>called 11 hydroxy metabolite and it's</v>

1848
01:14:48.611 --> 01:14:52.380
<v Speaker 3>just way more powerful than thc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You the only comedian that I've seen</v>

1849
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:55.210
<v Speaker 3>bring science into that fall into that</v>
<v Speaker 3>pit.</v>

1850
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:57.350
<v Speaker 3>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1851
01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.600
<v Speaker 3>just to kiss your ass a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That entire special is at the top of the</v>

1852
01:15:01.601 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

1853
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks bill.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm hustling.</v>

1855
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1856
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:08.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to get you.</v>

1857
01:15:08.231 --> 01:15:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a whole lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wanted to get you in here today and</v>

1858
01:15:10.421 --> 01:15:11.650
<v Speaker 3>get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1859
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:13.020
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1860
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.310
<v Speaker 3>can you tell people about this and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>else can be done?</v>

1861
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that people need to go to Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments that org leave a comment,</v>

1862
01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:19.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can,</v>

1863
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:21.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can call the dea,</v>

1864
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:24.610
<v Speaker 3>they can ask for Melvin Patterson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the spokesman.</v>

1865
01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:27.670
<v Speaker 3>They can leave a message with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this Kratom comments.org though</v>

1866
01:15:27.671 --> 01:15:31.330
<v Speaker 3>is going to be the most effective and</v>
<v Speaker 3>also like people need to seek it out and</v>
