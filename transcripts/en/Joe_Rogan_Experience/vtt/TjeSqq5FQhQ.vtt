1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.490
<v Speaker 1>What was the general good experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will there's diversion,</v>

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.930
<v Speaker 1>highlight knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most ridiculous nightmare of</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you stand there with your hands</v>

4
00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>step forward and it's like he was a</v>

5
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>comic book scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the way you knocked him out.</v>

6
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Like I said about you being a bad guy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie.</v>

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.440
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like you were a bad guy in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing movie,</v>

8
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were the guy.</v>

9
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was say if there's someone was</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a coach of a good guy and I was</v>

10
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>sitting ringside and I was watching you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>

11
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

12
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tell you.</v>

13
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Stood over them like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was outside of my body.</v>

14
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I could see me and him standing there</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was a third person.</v>

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

16
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And then when I started throwing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>punches,</v>

17
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>like I went back into my body and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>welding on the little whatever,</v>

18
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain that feeling</v>

19
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>so many different things that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big one too because I got</v>

20
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>shared so much online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions and millions of people saw that</v>

21
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.211
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

22
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this guy got in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>head and that's when they started.</v>

23
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Who is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we haven't heard about this</v>

24
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody's waking up to the</v>

25
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of sudden it was so true and it was</v>

26
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>the perfect convert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

27
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I did play it from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

28
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

29
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Straight box skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

30
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I got boxing skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>when the first photo I showed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stayed disciplined.</v>

32
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't abandoned the game plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>and I show people that I could box.</v>

34
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he knows probably the only time I</v>

35
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 1>just really just stay super disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not despite,</v>

36
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>but this first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this part,</v>

37
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one right here.</v>

38
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I went outside of my body right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing.</v>

39
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Then I came back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kid you not.</v>

40
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell was going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

41
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 1>That was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>

42
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no he didn't.</v>

43
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

44
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was quite upset that the strangest</v>

45
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>little concoction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got dreadlocks.</v>

46
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>They're little like tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

47
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>that seems like that would get in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to keep it up.</v>

48
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Asians believe in it too.</v>

49
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was sweet too.</v>

50
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Then the referee gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't</v>

51
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been funnier.</v>

52
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.410
<v Speaker 1>The railroad let go when he wrote to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other corner,</v>

53
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>talk about a movie that would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

54
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>that fight right there was the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>start of it all,</v>

55
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of public perception.</v>

56
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

57
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was really going somewhere with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

58
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:33.081
<v Speaker 1>especially when it went viral and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back with Ortiz made it cause</v>

59
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>people would have made it that much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to see what I'm going to do</v>

60
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>now because people tune in now whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>they they love me or hate me,</v>

61
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>they tuned into seeking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not next personnel.</v>

62
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

63
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.710
<v Speaker 1>At this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trt bell TRT Vito Belfort forever.</v>

64
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>That was when he was on trt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a different kind of human being.</v>

65
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>He was just completely different than he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in every circumstance.</v>

66
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking back,</v>

67
00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you can</v>

68
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.461
<v Speaker 2>see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

69
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 2>because when I fought him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought him on trt.</v>

70
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 2>You found him when he was at though the</v>
<v Speaker 2>super victorious.</v>

71
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looked like fucking the incredible hulk,</v>

72
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>but muscles on his fucking eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Looking back you can see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 2>but at the time as a fighter you got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

75
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 2>You can't think like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

76
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 2>What are they looking at it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't even do it just doesn't do</v>

77
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 2>it justice that's supposed to be before</v>
<v Speaker 2>and after.</v>

78
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.460
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just recovering from a cold or the</v>

79
00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little congested so I keep</v>

80
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 2>coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real,</v>

81
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.600
<v Speaker 2>the real key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a better one.</v>

82
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>That's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's way better.</v>

83
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.920
<v Speaker 2>That's much more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's</v>

84
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was known to take things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took things early in his career.</v>

85
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he fought randy when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 19,</v>

86
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.130
<v Speaker 1>he was 240 pounds.</v>

87
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly his next start at the top of his</v>

88
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

89
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was a picture of us</v>

90
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 2>both on the scale in Brazil and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

91
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 2>looking back now years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

92
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone else with the guys kinda big blah</v>

93
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 2>blah blah blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't think like that the time</v>

94
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't as a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you start having those thoughts,</v>

95
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 2>those doubts start looking at fight his</v>
<v Speaker 2>physique and thinking,</v>

96
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks good.</v>

97
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.350
<v Speaker 2>You've already lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

98
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>But in hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look back and say,</v>

99
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was I thinking?</v>

100
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's fucking body out of his mind.</v>

101
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I remember on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to get a rise out of him</v>

102
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>and he kept putting his hand in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a religious guy and you know,</v>

103
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.260
<v Speaker 2>God bless anyone that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean that I respect everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions,</v>

105
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not in as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>veto is heavily religious.</v>

106
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 2>And he kept sticking this thing in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

107
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 2>He was pissing me off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come here,</v>

108
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 2>come here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he leans in.</v>

109
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no Jesus</v>

110
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there is,</v>

111
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.533
<v Speaker 2>maybe there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.140
<v Speaker 2>me getting a job with a head kick in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>second round,</v>

113
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that was God the watting may</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

114
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 2>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some fucking project is bullshit.</v>

115
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>So the drug actually prolongs were</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensifies the depression,</v>

116
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

117
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For very short term use of very severe</v>

118
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are not things you want to go</v>

119
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:10.670
<v Speaker 1>on and stay on for a length of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating to me is when I talk</v>

120
00:05:10.671 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>to people that are on them that want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you,</v>

121
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>like they're on some cancer medication</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're on something that cures</v>

122
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 1>polio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

123
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>they make it seem like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>insensitive to the possibility that</v>

124
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 1>there's other solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

125
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And there were many other solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have really good evidence for the</v>

126
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant effect of physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

127
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both to prevent and treat.</v>

128
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>We have very good evidence for</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplemental fish oil or omega three</v>

129
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:42.721
<v Speaker 1>fatty acids to permit and CBDS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and the microbiome looks like it's</v>

130
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>involved in our mental states as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

131
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different ways.</v>

132
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBD for sure.</v>

133
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets back to inflammation it and it gets</v>

134
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>back to in an integrative approach and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just relying on a single thing like</v>

135
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>a pharmaceutical treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

136
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to intelligent people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are on Ssri in one form or another and</v>

137
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>even ones that have struggled were on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one for a while and then it stopped</v>

138
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.520
<v Speaker 1>working and then they tried another one</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're combining ones and they're</v>

139
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.540
<v Speaker 1>on this weird sort of chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>rollercoaster and they reject any</v>

140
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>possible notion that there's other</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternatives.</v>

141
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you bring up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise one,</v>

142
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring up the exercise one,</v>

143
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:20.571
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

144
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>this fucking meathead exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just stop and I'm like,</v>

145
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did this thing with my friends called</v>

146
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>sober October and what we did is we no</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

147
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>no anything for the month of October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also we did this fitness challenge</v>

148
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>and we got really carried away and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all competing against each other with</v>

149
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 1>this heart rate app.</v>

150
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.070
<v Speaker 1>So we're working out three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours a day.</v>

151
00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was interesting about it to me</v>

152
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>was not just that your body sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapts when you force it to work that</v>

153
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>many hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that your mood is phenomenal.</v>

154
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I felt so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>And I was telling everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could take what I like,</v>

156
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel that good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I felt great,</v>

157
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>but I don't feel as good as I did during</v>
<v Speaker 1>October because I was working out four</v>

158
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

159
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>If you could get that in pill form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would take it every day if there was</v>

160
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>no side effects because it literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>removed anxiety.</v>

161
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>All the internal chatter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the negative chatter,</v>

162
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>it was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything seemed amazing.</v>

163
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are side effects of physical</v>

164
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 1>activity are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

165
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it revs up immune function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improves the gesture and sleep,</v>

166
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 1>all that you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety,</v>

167
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 1>the by far and away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most effective treatment I found for</v>

168
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is simple.</v>

169
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 1>A simple breathing technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulating the breath.</v>

170
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this work for the most extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of panic disorder and the drugs</v>

171
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>that we use for anxiety or the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The benzodiazepines are highly</v>

172
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 1>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mess with your mind.</v>

173
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a good friend who has an issue</v>

174
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 1>with anxiety medication and he takes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and when he does take it,</v>

175
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>apparently it has that rebound effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly right.</v>

176
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>He gets horribly anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:07:56.961 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>these are handed out like candy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody warns people how addictive they</v>

178
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse addiction than an opiate.</v>

179
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xanax really?</v>

180
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

181
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Harder to get off of the opioids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

182
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Because out of all those voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're not personally trying</v>

183
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>to figure it out and filter it yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your own,</v>

184
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>which is completely impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you could just look at it</v>

185
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 1>objectively from afar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to work itself out in a</v>

186
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 1>far better way than has ever happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

187
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>In our past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been this many voices and</v>

188
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>our pastor has been like you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about a select few voices.</v>

189
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>The Walter cronkite's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whoever it is at the top,</v>

190
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>and then everyone else sort of had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait for the narrative to be spelled out</v>

191
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the case anymore.</v>

192
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.060
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

193
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best of times in the</v>

194
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>worst of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best of times because all these new</v>

195
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:53.651
<v Speaker 1>voices are bringing all sorts of great</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective and insight and intelligence</v>

196
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 1>to the story that wasn't there before.</v>

197
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>

198
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.741
<v Speaker 3>is if the infrastructure that used to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>there to kind of bring us all Paul bring</v>

199
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:09.201
<v Speaker 3>us all up to kind of basic level so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we understood the facts disappears so</v>

200
00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have anything that kind of</v>

201
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 3>makes it so that we all understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's at issue and what's at stake and</v>

202
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 3>what the facts are so that we can act as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a democracy in a sensible way.</v>

203
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Then the question is how do we run a</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy?</v>

204
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if we could have all these</v>

205
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I like to think about the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the culture channel and the</v>

207
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 3>democracy channels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the culture channel,</v>

208
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 3>this is the best of times by orders of</v>
<v Speaker 3>magnitude and the stuff on television</v>

209
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 3>today is a billion times better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything from the 19 seventies in 19</v>

210
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:38.510
<v Speaker 3>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

211
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a product of this incredible</v>

212
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 3>competition and the fact that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>have anything and any niche market and</v>

213
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:49.170
<v Speaker 3>as long as it's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense to do it and that's</v>

214
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.033
<v Speaker 3>what's great.</v>

215
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 3>But when you turn to the democracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>channel,</v>

216
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 3>the same fragmentation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same niche market,</v>

217
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 3>the same reality of us all living in</v>
<v Speaker 3>these different universes means we can't</v>

218
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 3>address problems as a democracy with</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the same facts.</v>

219
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 3>And that's a real problem because if we</v>
<v Speaker 3>all live in our own fact universe,</v>

220
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 3>but we have to same face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same real problems in the same real</v>

221
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we're not going to decide them in</v>

222
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 3>any sensible way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how you solve that problem is really</v>

223
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not going back.</v>

224
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Thank God we're not going back to the 19</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

225
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.980
<v Speaker 3>It's just not going to be the case that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are three channels we get to</v>

226
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 3>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just not gonna happen.</v>

227
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.411
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

228
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 3>and it's a great thing because we've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this amazing culture,</v>

229
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:34.620
<v Speaker 3>but what do we do on the democracy side?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we build a democracy,</v>

230
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 3>recognizing that everybody's not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to spend all their time geeking out</v>

231
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:40.620
<v Speaker 3>about campaign finance reform</v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation.</v>

232
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
