<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>that's what they decided to do to them to make it look like they found his body.</v>

5
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 1>He was 22 and I'm sure he was probably involved with a bunch of waves as the</v>

6
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.564
<v Speaker 1>evening.</v>

7
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.340

<v Speaker 1>rubberized underwear and a headmaster pork right here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's your definition of the 51 year old pastor wasn't voted as home at the</v>

20
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.290
<v Speaker 1>We'd gone apparently in the mess.</v>

22
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.503
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23

<v Speaker 1>what police?</v>

30
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.070
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

31
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>They chose not to mention what police discovered inside the ministers rubber</v>

32
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:25.234
<v Speaker 1>briefs.</v>

33
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>And if you click on that link they found a giant black.</v>

34
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:31.264
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

35
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

36
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.793
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

37
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 3>corked and Jamie here recording audio of all of this.</v>

38
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.783
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

39
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.683
<v Speaker 3>We're uh,</v>

40
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Speaker 3>we're in the kitchen with Tonka trucks.</v>

41
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Haul got allergies or something.</v>

42
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 3>Does the podcast studio has been transformed because a big part of the new Scifi</v>

43
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 3>show deals with the podcasts are,</v>

44
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 3>he's in it.</v>

45
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 3>And so it's young Duncan Trussell and uh,</v>

46
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 3>we're filming a lot of the guests and some of the discussions here,</v>

47
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

48
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.431
<v Speaker 3>at the studio.</v>

49
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:03.431
<v Speaker 3>So if you could see this is usually not cluttered and crazy and uh,</v>

50
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

51
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 3>they changed the decorations a little.</v>

52
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.153
<v Speaker 3>They gave us this,</v>

53
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 3>this fucking stupid thing.</v>

54
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.281
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is,</v>

55
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 3>but it makes it more saifai whatever.</v>

56
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

57
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 3>so today was a doctor Jeffrey Meldrum.</v>

58
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 3>He's a lead shit scientists who heavily believes in bigfoot,</v>

59
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.163
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

60
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 3>but fun stuff.</v>

61
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 3>And we'd been going nonstop.</v>

62
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 3>The show starts airing July 16th,</v>

63
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 3>and where,</v>

64
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

65
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.300
<v Speaker 3>the schedule's just been ridiculous,</v>

66
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.860
<v Speaker 3>but we're meeting a lot of really cool people and so far as Lana,</v>

67
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.003
<v Speaker 3>pretty cool shit.</v>

68
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 3>And that's all the crew back there.</v>

69
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Think of times that a lot of shit to show you fuckers for.</v>

70
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.903
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

71
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.943
<v Speaker 3>I'm so tired.</v>

72
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 3>I haven't slept right in days.</v>

73
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.171
<v Speaker 3>I've been fine.</v>

74
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Speaker 3>All of the fucking world.</v>

75
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I flew from Canada to New York,</v>

76
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:54.561
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>

77
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina,</v>

78
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina here,</v>

79
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.950
<v Speaker 3>and from here we got to go to Texas.</v>

80
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin's going to go to or no.</v>

81
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:00.431
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>

82
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 3>He's going to go to Colorado and I got to go to Texas and then I got to go to</v>

83
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:04.444
<v Speaker 3>Alaska.</v>

84
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 3>But it's gonna be bad ass.</v>

85
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully it'll suck either way.</v>

86
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

87
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll create a pseudonym.</v>

88
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.080
<v Speaker 3>I'll go online.</v>

89
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you my show stock.</v>

90
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.010
<v Speaker 3>That'd be really obvious though.</v>

91
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.841
<v Speaker 3>They'll be like,</v>

92
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

93
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 3>job until where are you said telepathy already exist in the form of language,</v>

94
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

95
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 3>With language.</v>

96
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Your mouth is making certain sounds and then you run those downs through a</v>

97
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 3>cultural context.</v>

98
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 3>A dictionary of sure.</v>

99
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 3>What we've accepted that those sounds represent.</v>

100
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 3>And through that I can read your mind.</v>

101
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

102
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you're doing.</v>

103
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 3>When you were describing to me your encounter,</v>

104
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.921
<v Speaker 3>meeting your friend,</v>

105
00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 3>and while you're jogging and various coincidences that have happened through</v>

106
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>

107
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm essentially reading a version of your thoughts on the,</v>

108
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 3>on these subjects and dad is telepathy.</v>

109
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 3>And that is what separates human beings from other animals.</v>

110
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 3>That what we're dealing with as far as like what we call psychic energy might</v>

111
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 3>just be a,</v>

112
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.211
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>

113
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:06.211
<v Speaker 3>we are slowly emerging and we were slowly developing these,</v>

114
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 3>these potential abilities and a guy like band a check may be able to come along</v>

115
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 3>and dismiss all of these because they're not as tangible as a noise that comes</v>

116
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 3>from your mouth.</v>

117
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it takes a million years to develop these abilities and maybe right now we</v>

118
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:21.244
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

119
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 3>the whispers of these abilities are possible maybe where it's like a radio</v>

120
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 3>station that you can only tune in during a thunderstorm,</v>

121
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like it was tiny weird phenomenon that only happens like upon</v>

122
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 3>occasion.</v>

123
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 3>That is possible.</v>

124
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 3>It is certainly possible.</v>

125
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 3>And another thing about psychic energy that makes it fantastic and very</v>

126
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 3>interesting to discuss is the fact that so many people have claimed to</v>

127
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:49.711
<v Speaker 3>experience it and so many people I think almost recognized at a genetic level</v>

128
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 3>that that's coming and that is an emerging aspect of human consciousness and the</v>

129
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 3>ability to do it nonverbally</v>

130
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

131
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean yeah,</v>

132
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 4>it's one I can say one thing is indisputable right now.</v>

133
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.190
<v Speaker 4>There is no accepted proof that this exists.</v>

134
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 4>There's no accepted proof.</v>

135
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.953
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

136
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 4>We don't know that it exists right now that is indisputable and that does not</v>

137
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 4>mean that it doesn't exist.</v>

138
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's really cool about the scientific method and this approach to</v>

139
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:22.380
<v Speaker 4>truth is it,</v>

140
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 4>it isn't committed one way or the other.</v>

141
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.640
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

142
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 4>And I don't even think vantage check was completely closed off to the idea that</v>

143
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't real.</v>

144
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

145
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.813
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

146
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 4>I thought for a moment he said,</v>

147
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.441
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

148
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:32.681
<v Speaker 4>may,</v>

149
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 4>I thought there was like something in,</v>

150
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:34.804
<v Speaker 4>they're always like,</v>

151
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't been proven,</v>

152
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 4>but maybe I don't remember.</v>

153
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I just,</v>

154
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.310
<v Speaker 3>well thanks for checking.</v>

155
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.420
<v Speaker 3>You might've put that in asleep.</v>

156
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.353
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

157
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.243
<v Speaker 3>you said me</v>

158
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 4>said maybe it's weird.</v>

159
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>

160
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 4>one thing that I love about this show,</v>

161
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 4>what it's done to me is if you think I'm a hippie now before the show I was much</v>

162
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:53.970
<v Speaker 4>more of a heavy,</v>

163
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:58.971
<v Speaker 4>and then you come into contact with people who are really in believing this</v>

164
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 4>thing or that thing and won't listen to logic.</v>

165
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 4>And then that becomes really appalling when you realize that from an</v>

166
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 4>individual's POV it's kind of sad or cute or whatever.</v>

167
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 4>But from a group of people believing in things that aren't provable,</v>

168
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 4>that shit gets really bad.</v>

169
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 4>And also I,</v>

170
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 4>one thing that vantage has pointed out,</v>

171
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 4>which I really liked just how dangerous it is,</v>

172
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

173
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.970
<v Speaker 4>when people decide to use methods that are easily recreated to actually get</v>

174
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 4>money from people and pray on the their vulnerabilities,</v>

175
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 4>like they miss a loved one,</v>

176
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 4>they show them a few parlor tricks,</v>

177
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 4>makes maybe think that they have these abilities and then suddenly they're</v>

178
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:44.471
<v Speaker 4>taking money from them to let them talk to their grandparents who've done or</v>

179
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 4>their parents have died that's evil.</v>

180
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 4>And then you take that one step further and you get the priest class who</v>

181
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 4>convinces groups of people that they can talk to God.</v>

182
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 4>And then they start churches and religions.</v>

183
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.980
<v Speaker 4>And then the next thing you know you've got an even deeper problems.</v>

184
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 4>So I think that stuff that vantage check does and that skeptics do,</v>

185
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 4>it's really important and good.</v>

186
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 4>And it's important to be skeptical,</v>

187
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 4>but you can't be skeptical to the point where you step on your own experience,</v>

188
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 4>where your skepticism override something that you've actually experienced.</v>

189
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

190
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 3>But isn't it possible that skepticism not overrides what you've actually</v>

191
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 3>experienced but defines it explains it?</v>

192
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

193
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

194
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.960
<v Speaker 4>if it,</v>

195
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.190
<v Speaker 4>if it can be explained,</v>

196
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.180
<v Speaker 4>if it can be explained.</v>

197
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

198
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 4>So far everything you've said,</v>

199
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:30.910
<v Speaker 4>I believe can be explained.</v>

200
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

201
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:32.260
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

202
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.300
<v Speaker 4>and also just because something can be explained,</v>

203
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.030
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that it's no longer special,</v>

204
00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:37.781
<v Speaker 4>are wonderful.</v>

205
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:39.400
<v Speaker 4>It just means that now you know what it is.</v>

206
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

207
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

208
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really important and I become much more of a skeptic because of</v>

209
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:44.974
<v Speaker 3>the show as well.</v>

210
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

211
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.100
<v Speaker 3>and talking to people that believe in things.</v>

212
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:52.450
<v Speaker 3>You also recognize these patterns that exist over and over again and people that</v>

213
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:57.451
<v Speaker 3>believe in things and it's that they don't ever contemplate the contrary.</v>

214
00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.620
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

215
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.640
<v Speaker 3>they don't ever consider whether or not what they believe in is nonsense.</v>

216
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.880
<v Speaker 3>They just go forward with sort of this,</v>

217
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:09.160
<v Speaker 3>this blind conviction that what they're,</v>

218
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.870
<v Speaker 3>whether it's about aliens or psychics or big foot or whatever it's about,</v>

219
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:19.180
<v Speaker 3>they go forth with this conviction that they have the truth and they want to</v>

220
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 3>expose the truth.</v>

221
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that can function</v>

222
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 1>because of his head sled over until I can come.</v>

223
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Cause when you touch my butt,</v>

224
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.460
<v Speaker 1>who wants to live forever?</v>

225
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

226
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 1>let's kill life after life still running.</v>

227
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.333
<v Speaker 1>We're rolling</v>

228
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.910
<v Speaker 1>white terror,</v>

229
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:09.861
<v Speaker 1>silver.</v>

230
00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Come by.</v>

231
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Fear.</v>
