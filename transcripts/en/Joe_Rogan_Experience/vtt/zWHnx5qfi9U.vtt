1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Stupid little fucking tube of paper that sucks in danger,</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>dangerous chemicals,</v>

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>and you're telling me that I should be worried about the end of the world you're</v>

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

5
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>The world is happening right now.</v>

6
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching it.</v>

7
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.171
<v Speaker 1>You're inhaling,</v>

8
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:10.351
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

9
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>you're addicted to a fucking little stick.</v>

10
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>

11
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>You're under the world's already here.</v>

13
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Stupid I,</v>

14
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>the world is not necessarily predetermined.</v>

15
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>We who knows how this is all going to turn out.</v>

16
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the fun of the movie.</v>

17
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the fun of the theatrical production.</v>

18
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>That is your life.</v>

19
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

20
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>If we knew everything that was going to take place,</v>

21
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>it would be so boring.</v>

22
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>If you knew that you were now in heaven and you get to bang some chick anytime</v>

23
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>you want for the rest of your life and you get to eat all the food you want it</v>

24
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of life,</v>

25
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you think that it would be awesome,</v>

26
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's not without risks,</v>

27
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>not without failure.</v>

28
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>You need all those things.</v>

29
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.531
<v Speaker 1>Human being,</v>

30
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>you need to reach struggle.</v>

31
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>You need struggle.</v>

32
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 1>It's part of,</v>

33
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>we are some sort of a monkey that creates things.</v>

34
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And if we don't create things,</v>

35
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>whether you create ideas,</v>

36
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>whether you create relationships,</v>

37
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>whether you create houses,</v>

38
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>whether you create jokes,</v>

39
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>wherever the fuck you put forth,</v>

40
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes human beings happy.</v>

41
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're just living in the clouds banging chicks and eat and food,</v>

42
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>you would fucking live in hell.</v>

43
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't think you would,</v>

44
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>but eventually you would be in hell.</v>

45
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>You'd be in some weird situation where a giant part of what it is to be a human</v>

46
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>is removed from the equation.</v>

47
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And it just goes back to what we talked about with Welfare.</v>

49
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:23.721
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

50
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

51
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you've got to work to get something.</v>

52
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't just get it.</v>

53
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a struggle or you don't evolve.</v>

54
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you introduce the option of no struggle,</v>

55
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you introduced the option of,</v>

56
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>and people think that the struggle is over financially.</v>

58
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why when people are successful,</v>

59
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.791
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people go,</v>

60
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:39.271
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

61
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>he sold out.</v>

62
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>he's not hip anymore.</v>

65
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

66
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>the struggle is never financial.</v>

67
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>The stroke did.</v>

68
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>The best part about overcoming the financial struggle is now the struggle gets</v>

69
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>to be about thoughts and ideas.</v>

70
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Now the struggle gets to be about creating shit and now the struggle gets to be</v>

71
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>about getting the center of what the fuck this is getting to the center of what</v>

72
00:01:59.011 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>is this life?</v>

73
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>And you can guess what you can think about.</v>

74
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>What is this life a whole lot more when you're a comedian that gets to wake up</v>

75
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>at one in the afternoon and it doesn't necessarily have to do anything all day,</v>

76
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>and you can sit in front of your computer computer drinking coconut juice and</v>

77
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot and reading online.</v>

78
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>You can think things through in a manner that the average person just never get</v>

79
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 1>a chance to do.</v>

80
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And you ever have that opportunity to get paid for it too.</v>

81
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what kind of standup is putting it into a funny light,</v>

82
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>but kind of like surprising people with where you're taking your idea.</v>

83
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

84
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mean.</v>

85
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

86
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.091
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

87
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

88
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>it's putting forth something you have.</v>

89
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

90
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's gotta be hard,</v>

91
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

92
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I write shit sometimes and I'm a fucking gold and man this bit sucks.</v>

93
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>There's something missing in this bit.</v>

94
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I know it's Dan but I don't know it's there.</v>

95
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this thing that I have just figured out how to do like over the</v>

96
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>last couple of years where I used to have a theme,</v>

97
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:44.671
<v Speaker 1>like I would say,</v>

98
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:44.941
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

99
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>today I'm going to write about Viagra,</v>

100
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>we're going to sit down and going to write some shit about Viagra.</v>

101
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And then I would start about that and maybe it would go in a different</v>

102
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:51.271
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

103
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>but not too far off path.</v>

104
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Now I just sit down and I open up a page and I just let it go.</v>

105
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I just get high as fuck and I let it all go,</v>

106
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever crazy thought I have.</v>

107
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>And then in the morning I get up sober and then I look at what I wrote and I go,</v>

108
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I talking about?</v>

109
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Like some I write shit sometimes when I'm high and I go back and read it and I'm</v>

110
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:15.041
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

111
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't even seem like it's me writing this.</v>

112
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:17.801
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

113
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck wrote this?</v>

114
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense sometimes.</v>

115
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

116
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

117
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it doesn't though,</v>

119
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's part of,</v>

120
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.050
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the whole zone that you get into when you're creating something</v>

121
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>and you can't be afraid of looking silly for so many years where you never,</v>

122
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>you never even smoked a joint.</v>

123
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.813
<v Speaker 1>Do anything.</v>

124
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.781
<v Speaker 1>What was your,</v>

126
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:38.614
<v Speaker 1>what was your turn,</v>

127
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>what did Stan hope gets you?</v>

128
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

129
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:40.631
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

130
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:41.464
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo.</v>

131
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo for sure.</v>

132
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.474
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

133
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.931
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

134
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>he was a really good at Jujitsu and uh,</v>

136
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>we were hanging out together just because we took classes together and he gave</v>

137
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>me some private lessons and tied me up and it not,</v>

138
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.381
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

139
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:53.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I was training with this guy.</v>

141
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Other guy was taking private lessons with his black belt.</v>

142
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a very nice guy.</v>

143
00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:58.571
<v Speaker 1>He had good intentions,</v>

144
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>but I could roll with him,</v>

145
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>but I knew his game,</v>

146
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 1>and you get to a certain point where you could roll the guy like,</v>

148
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I could tap them out and it very rare,</v>

150
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>but occasionally I can get them with something.</v>

151
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>And part of it was him like being Roland Nice with me and real easy with me and</v>

152
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>let me get things.</v>

153
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>But also I knew his game.</v>

154
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

155
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>But when you start rolling with someone else,</v>

156
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>you realize,</v>

157
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

158
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>you got to roll with a bunch of different people.</v>

159
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't just roll with one person because Eddie Bravo just went right through</v>

160
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:20.531
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

161
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.364
<v Speaker 1>He just destroyed me.</v>

162
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Part of it was because he was way better than me and really,</v>

163
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:24.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>an amazing Jujitsu guy.</v>

165
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a genius,</v>

166
00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>a Jujitsu genius,</v>

167
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:28.084
<v Speaker 1>a true genius,</v>

168
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>every sense of the word.</v>

169
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>But it was also because I sucked.</v>

170
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was good cause I knew how to wrestle with one guy.</v>

171
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I knew his weaknesses.</v>

172
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I was physically a little faster than him and I can do things.</v>

173
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>But then I started rolling with other people.</v>

174
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I was getting tapped all the time.</v>

175
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

176
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.291
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

177
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:40.541
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

178
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I got a joint class.</v>

179
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.921
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

180
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:42.754
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

181
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Eddie said,</v>

182
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happy to give you some private lessons.</v>

184
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

185
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>oh awesome.</v>

186
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 1>So we went out,</v>

187
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.131
<v Speaker 1>we got some lunch,</v>

188
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>get some private lessons,</v>

189
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and we started talking about creativity and life and music and stuff.</v>

190
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's a musician and he said that he writes his best stuff and he's stoned.</v>

191
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.861
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

192
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even make sense.</v>

193
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you're high and you're,</v>

194
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking when you're high.</v>

195
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

196
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

197
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 1>you dope.</v>

198
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

199
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:03.064
<v Speaker 1>you'd lose her.</v>

200
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

201
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

202
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

203
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>the moments in my life where I had been drunk,</v>

204
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I was embarrassed about those moments.</v>

205
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I never like look back at a time I was struggling.</v>

206
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I can now.</v>

207
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

208
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

209
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.871
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

210
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:11.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>we'll like,</v>

212
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.270
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

213
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>there were fucking hammered and we're talking shit at the bar and it's fun.</v>

214
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.260
<v Speaker 1>That to me,</v>

215
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

216
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

218
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm in control of my shit now.</v>

219
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

220
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So what if me and Brian and Joey Diaz do shots at the,</v>

221
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

222
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>in the green room and the Portland,</v>

223
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.611
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

224
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:24.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:25.804
<v Speaker 1>a helium.</v>

226
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel bad about that.</v>

227
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we had a good time.</v>

228
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:29.081
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

229
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>The next day I had a headache.</v>

230
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.890
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

231
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>But back then I was embarrassed about anything that I did that wasn't positive.</v>

232
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And anything that I did that cut might make me a loser.</v>

233
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Anything that I did that my keeping.</v>

234
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

236
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.501
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

237
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>he was so adamant about how we'd made him like a really creative,</v>

239
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:46.331
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

240
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:46.631
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

241
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:47.141
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>

242
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:47.441
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

243
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>pull over.</v>

244
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.551
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

245
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:48.821
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

246
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:49.191
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

247
00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

248
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.680
<v Speaker 1>we smoked pot and then we had some ice cream and uh,</v>

249
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>and it was amazing.</v>

250
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>It was the greatest ice cream I've ever had in my life.</v>

251
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't believe that marijuana made this cream so fucking good.</v>

252
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I had an ice cream Sundae with hot fudge and it was the most incredible.</v>

253
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

254
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>the sensation of eating the food was so heightened.</v>

255
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a fool.</v>

256
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I can't believe that all my,</v>

257
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>and that started.</v>

258
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:10.911
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

259
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

260
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.073
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>

261
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

262
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.720
<v Speaker 1>it was like I was talking to him and he's this fascinating guy.</v>

263
00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:15.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Eddie is a very fascinating guy.</v>

265
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

266
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.131
<v Speaker 1>he's a free thinker.</v>

267
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>He had a really hard childhood man.</v>

268
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>My childhood was not,</v>

269
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>my childhood was not,</v>

270
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>not terrible.</v>

271
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that it wasn't ideal.</v>

272
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of shit happened to me.</v>

273
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of us did,</v>

274
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>all of us here did,</v>

275
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.860
<v Speaker 1>but his was horrific and because of that he developed disability to just fuck</v>

276
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.604
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

277
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Like push people away,</v>

278
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>like focus on his goals and see things in a different way.</v>

279
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

280
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

281
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>he had this ability to like,</v>

282
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>he's got this ability to look at life and break things down and a lot of times</v>

283
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>when we have conversations he comes at it from a completely different angle than</v>

284
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

285
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

286
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>And I like that about you too.</v>

287
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 1>You will often do that too.</v>

288
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>And Duncan,</v>

289
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that all the time.</v>

290
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I love when people,</v>

291
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:00.620

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.460
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Matt Rung who was also on Mad TV.</v>

439
00:09:58.461 --> 00:09:59.294
<v Speaker 2>We had them on you,</v>

440
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Tommy stickers and Christina show.</v>

441
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:01.761
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

442
00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:04.880
<v Speaker 2>but he was talking about how he was on this thing that you can find on the</v>

443
00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:05.211
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

444
00:10:05.211 --> 00:10:06.260
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

445
00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Where these,</v>

446
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.780
<v Speaker 2>this comedy trip goes into an Ikea.</v>

447
00:10:08.781 --> 00:10:12.620
<v Speaker 2>They do like a CSI type show in the middle of Ikea,</v>

448
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.310
<v Speaker 2>like without Ikea knowing like they have employees or that are a part of the</v>

449
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:19.490
<v Speaker 2>production that will like take like the employees of Ikea and like get them</v>

450
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 2>distracted and then they'll have like full on like gun guns and cops,</v>

451
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:23.900
<v Speaker 2>shootouts,</v>

452
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.690
<v Speaker 2>you know like in the middle of like a bedroom in Ikea and they,</v>

453
00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:30.020
<v Speaker 2>so they use Ikea as a stage for CSI.</v>

454
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.390
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

455
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.530
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the funniest things.</v>

456
00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:36.170
<v Speaker 2>They had to stop doing it because they just were getting kicked out every</v>

457
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:36.640
<v Speaker 2>episode,</v>

458
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.160
<v Speaker 2>like intercompany kicks away.</v>

459
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is really cool that</v>

460
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.890
<v Speaker 2>these guys are actually doing a TV show in a status Ikea yet.</v>

461
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:45.800
<v Speaker 2>And instead it's like really funny and,</v>

462
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.270
<v Speaker 2>and it's all him prompts using,</v>

463
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

464
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.490
<v Speaker 2>it's Ikea Heights dotcom and they're in a kitchen now and then they're in the</v>

465
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.683
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>

466
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.290
<v Speaker 2>That's fine as ideas where you go,</v>

467
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:55.990
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck didn't I think of that?</v>

468
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.590
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

469
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.780
<v Speaker 2>And I guess supposedly like they can't do it anymore because they've just gotten</v>

470
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.581
<v Speaker 2>too much trouble.</v>

471
00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:01.890
<v Speaker 2>He keep doing it changes a malt.</v>

472
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.371
<v Speaker 2>Walmart.</v>

473
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd say the last one they did kia heights,</v>

474
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.803
<v Speaker 2>Ikea Heights.</v>

475
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.481
<v Speaker 2>Last one they did,</v>

476
00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:09.880
<v Speaker 2>they had like a Zombie attack or something like that,</v>

477
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 2>so they just had some bs.</v>

478
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.660
<v Speaker 2>But I was thinking instead of doing it again and getting in trouble,</v>

479
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Ikea act like they move like,</v>

480
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.730
<v Speaker 2>cause like you know how like in TV shows they moved to different cities.</v>

481
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.290
<v Speaker 2>So like Kmart,</v>

482
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Kmart Boulevard or something like that.</v>

483
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.080
<v Speaker 2>And that'd be the whole show.</v>

484
00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:30.860
<v Speaker 2>But they probably,</v>

485
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.251
<v Speaker 1>we will,</v>

486
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:32.900
<v Speaker 1>we probably don't even need to give them that idea.</v>

487
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.670
<v Speaker 1>They thought of that idea.</v>

488
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Must must've thought they couldn't have said yes,</v>

489
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:37.641
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

490
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:38.720
<v Speaker 1>They're kicking us out now.</v>

491
00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:39.620
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go somewhere else.</v>

492
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.110
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] dot com or something.</v>

493
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Ikea heights.com and the podcast we had mad on was a your mom's house number 14</v>

494
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.950
<v Speaker 2>squad</v>

495
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:46.581
<v Speaker 1>on iTunes.</v>

496
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:47.211
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

497
00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

498
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.190
<v Speaker 1>that's a great idea.</v>

499
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:49.761
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then,</v>

500
00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:49.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

501
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:51.170
<v Speaker 1>one of those ideas comes along,</v>

502
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:51.501
<v Speaker 1>we'd like,</v>

503
00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

504
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

505
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 1>That's one of,</v>

506
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.591
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

507
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:53.861
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

508
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>that's stellar.</v>

509
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.653
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

510
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about,</v>

511
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:58.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:11:58.961 --> 00:11:59.231
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

513
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I love being in the comedy community is such an interesting community,</v>

514
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.080
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

515
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

516
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it feels weird to even say that you're a part of it.</v>

517
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:06.251
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>

518
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>we all have this weird sort of,</v>

519
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

520
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.761
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

521
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you have like a weird sort of like a humility about the business and,</v>

522
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:13.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:12:13.371 --> 00:12:13.581
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

524
00:12:13.581 --> 00:12:13.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

525
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

526
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing to even say like,</v>

527
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:16.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

528
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:16.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

529
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm a problem freshen up comedian.</v>

530
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>

531
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it all seems like I won't enter that discussion.</v>

532
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.631
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

533
00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:22.091
<v Speaker 1>it seems,</v>

534
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 1>it seems odd and weird.</v>

535
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said to me,</v>

536
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:24.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

537
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:27.310
<v Speaker 1>you're professionally funny and my buddy Jimmy Burke said,</v>

538
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 1>you are professionally,</v>

539
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 1>so I'll show you is you are a pro.</v>

540
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:29.891
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

541
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:30.221
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>

542
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:30.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

543
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.361
<v Speaker 1>it's a wide,</v>

544
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 1>so it's a weird thing.</v>

545
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:32.441
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

546
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:34.150
<v Speaker 1>it goes contrary to the idea of being,</v>

547
00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 1>or what makes you funny in the first place.</v>

548
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.410
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

549
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

550
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>but being a part of the community,</v>

551
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>like you having people like you as a friend and having people like,</v>

552
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

553
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:42.240

00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:45.790

00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And Adam Carolla's really sitting there and you're really sitting there.</v>

560
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 1>It's the fucking greatest thing ever.</v>

561
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>The great,</v>

562
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 1>the greatest community to be a part of people who make you laugh.</v>

563
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.893
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

564
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like a part of this fraternity or something.</v>

565
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:01.901
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like,</v>

566
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:02.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:02.680
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

568
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>when you've done the road and when you've been on stage and you know,</v>

569
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 1>so different audiences are so different.</v>

570
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how they're gonna respond.</v>

571
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:09.881
<v Speaker 1>You've got,</v>

572
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 1>you've gone through something and we were at the backstage of the UFC and it was</v>

573
00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 1>a big UFC event and it fucking place was packed.</v>

574
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 1>But Jim Norton and Bobby Kelly showed up and I saw Jim Norton and Bobby Kelly</v>

575
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 1>and I shot towards them like a slingshot.</v>

576
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I made a beeline to them because I knew that's where the fun talk was going</v>

577
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:28.020
<v Speaker 1>to be fun.</v>

578
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

579
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Jimi fucking doors there and Bobby Kelly and Kelly's,</v>

580
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I've known Bobby Kelly since we were like 21 kills me.</v>

581
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Bobby was with Allen,</v>

582
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.570
<v Speaker 1>the monkeys and Dane Cook and that they were an Improv troupe and I was the</v>

583
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:43.210
<v Speaker 1>headliner and they would open for me and we did a bunch of those,</v>

584
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:43.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

585
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:44.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>cuckoos a addict already comedy huts.</v>

587
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 1>So we worked together a bunch of times when those guys were just coming up.</v>

588
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like a couple of years ahead of them,</v>

589
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.140
<v Speaker 1>but they were,</v>

590
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 1>they were close.</v>

591
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

592
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:53.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

593
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with Bobby Kelly like back in the day,</v>

594
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

595
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.720
<v Speaker 1>so I've known him since you ain't even know him bobbing and Dan for a long</v>

596
00:13:58.721 --> 00:13:59.051
<v Speaker 1>shore.</v>

597
00:13:59.051 --> 00:13:59.831
<v Speaker 1>I've known Dan forever.</v>

598
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I knew Dan before he ever did stand up on his own.</v>

599
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 1>He did it in a troop.</v>

600
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 1>He did it in the Allen,</v>

601
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:05.210
<v Speaker 1>the monkeys.</v>

602
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.630
<v Speaker 1>What they would do is they would do sketches and uh,</v>

603
00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:07.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:08.850
<v Speaker 1>they were taking chances.</v>

605
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 1>It was creative stuff.</v>

606
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.330
<v Speaker 1>And then they would each do stand up.</v>

607
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 1>They would each do like five minutes of standup and then I would go on stage</v>

608
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:14.381
<v Speaker 1>after them.</v>

609
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

610
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:15.783
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of like,</v>

611
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:15.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

612
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say like they,</v>

613
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:17.600
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

614
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.431
<v Speaker 1>they were opening,</v>

615
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was so much different than an opening act.</v>

616
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 1>They had a lot of shit going on.</v>

617
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Like they did.</v>

618
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 1>It was interesting to you guys,</v>

619
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:23.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

620
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

621
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:24.581
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

622
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:25.414
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

623
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 1>so I've known Bobby since,</v>

624
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:27.071
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

625
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I was like 24,</v>

626
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

627
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>and he was probably a couple of years younger than me,</v>

628
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 21 crazy.</v>

629
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.193
<v Speaker 1>I see them and man,</v>

630
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 1>it's what we were saying.</v>

631
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:34.841
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are,</v>

632
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>these are like,</v>

633
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 1>these are like soldiers.</v>

634
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.500
<v Speaker 1>They're like feller fellow,</v>

635
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>a fellow travelers in this weird world of show business.</v>

636
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a lot of pride in it.</v>

637
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

638
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:44.571
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

639
00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I did a New Year's eve show and I was in Ontario at the Improv and it was just</v>

640
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:49.391
<v Speaker 1>packed.</v>

641
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:49.511
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

642
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:49.900
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

643
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

644
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

645
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>we were about to count off</v>

646
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.083
<v Speaker 3>the new year and I,</v>

647
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I remember just stopping and I had the mic in my hand and I went,</v>

648
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 3>I really meant this too.</v>

649
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:56.781
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

650
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

651
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.000
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a successful person.</v>

652
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't believe I get to do this for a living.</v>

653
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:01.911
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

654
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 3>if I died tomorrow,</v>

655
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.171
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

656
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 3>I can't complain comparatively to what,</v>

657
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 3>how most people have to live their lives,</v>

658
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 3>their treasury.</v>

659
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.870
<v Speaker 3>And I get paid to make people laugh for two hours a night and I,</v>

660
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 3>and I get to do whatever I want when I want.</v>

661
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like the lottery.</v>

662
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy,</v>

663
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.393
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

664
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.030
<v Speaker 3>inventing yourself.</v>

665
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of lot of weird shit that goes on in the creating of material and</v>

666
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 3>the going up there and fucking around with it.</v>

667
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:24.411
<v Speaker 3>And two,</v>

668
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:24.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

669
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 3>and it never gets easy in a way.</v>

670
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Like it really doesn't,</v>

671
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's so satisfying when it comes out.</v>

672
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:30.351
<v Speaker 3>I just did it.</v>

673
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Just like we were talking about with Welfare and the lottery and all that shit</v>

674
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.120
<v Speaker 3>with you have to have,</v>

675
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that's different to me is relationships.</v>

676
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.181
<v Speaker 3>Relationships.</v>

677
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 3>I want no work.</v>

678
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.651
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

679
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

680
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 3>I want friendliness and love.</v>

681
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:43.783
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to work.</v>

682
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.431
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

683
00:15:44.431 --> 00:15:45.261
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to work for that.</v>

684
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I want to fight all the time.</v>

685
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Like there's people that think that you have to fight and I think that's,</v>

686
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 3>that's a crock of shit.</v>

687
00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 3>You just got to find something like that.</v>

688
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 3>But he a nice person and find someone that doesn't want to fight.</v>

689
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Comedy.</v>

690
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Comedy is one of the things,</v>

691
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:55.440
<v Speaker 3>like I just did a,</v>

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Or the civil rights and he just saw a reference,</v>

731
00:16:43.311 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 3>but he was fucking killing the room.</v>

732
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.470
<v Speaker 3>And then we were all backstage and I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I'm letting you know,</v>

740
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 3>about how did they just all have so much reverence for comedy?</v>

741
00:16:58.191 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's still not easy.</v>

742
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 3>No matter what and it's still a challenge and you're still,</v>

<v Speaker 3>bunch of people paid to see you don't so true.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you could ever do that shit on the road.</v>

763
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.040
<v Speaker 3>In some cities they'd be like,</v>

770
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're a famous Michael Richards out on the floor,</v>

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.650
<v Speaker 1>that is a good way of putting it.</v>

785
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Piven said that he goes,</v>

786
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>we sanitize it was a smart guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Brian thinks it's all,</v>

816
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Brian thinks it's all a scam to make two and a half men the biggest show ever</v>

817
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 1>next season when he comes back and his triumphant return,</v>

818
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 1>he thinks it's all orchestrated.</v>

819
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 1>The horrors banner of their show.</v>

824
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:05.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

825
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:06.241
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

826
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Apparently according to Hollywood insiders.</v>

827
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

828
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.130
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

829
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.963
<v Speaker 1>from cvs.</v>

830
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

831
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it Connie dog,</v>

832
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.621
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood insiders.</v>

833
00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 1>He actually has a very good point because the guy didn't show up for work late.</v>

834
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.580
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like he was missing set shoots and costing them money.</v>

835
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Speaker 1>He was always fucked up.</v>

836
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:23.610
<v Speaker 1>They knew it was fucked up from a long time ago.</v>

837
00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>They hired him under the premise that he was his party animal and guess what?</v>

838
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what he fucking plays on the show.</v>

839
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.780
<v Speaker 1>He plays a watered down version of the real life job chain.</v>

840
00:19:30.781 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

841
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a big dick contest.</v>

842
00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:33.871
<v Speaker 1>That's what it sounds like.</v>

843
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like him and that guy who was the executive producer there waving the</v>

844
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:41.220
<v Speaker 1>dicks around and the executive producer doesn't want this junky back on his set</v>

845
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:42.180
<v Speaker 1>and he wants to move on,</v>

846
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to ruin a lot of fucking people's jobs.</v>

847
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Stay was that he was able to,</v>

848
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 1>he could strangle a girl everything else.</v>

849
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 1>And then he made fun of Chuck Lorre on that radio show and that's when he got</v>

850
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.220
<v Speaker 1>fired.</v>

851
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Well that Chuck Lorre guy we talked about on the show before about all the shows</v>

852
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:56.820
<v Speaker 1>that he's produced.</v>

853
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 1>He produced grace under fire.</v>

854
00:19:58.261 --> 00:19:59.250
<v Speaker 1>He proves Roseanne.</v>

855
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:00.090
<v Speaker 1>He produced Sibbel.</v>

856
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.470
<v Speaker 1>He had to deal with con after comment after comment and he developed the ability</v>

857
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.670
<v Speaker 1>to put his fucking foot down.</v>

858
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.550
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

859
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's why he's so successful.</v>

860
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking good at what he does.</v>

861
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I guys got a gang of TV shows and listen man,</v>

862
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.630
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line is Charlie Sheen was probably very creatively unfulfilled.</v>

863
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

864
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's not to say the two and a half men wasn't a good show,</v>

865
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:18.421
<v Speaker 1>cause one,</v>

866
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:18.721
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

867
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:19.441
<v Speaker 1>I never watched it.</v>

868
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a single episode.</v>

869
00:20:21.361 --> 00:20:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad.</v>

870
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.351
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

871
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I watched like maybe one scene once.</v>

872
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy for Jon Cryer isn't the nicest fucking human being.</v>

873
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I met him a long time ago.</v>

874
00:20:28.801 --> 00:20:31.090
<v Speaker 1>We did a college together and um,</v>

875
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:31.800
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>

876
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did.</v>

877
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was him.</v>

878
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

879
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.270
<v Speaker 1>he's about to,</v>

880
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.410
<v Speaker 1>cause he was in a movie before then.</v>

881
00:20:37.411 --> 00:20:38.011
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that.</v>

882
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

883
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.530
<v Speaker 1>there was one of the first guys that I ever saw that had been in a movie.</v>

884
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I did a standup at this college.</v>

885
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Then he did something else.</v>

886
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:44.700
<v Speaker 1>It was like bigger than the same college.</v>

887
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.553
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty in pink.</v>

888
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:46.801
<v Speaker 1>It was something,</v>

889
00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:47.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

890
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.660
<v Speaker 1>somewhere on those.</v>

891
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was Jon cryer long,</v>

892
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:49.931
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

893
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

894
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.180
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that,</v>

895
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

896
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 1>he would probably mean the guy was in fucking platoon and Wall Street.</v>

897
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.440
<v Speaker 1>He was in two huge Oliver Stone's smash movies.</v>

898
00:20:59.441 --> 00:20:59.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

899
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 1>and they were brilliant performances.</v>

900
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So when he's playing this silly guy and this silly show year after year making</v>

901
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:06.791
<v Speaker 1>mad,</v>

902
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:07.361
<v Speaker 1>mad loot,</v>

903
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the money piles up.</v>

904
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.070
<v Speaker 1>But then the ability to break away from the mundane becomes more and more</v>

905
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:12.570
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

906
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the Catholic girl that wants to suck a dick and he's,</v>

907
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.370
<v Speaker 1>he's not being challenged as a grown man.</v>

908
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.900
<v Speaker 1>You didn't give yourself a fucking problem.</v>

909
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find a way to challenge yourself.</v>

910
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.260
<v Speaker 1>You're going to create a problem for yourself.</v>

911
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.390
<v Speaker 1>That shit happens all the time.</v>

912
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.450
<v Speaker 1>You get somebody to get to exactly what they want and they're a little too young</v>

913
00:21:28.451 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 1>to handle it or they get exactly what they want.</v>

914
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:32.290
<v Speaker 1>They have no where else that they don't have the imagination and figure out</v>

915
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 1>where else they can grow.</v>

916
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 1>They get in the fucking trouble.</v>

917
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Too much money,</v>

918
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 1>no imagination,</v>

919
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 1>and you didn't earn it.</v>

920
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.081
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

921
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking,</v>

922
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 1>even if you did or do respect the Charlie Sheen is trying to do is apparently</v>

923
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:44.020
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to evolve his show,</v>

924
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 1>so he's bringing comics and Russell Peters is going to come on.</v>

925
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:48.750
<v Speaker 1>He's going to tell us about it because Russell's been,</v>

926
00:21:48.751 --> 00:21:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I was in it for him.</v>

927
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>

928
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Someone please on Twitter verify Russell Peters,</v>

929
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 1>the Real Russell p.</v>

930
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.413
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>

931
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 1>So he can't get verified.</v>

932
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:58.211
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

933
00:21:58.211 --> 00:22:01.480
<v Speaker 1>he's having guests on the show are comics opening form comics.</v>

934
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.130
<v Speaker 1>What they do is the comics,</v>

935
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:06.740
<v Speaker 1>we'll interview him and there's video of him interviewing Russell Peters where,</v>

936
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.330
<v Speaker 1>or Russell Peters rather interviewing Charlie Sheen were Charlie sheen talks</v>

937
00:22:10.331 --> 00:22:14.530
<v Speaker 1>about accidentally leaving his gun out and Kelly Preston was living with him and</v>

938
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>she dropped the gun and shot her.</v>

939
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It shot the toilet and it ricocheted and hit her.</v>

940
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

941
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:19.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

942
00:22:19.491 --> 00:22:19.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

943
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.141
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

944
00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:20.740
<v Speaker 1>She got hurt.</v>

945
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.573
<v Speaker 1>How does that happen?</v>

946
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:21.940
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

947
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

948
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Junkie Shit on a gun though.</v>

949
00:22:24.641 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that usually goes off.</v>

950
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

951
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.070
<v Speaker 1>it very well could have been.</v>

952
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Charlie just has good writers for the show.</v>

953
00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:30.560
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

954
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.220
<v Speaker 1>they've probably learned from the mistakes of the past that they actually have</v>

955
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:34.780
<v Speaker 1>to make this thing interesting because,</v>

956
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:35.910
<v Speaker 1>well that's what they're doing now.</v>

957
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.390
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the story's a true story,</v>

958
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.370
<v Speaker 1>but apparently who knows how much of it's true.</v>

959
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 1>But Russell Peters was interviewing him.</v>

960
00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:41.800
<v Speaker 1>That's how it didn't.</v>

961
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Then Russel says a bunch of Lou really funny lines in between it and just fucks</v>

962
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:46.000
<v Speaker 1>around with it.</v>

963
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And so now that sort of become sort of a show,</v>

964
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

965
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 1>but I think they need to incorporate other things like they need to incorporate</v>

966
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:53.560
<v Speaker 1>music and some other shit.</v>

967
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I think I should just,</v>

968
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

969
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I haven't thought about Charlie Sheen and like three weeks.</v>

970
00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:58.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

971
00:22:58.931 --> 00:22:59.764
<v Speaker 1>but that's you.</v>

972
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:00.670
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>

973
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 1>That's guy.</v>

974
00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 1>He's got everybody's [inaudible].</v>

975
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.341
<v Speaker 1>He's got it.</v>

976
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:04.300
<v Speaker 1>He's got something there.</v>

977
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 1>If there's some sort of an interest moves to the country,</v>

978
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:08.800
<v Speaker 1>he starts dragging together a show.</v>

979
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:09.851
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

980
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of fascinating.</v>

981
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.003
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

982
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

983
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:12.521
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

984
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the guy that whoever the fuck the guy is inside of him,</v>

985
00:23:15.221 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 1>that was the guy that was in Wall Street or was the guy that was in platoon.</v>

986
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.390
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a bad motherfucker.</v>

987
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And if you could find who that guy is,</v>

988
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

989
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>people lose their way and regain it.</v>

990
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.173
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

991
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

992
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 1>And it might be through this humility that he gets out of getting fired from his</v>

993
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:31.100
<v Speaker 1>fucking job and bested in this Dick Contest.</v>

994
00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 1>What do these kind of like a hundred million bucks or something.</v>

995
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

996
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.750
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it might be in real estate.</v>

997
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:38.261
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it's,</v>

998
00:23:38.261 --> 00:23:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999

<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

1000
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times too,</v>

1001
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.000
<v Speaker 1>when he was making more money than any human being had ever made on a sitcom,</v>

1002

<v Speaker 1>he was making $2 million a fucking,</v>

1003

<v Speaker 1>he's definitely got mine.</v>

1004
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.173
<v Speaker 1>He's got some cash.</v>

1005
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't,</v>

1006
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>he's crate almost bought a hooker hotel.</v>

1007
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.650
<v Speaker 1>There was a train goes by,</v>

1008

<v Speaker 1>buy a house having that much money.</v>

1009
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1010
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's some haterade the haterade.</v>

1012
00:23:57.591 --> 00:23:58.690

<v Speaker 1>I have any,</v>

1057
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.120
<v Speaker 1>any sense of delusions of grandeur.</v>

1074
00:25:35.281 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 1>the lovely Brittany Palmer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's one of the ring girls with USC.</v>

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.393
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

1084
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Your friend Anthony's getting some of that.</v>

1085
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.030
<v Speaker 1>My buddies,</v>

1086
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:47.500
<v Speaker 1>my buddy,</v>

1087
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.690
<v Speaker 1>a writer and debated guy.</v>

1088
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I just saw Brittany boom.</v>

1089
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.081
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1090
00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:55.130
<v Speaker 1>she's very nice person and she is fascinated by the 70s and the 60s and she's a</v>

1091
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:56.150
<v Speaker 1>painter and she makes all these,</v>

1092
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 1>she's making all these different paintings and we were having this conversation</v>

1093
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 1>like I'm,</v>

1094
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:00.321
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1095
00:26:00.321 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm the same way when I listen to music,</v>

1096
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>nine times out of 10 when I'm driving in my car,</v>

1097
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to my iPod and it's usually like some,</v>

1098
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.040
<v Speaker 1>some like 1970 Zeplin or it's some 1970s almond brothers or Leonard Skinner.</v>

1099
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.210
<v Speaker 1>That shit to me just resonates.</v>

1100
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:14.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1101
00:26:14.641 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 1>when I listen to old music from like that era for whatever reason,</v>

1102
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:21.230
<v Speaker 1>it just resonates and I'm trying to figure out what is it about that time?</v>

1103
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.880
<v Speaker 1>What is it about the Jimi Hendrix,</v>

1104
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.170
<v Speaker 1>what is it about Jim Morrison?</v>

1105
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.011
<v Speaker 1>What it was.</v>

1106
00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:27.410
<v Speaker 1>It just because it was the first of that shit was it,</v>

1107
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.760
<v Speaker 1>was it because it was the first,</v>

1108
00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:30.960
<v Speaker 1>this giant evolutionary breakthrough from the,</v>

1109
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a combination of,</v>

1110
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:33.200
<v Speaker 1>of a number of things.</v>

1111
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:37.370
<v Speaker 1>One is that a lot of people back then thought their music was counted for</v>

1112
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:37.851
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1113
00:26:37.851 --> 00:26:38.570
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1114
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 1>they thought that their music could actually change something.</v>

1115
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:41.870
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of,</v>

1116
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.060
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what happens with artists as cynicism's</v>

1117
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 3>at times have a certain cynical a of stamp on them.</v>

1118
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.890
<v Speaker 3>And I think we live in a very cynical time,</v>

1119
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 3>the notion that nothing you do as an individual,</v>

1120
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 3>certainly as an artist could change anything at all.</v>

1121
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 3>That's very prevalent among artists.</v>

1122
00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have people who are doing standup,</v>

1123
00:26:57.721 --> 00:26:58.161
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1124
00:26:58.161 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 3>to try to break a social norm or shatter a social norm.</v>

1125
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.970
<v Speaker 3>You certainly don't have a lot of musicians saying,</v>

1126
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 3>my music is actually influenced the political atmosphere.</v>

1127
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Remember it was after we had been through in the 70s we just spin through and</v>

1128
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:12.810
<v Speaker 3>we're going through a terrible war in Vietnam and,</v>

1129
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 3>and you know how many people died?</v>

1130
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:16.410
<v Speaker 3>54,000 men were killed.</v>

1131
00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge number where if you compare the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,</v>

1132
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 3>it would say it was 4,000 death and a lot of injuries.</v>

1133
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:26.010
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying that in a very short period of time,</v>

1134
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.630
<v Speaker 3>we'd also been through a world we'd been through a number of that were in the</v>

1135
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Cold War.</v>

1136
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.360
<v Speaker 3>We'd been to a world war two and everybody had an act of memory of that.</v>

1137
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 3>That shit life really counted and mattered and people didn't live as long.</v>

1138
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 3>There was this,</v>

1139
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 3>there's this idea that you better hurry up and get through it and make your</v>

1140
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 3>fucking stamp while you still have an opportunity.</v>

1141
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Because if you looked around and let's take 1974 and you looked around at the</v>

1142
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1143
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 3>half the world was starving to death and,</v>

1144
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:52.861
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1145
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 3>and for the them and half the world with living under communist dictatorships,</v>

1146
00:27:55.981 --> 00:28:00.690
<v Speaker 3>which was essentially slavery and half the world was a very dangerous place.</v>

1147
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:01.524
<v Speaker 3>And that war,</v>

1148
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.970
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

1149
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.020
<v Speaker 3>there was an arms race called the nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and</v>

1150
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:07.651
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>

1151
00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:09.030
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people really were like,</v>

1152
00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:09.511
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1153
00:28:09.511 --> 00:28:11.160
<v Speaker 3>we could all fucking just blow up.</v>

1154
00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 3>The next war is going to be where the cockroaches and the rats are the only</v>

1155
00:28:15.001 --> 00:28:15.870
<v Speaker 3>things live in.</v>

1156
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:16.741
<v Speaker 3>And there's always,</v>

1157
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:19.020
<v Speaker 3>there was always that saying that if there is a third World War,</v>

1158
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:20.430
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Einstein who said the,</v>

1159
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.270
<v Speaker 3>the living,</v>

1160
00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 3>the living,</v>

1161
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.620
<v Speaker 3>the living will yeah.</v>

1162
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 3>And the living will envy the dead.</v>

1163
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:27.511
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1164
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:27.711
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

1165
00:28:27.711 --> 00:28:28.201
<v Speaker 3>that a whole lot,</v>

1166
00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:28.621
<v Speaker 3>that idea,</v>

1167
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:29.610
<v Speaker 3>cause you'll be start,</v>

1168
00:28:29.611 --> 00:28:30.150
<v Speaker 3>you'll be BCIT.</v>

1169
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going to start the Third World War,</v>

1170
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 3>what weapons would be used,</v>

1171
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 3>but the fourth world be fought with sticks such a great quote.</v>

1172
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 3>But the point is that I think when you live in,</v>

1173
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 3>in times of great uncertainty and times of great hope and times of great</v>

1174
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:44.550
<v Speaker 3>violence member in this country,</v>

1175
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:46.440
<v Speaker 3>we'd come off a number of assassinations.</v>

1176
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Martin Luther King,</v>

1177
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Malcolm X,</v>

1178
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>

1179
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 3>John Kennedy,</v>

1180
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Joe Kennedy.</v>

1181
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:51.990
<v Speaker 3>And it goes on and on.</v>

1182
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:52.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1183
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:56.940
<v Speaker 3>there was this notion that we were in a real battle and a real social battle,</v>

1184
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:57.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1185
00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:57.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1186
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.070
<v Speaker 3>for our souls.</v>

1187
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Man You had,</v>

1188
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 3>you had to governments sending young boys off to die in a war.</v>

1189
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Most people hadn't even heard of that fucking part of the world.</v>

1190
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.490
<v Speaker 3>And there was this idea that we're losing them.</v>

1191
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.210
<v Speaker 3>We're we gotta,</v>

1192
00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:11.190
<v Speaker 3>we gotta get in the streets and say something and do something more importantly</v>

1193
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:11.761
<v Speaker 3>if we do.</v>

1194
00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 3>So Shit will change.</v>

1195
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 3>And people were getting to hose down and black people didn't have the vote until</v>

1196
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 3>1964 it was only 10 years old.</v>

1197
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.710
<v Speaker 3>So when you think about how extreme things were,</v>

1198
00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:24.544
<v Speaker 3>and not only that,</v>

1199
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.950
<v Speaker 3>but how uncertain and how it was the beginning of so many different ideas that</v>

1200
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:30.790
<v Speaker 3>were competing that when,</v>

1201
00:29:30.791 --> 00:29:33.990
<v Speaker 3>when you get a very term but a society in turmoil usually.</v>

1202
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.190
<v Speaker 3>And what's very positive about it is you want to cross current of ideas.</v>

1203
00:29:38.191 --> 00:29:40.410
<v Speaker 3>You want ideas bashing heads,</v>

1204
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.030
<v Speaker 3>like fucking rams.</v>

1205
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.470
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1206
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.700
<v Speaker 3>and when you have that provided you keep the violence out of it,</v>

1207
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:46.650
<v Speaker 3>but there's always gonna be a little violent.</v>

1208
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.420
<v Speaker 3>But when you have that and people who,</v>

1209
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:48.830
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1210
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.730
<v Speaker 3>where they're fighting for their souls with an idea,</v>

1211
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get something pretty fucking cool.</v>

1212
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:54.671
<v Speaker 3>And you're,</v>

1213
00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:58.180
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to get certainly very volatile artistic expression and a lot of</v>

1214
00:29:58.181 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 3>that expression can very well be a miles Davis who was saying,</v>

1215
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm a black man in America with,</v>

1216
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:03.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1217
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 3>and I still don't feel free or whatever it might be.</v>

1218
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Or You could have,</v>

1219
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1220
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 3>beeper.</v>

1221
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I love Bieber is candy compared to think about it,</v>

1222
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 3>how much music counted back then?</v>

1223
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1224
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Jazz was the only place that a lot of black people could really express</v>

1225
00:30:18.941 --> 00:30:19.301
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1226
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:21.010
<v Speaker 3>honestly through a fucking horn.</v>

1227
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 3>So if your heart's broken,</v>

1228
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.200
<v Speaker 3>you are the sing it or you shoot it through a horn because if you say otherwise,</v>

1229
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get fucking hung or shot or arrested.</v>

1230
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.780
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was to be black in the 1940s,</v>

1231
00:30:31.781 --> 00:30:32.201
<v Speaker 3>50s,</v>

1232
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:32.651
<v Speaker 3>60s,</v>

1233
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:34.030
<v Speaker 3>and even the 70s for a lot of them,</v>

1234
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 3>that's the bottom line.</v>

1235
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 3>It goes on and on.</v>

1236
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:37.780
<v Speaker 3>So things were way more extreme.</v>

1237
00:30:37.781 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1238
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.531
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1239
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 3>in today's world where everything's at the,</v>

1240
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 3>at the touch of a button where everybody has plenty to eat,</v>

1241
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 3>even if it's not healthy food.</v>

1242
00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1243
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 3>and we feel safer and I don't think,</v>

1244
00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 3>and I think we're cynical,</v>

1245
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:51.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that what we do and what we say can really change the world.</v>

1246
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:52.300
<v Speaker 3>And back then you did</v>

1247
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.150
<v Speaker 1>the thing is the numbers just to many the humans now,</v>

1248
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1249
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's still people that rage against the machine.</v>

1250
00:30:57.761 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't kind of believe the same kind of shit.</v>

1251
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to face another,</v>

1252
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1253
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.520
<v Speaker 3>we're going to face,</v>

1254
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:06.570
<v Speaker 3>we're always going to face challenges as people and as a world and those</v>

1255
00:31:06.571 --> 00:31:09.450
<v Speaker 3>challenges may very well bring into question our own survival.</v>

1256
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so for a long time.</v>

1257
00:31:11.311 --> 00:31:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1258
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1259
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.110
<v Speaker 1>What's really changed in the world?</v>

1260
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:14.700
<v Speaker 1>This thing run right now?</v>

1261
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:15.470
<v Speaker 1>The Internet?</v>

1262
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1263
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Is this really the big change?</v>

1264
00:31:16.951 --> 00:31:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Very much the way we are right now.</v>

1265
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Our parents were never like this.</v>

1266
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.023
<v Speaker 1>These is,</v>

1267
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.760
<v Speaker 1>we're never held and it gives more potential Joe for the notion that all of us</v>

1268
00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:31.761
<v Speaker 1>could get together and springboard into an idea and a major shift in colleges.</v>

1269
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Something like this.</v>

1270
00:31:33.811 --> 00:31:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Like right now live,</v>

1271
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:39.240
<v Speaker 1>there's 2000 people listening to us live and this is a tiny fraction of the</v>

1272
00:31:39.241 --> 00:31:42.030
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that will listen to us over the next few months.</v>

1273
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:42.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1274
00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:44.340
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be hundreds of thousands of people.</v>

1275
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And these people,</v>

1276
00:31:46.141 --> 00:31:48.090
<v Speaker 1>when they start looking at the world,</v>

1277
00:31:48.091 --> 00:31:49.170
<v Speaker 1>the way you're talking about it,</v>

1278
00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:49.681
<v Speaker 1>the way you know,</v>

1279
00:31:49.681 --> 00:31:51.210
<v Speaker 1>stepping back and describing and say,</v>

1280
00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:51.870
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

1281
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:52.101
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1282
00:31:52.101 --> 00:31:53.160
<v Speaker 1>what is it to live with?</v>

1283
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:53.641
<v Speaker 1>Passion.</v>

1284
00:31:53.641 --> 00:31:53.941
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

1285
00:31:53.941 --> 00:31:55.260
<v Speaker 1>what is important in this life?</v>

1286
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:55.560
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

1287
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.430
<v Speaker 1>what is the fun?</v>

1288
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Where's the enjoyment?</v>

1289
00:31:57.631 --> 00:31:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Where's the,</v>

1290
00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.470
<v Speaker 1>where's the real true passion in this world?</v>

1291
00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it for you?</v>

1292
00:32:02.491 --> 00:32:03.121
<v Speaker 1>What is it for you?</v>

1293
00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:06.450
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't fucking find that your life's not going to be fun.</v>

1294
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:06.900
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1295
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.760
<v Speaker 1>And if don't get saddled down by debt,</v>

1296
00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:10.090
<v Speaker 1>don't get caught up in a lot of,</v>

1297
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but also have backing on that.</v>

1298
00:32:12.481 --> 00:32:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Great Point is,</v>

1299
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.340
<v Speaker 1>is you've got to find a way to keep yourself inspired.</v>

1300
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1301
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Find ways.</v>

1302
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what it is,</v>

1303
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.470
<v Speaker 1>just truly be doing what you enjoy doing.</v>

1304
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.353
<v Speaker 1>You'd be</v>

1305
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.040
<v Speaker 1>stoked that those fires.</v>

1306
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:29.220
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things about standup is the fear of bombing also gives you</v>

1307
00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:33.150
<v Speaker 1>another added incentive and motivation that I think some artists are without,</v>

1308
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:33.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1309
00:32:33.861 --> 00:32:35.890
<v Speaker 1>and they just produced books are just producing,</v>

1310
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1311
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.620
<v Speaker 1>they're just wait for reviews.</v>

1312
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.150
<v Speaker 1>But the fear of actual being in front of someone when they don't like you,</v>

1313
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 1>that's so much more intense than a shitty review.</v>

1314
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.020
<v Speaker 1>It sure as cause you feel it right away,</v>

1315
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:45.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1316
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1317
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's not,</v>

1318
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.611
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

1319
00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

1320
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 1>just life is temporary and we all need to wrap our fucking heads around that.</v>

1321
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:53.150
<v Speaker 1>If we all just step back,</v>

1322
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.590
<v Speaker 1>this whole world is moving on momentum and that is our number one problem as a</v>

1323
00:32:57.591 --> 00:32:57.891
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

1324
00:32:57.891 --> 00:33:01.400
<v Speaker 1>We're moving in the way that our ancestors had been moving and we don't,</v>

1325
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 1>no one ever just stops and goes,</v>

1326
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:03.171
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1327
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:03.441
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1328
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:03.711
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1329
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's just settle down and talk this over.</v>

1330
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a 30 day summit where we all the leaders of the world get together</v>

1331
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:14.540
<v Speaker 1>and try to figure out how are we going to redesign the human race to make us all</v>

1332
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:15.590
<v Speaker 1>function together?</v>

1333
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 1>How is there going to be a,</v>

1334
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:17.560
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1335
00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>a reasonable distribution of the natural resources of the earth so that one</v>

1336
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.730
<v Speaker 1>country doesn't grow rich because they have the fucking missiles and the nuclear</v>

1337
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:27.170
<v Speaker 1>bombs and that somehow or another,</v>

1338
00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:28.460
<v Speaker 1>it's distributed amongst everyone.</v>

1339
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.610
<v Speaker 1>So we get to some sense of fairness and all work together to make sure that</v>

1340
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:33.410
<v Speaker 1>people don't have too many fucking babies.</v>

1341
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 1>So we don't run out of food on this crazy rock,</v>

1342
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.441
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1343
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:36.681
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1344
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:36.951
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1345
00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 1>let's organize this thing and let's do it together.</v>

1346
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 1>The only way that's going to happen is the kids that are in college right now</v>

1347
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 1>who are listening to shit like this,</v>

1348
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:49.100
<v Speaker 1>who are going online and researching the world and looking at things in a way</v>

1349
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 1>that we never had the,</v>

1350
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:50.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1351
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.230
<v Speaker 1>the ability to,</v>

1352
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.810
<v Speaker 1>and the access to information that we never had access to.</v>

1353
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.501
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>

1354
00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 1>they're getting a chance to see the world from a fresh eyes and fresh</v>

1355
00:33:57.651 --> 00:34:00.740
<v Speaker 1>perspective and realize that this is some weird thing.</v>

1356
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:03.200
<v Speaker 1>We're all running in the same direction,</v>

1357
00:34:03.201 --> 00:34:04.820
<v Speaker 1>hoping that someone knows where we're going.</v>

1358
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.000
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1359
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.240
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1360
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:06.481
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1361
00:34:06.481 --> 00:34:07.191
<v Speaker 1>they're the future.</v>

1362
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:07.431
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1363
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:09.860
<v Speaker 1>you college motherfucker with the Bong right now.</v>

1364
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:10.723
<v Speaker 1>This is for you.</v>

1365
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.873
<v Speaker 1>Change the world.</v>

1366
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Just figuring out a way to sift through all the information.</v>

1367
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.000
<v Speaker 1>There'll be some in the system right now that will be sensitive to it and the</v>

1368
00:34:19.001 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 1>next wave will integrate.</v>

1369
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And the next wave of people that are trying to be politicians would be like,</v>

1370
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson will be like Ron Paul.</v>

1371
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.670
<v Speaker 1>They'll realize there's freedom and love and,</v>

1372
00:34:26.671 --> 00:34:26.861
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1373
00:34:26.861 --> 00:34:27.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1374
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.990
<v Speaker 1>and telling the truth and really trying to do the right thing instead of being</v>

1375
00:34:29.991 --> 00:34:32.090
<v Speaker 1>some bitch to a corporation,</v>

1376
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.180
<v Speaker 1>which is the most common,</v>

1377
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 1>most politicians are.</v>

1378
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Most politicians are little hookers there.</v>

1379
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Stick their ass up in the air and some corporation comes by and drop some money</v>

1380
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 1>and their pussy and that's what they are.</v>

1381
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we have to realize.</v>

1382
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:43.951
<v Speaker 1>We don't do.</v>

1383
00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:44.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be like that.</v>

1384
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:45.890
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

1385
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:46.723
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

1386
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.900
<v Speaker 1>The fear factor guy and the guy from a hangover to telling you how to run this</v>

1387
00:34:50.901 --> 00:34:51.900
<v Speaker 1>world by channeling,</v>

1388
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 1>take notes.</v>

1389
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Take blame the weed for the last five minutes of this rant.</v>

1390
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:57.711
<v Speaker 1>But it's true,</v>

1391
00:34:57.711 --> 00:34:58.011
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1392
00:34:58.011 --> 00:34:58.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1393
00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.020
<v Speaker 1>and I hear it,</v>

1394
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.100
<v Speaker 1>and not to say that this is why we're doing it,</v>

1395
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:01.281
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1396
00:35:01.281 --> 00:35:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I hear it all the time that this podcast changes the way people think.</v>

1397
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.001
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1398
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:05.481
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1399
00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1400
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1401
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:08.960
<v Speaker 1>having a guy like you in my life has definitely changed the way I think.</v>

1402
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:09.681
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1403
00:35:09.681 --> 00:35:10.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1404
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1405
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1406
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:12.170
<v Speaker 1>all of us together,</v>

1407
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:17.200
<v Speaker 1>we help each other and I'm very happy and very proud that we can dig and put out</v>

1408
00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:18.644
<v Speaker 1>this resource,</v>

1409
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.970
<v Speaker 1>not just for entertainment,</v>

1410
00:35:19.971 --> 00:35:20.161
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1411
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:20.961
<v Speaker 1>this podcast,</v>

1412
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:21.590
<v Speaker 1>but also,</v>

1413
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:21.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1414
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 1>it gives you an opportunity to hear another point of view that you might not</v>

1415
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:26.180
<v Speaker 1>come in contact with in your life.</v>

1416
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know too many people like you,</v>

1417
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1418
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:28.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1419
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to cultivate them.</v>

1420
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 1>I've done a real good job of trying to keep as many interesting people in my</v>

1421
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:34.820
<v Speaker 1>life as possible because I think it's,</v>

1422
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.800
<v Speaker 1>it's an enriching and I love you,</v>

1423
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 1>love conversations with you.</v>

1424
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 1>We have the craziest fucking conversations.</v>

1425
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1426
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.710
<v Speaker 1>But we have had more on a regular basis since I put together this podcast and we</v>

1427
00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:44.780
<v Speaker 1>have the last few years.</v>

1428
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.660
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like doing it.</v>

1429
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:46.381
<v Speaker 1>That's why I call it up.</v>

1430
00:35:46.381 --> 00:35:46.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1431
00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to do your podcast so we can hang out and talk.</v>

1432
00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:48.950
