<v Speaker 1>I'm getting treatment on my shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was that close to getting</v>

15
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this gentleman,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the chance to be here.</v>

20
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>What do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

21
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>A very short words today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very talkative before the podcast</v>

22
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it goes.</v>

23
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm hearing myself and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

24
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Weird you out?</v>

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>We can take them off as too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd never done a podcast like this for</v>

27
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is Excellent.</v>

29
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>We can take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have to.</v>

30
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take it off.</v>

31
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Is that better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a little more like a normal</v>

33
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to freak you out.</v>

34
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>To me it's better cause like I can hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if it's things are wrong,</v>

35
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>what's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the notes Daddy?</v>

36
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you got there?</v>

37
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of things I jotted down.</v>

38
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Just make sure a gift you all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information you want to hear.</v>

39
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to tell you that I feel</v>

40
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>super fortunate to have met you and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been treated by you and to be able</v>

41
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>to have these conversations with you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your office,</v>

42
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>which is why I wanted to have you here</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to you because I mean,</v>

43
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I was having some really significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder issues before.</v>

44
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you treated it and it's,</v>

45
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing the results and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

46
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've avoided,</v>

48
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>avoided in shoulder surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've had a tremendous result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

50
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're very thankful that</v>

51
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you're able to get that benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're in my community of</v>

52
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Orthopedic Surgery and sports medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>we're very excited about the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eager to continue to learn about it</v>

54
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>and see what it can be and how it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>help and what it does best for.</v>

55
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>What now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's all this stuff coming from?</v>

56
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Like winter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is this science coming from and</v>

57
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>how has it evolved over the last few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

58
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the stuff that we're using is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not new in terms of,</v>

60
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tissue or a,</v>

61
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's actually that the application</v>

62
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>for Orthopedic Sports Medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could go back decades to when</v>

63
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>it's been used in plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>for corneal ulcers is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original applications of placental</v>

65
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of it isn't necessarily new,</v>

66
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just that as we've gained more</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding in our community of</v>

67
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>orthopedic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're starting to see what the</v>

68
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>applications can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

69
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>when you say plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what have they done with it?</v>

70
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>With plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly helping with wounds,</v>

71
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>complication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wound healing,</v>

72
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>and the potential</v>

73
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>for there to be wound healing without</v>
<v Speaker 2>scarring.</v>

74
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the things that we'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into.</v>

75
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>How do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

76
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the mechanism of how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cell helps the process of the healing.</v>

77
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll talk about that for sure.</v>

78
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Now when they extract the placental</v>
<v Speaker 2>tissue,</v>

79
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>like how are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

80
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it on young women who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>had [inaudible] sections,</v>

81
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 2>crusher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bypasses a lot of the ethical</v>

82
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 2>concerns that a lot of people had during</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bush administration,</v>

83
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 2>which kept them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

84
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said a couple of different important</v>

85
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's start breaking that down a</v>

86
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing is,</v>

87
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

88
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 2>where does it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes from a young,</v>

89
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 2>healthy mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

90
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.710
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

91
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 2>this particular category of biologic</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment or cellular tissue,</v>

92
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this comes from a young healthy mother</v>

93
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:53.041
<v Speaker 2>that's having elective c section and</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior to the delivery has agreed to make</v>

94
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 2>a charitable donation.</v>

95
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 2>And then they have been screened and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a process that must be followed</v>

96
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 2>by the American Association of Tissue</v>
<v Speaker 2>Banks.</v>

97
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 2>And they have a series of blood tests</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have to go through.</v>

98
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 2>And so you're checking to be sure that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no communicable disease,</v>

99
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

100
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 2>hepatitis or HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 2>things of that nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so once that has been cleared and</v>

102
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 2>they're an acceptable donor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go through the delivery,</v>

103
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 2>the tissues collected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you said,</v>

104
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 2>this is stuff that typically would go in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the garbage.</v>

105
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:27.590
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

106
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 2>essentially the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:34.621
<v Speaker 2>the ethical and the moral dilemma</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't exist for that portion of it</v>

108
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:39.721
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise it's just garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's taken by the company that has</v>

109
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 2>harvested and they have their processing</v>
<v Speaker 2>center,</v>

110
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:47.940
<v Speaker 2>which also has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

111
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>evaluated and approved by this aatp</v>
<v Speaker 2>American Association of Tissue Banks,</v>

112
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a facility that is up to their</v>

113
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 2>standards.</v>

114
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 2>So they have a sterilization process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tissue's not contaminated.</v>

115
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Their packaging is appropriate that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>their shipping's not causing problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the tissue.</v>

117
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 2>So you have to meet all these standards</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very stringent.</v>

118
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 2>And so if you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a company has that,</v>

119
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>approval,</v>

120
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:13.970
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

121
00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 2>they meet the standards allowed so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff can then go either to an</v>

122
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 2>office or to a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the,</v>

123
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 2>the next thing of what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

124
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.150
<v Speaker 2>let's talk a little bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

125
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Bush and that whole</v>

126
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

127
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 2>that is about embryonic stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

128
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 2>An embryonic stem cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

129
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have anything to do with</v>

130
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:43.980
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

131
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.050
<v Speaker 2>an embryonic stem cell is when the sperm</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the egg join and begin to form the</v>

132
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 2>beginning sells a life and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially two cells and then it divides</v>

133
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>into four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

134
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the f the first five days of life,</v>

135
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>that's called a blastocyst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those cells can be harvested,</v>

136
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are what we call toady potent.</v>

137
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>That means they can become anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the ability to transform into</v>

138
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:15.851
<v Speaker 1>any line of tissue or Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in the case of that first five days</v>

139
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those individual cells can actually</v>

140
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>become a complete organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

141
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.060
<v Speaker 1>that's where we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>the cloning of the sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what happens.</v>

143
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took the cells in that first couple</v>

144
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>of days and then they divide process to</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow it to continue to grow.</v>

145
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you had two different,</v>

146
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>from a single sperm and egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had two organisms,</v>

147
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>complete mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:45.880
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say this blastocyst,</v>

149
00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>is that how you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the term for the initial,</v>

150
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball of cells that's formed.</v>

151
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>And how many cells is in a blastocyst?</v>

152
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dividing over the number of days</v>

153
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>in doubling each time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then thousands,</v>

154
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>not by that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

155
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 16,</v>

156
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>32.</v>

157
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>So if you have 32,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many different organisms can you</v>

158
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>make off of those 32 cells?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically,</v>

159
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>if you have a toadie potent cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every individual cell has the ability to</v>

160
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>become a complete organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

161
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>So that could be one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blastocyst could be 32 different people,</v>

162
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potentially.</v>

163
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that experiment's been</v>

164
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:22.920
<v Speaker 1>carried out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but theoretically at least.</v>

165
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

166
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now when they have like frozen embryos,</v>

167
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 1>when people do things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they decide they want to have kids</v>

168
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 1>later in life and they freeze their</v>
<v Speaker 1>embryos,</v>

169
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 1>how the hell are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

170
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>what's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not like a reproduction</v>

171
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>specialists so we might be getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Adam,</v>

172
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's frozen embryos.</v>

173
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they don't get used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

174
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works.</v>

175
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I know there's been battles,</v>

176
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>like people have had battles with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>wives and stuff.</v>

177
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>That's very much the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my understanding of it would be that if</v>

178
00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:57.441
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>you're freezing it with the intention of</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining the cell viability and so</v>

180
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 1>somebody has demonstrated that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>then thaw that sal and it still has the</v>

181
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to divide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce and you know,</v>

182
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>become a living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

183
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like for the non-viable</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones or the ones that don't get turned</v>

184
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Speaker 1>into people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could probably use those as well.</v>

185
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>

186
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 1>that's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing,</v>

187
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the big George Bush thing.</v>

188
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.481
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

189
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>so let's back up on that because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of misconception about</v>

190
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hear like very strange comments</v>

191
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>made about it all the time in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that George Bush signed in</v>

192
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:39.731
<v Speaker 1>2001 stated that the federal government</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not going to supply money for</v>

193
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>embryonic stem cell research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

194
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.290
<v Speaker 1>It was not a ban on the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on nation,</v>

195
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>on stem cell research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for all of that time,</v>

196
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean private equity companies in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>private investor could have and probably</v>

197
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>been spending the money</v>

198
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 2>to continue to research that and develop</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and find it.</v>

199
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 2>So I always find it interesting when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear on TV,</v>

200
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.240
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

201
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 2>our country has been set back a decade</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they signed to this,</v>

202
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:09.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill.</v>

203
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you feel that's wrong?</v>

204
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so,</v>

205
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all he said was,</v>

206
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to dedicate federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>money to it.</v>

207
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different than a ban on any</v>

208
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how much research does rely on</v>

209
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 2>federal funding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know.</v>

210
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's private funding for all kinds of</v>

211
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:29.210
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it more common now than it is</v>

212
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 2>before or is it always been the case</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's a lot of private funding?</v>

213
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So President Obama in 2009 lifted the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ban on the federal funding.</v>

214
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 2>So federal fundings been going on for it</v>
<v Speaker 2>since,</v>

215
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 2>since then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

216
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is the difference in terms of</v>

217
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 2>the viability of placental stem cells</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would get from a woman in</v>

218
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 2>necessary and section versus something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would get from a blastocyst?</v>

219
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a couple of things about that.</v>

220
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one there's,</v>

221
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually to our benefit in</v>

222
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:08.001
<v Speaker 2>orthopedics not to be using that line of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells because those cells starting from</v>

223
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:14.121
<v Speaker 2>that time point have the ability to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>teratogenic potential.</v>

224
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially form tumors.</v>

225
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.980
<v Speaker 2>So that makes it obviously a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>disadvantage because now we're,</v>

226
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 2>we're adding our risk to what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing once they've gotten to the point</v>

227
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 2>where it's a part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>

228
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call this like a human placental stem</v>

229
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:36.330
<v Speaker 2>cells or Mesenchymal stem cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that includes the placenta,</v>

230
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 2>the umbilical cord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Wharton's Jelly is a mucus type</v>

231
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 2>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's around the arteries of the</v>

232
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 2>umbilical cord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amnion or the amniotic sac,</v>

233
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Speaker 2>which is the inner layer around the the</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

234
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>And then the outer layer is called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cory on.</v>

235
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Now all of that has cells in it that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>would put in the category of Ms Inca,</v>

236
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 2>most stem cells or Mesenchymal stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>cell.</v>

237
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.560
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is they have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific line of tissues that they can</v>

238
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 2>become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now back to when I was explaining the</v>

239
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 2>formation of the blastocyst becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morella becomes,</v>

240
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an embryo eventually.</v>

241
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 2>So in that process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

242
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:26.511
<v Speaker 2>you have this ball of tissue and then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to kind of fold in on itself.</v>

243
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>And then it starts to layer out into</v>
<v Speaker 2>these three layers.</v>

244
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:31.740
<v Speaker 2>You have endoderm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ectoderm,</v>

245
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.960
<v Speaker 2>mesoderm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

246
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of those kinds of is directed</v>

247
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:38.880
<v Speaker 2>towards a certain line of cells and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tissues.</v>

248
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 2>The misa Durham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what these,</v>

249
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mesenchymal stem cells can become,</v>

250
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.030
<v Speaker 2>are all of the things that we care about</v>
<v Speaker 2>in orthopedics.</v>

251
00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 2>So cartilage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone,</v>

252
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.170
<v Speaker 2>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ligament,</v>

253
00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:52.620
<v Speaker 2>tendon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have that whole line of cells,</v>

254
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this particular sale has the</v>

255
00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:01.381
<v Speaker 2>potential to become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we talk about a stem cell,</v>

256
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 2>the by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means is one,</v>

257
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 2>it can divide and become another stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>cell so it can,</v>

258
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Speaker 2>it can duplicate itself so that now you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have another cell that can divide and</v>

259
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:19.501
<v Speaker 2>become another cell or it can divide and</v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiate into a cell that then has</v>

260
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:25.420
<v Speaker 2>the characteristics of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hoping it will become.</v>

261
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

262
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 2>directed in ordered approach in</v>
<v Speaker 2>embryology.</v>

263
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

264
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 2>treating an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're hoping is that that can</v>

265
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.760
<v Speaker 2>differentiate into the injured tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long have they been doing that</v>

266
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 2>while studies on that have been going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>for at least 10 years.</v>

267
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Speaker 2>So I want to say maybe back as early as</v>
<v Speaker 2>2007.</v>

268
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we've been,</v>

269
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.550
<v Speaker 2>if you go in a way back to the early</v>
<v Speaker 2>days of a arthroscopy,</v>

270
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 2>and now it'd be like the late seventies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and early 1980s,</v>

271
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know exactly what year,</v>

272
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have started doing this,</v>

273
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

274
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 2>doctor steadman at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

275
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 2>in Vail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado and he was in Reno and Lake</v>

276
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Tahoe area before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>

277
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

278
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 2>he's the one that developed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>microfracture procedure.</v>

279
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

280
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 2>You've had a couple of knee surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know if you've heard that</v>

281
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 2>term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have,</v>

282
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:31.270
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really recall exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

283
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically if a patient had a small</v>

284
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 2>cartilage defect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took a small,</v>

285
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an all or like what looked like a tiny</v>

286
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 2>little pick and made a puncture into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone.</v>

287
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 2>And what that did is it releases marrow</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements along with blood.</v>

288
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 2>And they were able to see with time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

289
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:55.420
<v Speaker 2>there were occasions when they got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have second look arthroscopy that that</v>

290
00:13:55.421 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 2>cartilage could fill in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they also found that that didn't</v>

291
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 2>become the native cartilage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes something called fibro</v>

292
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Speaker 2>cartilage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at it under a</v>

293
00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 2>microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks different compared to our</v>

294
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 2>normal cartilage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

295
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Appearance like physically looks the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same,</v>

296
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 2>but under the microscope looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

297
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.660
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

298
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main difference in,</v>

299
00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:20.290
<v Speaker 2>in what's applicable is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

300
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.610
<v Speaker 2>it's doesn't have the same structural</v>
<v Speaker 2>properties.</v>

301
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 2>So it was more easily able to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>come off with a sheer force.</v>

302
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.210
<v Speaker 2>So just picture like you were bending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

303
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.770
<v Speaker 2>You could kind of flake off or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in some cases just didn't form as</v>

304
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 2>well as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would want.</v>

305
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

306
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 2>so that experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

307
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:42.911
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

308
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 2>having conversations with the guy that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained with,</v>

309
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:50.401
<v Speaker 2>his name's Larry Lemak in Birmingham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He noted just over his career that he</v>

310
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 2>always felt like patients that had worse</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis,</v>

311
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 2>but they would do this microfracture</v>
<v Speaker 2>procedure on in knee arthroscopy</v>

312
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 2>actually would do better than patients</v>
<v Speaker 2>with less arthritis,</v>

313
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 2>but that they didn't do the procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it had always been in his mind</v>

314
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that somehow that marrow stimulation</v>

315
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:10.730
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was providing something that was helping</v>

316
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 2>with either healing or pain relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

317
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's only now that we start to</v>

318
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 2>because the bone marrow has some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mesenchymal stem cells available</v>

320
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:22.034
<v Speaker 2>also.</v>

321
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 2>And we'll kind of talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences and stuff like that.</v>

322
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 2>So it was essentially like a crude</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of some stem cell transplants,</v>

323
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

324
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

325
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our hope is that we're,</v>

326
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 2>we're using cells that can again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change into other things that we want.</v>

327
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 2>And when did they start applying this on</v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

328
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of not just tests and</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies,</v>

329
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:46.460
<v Speaker 2>but actually in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what you do?</v>

330
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

331
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.990
<v Speaker 2>in Orthopedic Sports Medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I started to hear about it</v>

332
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 2>until around 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the first year that I was in</v>

333
00:15:55.461 --> 00:16:00.461
<v Speaker 2>practice and I attended a conference in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Las Vegas and it was called the emerging</v>

334
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:04.580
<v Speaker 2>techniques in orthopedics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were kind of talking about</v>

335
00:16:04.581 --> 00:16:06.800
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the newest and uh,</v>

336
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most forward thinking ideas that are</v>

337
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 2>coming through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a company presented and one of the</v>

338
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:21.250
<v Speaker 2>physicians presented information showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had harvested fat tissue from</v>

339
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:25.010
<v Speaker 2>patients abdomens and injected into</v>
<v Speaker 2>their knee,</v>

340
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for patients that had knee arthritis and</v>

341
00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:33.770
<v Speaker 2>they were showing new growth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cartilage and,</v>

342
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 2>and actually improvement in some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>x rays.</v>

343
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at an x ray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some characteristics that we</v>

344
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Speaker 2>look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

345
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 2>define what arthritises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the patient has narrowing of the</v>

346
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 2>joint space or they have bone spurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that,</v>

347
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were actually seeing more space</v>

348
00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 2>between the bones and some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>serial x rays.</v>

349
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:53.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

350
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I saw that and that was just like so</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible and something that I'd never</v>

351
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 2>heard about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read about or you know,</v>

352
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>had encountered before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what kind of sparked</v>

353
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:06.320
<v Speaker 2>my interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are they doing with the fat?</v>

354
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Cause I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that they do stem cells,</v>

355
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:10.430
<v Speaker 2>the virtual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

356
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.060
<v Speaker 2>like a mini liposuction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

357
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.540
<v Speaker 2>And then they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

358
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:17.000
<v Speaker 2>they either spin it in a centrifuge or</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

359
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

360
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:22.700
<v Speaker 2>these syringes that you can pass it</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a filter and then you reinject</v>

361
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:23.130
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

362
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.980
<v Speaker 2>and what you're trying to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is again,</v>

363
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:28.880
<v Speaker 2>take advantage of the fact that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mesenchymal stem cells in the</v>

364
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:33.881
<v Speaker 2>tissue and like what can they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they just taking the fat,</v>

365
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 2>like when they spin it in a centrifuge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what does that accomplish?</v>

366
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just separates out the,</v>

367
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.530
<v Speaker 2>the cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you can inject the portion that</v>

368
00:17:42.531 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we do that.</v>

369
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Usually I've had it with PRP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

370
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.293
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

371
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 2>So just I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had with Regina King,</v>

372
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.090
<v Speaker 1>which is like a form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

373
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 1>PRP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

374
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a heated up and becomes like a</v>

375
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 1>yellow serum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

376
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.650
<v Speaker 1>So when their platelet layer of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and you're looking at,</v>

377
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.743
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

378
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red cells separate out and you can,</v>

379
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>you can easily see that in the tube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is the difference in the</v>

380
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:10.310
<v Speaker 1>results from someone who does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know quite a few people who've</v>

381
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 1>done it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had injuries treated where they</v>

382
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 1>suck the fat out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't any,</v>

383
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:18.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any research to differentiate like one</v>

384
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 1>of these treatments versus another yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not available.</v>

385
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:23.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's all anecdotal in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to patients.</v>

386
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:24.601
<v Speaker 1>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

387
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 1>people are collecting the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not,</v>

388
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not at the mature stage where,</v>

389
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:36.591
<v Speaker 1>where it's available and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>published stuff to look at and</v>

391
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.680
<v Speaker 1>personally know of anybody who's had</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good results using the fat</v>

392
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.523
<v Speaker 1>method.</v>

393
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

394
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:43.080
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

395
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.710
<v Speaker 1>a physician friend of mine in Memphis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee,</v>

396
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.540
<v Speaker 1>her name's doctor Laura Lenderman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

397
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.560
<v Speaker 1>she has utilized that quite a bit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's been very happy with the patients</v>

398
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:56.910
<v Speaker 1>that she's treated in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naturally.</v>

399
00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Some people do better than others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

400
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real,</v>

401
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 1>the rigorous study of this though is</v>
<v Speaker 1>still yet to come.</v>

402
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like d have you considered trying that</v>

403
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 1>or you just definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

404
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.500
<v Speaker 1>But you don't so far you just do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells haven't had anybody</v>

405
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:16.140
<v Speaker 1>specifically request it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

406
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe somebody wants to lose a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat and fix her knees.</v>

407
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

408
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 1>that's probably taking things in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction I don't want to be going.</v>

409
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:28.731
<v Speaker 1>But by plastic surgery are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know there are a number of different</v>

410
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 1>options in terms of where these sources</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cells can come from.</v>

411
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone marrow is certainly had a lot of</v>

412
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 1>use and Daniel Qca had that done.</v>

413
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what he told me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

414
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:43.290
<v Speaker 1>He had a pulled out of his hip and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said it was brutally painful then he was</v>

415
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 1>walking with a limp for like two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

416
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's a procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

417
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.900
<v Speaker 1>there's pain and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 1>morbidity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a consequence to,</v>

419
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting a sharp object into the bone and</v>

420
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:57.170
<v Speaker 1>drying them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.063
<v Speaker 1>So that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

422
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.320
<v Speaker 1>a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that word now.</v>

423
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like it either.</v>

424
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.320
<v Speaker 1>In medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more bid is a bad word.</v>

425
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.640
<v Speaker 1>We have conferences called Morbidity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality and that's where you basically</v>

426
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 1>own up to things that you've done a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible job with or explain,</v>

427
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why somebody has died as a result of</v>

428
00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 1>your care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a awful thing to go through and</v>

429
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 1>it's critically important to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluate yourself and understand what</v>

430
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 1>things happen when they don't go the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we want them to.</v>

431
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:31.431
<v Speaker 1>So it's an important exercise that</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicians go through to review cases.</v>

432
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.150
<v Speaker 1>So I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

433
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're dealing with people</v>

434
00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:36.630
<v Speaker 1>that are broken apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

435
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 1>essentially as an orthopedic surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with,</v>

436
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 1>people's bodies have failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

437
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Your limbs have failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ligaments have torn off the bone,</v>

438
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.740
<v Speaker 1>and these have exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

439
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 1>you've</v>

440
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.030
<v Speaker 3>told me some gnarly stuff in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of injuries that you've had to</v>

441
00:20:51.031 --> 00:20:53.940
<v Speaker 3>treat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I could only imagine some of bad</v>

442
00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:54.620
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

443
00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.453
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

444
00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 3>And so your time doing this with</v>
<v Speaker 3>placental stem cells,</v>

445
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:02.120
<v Speaker 3>how long have you been doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

446
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:07.170
<v Speaker 3>it's been a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So essentially you did mine,</v>

447
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long ago was it?</v>

448
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I think it was July of 2015 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of came in pretty,</v>

449
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 3>pretty early because Jeff Davidson to</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor from the UFC,</v>

450
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.580
<v Speaker 3>he was the one who told me about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he had shoulder surgery and um,</v>

451
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.200
<v Speaker 3>he was very stiff and had real problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the shoulder surgery and was,</v>

452
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm just very unhappy with his range of</v>
<v Speaker 3>motion and the pain that is</v>

453
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 3>experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he got some stem cell</v>

454
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 3>treatments and it just all went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he trains a lot.</v>

455
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trains really hard and he's very fit,</v>

456
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.850
<v Speaker 2>pretty impressed with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

457
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.910
<v Speaker 2>you know what he told me about how he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

458
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.460
<v Speaker 2>what he was able to get back to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

459
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had been treated with,</v>

460
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of injection.</v>

461
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

462
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he told me and then I was like on the</v>

463
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:52.811
<v Speaker 3>fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

464
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.020
<v Speaker 3>I'd seen an orthopedic surgeon and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only thing that was keeping me from</v>

465
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:57.160
<v Speaker 3>getting surgery is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

466
00:21:57.161 --> 00:21:58.420
<v Speaker 3>he put me through all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

467
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 3>stress tests where he pushed down on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>arm and all this time and I resisted all</v>

468
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:03.791
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

469
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:05.590
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of odd,</v>

470
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 3>but your injuries this bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have so much strength in your</v>

471
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:09.350
<v Speaker 3>joints still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

472
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe you should hold off a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit before you get the surgery.</v>

473
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.230
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

474
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.890
<v Speaker 2>cause I thought that when I examined you</v>
<v Speaker 2>two because I really couldn't reproduce</v>

475
00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:18.600
<v Speaker 2>your pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

476
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.200
<v Speaker 2>So and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

477
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.200
<v Speaker 2>that's another reason and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably would have been in the same</v>

478
00:22:25.201 --> 00:22:28.380
<v Speaker 2>boat as the first guy in terms of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

479
00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:31.260
<v Speaker 2>trying to make a decision about surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

480
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.140
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your physical exam doesn't,</v>

481
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show that somebody has some significant</v>

482
00:22:36.571 --> 00:22:37.440
<v Speaker 2>deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

483
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.810
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to make the jump to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody to surgery.</v>

484
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during normal,</v>

485
00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:44.130
<v Speaker 3>everyday life there'd be like zero pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

486
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Problem is what I put my body through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His has nothing that resembles normal</v>

487
00:22:48.141 --> 00:22:51.590
<v Speaker 3>everyday life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and kickboxing and kettle bells</v>

488
00:22:51.591 --> 00:22:56.591
<v Speaker 3>and archery and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just so much explosive movements</v>

489
00:22:56.991 --> 00:23:00.740
<v Speaker 3>and so much weight bearing movements and</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing really high demand stuff.</v>

490
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that,</v>

491
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.830
<v Speaker 3>in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the reasons why I was</v>

492
00:23:03.831 --> 00:23:05.180
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause like I don't want to walk around</v>

493
00:23:05.181 --> 00:23:06.890
<v Speaker 3>with a compromised body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

494
00:23:06.891 --> 00:23:11.150
<v Speaker 3>if I have to just get surgery and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>take six months of Rehab or whatever it</v>

495
00:23:11.151 --> 00:23:12.050
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

496
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.510
<v Speaker 3>for a type of shoulder injury that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

497
00:23:14.511 --> 00:23:15.980
<v Speaker 3>what is the rehabilitation time?</v>

498
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:23:18.741 --> 00:23:22.130
<v Speaker 2>for sure probably three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

500
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.610
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be longer than that.</v>

501
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.120
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

502
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.270
<v Speaker 2>somebody like you that in one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we,</v>

503
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:32.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have trouble with,</v>

504
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.180
<v Speaker 2>with some patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never even lifted weights for</v>

505
00:23:35.181 --> 00:23:36.110
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

506
00:23:36.111 --> 00:23:37.760
<v Speaker 2>So for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Rehab,</v>

507
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.050
<v Speaker 2>recovery and rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're introducing things to them that</v>

508
00:23:42.051 --> 00:23:43.700
<v Speaker 2>they've never seen or done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

509
00:23:43.701 --> 00:23:45.170
<v Speaker 2>And they don't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>

510
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being sore and in pain.</v>

511
00:23:47.751 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they should be conscious about.</v>

512
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's challenging,</v>

513
00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 2>it's hard work and it's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so some patients,</v>

514
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:58.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they struggle to get through that part</v>

515
00:23:58.371 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

516
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 2>in a naturally will take longer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve.</v>

517
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's harder for them to get their</v>
<v Speaker 2>motion.</v>

518
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Speaker 2>It's longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much longer for them to return their</v>

519
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:08.720
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you already have like a significant</v>

520
00:24:08.721 --> 00:24:13.520
<v Speaker 2>baseline level of strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much easier in your case to bounce</v>

521
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also the things that you would</v>

522
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.130
<v Speaker 2>do in rehab there are so rudimentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

523
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.760
<v Speaker 2>you would move through that very</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

524
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.100
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

525
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.600
<v Speaker 2>once you're at the point where you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>had enough tissue healing and it's safe</v>

526
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 2>to progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

527
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.091
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

528
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 2>through higher level exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could really push it and you</v>

529
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:32.691
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

530
00:24:32.691 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 2>you would be committed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dedicated,</v>

531
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>diligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'd almost have to hold you</v>

532
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

533
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:38.880
<v Speaker 2>that was another</v>

534
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.600
<v Speaker 3>question that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How often do you have people where that</v>

535
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue?</v>

536
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've treated a bunch of fighters and</v>

537
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 3>when you treat mma fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that an issue where you're trying to</v>

538
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 3>like slow them down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go</v>

539
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.610
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to let people know,</v>

540
00:24:51.611 --> 00:24:52.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of my,</v>

541
00:24:52.901 --> 00:24:54.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.470
<v Speaker 2>one of the lines that I'd say to all my</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients,</v>

543
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regularly is you got to respect biology.</v>

544
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to allow the healing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

545
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I know you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're moving good and you're</v>

546
00:25:04.961 --> 00:25:07.360
<v Speaker 2>ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be back on the court,</v>

547
00:25:07.361 --> 00:25:08.650
<v Speaker 2>on the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

548
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.280
<v Speaker 2>But if we don't take the proper</v>
<v Speaker 2>progression,</v>

549
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we risk having you reinjure and then</v>

550
00:25:15.071 --> 00:25:16.870
<v Speaker 2>you're right back in that same boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

551
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:21.400
<v Speaker 2>we only want to have you miss the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited block of time that you can.</v>

552
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.210
<v Speaker 2>So I never want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to miss one more</v>

553
00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 2>practice game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.110
<v Speaker 2>match workout or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they have to,</v>

555
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but same time we don't want to put them</v>

556
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:34.510
<v Speaker 2>in a situation that's unsafe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's always a,</v>

557
00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:35.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a balancing act.</v>

558
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.850
<v Speaker 3>So in your time of doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you had people that didn't respond</v>

559
00:25:39.851 --> 00:25:41.440
<v Speaker 3>to this particular topic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely,</v>

560
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

561
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And were they the people that we talked</v>

562
00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:45.910
<v Speaker 3>about before that don't exercise and</v>

563
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Arnie each shape or is it across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>board?</v>

564
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to go back and look and,</v>

565
00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:52.570
<v Speaker 2>and kind of critically evaluate each</v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

566
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly,</v>

567
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we worry about the patient that has</v>

568
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.070
<v Speaker 2>lower like baseline fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their overall health is poorer,</v>

569
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what their response might be.</v>

570
00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.730
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's information that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>still to come.</v>

571
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:11.410
<v Speaker 2>But definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

572
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.380
<v Speaker 2>some of the people that have responded</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most dramatically,</v>

573
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.540
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and John Dudley,</v>

574
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are fanatical about your</v>

575
00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:23.470
<v Speaker 2>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're working out regularly,</v>

576
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.500
<v Speaker 2>you're doing all kinds of things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimize your chance to not,</v>

577
00:26:28.601 --> 00:26:29.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this case he'll,</v>

578
00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:32.940
<v Speaker 2>but in other instances perform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

579
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.500
<v Speaker 2>and I have to believe that that has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

580
00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:36.400
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge factor.</v>

581
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.573
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would wonder what,</v>

582
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 3>how much of a factor it is if your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>is conditioned in a way to constantly</v>

583
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>generate muscle tissue</v>

584
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 2>and breaking down and rebuilding and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was always constantly under stress.</v>

585
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Definitely has to be a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

586
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

587
00:26:51.961 --> 00:26:56.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the typical realm of my</v>

588
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 2>specialty to be looking at all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>other factors.</v>

589
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 2>But I think with all of the information</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's becoming available,</v>

590
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 2>one of the cool things for me has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's forcing me to have to learn about</v>

591
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:09.310
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's forcing me to have to take look at</v>

592
00:27:09.311 --> 00:27:09.720
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

593
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.660
<v Speaker 2>how can we do better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we ignoring?</v>

594
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you're not looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>every aspect of that wheel,</v>

595
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.010
<v Speaker 2>then you're missing a chance to do as</v>
<v Speaker 2>good as you can for,</v>

596
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 2>for each patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

597
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.500
<v Speaker 2>and it might be things that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do before somebody even has treatment.</v>

598
00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:29.070
<v Speaker 2>We may have to bring them up to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>baseline level with a number of</v>

599
00:27:29.071 --> 00:27:30.690
<v Speaker 2>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

600
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

601
00:27:33.121 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 2>and the other side of it too is we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a,</v>

602
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.630
<v Speaker 2>we're in a system now where there's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much information,</v>

603
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person can't be your source for</v>

604
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you really have to have a good team</v>

605
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.440
<v Speaker 2>all around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

606
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself more and more seeking</v>

607
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 2>help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help and just saying,</v>

608
00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:53.310
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

609
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

610
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 2>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you help me with this?</v>

611
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Or explain it better or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I have the patient talk with you</v>

612
00:27:59.341 --> 00:28:01.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe get some more information.</v>

613
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:05.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think that may give them even</v>
<v Speaker 2>better a chance to do well just because</v>

614
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:08.190
<v Speaker 2>the options and the possibilities are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive and time.</v>

615
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.210
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

616
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.510
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a typical orthopedic practice,</v>

617
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a ton of time to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through all of this with every patient.</v>

618
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you just have to make sure that</v>

619
00:28:18.601 --> 00:28:22.190
<v Speaker 2>you're providing resources and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting them as good information is</v>

620
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I thought was</v>

621
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:25.770
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were telling me that there's been</v>

622
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 2>really good results with people going</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a sauna directly after treatment.</v>

623
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that there's been good</v>

624
00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:34.050
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

625
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the things that you've talked about</v>

626
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:39.780
<v Speaker 2>for other applications in terms of heat</v>
<v Speaker 2>shock proteins,</v>

627
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some belief that that may either</v>

628
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:48.390
<v Speaker 2>assist the cells and pro proliferation</v>
<v Speaker 2>or their ability to,</v>

629
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have as robust a,</v>

630
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a response as possible.</v>

631
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not proven.</v>

632
00:28:54.091 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hypothesis.</v>

633
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.410
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's interesting and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

634
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 2>it's falls into the category of a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that we're talking about</v>

635
00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:05.070
<v Speaker 2>where the science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic science is,</v>

636
00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we understand how it happens in the</v>

637
00:29:07.711 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 2>embryo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the developing child.</v>

638
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.460
<v Speaker 2>We know what it does in a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we can add these things to a petri</v>

639
00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:17.190
<v Speaker 2>dish and watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch these changes happen.</v>

640
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 2>But nobody has demonstrated this in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>

641
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.500
<v Speaker 2>in a clinical trial where we're treating</v>
<v Speaker 2>an injury.</v>

642
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.570
<v Speaker 2>So we have to be very careful about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

643
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:27.660
<v Speaker 2>And that in fact that the FDA is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear that,</v>

644
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cannot be making those claims.</v>

645
00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Companies can't be making those claims</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their products and physicians</v>

646
00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:39.171
<v Speaker 2>cannot be making claims and marketing</v>
<v Speaker 2>their practice to drive people to them</v>

647
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.960
<v Speaker 2>stating that these things were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

648
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about heat shock proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

649
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if you can answer this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is there a difference between the</v>

650
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:49.210
<v Speaker 1>heat shock proteins that you receive</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

651
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 1>say like a steam shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a steam room versus a sauna versus</v>

652
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:56.360
<v Speaker 1>even a hot bath?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of people saying that you'd</v>

653
00:29:56.370 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 1>get heat shock proteins from a very hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>bath and I think you would have to,</v>

654
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:05.440
<v Speaker 1>there would have to be some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>biopsy or blood test and you know,</v>

655
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:08.670
<v Speaker 1>sample like have people go through each</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things and control for all</v>

656
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:09.950
<v Speaker 1>those factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

657
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.080
<v Speaker 1>But the whole idea is just being</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in an environment that's</v>

658
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:16.630
<v Speaker 1>extremely hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where your body is like,</v>

659
00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:19.330
<v Speaker 1>what is this guy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it produces the heat shock</v>

660
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:20.750
<v Speaker 1>proteins to try to compensate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:30:20.751 --> 00:30:22.860
<v Speaker 1>As a protective mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the,</v>

662
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge of this,</v>

663
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people have been using saunas</v>

664
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 1>forever and it was all sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdotal,</v>

665
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.060
<v Speaker 1>oh to sauna makes me feel great.</v>

666
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And I would look at them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are these assholes doing?</v>

667
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go in there and sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was people that were</v>

668
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:38.380
<v Speaker 1>just like lazy and they didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose weight.</v>

669
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And so they went to the sauna and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they lost weight.</v>

670
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really did think they're just dropping</v>

671
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:46.150
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm talking to Doctor Rhonda Patrick</v>

672
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:51.151
<v Speaker 1>and she was explaining the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of a sauna where there was</v>

673
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:57.061
<v Speaker 1>one study where mortality decreased 40%</v>
<v Speaker 1>from all causes.</v>

674
00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Turning the guy literally using the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>

675
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All cause mortality was less.</v>

676
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40%.</v>

677
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Here it is right now using the sauna</v>
<v Speaker 1>four to seven times per week associated</v>

678
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>with a 40% lower all cause mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be heat shock,</v>

679
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>protein science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily.com.</v>

680
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

681
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can click on it.</v>

682
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Click on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young Jamie,</v>

683
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:19.950
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

684
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:24.790
<v Speaker 1>So get a little larger than the Journal</v>
<v Speaker 1>of American Medical Association.</v>

685
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So serious stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

686
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean that it's a peer reviewed</v>
<v Speaker 1>journal.</v>

687
00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume that there may be some validity</v>

688
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 1>of the information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

689
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

690
00:31:36.491 --> 00:31:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean if that's correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

691
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:40.480
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all I have to do is get in a sauna</v>

692
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

693
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:46.450
<v Speaker 1>can decrease my chance of death from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had all diseases by 40% like cancer,</v>

694
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 1>heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leukemia.</v>

695
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what a suitable replacement,</v>

696
00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:55.790
<v Speaker 1>hot bath won't be as robust but can</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase blood flow of eight Harvard and</v>

697
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 1>cleat increase heat shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she saying it just won't be as</v>

698
00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:01.330
<v Speaker 1>robust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say she's never taken one of my baths.</v>

699
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

700
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:07.170
<v Speaker 1>a simple thing to find out or like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do yourself is check your</v>

701
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.280
<v Speaker 1>heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood pressure,</v>

702
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:13.740
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take those as like a baseline right</v>

704
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.340
<v Speaker 1>on after each of those sessions and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's difference.</v>

705
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 1>How much is your body temperature</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevate during those things and how much</v>

706
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:25.300
<v Speaker 1>of it is a surface here is can you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't elevate your core temperature</v>

707
00:32:25.301 --> 00:32:27.040
<v Speaker 1>too much or you're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying,</v>

708
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 1>enzymatic breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these bad things are gonna happen.</v>

709
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder like what the line is the point</v>

710
00:32:33.671 --> 00:32:38.470
<v Speaker 1>of diminishing returns where the sauna</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes detrimental versus beneficial.</v>

711
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder like how a cryotherapy</v>

712
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 1>comes into play with that as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>because cold shock proteins also show</v>

713
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:48.090
<v Speaker 1>some great benefit in reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation and yeah.</v>

714
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.710
<v Speaker 1>So it was just an amazing time for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different,</v>

715
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 1>definitely the options that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>available to people.</v>

716
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I think at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

717
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.580
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of is,</v>

718
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being responsible about how we use this</v>

719
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:07.280
<v Speaker 1>information and what we're telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients.</v>

720
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:12.670
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of misinformation</v>

721
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:15.050
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people taking advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

722
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

723
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we want to try to avoid that,</v>

724
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to try to give people good</v>
<v Speaker 1>information so that they can ask the</v>

725
00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:24.230
<v Speaker 1>right questions and they can evaluate</v>
<v Speaker 1>places where they're going to see if</v>

726
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 1>they're comfortable with what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>being told and what's being offered.</v>

727
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:32.770
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's something like 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus regenerative medicine clinics that</v>

728
00:33:33.171 --> 00:33:35.210
<v Speaker 1>have popped up in the last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

729
00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means at least 40 of them are</v>

730
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My math,</v>

731
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

732
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe more than that.</v>

733
00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And they always 90.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

734
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I just think people have to be cautious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and careful about,</v>

735
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:49.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

736
00:33:49.781 --> 00:33:51.200
<v Speaker 1>what am I eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying.</v>

737
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 1>And some of these places have received</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct letters from the FDA saying,</v>

738
00:33:55.971 --> 00:33:58.670
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that he can't be making</v>

739
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:00.400
<v Speaker 1>claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

740
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.450
<v Speaker 1>go over some stuff that's definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

741
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Like platelet rich plasma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>PRP injections.</v>

742
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:07.430
<v Speaker 1>People have had real benefit from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

743
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:08.264
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

744
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has some validated outcome studies.</v>

745
00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a comparison study with prp,</v>

746
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:18.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis</v>

747
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:21.320
<v Speaker 1>comparing that to corticosteroid</v>
<v Speaker 1>injections,</v>

748
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:24.560
<v Speaker 1>which is a common treatment for attempt</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give pain relief.</v>

749
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the particular study that I'm</v>

750
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had 73% of the patients that</v>

751
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:35.351
<v Speaker 1>receive prp had relief of their pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to about 50% of patients with a</v>

752
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 1>steroid injection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a head to head study comparing</v>

753
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:43.370
<v Speaker 1>treatment and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advantage seem to be to prp.</v>

754
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between the</v>

755
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:47.470
<v Speaker 1>results?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've even know that</v>

756
00:34:47.471 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 1>it's between the results of PRP and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regena keen.</v>

757
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about that product</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

758
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what it is.</v>

759
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I know that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

760
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.490
<v Speaker 1>going on in Germany.</v>

761
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tate ranting,</v>

762
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Koby Bryant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those guys flew Alex Rodriguez or</v>

763
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.380
<v Speaker 1>thing Dana White did to the president of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>

764
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:07.900
<v Speaker 1>He went in there for tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

765
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

766
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 1>found through intramuscular injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a deep relief of tinnitus.</v>

767
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

768
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:18.630
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

769
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.150
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

770
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.470
<v Speaker 1>there may be great applications for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the different things that fall into</v>

771
00:35:24.471 --> 00:35:29.471
<v Speaker 1>this category of biologic treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time is going to tell us what things pan</v>

772
00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:32.660
<v Speaker 1>out clinically to be best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

773
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:37.661
<v Speaker 1>you can look at all kinds of factors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can draw conclusions from that.</v>

774
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 2>the proof is going to be when we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

776
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:45.810
<v Speaker 2>robust clinical studies that compare</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>

777
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

778
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:52.851
<v Speaker 2>we have follow up physical exams and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have follow up imaging to see exactly</v>

779
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 2>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know what we are hoping for.</v>

780
00:35:56.491 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 2>We know what we want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to see that.</v>

781
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this cell that has a potential</v>

782
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:04.950
<v Speaker 2>to differentiate into other tissue and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually causes healing.</v>

783
00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody has demonstrated that yet.</v>

784
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 2>There are some studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

785
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 2>there's 35 studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 29 or animal,</v>

786
00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:19.050
<v Speaker 2>there's six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six or seven that are a human trial.</v>

787
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw this a review paper and I</v>

788
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:23.520
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know if the review paper had</v>

789
00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:25.200
<v Speaker 2>been written before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the more recent,</v>

790
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials was published.</v>

791
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

792
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:35.230
<v Speaker 2>so the one was on a knee arthritis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the others were on mostly foot and ankle</v>

793
00:36:35.341 --> 00:36:36.174
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

794
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most recent,</v>

795
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as from USC and a in combination with,</v>

796
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:45.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a doctor that's in Indiana and they</v>

797
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:49.890
<v Speaker 2>looked at patients that had a knee</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthroscopy and they resected part of</v>

798
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:52.110
<v Speaker 2>the meniscus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we call it a meniscectomy.</v>

799
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.860
<v Speaker 2>And part of it was essentially cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a tear.</v>

800
00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 2>They cut out the bad tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they left the remaining healthy tissue</v>

801
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:04.820
<v Speaker 2>and they did an Mri and they measured on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mri,</v>

802
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 2>the volume of meniscal tissue and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>injected the patient with a bone marrow</v>

803
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 2>aspirate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in this case was the,</v>

804
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:14.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be Mac or bone marrow aspirate,</v>

805
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.353
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

806
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.470
<v Speaker 3>which is stem cells extracted from bone</v>
<v Speaker 3>marrow.</v>

807
00:37:18.471 --> 00:37:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Like the way Daniel Cormier they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

808
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.480
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

809
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they injected that into the knee and</v>

810
00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:26.660
<v Speaker 2>then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was four or eight</v>

811
00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:28.760
<v Speaker 2>months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was eight months,</v>

812
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.820
<v Speaker 2>they re imaged the knee and they found</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a 15% increase in the</v>

813
00:37:34.611 --> 00:37:39.260
<v Speaker 2>municipal volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the patients had apparently grown</v>

814
00:37:39.261 --> 00:37:40.100
<v Speaker 2>meniscal tissue.</v>

815
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I had a meniscus scope on my left knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

816
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.190
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

817
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.240
<v Speaker 3>an acl injury that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an acl surgery,</v>

818
00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:51.920
<v Speaker 3>but there was still some meniscus</v>
<v Speaker 3>damage.</v>

819
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.190
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

820
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.930
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

821
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time of the acl injury they tried</v>

822
00:37:56.841 --> 00:38:00.230
<v Speaker 3>to stitch up the meniscus and okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just tried to,</v>

823
00:38:00.231 --> 00:38:01.580
<v Speaker 3>tried to repair it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut it out.</v>

824
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.390
<v Speaker 3>And it was a problem for me for several</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

825
00:38:05.391 --> 00:38:09.320
<v Speaker 3>And then finally a tour became a bucket</v>
<v Speaker 3>handle tear where it locks,</v>

826
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it locked my knee.</v>

827
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I was brutally painful in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jujutsu class.</v>

828
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.990
<v Speaker 3>It was really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

829
00:38:14.991 --> 00:38:16.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to get it scoped and then once I</v>

830
00:38:16.791 --> 00:38:18.080
<v Speaker 3>got at scoped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was oak.</v>

831
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:23.110
<v Speaker 3>It was functional but it would provide</v>
<v Speaker 3>me with maybe every couple of weeks.</v>

832
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.520
<v Speaker 3>It would be painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There would be something going on</v>

833
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.260
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] it would be a problem.</v>

834
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.520
<v Speaker 3>You shot some stem cells in there a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

835
00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I've zero problems with it since zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

836
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't even acknowledge that I</v>

837
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:43.360
<v Speaker 3>have a knee that's weaker than the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>knee anymore.</v>

838
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even feel like that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My left knee feels exactly like my right</v>

839
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:47.584
<v Speaker 3>knee now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

840
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:52.890
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for a decade plus I had pain in</v>

841
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:55.370
<v Speaker 3>that knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

842
00:38:55.570 --> 00:39:00.570
<v Speaker 3>one injection a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing and it was almost within two</v>

843
00:39:02.831 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within two months after the injection.</v>

844
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I felt like a significant difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like waiting for those days</v>

845
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:10.960
<v Speaker 3>because those days when I pushed it</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

846
00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:12.980
<v Speaker 3>particularly after kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

847
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.940
<v Speaker 3>There's something about those like hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>pad work,</v>

848
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 3>like kicking the pads on the MTA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any particular things that you were</v>

849
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 3>doing that made it feel the worst?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the big one is just such a</v>

850
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.200
<v Speaker 3>striking cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Striking is just jarring and there's</v>

851
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 3>just so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just think there's just,</v>

852
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:30.490
<v Speaker 3>there was laxity in the knee.</v>

853
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Said a word to sound wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

854
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I know it's word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that it sounds,</v>

855
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.340
<v Speaker 3>it sounds wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laxity sounds wrong.</v>

856
00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:39.820
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a laxative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sounds like I'm making up a word.</v>

857
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was laxity from my laxative.</v>

858
00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that kicking motion would always,</v>

859
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it would just hurt and I would put</v>

860
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:49.080
<v Speaker 3>ice on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

861
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.440
<v Speaker 3>it'd be just go about my day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

862
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:51.011
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

863
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 3>It's not swelling up to now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something you don't think about.</v>

864
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:54.280
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's zero.</v>

865
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I ran a trail yesterday and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains like brutal steep trail for</v>

866
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:02.140
<v Speaker 3>two miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have zero pain in it today.</v>

867
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.070
<v Speaker 3>So this is</v>

868
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:07.930
<v Speaker 2>it kind of thing that I think gets a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us excited about what the potential</v>

869
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:08.680
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

870
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a patient here that you had</v>

871
00:40:13.241 --> 00:40:17.200
<v Speaker 2>him meniscal tear then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you had attempted to repair.</v>

872
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:22.230
<v Speaker 2>We know that about 15 to 22% of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail the meniscal repairs.</v>

873
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a disappointing number.</v>

874
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like things to be much higher than</v>

875
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:27.740
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what the,</v>

876
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.430
<v Speaker 2>the facts are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the,</v>

877
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>larger scale studies have told us.</v>

878
00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.910
<v Speaker 3>And to anybody that has a meniscal</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury,</v>

879
00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.390
<v Speaker 3>that's a risk worth taking because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what it feels like to have a</v>

880
00:40:38.391 --> 00:40:39.830
<v Speaker 3>bucket handle tear and someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

881
00:40:39.831 --> 00:40:41.540
<v Speaker 3>you have an 80% chance of success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

882
00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm in man.</v>

883
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:42.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it.</v>

884
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:45.240
<v Speaker 2>We'll also for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we know,</v>

885
00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:49.020
<v Speaker 2>this is why we will take the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for a young person that has the tear,</v>

886
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to preserve that meniscal tissue</v>

887
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.340
<v Speaker 2>and for as long as their life as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So certainly you are willing to risk and</v>

888
00:40:56.341 --> 00:41:00.750
<v Speaker 2>even you sometimes might attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 2>repair something that you think even has</v>

889
00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:04.740
<v Speaker 2>a lower chance just because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>young and you want to preserve that.</v>

890
00:41:04.741 --> 00:41:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Why you want to preserve it as we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you even resect a small amount</v>

891
00:41:09.211 --> 00:41:12.600
<v Speaker 2>of the meniscal tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Sapta 25%,</v>

892
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will change the contact pressure in</v>

893
00:41:15.691 --> 00:41:17.550
<v Speaker 2>the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they do these,</v>

894
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>color pressure studies where it,</v>

895
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.990
<v Speaker 2>it shows you the amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of force and its distribution.</v>

896
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.700
<v Speaker 2>And with a normal meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's evenly distributed into the,</v>

897
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the medial femoral condyles the end</v>

898
00:41:31.801 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>of the femur and the tibial plateau is</v>

899
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.460
<v Speaker 1>the top part of the Shin Bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when those come together with a</v>

900
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 1>normal meniscus in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pressure's,</v>

901
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 1>even if you resect part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you see this point loading.</v>

902
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:47.180
<v Speaker 1>So you see these hot spots where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a much greater amount of pr of</v>

903
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like when you go to a restaurant</v>

904
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:52.670
<v Speaker 1>and you're sitting at a table and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wobbly and you have to stick a napkin</v>

905
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:54.990
<v Speaker 1>under one of the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about analogy?</v>

906
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably bad analogy.</v>

907
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Not following you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't,</v>

908
00:41:57.951 --> 00:41:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that.</v>

909
00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Eating is dump then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

910
00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy comes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of test the one leg a little</v>

911
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:04.761
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

912
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:07.370
<v Speaker 1>A piece of a wedge under there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know what you're saying.</v>

913
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it's not the best,</v>

914
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

915
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.910
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

916
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swung and I missed.</v>

917
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Let's continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

918
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.780
<v Speaker 1>But the point of this story is that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if we cut part of that out,</v>

919
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.140
<v Speaker 1>your cartilage is going to have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear and tear over time.</v>

920
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you develop symptoms from</v>

921
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:25.700
<v Speaker 1>that is hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to predict.</v>

922
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that that's what was</v>

923
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:31.880
<v Speaker 1>going on with my knee because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was uneven and the jarring</v>

924
00:42:31.881 --> 00:42:34.610
<v Speaker 1>action of kicking a heavy bag or kicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>pads.</v>

925
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.400
<v Speaker 1>So I think that what I was trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

926
00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:40.280
<v Speaker 1>and I was taking the long path to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was that,</v>

927
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past what we might've said is,</v>

928
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

929
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 1>you had an acl tear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had meniscus tear,</v>

930
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your niece crappy,</v>

931
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.760
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to have some pain,</v>

932
00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 1>but in what are you trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you kickbox and for eight year</v>

933
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:54.980
<v Speaker 1>age anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that this is,</v>

934
00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:56.270
<v Speaker 1>this would be the attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

935
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really what that means is I'm</v>

936
00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable because I don't have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy solution for you.</v>

937
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.560
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to blame you for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also people wanting you to adopt</v>

938
00:43:06.561 --> 00:43:10.100
<v Speaker 1>their lifestyle or them to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lifestyle is foolhardy.</v>

939
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:14.150
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just trying to find an easy solution</v>

940
00:43:14.151 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't come back into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>office and complain about something that</v>

941
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 1>we don't have an easy solution for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

942
00:43:19.761 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying to talk sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>into you.</v>

943
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 1>That might be true to their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

944
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:26.860
<v Speaker 1>like if you don't do martial arts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see some knuckleheads out there,</v>

945
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.210
<v Speaker 1>risk of having to come to my office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

946
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:32.780
<v Speaker 1>It's also you see someone who's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and hurting themselves and you tell</v>

947
00:43:32.781 --> 00:43:33.261
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

948
00:43:33.261 --> 00:43:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

949
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 1>cause you think you're doing the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing by telling them that.</v>

950
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

951
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:40.430
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially telling someone that</v>

952
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.530
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff that makes you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

953
00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 1>alleviates stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>builds confidence.</v>

954
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:48.110
<v Speaker 1>It makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your soul.</v>

955
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part.</v>

956
00:43:49.191 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how am I supposed to rip that away</v>

957
00:43:51.531 --> 00:43:54.470
<v Speaker 1>from me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some people it becomes a real,</v>

958
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously with certain injuries.</v>

959
00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:56.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

960
00:43:56.781 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people we have to have the hard</v>

961
00:43:58.791 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

962
00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you want to keep doing this.</v>

963
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I know you think you're heading that</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

964
00:44:04.251 --> 00:44:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but this is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when they do replacements now</v>

965
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.860
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who's got a knee</v>

966
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:13.280
<v Speaker 1>replacement and one of the things he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying actually I know quite a few</v>

967
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:14.710
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them was on the podcast,</v>

968
00:44:14.711 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 1>his name is Dan Pena and he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

969
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is with his knees is they</v>

970
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 1>only been this way.</v>

971
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Now they don't move side to side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no lateral movement and the</v>

972
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:27.470
<v Speaker 1>knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no wiggle room.</v>

973
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.670
<v Speaker 1>He can't go side to side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the knee is just goes straight up</v>

974
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and back like this artificial ne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

975
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

976
00:44:37.031 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 1>you got skeptical hippo face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on a lot of factors.</v>

977
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe for him,</v>

978
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be other patients that don't</v>

979
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Speaker 1>have quite as much stiffness in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>knee,</v>

980
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.610
<v Speaker 1>but no one who gets a hip replacement is</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing triathlons.</v>

981
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a knee replacement rather,</v>

982
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:58.170
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

983
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:03.150
<v Speaker 1>So it's limited with 100% certainty that</v>
<v Speaker 1>implant will loosen and fall apart.</v>

984
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't they make a knee of fake knee</v>

985
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.610
<v Speaker 1>that's as good as a real knee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

986
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a long question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they lazy?</v>

987
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>

988
00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly lots of motivation and uh,</v>

989
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an now,</v>

990
00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they could fix a Ni and turn a knee</v>

991
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 1>into a superior need to the need that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have now.</v>

992
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

993
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like an overall question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

994
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Why can you not a replace something</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than you can repair it will</v>

995
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't we want to be going more</v>

996
00:45:40.501 --> 00:45:45.501
<v Speaker 1>towards repair and renewal regeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're hoping that we can figure</v>

997
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:48.310
<v Speaker 1>something out for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what factors did.</v>

998
00:45:48.311 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 1>The knee replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a metal component that you're</v>

999
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:53.230
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1000
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:57.140
<v Speaker 1>cementing to the bone or you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1001
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 1>applying it to the bone and having bony</v>
<v Speaker 1>in growth into the implant.</v>

1002
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.560
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an interface between that</v>

1003
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:09.770
<v Speaker 1>implant and the body and to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that would never allow that to</v>

1004
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:12.540
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1005
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you do that?</v>

1006
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who had bone cancer.</v>

1007
00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:22.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a really kind of a terrible story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he lived near a golf course and the</v>

1008
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:25.800
<v Speaker 1>golf course used these horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>pesticides and it leaked into the ground</v>

1009
00:46:25.801 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 1>water and all the people in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood got cancer,</v>

1010
00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:33.060
<v Speaker 1>like a huge epidemic of cancer in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and he got bone cancer and</v>

1011
00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:37.720
<v Speaker 1>they replaced one of his femurs with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal rod and uh,</v>

1012
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.770
<v Speaker 1>it causes him significant discomfort in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those,</v>

1013
00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 1>in my training.</v>

1014
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swore.</v>

1015
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:44.940
<v Speaker 1>What's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>is rejecting it,</v>

1028
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't know what to do with action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you got this big hunk of metal</v>

<v Speaker 1>and the up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:28.500
<v Speaker 1>this sort of slime layer that can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1033
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:33.880
<v Speaker 1>blood can't get to the metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you formed this layer and then it's</v>

1034
00:47:33.881 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 1>just once it's contaminated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't control it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just the,</v>

1038
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that's produced by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria adheres to the metal.</v>

1039
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1040
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.610

<v Speaker 1>There's so much opportunity.</v>

1041
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Got An image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>

1048
00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Hold it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't come.</v>

1049
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 1>You're a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

1050
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.460
<v Speaker 1>How dare you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pull it up.</v>

1051
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do,</v>

1052
00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:21.910
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm feeling bad.</v>

1053
00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where you're going to get</v>

1054
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:26.010
<v Speaker 1>the total femur.</v>

1055
00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:26.520
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.770
<v Speaker 1>That's go large with that sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that.</v>

1057
00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy Jesus.</v>

1058
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Whoa my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1059
00:48:36.731 --> 00:48:39.430
<v Speaker 1>what am I looking at there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the f the Femur,</v>

1060
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a metal femur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the</v>

1061
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 1>just google replaced Femur and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flags opened up there and you have</v>

1062
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:50.190
<v Speaker 1>to make measurements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's basically a,</v>

1063
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.310
<v Speaker 1>a total knee and a total hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of the bone in between has</v>

1064
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:59.311
<v Speaker 1>been replaced with that metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your foot's just attached to</v>

1065
00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:01.840
<v Speaker 1>your regular Shin below it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1066
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.780
<v Speaker 1>And what does this normally used for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how often?</v>

1067
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.700
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1068
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:09.400
<v Speaker 1>so that would be in the case of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection and you know,</v>

1069
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.500
<v Speaker 1>there's the cases that we had were</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually multiple fractures below a hip</v>

1070
00:49:14.501 --> 00:49:19.501
<v Speaker 1>replacement and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then below a longer stem hip</v>

1071
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:20.770
<v Speaker 1>replacements.</v>

1072
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got just no bone.</v>

1073
00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other reason would be infected bone</v>

1074
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 1>that you had to resect and then still</v>
<v Speaker 1>another reason would be in the case of</v>

1075
00:49:29.441 --> 00:49:32.050
<v Speaker 1>tumor where you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing limb salvage.</v>

1076
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was this gentleman's now that one</v>

1077
00:49:34.421 --> 00:49:37.910
<v Speaker 1>above Jamie where it's got like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>spreading it apart afar.</v>

1078
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there,</v>

1079
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there and what's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff on the outside,</v>

1080
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 1>that orange stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1081
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1082
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 1>that's called io band and it's a thin</v>
<v Speaker 1>film that we cover over where we're</v>

1083
00:49:50.111 --> 00:49:53.020
<v Speaker 1>making an incision in surgery is to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent infection.</v>

1084
00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So we naturally have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1085
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:59.140
<v Speaker 1>staff and other bacteria on the surface</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the skin and you put this sticker</v>

1086
00:49:59.141 --> 00:50:03.100
<v Speaker 1>cover on top of the skin and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's around the wound is,</v>

1087
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>is contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says play video.</v>

1088
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I think you should listen to him.</v>

1089
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Click on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what that is.</v>

1090
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see who this is.</v>

1091
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a picture of that that says</v>

1092
00:50:11.861 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 1>that I could visit page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click play video and here we go.</v>

1093
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

1094
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I get nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Daddy.</v>

1095
00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Whoa boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

1096
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Now that seems valley view surgery</v>
<v Speaker 1>through incisions,</v>

1097
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:29.120
<v Speaker 1>like better about this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1098
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 1>a little tiny incisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that seems odd because that seems</v>

1099
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:35.540
<v Speaker 1>like a very old person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm looking at the lack of muscle</v>

1100
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:38.180
<v Speaker 1>tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either very old or very unathletic.</v>

1101
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:39.403
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1102
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like good evaluation.</v>

1103
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.030
<v Speaker 1>That's incredibly traumatic then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1104
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does someone recover from that?</v>

1105
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's slow</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1106
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Is there a potential use of stem cells</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the case of like,</v>

1107
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible to regenerate a bone?</v>

1108
00:50:57.531 --> 00:51:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I know they've built a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a artificial bladder through</v>

1109
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:05.720
<v Speaker 1>sympathetically bone is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissues that is a part of that line of</v>

1110
00:51:05.721 --> 00:51:07.160
<v Speaker 1>the Mesenchymal stem cells.</v>

1111
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying is from the Misa</v>

1112
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Durham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that could be something</v>

1113
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 1>down the line that they could be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish there?</v>

1114
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing that femur and it's cartilage</v>

1115
00:51:18.171 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 1>covering at the knee and the hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1116
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that's at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1117
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.473
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy.</v>

1118
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that one,</v>

1119
00:51:24.521 --> 00:51:27.140
<v Speaker 1>but I said when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when if someone came up to the person</v>

1120
00:51:27.141 --> 00:51:28.490
<v Speaker 1>that had the telegraph and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1121
00:51:28.491 --> 00:51:30.800
<v Speaker 1>do you think one day I'll be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>send Dick Pics from this thing?</v>

1122
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:34.250
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well right now that's the fantasy,</v>

1123
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>

1124
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Probably most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they would look at you like</v>

1125
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:41.690
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when I was a,</v>

1126
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 1>this is an embarrassing story to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was about 13 I went next door</v>

1127
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:51.950
<v Speaker 1>to my neighbor's house and he was kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a computer nerd at the time.</v>

1128
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:56.340
<v Speaker 1>But you know computer nerds at the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>or playing with like commodore 64 right?</v>

1129
00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.940
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude look at this.</v>

1130
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I can hook my computer up to the phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can type on the screen in my</v>

1131
00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 1>friend down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see what I wrote.</v>

1132
00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.980
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the dumbest thing I've ever</v>

1133
00:52:09.981 --> 00:52:10.491
<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1134
00:52:10.491 --> 00:52:14.000
<v Speaker 1>can we like go play football?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talking about,</v>

1135
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.210
<v Speaker 1>so apparently not very forward thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1136
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Cause obviously we're doing that quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit now.</v>

1137
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I had a showtime special in 2005 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix special actually that eventually</v>

1138
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:27.980
<v Speaker 1>wound up on showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had a joke in there about cell</v>

1139
00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:29.540
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1140
00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:33.320
<v Speaker 1>about people sending you a text message</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the part of the joke was like,</v>

1141
00:52:33.321 --> 00:52:36.200
<v Speaker 1>it takes you four presses to get an S.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1142
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Like why don't you just call me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like it was before anybody had</v>

1143
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:40.440
<v Speaker 1>figured out.</v>

1144
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll keyboard and I'm like,</v>

1145
00:52:42.981 --> 00:52:45.770
<v Speaker 1>why are you making me read like this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so stupid.</v>

1146
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just like a dumb trend</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was going to go away.</v>

1147
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And now if someone calls me I will fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1148
00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Call me for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1149
00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange what's happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>just 12 years.</v>

1150
00:52:57.830 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chill little shift in how we</v>

1151
00:52:59.361 --> 00:53:00.530
<v Speaker 1>communicate with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1152
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 1>A massive one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how uh,</v>

1153
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:07.870
<v Speaker 1>how disruptive to your life is it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to like send emails now?</v>

1154
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean to sit down and like type and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>like email,</v>

1155
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:14.360
<v Speaker 1>respond back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some emails you like,</v>

1156
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 1>people email me with like a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

1157
00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a big chore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like homework,</v>

1158
00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I got to sit down and it takes a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1159
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1160
00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.720
<v Speaker 1>a text is like a quick response like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Matt stags who contacts people,</v>

1167
00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:36.210

<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1168
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.600
<v Speaker 3>So like a lot of the booking and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things that I do,</v>

1169
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 3>I contact people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to do it is through an</v>

1170
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:44.161
<v Speaker 3>email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1171
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:44.941
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1172
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 3>I would really love to talk to you about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this or that.</v>

1173
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:48.710
<v Speaker 3>I have a question about that brief</v>
<v Speaker 3>emails.</v>

1174
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 3>I would bet sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1175
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.710
<v Speaker 3>but I've gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1176
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 3>I've had some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1177
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:57.510
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem is the volume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sheer volume I get is just</v>

1178
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.940
<v Speaker 3>unmanageable to the point where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>think I'm ignoring them.</v>

1179
00:54:00.941 --> 00:54:01.411
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1180
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:03.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not ignoring you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even see it.</v>

1181
00:54:03.061 --> 00:54:05.910
<v Speaker 3>It just got lost in the tsunami of</v>
<v Speaker 3>emails that came in.</v>

1182
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I go on vacation,</v>

1183
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 3>I hardly communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely do anything.</v>

1184
00:54:10.861 --> 00:54:13.500
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll put up a social media post</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1185
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.670
<v Speaker 3>just just to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's kind of a part of the job.</v>

1186
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't pay attention to the emails.</v>

1187
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 3>I just leave him alone and then I get</v>
<v Speaker 3>home and I'll go,</v>

1188
00:54:22.261 --> 00:54:24.210
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 2000 emails.</v>

1189
00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll have 2000 emails in a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1190
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exaggerating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you go through all this?</v>

1191
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I do my best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to.</v>

1192
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:33.320

<v Speaker 3>I look for people that are important and</v>

1198
00:54:45.451 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Speaker 3>helps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people that are important to me get</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just want to let you know,</v>

1205
00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.160
<v Speaker 3>you won't tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't like to be on the outside.</v>

1206
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.330
<v Speaker 3>You tell him about that and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1207
00:55:00.331 --> 00:55:01.260
<v Speaker 3>which one way up,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1209

<v Speaker 3>What list of mine?</v>

1210
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Why worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

1211
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:06.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.240

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1213
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:13.260
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder when it's going to pass what</v>

1214
00:55:13.261 --> 00:55:13.981
<v Speaker 3>we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1215
00:55:13.981 --> 00:55:17.160
<v Speaker 3>when it's not going to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be typing like what's</v>

1216
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:18.800
<v Speaker 3>the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1217
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:19.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1218
00:55:19.561 --> 00:55:22.230
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not going to be videos</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you force people to watch.</v>

1219
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.050
<v Speaker 3>The beautiful thing about an emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can kind of scan it through.</v>

1220
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.120
<v Speaker 3>What's this guy saying not interested.</v>

1221
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you messed around with a like</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1223
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.170

<v Speaker 3>It's amazing for notes when you're in a</v>

1224
00:55:34.171 --> 00:55:37.770
<v Speaker 3>car or when I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no way I could type it on my phone that</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>

1226
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen how good it works?</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

1239
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.420
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is,</v>

1240
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.900
<v Speaker 3>it really is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can do that in your car if you</v>

1241
00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:12.270
<v Speaker 3>have an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're not some asshole is texting</v>

1242
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:16.080
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes like neal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neal Brennan had the best analogy for</v>

1243
00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:16.381
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1244
00:56:16.381 --> 00:56:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Neal Brennan is standup comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Co creator of the Chappelle show.</v>

1245
00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 3>He had the best analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1246
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.030
<v Speaker 3>my notebook is essentially like a net</v>
<v Speaker 3>for catching ideas.</v>

1247
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've got to catch those ideas as</v>

1248
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 3>quick as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's a good way of looking at</v>

1249
00:56:28.901 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're,</v>

1250
00:56:30.521 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 3>if I'm in a car and I have an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1251
00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:35.020
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get this out before I forget.</v>

1252
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:38.440
<v Speaker 3>So I start repeating it to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if I'm at a red light or</v>

1253
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 3>something on press that record button,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very responsible of you.</v>

1254
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very responsible when it comes to</v>

1255
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:45.370
<v Speaker 3>texting and driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

1256
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1257
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>infuriating things.</v>

1258
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1259
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're going 60 plus whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles an hour.</v>

1260
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:59.710
<v Speaker 3>The amount of distance that you cover in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a glance where you are not looking at</v>

1261
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:01.990
<v Speaker 3>the road and things can happen at any</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

1262
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Just to me it's super disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the back to the grind.</v>

1264
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did,</v>

1265
00:57:09.341 --> 00:57:10.370
<v Speaker 3>what do you got there that you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to?</v>

1266
00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1267
00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1268
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:16.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we touched a little bit about,</v>

1269
00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1270
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.090
<v Speaker 2>all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the elements of the care of the</v>

1271
00:57:20.091 --> 00:57:20.960
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1272
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:25.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be more than just giving you a</v>

1273
00:57:25.161 --> 00:57:27.380
<v Speaker 2>shot and send you on your way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1274
00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.170
<v Speaker 2>If you truly have an injury and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to recover you,</v>

1275
00:57:30.171 --> 00:57:35.171
<v Speaker 2>then what also comes along with that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the appropriate rehab protocol.</v>

1276
00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:39.710
<v Speaker 2>And none of those are defined yet for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what some of these things that we've</v>

1277
00:57:39.711 --> 00:57:40.580
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1278
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:44.300
<v Speaker 2>but we're trying to develop that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dial it in and hone it down.</v>

1279
00:57:44.301 --> 00:57:45.500
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me right now,</v>

1280
00:57:45.501 --> 00:57:49.730
<v Speaker 2>the easiest thing is to try to adapt it</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a surgical rehab.</v>

1281
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a physical therapist</v>

1282
00:57:51.651 --> 00:57:53.570
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I tried to collaborate with those</v>

1283
00:57:53.571 --> 00:57:57.920
<v Speaker 2>guys and girls that are smarter than me</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

1284
00:57:57.921 --> 00:57:59.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>avenue.</v>

1285
00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:02.210
<v Speaker 2>But the principles are the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1286
00:58:02.211 --> 00:58:05.660
<v Speaker 2>So you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an injury that you're trying to</v>

1287
00:58:05.661 --> 00:58:06.590
<v Speaker 2>heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1288
00:58:06.591 --> 00:58:08.360
<v Speaker 2>in some cases it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1289
00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:12.440
<v Speaker 2>we've created the injury or we've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that the patient has to</v>

1290
00:58:12.441 --> 00:58:14.750
<v Speaker 2>recover from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the case of an injection,</v>

1291
00:58:14.751 --> 00:58:18.020
<v Speaker 2>you have an injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've done the injection and now we</v>

1292
00:58:18.021 --> 00:58:21.740
<v Speaker 2>need the effect to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that we're hoping that</v>

1293
00:58:21.741 --> 00:58:23.480
<v Speaker 2>we'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1294
00:58:23.481 --> 00:58:28.481
<v Speaker 2>but then you can't ignore the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody has a bad shoulder,</v>

1295
00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.400
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we may decrease the pain,</v>

1296
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:32.840
<v Speaker 2>but if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're,</v>

1297
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.900
<v Speaker 2>if their motion is poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if their strength is poor,</v>

1298
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:40.670
<v Speaker 2>if it's not functioning correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then how can we be achieving the best</v>

1299
00:58:40.671 --> 00:58:43.040
<v Speaker 2>result if we're not also attending to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1300
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a multi step,</v>

1301
00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.540
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the more that we're learning</v>

1302
00:58:47.541 --> 00:58:49.340
<v Speaker 2>about all these other factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1303
00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:52.220
<v Speaker 2>like again for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1304
00:58:52.221 --> 00:58:54.350
<v Speaker 2>you're paying attention to your sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're paying attention to your</v>

1305
00:58:54.351 --> 00:58:56.300
<v Speaker 2>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on,</v>

1306
00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:57.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
00:58:57.501 --> 00:59:01.760
<v Speaker 2>a variety of supplements that are meant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help a lot of these processes.</v>

1308
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:05.690
<v Speaker 2>And I think we're going to get better</v>
<v Speaker 2>and better at it.</v>

1309
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.550
<v Speaker 2>And that has got to be pretty critical</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1310
00:59:07.551 --> 00:59:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be hugely important,</v>

1311
00:59:09.201 --> 00:59:11.840
<v Speaker 2>especially like staying away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation.</v>

1312
00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Enhancing foods are inflammatory foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1313
00:59:14.421 --> 00:59:16.010
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1314
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1315
00:59:17.541 --> 00:59:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gotta be critically</v>
<v Speaker 2>important and we try to share that</v>

1316
00:59:20.061 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>information with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1317
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for athletes,</v>

1318
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:25.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a website that you could pull up</v>

1319
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:29.450
<v Speaker 1>and we can share as the college and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professional Athlete,</v>

1320
00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>a dietetics association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is college in professional</v>

1321
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 1>college and professional athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1322
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:41.120
<v Speaker 1>what college and professional athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't even know what that means.</v>

1323
00:59:41.121 --> 00:59:42.430
<v Speaker 1>We all have Collagen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1324
00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:44.510
<v Speaker 1>College hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:48.770
<v Speaker 1>So these guys have some great</v>
<v Speaker 1>information and good infographics that,</v>

1326
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:50.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we utilize.</v>

1327
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I'm not a,</v>

1328
00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.500
<v Speaker 1>that looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a dietician,</v>

1329
00:59:54.501 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 1>so I have to rely again on people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have good information.</v>

1330
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.860
<v Speaker 1>I think these guys have a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>

1331
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:05.570
<v Speaker 1>they're good reliable source and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got great infographics if you go</v>

1332
01:00:05.571 --> 01:00:06.404
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1333
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 4>mmm.</v>

1334
01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:15.600
<v Speaker 5>Uh</v>

1335
01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Educational Resources.</v>

1336
01:00:21.221 --> 01:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1337
01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>So this will pull up some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some different things,</v>

1338
01:00:25.601 --> 01:00:28.810
<v Speaker 1>balancing extra exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>induced inflammation.</v>

1339
01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1340
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:35.650
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much universally agreed that</v>

1341
01:00:35.651 --> 01:00:36.341
<v Speaker 1>rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ice,</v>

1342
01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.600
<v Speaker 1>compression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevation,</v>

1343
01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>all those different things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have said in the past,</v>

1344
01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:43.330
<v Speaker 1>there is benefit to a particular icing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1345
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1346
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1347
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>There's some debate now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly there's like a definite,</v>

1348
01:00:49.151 --> 01:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti ice community.</v>

1349
01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that out there?</v>

1350
01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's legit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1351
01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>there can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a downside to it.</v>

1352
01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ice.</v>

1353
01:00:58.570 --> 01:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1354
01:00:59.981 --> 01:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>we've used it regularly and so I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1355
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a group that,</v>

1356
01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know all of their arguments</v>

1357
01:01:06.401 --> 01:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but may should take the former UFC</v>

1358
01:01:08.921 --> 01:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>bantamweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had had a podcast with this guy who</v>

1359
01:01:11.721 --> 01:01:13.570
<v Speaker 1>was the anti ice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1360
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I got this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See a flat earth guy to no,</v>

1361
01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't believe in dinosaurs I</v>
<v Speaker 1>made is not,</v>

1362
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made that up.</v>

1363
01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:20.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1364
01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:22.871
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1365
01:01:22.871 --> 01:01:24.520
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he's a doctor,</v>

1366
01:01:24.521 --> 01:01:25.091
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1367
01:01:25.091 --> 01:01:30.091
<v Speaker 1>he might be a fucking veterinary works</v>
<v Speaker 1>on no cat infections or something.</v>

1368
01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think there's a downscaling</v>

1369
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in my opinion,</v>

1370
01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely had athletic injuries.</v>

1371
01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a pitcher previously.</v>

1372
01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:44.440
<v Speaker 1>We routinely ice our shoulder and elbow</v>
<v Speaker 1>after pitching.</v>

1373
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it as a matter of routine and may,</v>

1374
01:01:46.721 --> 01:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>it felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt better when I did it and I</v>

1375
01:01:49.271 --> 01:01:50.470
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the question.</v>

1376
01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It felt good at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is that feeling good in any way.</v>

1377
01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Slowing the healing process.</v>

1378
01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:59.003
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1379
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Hard to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1380
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1381
01:02:03.321 --> 01:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1382
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>To be frank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

1383
01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1384
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.890
<v Speaker 1>you're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the fucking genius,</v>

1385
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you don't know we're doomed.</v>

1386
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>They get back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1387
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1388

<v Speaker 1>I'll get you some good information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It thank you.</v>

1389
01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate</v>

1390
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.390

1391
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think one of the interesting things</v>

1392
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:30.400
<v Speaker 2>about this whole topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1393
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:34.590
<v Speaker 2>and the possibility of healing from</v>
<v Speaker 2>utilizing this type of treatment,</v>

1394
01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:40.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how it allows you to go through the</v>

1395
01:02:41.101 --> 01:02:45.630
<v Speaker 2>process of healing without this fibro</v>
<v Speaker 2>vascular response.</v>

1396
01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.660
<v Speaker 2>So the typical healing cascade has an</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory phase,</v>

1397
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:53.700
<v Speaker 2>proliferative phase and the maturation</v>
<v Speaker 2>phase.</v>

1398
01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:58.620
<v Speaker 2>So in the inflammatory phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have neutrophils and white blood</v>

1399
01:02:58.621 --> 01:03:03.621
<v Speaker 2>cells and these enzymes that are present</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to start the process.</v>

1400
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Then in the proliferative phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having what's called angiogenesis</v>

1401
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:13.560
<v Speaker 2>and that means the development of new</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood vessels and vasculature to the</v>

1402
01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:15.030
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1403
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.840
<v Speaker 2>and your body's producing fiber blasts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're laying down tissue in this</v>

1404
01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Speaker 2>sort of haphazard manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just kind of piling on in there.</v>

1405
01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the maturation phase is when</v>

1406
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 2>you have remodeling.</v>

1407
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.560
<v Speaker 2>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that scar tissue is changing over time</v>

1408
01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and developing into a tissue that's more</v>

1409
01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:36.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is the native tissue.</v>

1410
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:42.300
<v Speaker 2>So that occurs over a period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of times during that</v>

1411
01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:45.240
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you're fully matured in the</v>

1412
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:47.420
<v Speaker 2>healing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're backed activities.</v>

1413
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.013
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best.</v>

1414
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.380
<v Speaker 2>So let's just take an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you sprain your ankle and then</v>

1415
01:03:52.381 --> 01:03:54.060
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1416
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.530
<v Speaker 2>you start feeling better and maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to basketball within a couple of</v>

1417
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.180
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that point,</v>

1418
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.240
<v Speaker 2>if you've actually torn one of the ankle</v>
<v Speaker 2>ligaments,</v>

1419
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.920
<v Speaker 2>you don't have native ligament tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same structural properties.</v>

1420
01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:09.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not as strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1421
01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:11.880
<v Speaker 2>you might be developing the strength</v>
<v Speaker 2>around it,</v>

1422
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like the native tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the hope is that we can demonstrate</v>

1423
01:04:18.031 --> 01:04:21.300
<v Speaker 2>now we know that this is the science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what it's supposed to do.</v>

1424
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 2>This is what it does in the developing</v>
<v Speaker 2>fetus.</v>

1425
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.180
<v Speaker 2>We see it in kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how,</v>

1426
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.460
<v Speaker 2>you know when your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your daughter was real young,</v>

1427
01:04:29.461 --> 01:04:31.850
<v Speaker 2>she scratched her face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the healing it will ring.</v>

1428
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.540
<v Speaker 2>It was like gone like the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1429
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:39.150
<v Speaker 2>so healing without scar is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do with not forming this,</v>

1430
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 2>these fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fiber blast or fiber vascular</v>

1431
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:47.931
<v Speaker 2>response and in fiber optic phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what the cool potential of this to</v>

1432
01:04:49.111 --> 01:04:54.111
<v Speaker 2>me is if we can skip that and we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>have more complete healing and quicker</v>

1433
01:04:56.731 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 2>resolution to the native tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to have those,</v>

1434
01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.330
<v Speaker 2>the same properties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be stronger,</v>

1435
01:05:03.331 --> 01:05:05.730
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1436
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.680
<v Speaker 2>technically and hopefully you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinically this pans out that you would</v>

1437
01:05:10.681 --> 01:05:14.340
<v Speaker 2>be more resistant and lower risk for</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeat injury because that's really our</v>

1438
01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:19.300
<v Speaker 2>goal is in treating patients is get them</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to their activity and decrease the</v>

1439
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 2>chance that they have to miss more time.</v>

1440
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>How do you know how much to inject into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows,</v>

1441
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.100
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows that.</v>

1442
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:31.960
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the big questions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will be discovered with again,</v>

1443
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorous studies where we can look at,</v>

1444
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should the dosing be,</v>

1445
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:38.800
<v Speaker 2>what should the frequency of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment be and what should these,</v>

1446
01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:43.150
<v Speaker 2>the protocols before and after be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not defined in anybody.</v>

1447
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>That's telling a patient that they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what it should be.</v>

1448
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be wary of that because that has not</v>

1449
01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>been discovered yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trying to,</v>

1450
01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:53.830
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1451
01:05:53.831 --> 01:05:57.790
<v Speaker 2>we're taking the information from our</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and applying it that way.</v>

1452
01:05:57.791 --> 01:05:59.350
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the,</v>

1453
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:02.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not the best way to go about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1454
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that prp suffered</v>
<v Speaker 2>from is that all of the things everybody</v>

1455
01:06:06.521 --> 01:06:08.610
<v Speaker 2>was using it for so many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and,</v>

1456
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:12.670
<v Speaker 2>and just kind of hoping that it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>magic bullet that it was going to treat</v>

1457
01:06:12.671 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 2>all the things that we had difficulty</v>
<v Speaker 2>treating.</v>

1458
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even all of the studies that were</v>

1459
01:06:18.371 --> 01:06:19.660
<v Speaker 2>coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.830
<v Speaker 2>people were using different centrifuges</v>
<v Speaker 2>and applying it for different reasons,</v>

1461
01:06:23.831 --> 01:06:26.290
<v Speaker 2>different protocols was just a mishmash</v>
<v Speaker 2>of information.</v>

1462
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:29.670
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How d how does platelet rich plasma will</v>

1463
01:06:29.671 --> 01:06:33.520
<v Speaker 2>work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has growth factors and cytokines</v>

1464
01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:34.820
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1465
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the platelets release proteins and</v>

1466
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:42.490
<v Speaker 2>things and those things help mediate</v>
<v Speaker 2>that inflammatory response and help the</v>

1467
01:06:42.491 --> 01:06:43.390
<v Speaker 2>healing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1468
01:06:43.391 --> 01:06:46.120
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that they could work in a</v>

1469
01:06:46.121 --> 01:06:51.121
<v Speaker 2>symbiotic fashion with like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>information that adding prp to,</v>

1470
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:56.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some cellular treatment like bone marrow</v>

1471
01:06:56.081 --> 01:06:58.460
<v Speaker 2>fat or the placental tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1472
01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.930
<v Speaker 2>and that line of treatment can help</v>
<v Speaker 2>expand the cells.</v>

1473
01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that gets us to an important point,</v>

1474
01:07:05.111 --> 01:07:06.610
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1475
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:11.560
<v Speaker 2>expanding the cells has been done and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not currently legal in the United</v>

1476
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.130
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a place,</v>

1477
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:19.570
<v Speaker 2>and they do it in other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here if you,</v>

1478
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.420
<v Speaker 2>if you more than men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a mouthful.</v>

1479
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.120
<v Speaker 2>If you more than minimally manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tissue,</v>

1480
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:30.750
<v Speaker 2>then that is not under the guidelines of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the FDA for use of human cellular tissue</v>

1481
01:07:31.451 --> 01:07:35.230
<v Speaker 2>products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were taking,</v>

1482
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:40.350
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone marrow and plating it and growing</v>

1483
01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:42.490
<v Speaker 2>more sales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing the patients back two weeks</v>

1484
01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:44.610
<v Speaker 2>later and injecting them with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1485
01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.250
<v Speaker 2>super production of cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which probably is great,</v>

1486
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if that's safe.</v>

1487
01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.860
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that has to be,</v>

1488
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to be taken through the</v>

1489
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:57.580
<v Speaker 2>appropriate process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1490
01:07:57.910 --> 01:08:02.910
<v Speaker 2>so you can't necessarily recommend</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone taking prp while they're taking</v>

1491
01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:06.670
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a stem cell injections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the difference of that.</v>

1492
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:12.200
<v Speaker 2>A manufacturer can't say that we have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>product that is a combined prp stem cell</v>

1493
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.050
<v Speaker 2>injection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1494
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.860
<v Speaker 2>And it does this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's illegal.</v>

1495
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:22.760
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a patient we can't put on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my website,</v>

1496
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.040
<v Speaker 2>I have the magic potion.</v>

1497
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It's PRP and amniotic fluid and tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just inject it and it can heal</v>

1498
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I admire how responsible you are and how</v>

1499
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>you keep cutting me off whenever I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting some ridiculous thing.</v>

1500
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.560
<v Speaker 2>But is would there be a benefit for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient potential benefit who's getting</v>

1501
01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.440
<v Speaker 2>stem cell injections and also gets prp</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time?</v>

1502
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Or is it just theoretical?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Its theoretical right now.</v>

1503
01:08:48.381 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But potentially,</v>

1504
01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.810
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1505
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 2>there's potential and it's encouraging</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1506
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the possibility is there.</v>

1507
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:00.840
<v Speaker 2>It appears to be safe there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1508
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 2>we don't have adverse reactions to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1509
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the point that I wanted to make is</v>

1510
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:13.871
<v Speaker 2>that a physician can prescribe something</v>
<v Speaker 2>and use it off label.</v>

1511
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the FDA doesn't regulate the practice</v>

1512
01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:23.090
<v Speaker 2>of medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that in my office,</v>

1513
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.770
<v Speaker 2>but I can't make claims about it and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't put it on social media and on my</v>

1514
01:09:27.771 --> 01:09:31.310
<v Speaker 2>website and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to do this and I'm going to</v>

1515
01:09:31.311 --> 01:09:35.030
<v Speaker 2>fix your shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like come here if you have a meniscus</v>

1516
01:09:35.031 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 2>tear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we do this injection and it's</v>

1517
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:38.210
<v Speaker 2>gonna make you better.</v>

1518
01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:39.260
<v Speaker 2>That's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1519
01:09:39.261 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1520
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.550
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody comes to my office,</v>

1521
01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can elect to do that because both</v>

1522
01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 2>things are available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1523
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:49.700
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have permission,</v>

1524
01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use them,</v>

1525
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.510
<v Speaker 2>but we're using it off label and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1526
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:54.523
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1527
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:58.160
<v Speaker 2>when you say maximize cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the term used maybe.</v>

1528
01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:02.240
<v Speaker 2>What does the term used about prp in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in conjunction think that it can</v>

1529
01:10:02.241 --> 01:10:04.430
<v Speaker 2>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The proliferation of them is income.</v>

1530
01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Stem cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1531
01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.490
<v Speaker 2>how much of a time period would it have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be between the injection and the PRP?</v>

1532
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:14.220
<v Speaker 2>That's undefined again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what would you assume?</v>

1533
01:10:14.221 --> 01:10:15.890
<v Speaker 2>The way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that we're doing is we would do</v>

1534
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:17.260
<v Speaker 2>the injection at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1535
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:19.010
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it in there together.</v>

1536
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:24.350
<v Speaker 2>So you really only have a narrow window</v>
<v Speaker 2>from when we take those frozen cells and</v>

1537
01:10:24.351 --> 01:10:25.880
<v Speaker 2>then we thaw them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1538
01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:29.810
<v Speaker 2>we have a short window when we can then</v>
<v Speaker 2>inject them and then there's,</v>

1539
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:33.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe between seven and 21 days that</v>

1540
01:10:33.621 --> 01:10:37.910
<v Speaker 2>those cells are viable in your shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your knee or wherever we inject it.</v>

1541
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:40.580
<v Speaker 2>So if someone gets an injection that</v>
<v Speaker 2>does PRP,</v>

1542
01:10:40.581 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 2>they would have to essentially get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>done within those seven to 21 days to</v>

1543
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:47.510
<v Speaker 2>have some sort of a benefit of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying theoretically radicals</v>

1544
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:48.403
<v Speaker 2>that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1545
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.890
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I would do it currently.</v>

1546
01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on that information.</v>

1547
01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.030
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1548
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:58.220
<v Speaker 2>What else you got there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1549
01:10:58.221 --> 01:10:59.210
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1550
01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:01.280
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was important to talk about</v>

1551
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called section three 61 of the</v>

1552
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Public Health Service Act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the definition from the FDA</v>

1553
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:12.980
<v Speaker 2>on the use of human cell tissue and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cellular tissue products.</v>

1554
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.550
<v Speaker 2>So it has to match these criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to have minimal</v>

1555
01:11:17.551 --> 01:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you can't add things to it.</v>

1556
01:11:20.581 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 2>You can't combine it with other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

1557
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was saying,</v>

1558
01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:26.820
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1559
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.100
<v Speaker 2>put it in the lab and grow it and add</v>
<v Speaker 2>things to it and then come bring the</v>

1560
01:11:31.101 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 2>patient back and treat them how this</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't part of the,</v>

1561
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.711
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it,</v>

1562
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:37.050
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't treat patients on a,</v>

1563
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.950
<v Speaker 2>on a different day.</v>

1564
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:42.950
<v Speaker 2>It has to be at the same time whenever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're harvesting the cells or utilizing</v>

1565
01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is you're using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1566
01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:48.030
<v Speaker 2>it has to be something called homologous</v>
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>

1567
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is whatever tissue</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking has to have the intention</v>

1568
01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 2>of the purpose of that tissue for when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it into somebody's body.</v>

1569
01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.330
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1570
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.250
<v Speaker 2>if I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1571
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:06.240
<v Speaker 2>if you have a fracture that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>healing and I take a bone graft product,</v>

1572
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:10.440
<v Speaker 2>so cadaver bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to use that to help heal</v>

1573
01:12:10.441 --> 01:12:11.970
<v Speaker 2>your fracture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't healed.</v>

1574
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:15.540
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's homologous use we have,</v>

1575
01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:18.510
<v Speaker 2>we're taking bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're using it to become bone or to be</v>

1576
01:12:18.511 --> 01:12:21.960
<v Speaker 2>the scaffold for bone to heal and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1577
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be combined with something else</v>

1578
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:31.260
<v Speaker 2>and it can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be intended to have a systemic</v>

1579
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now all of these things that I'm</v>

1580
01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:37.200
<v Speaker 2>explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are rules for manufacturers and</v>

1581
01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:40.080
<v Speaker 2>what they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the rules are for them to be able</v>

1582
01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 2>to market their product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1583
01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.160
<v Speaker 2>you can't take amniotic fluid and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a product meant for IV infusion</v>

1584
01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:53.490
<v Speaker 2>for treatment of whatever diabetes.</v>

1585
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is something that people do in</v>

1586
01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:56.640
<v Speaker 1>other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1587
01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.310
<v Speaker 1>They're doing in other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that in,</v>

1588
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 1>you technically can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't manufacture a product and put</v>

1589
01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:06.150
<v Speaker 1>that on the labeling that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's intended for.</v>

1590
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 1>But do they do that in America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1591
01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.850
<v Speaker 1>ve stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been told by patients that they've</v>

1592
01:13:11.851 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 1>gone to places that have suggested to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that that was going to be the</v>

1593
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.380
<v Speaker 1>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1594
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on there?</v>

1595
01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1596
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:21.930
<v Speaker 1>how does that even work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

1597
01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not your wheelhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1598
01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.980
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody knows if it does.</v>

1599
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:28.620
<v Speaker 1>So it was just experimental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1600
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1601
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:32.790
<v Speaker 1>boss ruin is former UFC champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever treat him?</v>

1602
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I have no law to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1603
01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I can say talk about any</v>

1604
01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:39.980
<v Speaker 1>patient that unless they tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1605
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:42.710
<v Speaker 1>set it or they're sitting in front of me</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it and okay,</v>

1606
01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that it's hipaa violation.</v>

1607
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Just want a nation state for the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give you permission.</v>

1608
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bas and went to,</v>

1609
01:13:51.481 --> 01:13:53.400
<v Speaker 1>where did he said he'd go to Peru or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1610
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Went to the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some dude kill the chicken and then</v>

1611
01:13:56.581 --> 01:13:59.630
<v Speaker 1>showed some stem cells into him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a blood vein.</v>

1612
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.510
<v Speaker 1>He was saying it was fucking amazing if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1613
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were to wait boss talks.</v>

1614
01:14:05.431 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the energy was coming out of</v>

1615
01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 1>my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Ah,</v>

1616
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>he said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He literally felt like,</v>

1617
01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

1618
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.340
<v Speaker 3>some guy of Kung Fu and we'll be where</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy was like shooting off his</v>

1619
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 3>fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it was amazing.</v>

1620
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Like the emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not the only guy that said that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>instagram guy with the boobs and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>butts?</v>

1623
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he told me the same thing.</v>

1624
01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.360
<v Speaker 3>He said that when he got it done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said it's amazing.</v>

1625
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.980
<v Speaker 3>He goes to Mexico to get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not recommended,</v>

1626
01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 3>but he can't talk about it off air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll be a little chatter box.</v>

1627
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Just you wait maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1628
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:49.720
<v Speaker 3>what I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in what I was thinking for you threw me</v>

1629
01:14:49.721 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 3>off there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1630
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he going to with a specific intent of</v>

1631
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 3>treating something or is he just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for the Fountain of Youth?</v>

1632
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he fucks so much.</v>

1633
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:06.060
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have any sperm in his body</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's trying to kicks,</v>

1634
01:15:06.221 --> 01:15:07.010
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1635
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's an animal.</v>

1636
01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's got a series of injuries.</v>

1637
01:15:11.111 --> 01:15:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I know that because he's had regena keen</v>
<v Speaker 3>for his neck.</v>

1638
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.870
<v Speaker 3>He put it up on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on instagram,</v>

1639
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 3>like with instagram stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was videoing himself while I was</v>

1640
01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:24.620
<v Speaker 3>getting injections in his neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've had a Regena keen</v>

1641
01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.020
<v Speaker 3>interjections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1642
01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Speaker 3>It cured my cervical disc bulge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1643
01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That and disco decompression,</v>

1644
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 3>a spinal decompression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know with like a harness where</v>

1645
01:15:35.981 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 3>they're pulling on your neck that I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bulging disc in my neck that was</v>

1646
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:40.990
<v Speaker 3>pushing on my unresolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1647
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.610
<v Speaker 3>completely resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on an MRI.</v>

1648
01:15:42.611 --> 01:15:46.090
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist anymore where I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting numb hands cause the Ulnar nerve</v>

1649
01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:47.500
<v Speaker 3>was being pressed upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it works.</v>

1651
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Some massive anti inflammation</v>
<v Speaker 3>properties.</v>

1652
01:15:52.571 --> 01:15:57.010
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that it has the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>healing potential.</v>

1653
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it reduces inflammation in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a giant way.</v>

1654
01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:01.840
<v Speaker 3>What's going on with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1655
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had regena keen shot in my knee too.</v>

1656
01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:07.420
<v Speaker 3>It didn't really show me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't really have the same</v>

1657
01:16:07.421 --> 01:16:09.130
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a little bit,</v>

1658
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:14.310
<v Speaker 3>so patients like yourself that have had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a number of injuries and a number of</v>

1659
01:16:15.491 --> 01:16:17.590
<v Speaker 3>treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that's got me</v>

1660
01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:22.570
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic about the potential of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this is when somebody tells me,</v>

1661
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:23.411
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had this,</v>

1662
01:16:23.411 --> 01:16:24.490
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and this.</v>

1663
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:29.890
<v Speaker 3>And then I had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're talking about and that it was</v>

1664
01:16:29.891 --> 01:16:33.330
<v Speaker 3>just completely different game changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a hundred percent captured and</v>

1665
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.360
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>

1666
01:16:34.361 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Mine right shoulder is not 100% but it</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be 90%.</v>

1667
01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:40.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's strong as fuck.</v>

1668
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Like I could do a lot of shit with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't do some insane stuff.</v>

1669
01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:44.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1670
01:16:44.561 --> 01:16:46.420
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't bog things that I probably</v>

1671
01:16:46.421 --> 01:16:48.160
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no pain.</v>

1672
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

1673
01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.290
<v Speaker 3>why could do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1674
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.250
<v Speaker 3>I take these 90 pound kettle bells and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>do windmills with them.</v>

1675
01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.151
<v Speaker 3>Where you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1676
01:16:55.151 --> 01:16:58.030
<v Speaker 3>you're pressing overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what a windmill is dropping</v>

1677
01:16:58.031 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what your shoulders</v>

1678
01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:01.480
<v Speaker 3>rotating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do that with 90 pounds,</v>

1679
01:17:01.481 --> 01:17:03.430
<v Speaker 3>but I know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

1680
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that I can do that with a</v>

1681
01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:10.501
<v Speaker 3>shoulder that was on the way probably to</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting on it was just amazing.</v>

1682
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:14.670
<v Speaker 3>My bow tie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most impressive thing was that push</v>

1683
01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:17.990
<v Speaker 3>up with the wheel thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that thing called?</v>

1684
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the AB wheel.</v>

1685
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Now it's like a little roller that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had your hand.</v>

1686
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things when you go for,</v>

1687
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 3>what's that called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The comfort of all havoc creates it.</v>

1688
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:27.580
<v Speaker 3>There's sliders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>havoc.</v>

1689
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:28.510

<v Speaker 3>why k sliders?</v>

1692
01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of it on seat.</v>

1693
01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 3>There's a video on my instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1694
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:37.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from quite a while ago,</v>

1695
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.350
<v Speaker 3>but it was posts post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1696
01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:40.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>injection.</v>

1697
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's from way back.</v>

1698
01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 3>I want to say at least a year ago I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

1699
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:50.480
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1700
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:53.870
<v Speaker 3>there's my range of motion's 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1701
01:17:53.871 --> 01:17:56.120
<v Speaker 3>at the most it's uncomfortable in</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things,</v>

1702
01:17:56.121 --> 01:18:00.410
<v Speaker 3>but for a big one for me was archery</v>
<v Speaker 3>because um,</v>

1703
01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoy it.</v>

1704
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I do it all the time and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditative to me and I,</v>

1705
01:18:05.571 --> 01:18:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love archery.</v>

1706
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.740
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the idea of not being able to pull</v>

1707
01:18:09.741 --> 01:18:11.270
<v Speaker 3>my bow back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1708
01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:12.560
<v Speaker 3>it was really disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1709
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to get the surgery</v>

1710
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:14.241
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

1712
01:18:16.011 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Now I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

1736
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say Batman,</v>

1737
01:19:12.591 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1738
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:16.760
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those bows or they're amazing.</v>

1739
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:17.600
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

1740
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.070
<v Speaker 3>And it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1741
01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I've only been able to go a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

1742
01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:25.010
<v Speaker 3>but I'm definitely hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most amazing meditation.</v>

1743
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:26.510
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cause it's you,</v>

1744
01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:30.770
<v Speaker 3>when you're focusing on that shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you literally have no room for anything</v>

1745
01:19:30.771 --> 01:19:31.371
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1746
01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:36.080
<v Speaker 3>it requires so much concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're concentrating on the front hand</v>

1747
01:19:36.081 --> 01:19:38.360
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>front shoulder position,</v>

1748
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:41.180
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the string touches the tip of your</v>

1749
01:19:41.181 --> 01:19:42.830
<v Speaker 3>nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the corner of your mouth.</v>

1750
01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:46.560
<v Speaker 3>And John is just an amazing coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1751
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally unfair.</v>

1752
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.480
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the bow.</v>

1753
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Then the first bow that I get to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1754
01:19:53.031 --> 01:19:57.380
<v Speaker 3>and then John gives me the first lesson</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've ever pulled a back.</v>

1755
01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.960
<v Speaker 3>He's standing there right with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an Olympic coach by the way.</v>

1756
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.600
<v Speaker 3>He used to coach to the Olympic team and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's amazing.</v>

1757
01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he really,</v>

1758
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 3>he's a great guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he can take years off of people's</v>

1759
01:20:08.611 --> 01:20:09.870
<v Speaker 3>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>

1760
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:12.690
<v Speaker 3>he's absolutely taking years off my</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning curve.</v>

1761
01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sneeze.</v>

1762
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 3>I hate when you say you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sneeze and they put a lot of pressure on</v>

1763
01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:23.520
<v Speaker 3>yourself and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1764
01:20:23.521 --> 01:20:24.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might not,</v>

1765
01:20:24.401 --> 01:20:26.670
<v Speaker 3>it might just look like a Weirdo for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few minutes.</v>

1766
01:20:26.671 --> 01:20:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Did you find that video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1767
01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 3>it's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God.</v>

1768
01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.380
<v Speaker 3>So here's another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1769
01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.440
<v Speaker 3>kind of crazy thing about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the placental derived treatments</v>

1770
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:43.440
<v Speaker 2>is it they actually have a antimicrobial</v>
<v Speaker 2>properties.</v>

1771
01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is crazy.</v>

1772
01:20:45.601 --> 01:20:47.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean we kind of know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1773
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the functions of the amniotic</v>

1774
01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.850
<v Speaker 2>membrane is to protect the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the developing baby.</v>

1775
01:20:53.851 --> 01:20:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1776
01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:56.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1777
01:20:56.401 --> 01:20:59.010
<v Speaker 2>in one of the things it does protect it</v>
<v Speaker 2>from infection,</v>

1778
01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.030
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were able to demonstrate was that,</v>

1779
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:04.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

1780
01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:09.450
<v Speaker 2>they've actually introduced bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally injected bacteria onto</v>

1781
01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.490
<v Speaker 2>these membranes and then they come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1782
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:13.480
<v Speaker 2>and check and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1783
01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:18.210
<v Speaker 2>it has destroyed the bacteria so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

1784
01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.730
<v Speaker 2>So ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1785
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:24.960
<v Speaker 2>resist scar formation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move through the,</v>

1786
01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.130
<v Speaker 2>the fibrotic phase of healing and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>also the antimicrobial profit.</v>

1787
01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:32.150
<v Speaker 3>So amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be super beneficial.</v>

1788
01:21:32.151 --> 01:21:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Postsurgery right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's a giant issue.</v>

1789
01:21:35.091 --> 01:21:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Staph infections and the like.</v>

1790
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:39.290
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frightens us most about,</v>

1791
01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing our procedures is,</v>

1792
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:44.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we prevent infection?</v>

1793
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1794
01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:49.470
<v Speaker 3>Giant issue where people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know because of the nature of a</v>

1795
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.820
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

1796
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:52.850
<v Speaker 3>everybody I know is that surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1797
01:21:52.851 --> 01:21:57.550
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the big issue is post in post</v>

1798
01:21:57.551 --> 01:21:59.370
<v Speaker 3>surgery infections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1799
01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh those guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting abrasions and everything</v>

1800
01:22:02.341 --> 01:22:06.030
<v Speaker 3>like that on the mat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then so then they're colonized with,</v>

1801
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrse out of whatever funk is in that</v>

1802
01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:12.690
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell everybody,</v>

1803
01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.060
<v Speaker 3>if you are a grappler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is super important.</v>

1804
01:22:15.061 --> 01:22:20.061
<v Speaker 3>I want you to look up defense soap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Defense soap is a soap company that was</v>

1805
01:22:21.091 --> 01:22:24.390
<v Speaker 3>created by my friend Guy Sacco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is it?</v>

1806
01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:29.190
<v Speaker 3>It is all natural soap that promotes</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy bacteria.</v>

1807
01:22:29.191 --> 01:22:31.040
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't destroy the healthy bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1808
01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.720
<v Speaker 3>But it's all tea tree oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eucalyptus oil.</v>

1809
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:36.150
<v Speaker 3>This shit is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I used to get,</v>

1810
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten staff at least twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to get ringworm all the time.</v>

1811
01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:41.971
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all the time,</v>

1812
01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:46.250
<v Speaker 3>but I got a couple of times and until I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like super diligent about wool</v>

1813
01:22:46.251 --> 01:22:48.120
<v Speaker 3>washing myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like immediately afterwards.</v>

1814
01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.300
<v Speaker 3>But once I started using two things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probiotics,</v>

1815
01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.400
<v Speaker 3>which is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1816
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.900
<v Speaker 3>acidophilus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Eating yogurt and a drinking Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next one in fact soap</v>

1818
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.080
<v Speaker 3>probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a little bit of something and</v>

1819
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:06.460
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit of something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good to have.</v>

1820
01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.250
<v Speaker 3>It's good to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1821
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.540
<v Speaker 3>probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Kimchi.</v>

1822
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 3>I tried to take my probiotic probiotics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and multiple forms.</v>

1823
01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff that I was drinking when he</v>

1824
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:16.900
<v Speaker 3>got here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kombucha.</v>

1825
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I love this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drink all the time.</v>

1826
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Or that you like or did he met mixing</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be careful because I'm a low</v>

1827
01:23:23.021 --> 01:23:24.880
<v Speaker 3>sugar guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like the grapes,</v>

1828
01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:27.800
<v Speaker 3>there's some of them that are delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have a lot of sugar.</v>

1829
01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1830
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:30.640
<v Speaker 3>this multigrains does not have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>

1831
01:23:30.641 --> 01:23:33.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see what it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something like 10 grams per</v>

1832
01:23:33.971 --> 01:23:35.740
<v Speaker 3>serving or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

1833
01:23:35.741 --> 01:23:38.020
<v Speaker 3>that sounds high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I've seen them lower.</v>

1834
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.280
<v Speaker 3>Two grams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1836
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.940
<v Speaker 3>that's what you want the grapes high</v>
<v Speaker 3>grape is,</v>

1837
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.600
<v Speaker 3>but the taste wonderful and write</v>
<v Speaker 3>essays.</v>

1838
01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Yummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

1839
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:53.080
<v Speaker 3>This does not taste so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know you're getting something</v>

1840
01:23:53.081 --> 01:23:55.450
<v Speaker 3>good in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the fight your way through</v>

1841
01:23:55.451 --> 01:23:57.100
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The important stuff is that you get the</v>

1842
01:23:57.101 --> 01:23:59.700
<v Speaker 3>strong Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the brand that I really liked.</v>

1843
01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't work for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not a sponsor.</v>

1844
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.300
<v Speaker 3>GTS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kombucha,</v>

1845
01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:05.100
<v Speaker 3>gt gts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1846
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:09.910
<v Speaker 3>this stuff is awesome but you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 21 because it has more than one</v>

1847
01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:13.720
<v Speaker 3>half of 1% alcohol by volume because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fermentation process,</v>

1848
01:24:13.721 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Speaker 3>cause it's so strong.</v>

1849
01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:15.940
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they make you get,</v>

1850
01:24:15.941 --> 01:24:17.320
<v Speaker 3>you show your Id.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1851
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.150
<v Speaker 3>They actually pulled it from whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>foods.</v>

1852
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

1853
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:22.050
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I saw,</v>

1854
01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:22.923
<v Speaker 3>that's where I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.230
<v Speaker 3>they have it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they pulled it from whole foods</v>

1856
01:24:25.231 --> 01:24:28.330
<v Speaker 3>until whole foods had to like put some</v>
<v Speaker 3>regulations in place to keep,</v>

1857
01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.020
<v Speaker 3>you would literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were eight years old do,</v>

1858
01:24:31.021 --> 01:24:32.770
<v Speaker 3>you could drink one and not get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1859
01:24:32.771 --> 01:24:34.930
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you're going to get drunk</v>

1860
01:24:34.931 --> 01:24:37.360
<v Speaker 3>off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just due to regulations,</v>

1861
01:24:37.361 --> 01:24:39.700
<v Speaker 3>you have to listen to the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1862
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:42.963
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got</v>

1863
01:24:44.730 --> 01:24:45.850
<v Speaker 3>got a lot of papers there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy.</v>

1864
01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:49.360
<v Speaker 3>Got Drawings and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charts and graphs.</v>

1865
01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Have to think about probably a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff you say.</v>

1866
01:24:52.661 --> 01:24:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Don't let joe talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1867
01:24:57.550 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 3>what other questions have you come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with along the way?</v>

1868
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Or One big question I wanted to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you about was something that I had a</v>

1869
01:25:05.231 --> 01:25:07.870
<v Speaker 3>discussion with Dr. Davidson about</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

1870
01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Jeff was telling me that the most</v>

1871
01:25:12.071 --> 01:25:17.071
<v Speaker 3>recent procedure with stem cells is</v>
<v Speaker 3>injecting them directly into the discs</v>

1872
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.780
<v Speaker 3>for people that have degenerative disc</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>

1873
01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.910
<v Speaker 3>And that there's some really promising</v>
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>

1874
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I've heard anecdotally of a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1875
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:29.850
<v Speaker 2>very positive outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1876
01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:31.850
<v Speaker 2>with treatment like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1877
01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:34.070
<v Speaker 2>But that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1878
01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:34.933
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1879
01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:39.080
<v Speaker 2>it's still too early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot is surely enough conservative</v>

1880
01:25:39.081 --> 01:25:40.190
<v Speaker 2>about this are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1881
01:25:40.191 --> 01:25:42.350
<v Speaker 2>really do appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I'm giving you a hard time,</v>

1882
01:25:42.351 --> 01:25:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I feel you when you hustled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really wrestled with it because,</v>

1883
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1884
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.570
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our whole training is based on,</v>

1885
01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to do things that have an</v>

1886
01:25:52.461 --> 01:25:54.290
<v Speaker 2>evidence base for our patients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1887
01:25:54.291 --> 01:25:57.770
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foundation of what we do.</v>

1888
01:25:58.310 --> 01:26:00.770
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're in a unique situation,</v>

1889
01:26:00.771 --> 01:26:03.080
<v Speaker 2>so we have patients that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1890
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:08.090
<v Speaker 2>one week this stuff is available and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's legal to do and it's there and</v>

1891
01:26:08.091 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 2>people know about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

1892
01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.720
<v Speaker 2>they're seeking the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come to us.</v>

1893
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:13.820
<v Speaker 2>And even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1894
01:26:13.821 --> 01:26:16.550
<v Speaker 2>even before we started talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1895
01:26:16.551 --> 01:26:20.570
<v Speaker 2>it started to be like here and there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden it's like two,</v>

1896
01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:21.710
<v Speaker 2>three patients a day.</v>

1897
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Now even more are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1898
01:26:23.911 --> 01:26:25.510
<v Speaker 2>what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about stem cells should,</v>

1899
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:27.650
<v Speaker 2>can I have stem cell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1900
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:28.221
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1901
01:26:28.221 --> 01:26:30.020
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to have to back up and</v>

1902
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:31.100
<v Speaker 2>like have the whole discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1903
01:26:31.101 --> 01:26:33.530
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's talk about what that is and</v>

1904
01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:34.820
<v Speaker 2>what may be it can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1905
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:39.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people are seeking the treatment.</v>

1906
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:42.350
<v Speaker 2>It's available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1907
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:44.330
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know and we don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of information.</v>

1908
01:26:44.331 --> 01:26:45.740
<v Speaker 2>So we just have to be forthcoming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1909
01:26:45.741 --> 01:26:47.060
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is experimental.</v>

1910
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 2>We've had encouraging early results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you anecdotal stuff.</v>

1911
01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.900
<v Speaker 2>We've even seen images where somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

1912
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full thickness rotator cuff tear eight</v>

1913
01:26:56.571 --> 01:26:59.390
<v Speaker 2>months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what looked like a healed rotator cuff</v>

1914
01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:01.910
<v Speaker 2>on an MRI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1915
01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.710
<v Speaker 2>did that happen on its own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1916
01:27:03.711 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 2>we know that that happens at a lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage,</v>

1917
01:27:05.781 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 2>but it is possible to heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a lower percentage.</v>

1918
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it happen because of the treatment,</v>

1919
01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't been established.</v>

1920
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:18.230
<v Speaker 2>So I have to really explain all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other category to that,</v>

1921
01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients will come in and they'll</v>

1922
01:27:20.571 --> 01:27:25.250
<v Speaker 2>explain an injury and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've had to turn away a lot of</v>

1923
01:27:25.251 --> 01:27:27.920
<v Speaker 2>people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were fully ready to come in and</v>

1924
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:31.430
<v Speaker 2>have treatment and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were fine with paying out of</v>

1925
01:27:31.431 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 2>pocket because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not covered by insurance because</v>

1926
01:27:35.211 --> 01:27:37.400
<v Speaker 2>it's experimental because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1927
01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.320
<v Speaker 2>no data yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not true.</v>

1928
01:27:39.321 --> 01:27:40.790
<v Speaker 2>There's not no data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

1929
01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough data to support</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment for certain,</v>

1930
01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

1931
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1932
01:27:49.911 --> 01:27:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I've had to tell people I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is appropriate even even to try</v>

1933
01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:54.930
<v Speaker 2>even if you want this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1934
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:59.950
<v Speaker 2>and usually the category is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me if it's something mechanical.</v>

1935
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 2>So I think this makes intuitive sense to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1936
01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.310
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had you come to me and you said,</v>

1937
01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:08.144
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1938
01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:11.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dislocated my shoulder seven times and</v>

1939
01:28:11.481 --> 01:28:13.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you just put an injection in their</v>

1940
01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:15.013
<v Speaker 2>will?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1941
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:18.530
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>

1942
01:28:18.531 --> 01:28:21.200
<v Speaker 2>in this example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ligaments of the shoulder had been</v>

1943
01:28:21.201 --> 01:28:24.770
<v Speaker 2>stretched and disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of a dislocation,</v>

1944
01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:27.380
<v Speaker 2>there's oftentimes a labral tear that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes with that.</v>

1945
01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in,</v>

1946
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I could be proven wrong over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't believe that that an</v>

1947
01:28:34.371 --> 01:28:39.371
<v Speaker 2>injection on its own would magically</v>
<v Speaker 2>decreased the volume of the capsule.</v>

1948
01:28:40.130 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tightened the static structures in the</v>

1949
01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:45.740
<v Speaker 2>shoulder and resolve the pain for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient now.</v>

1950
01:28:45.741 --> 01:28:49.140
<v Speaker 2>But those right there was in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1951
01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:53.330
<v Speaker 2>I believe there was something that came</v>
<v Speaker 2>up a few years ago where they were doing</v>

1952
01:28:53.331 --> 01:28:57.000
<v Speaker 2>something where they're heating up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>insulation or capsule and shrink the</v>

1953
01:28:57.001 --> 01:28:58.130
<v Speaker 2>normal capsulorrhaphy.</v>

1954
01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:01.520
<v Speaker 2>What does that was very popular for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1955
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's close to malpractice.</v>

1956
01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:04.441
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1957
01:29:04.441 --> 01:29:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting though,</v>

1958
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:11.640
<v Speaker 2>the way these things go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a huge wave of,</v>

1959
01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:13.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in this.</v>

1960
01:29:13.921 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>And essentially what guys would do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking inside the shoulder.</v>

1961
01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:20.430
<v Speaker 2>You have a radio frequency wand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using that to heat the tissue and</v>

1962
01:29:20.431 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 2>you can watch it literally shrink in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you.</v>

1963
01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:28.340
<v Speaker 2>And then Richard Hawkins is a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished orthopedic surgeon,</v>

1964
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:30.930
<v Speaker 2>kind of iconic guy that's done tons of</v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

1965
01:29:30.931 --> 01:29:33.720
<v Speaker 2>He was also went in Vail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado,</v>

1966
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:37.280
<v Speaker 2>now in Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he published a paper that,</v>

1967
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:40.560
<v Speaker 2>that showed a very high rate of failure</v>
<v Speaker 2>from these procedures.</v>

1968
01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And so as a result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1969
01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:46.240
<v Speaker 2>it's fallen out of favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

1970
01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 2>But it was done very frequently on lots</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lots of shoulders,</v>

1971
01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.510
<v Speaker 2>a high rate of failure.</v>

1972
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:53.430
<v Speaker 2>It was like 40%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1973
01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.710
<v Speaker 2>But here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that because you're,</v>

1974
01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about already compromised</v>
<v Speaker 2>joints,</v>

1975
01:29:58.410 --> 01:30:00.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is a very complicated joint.</v>

1976
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:04.140
<v Speaker 2>The shoulder is very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's certainly a number of reasons</v>

1977
01:30:04.141 --> 01:30:05.640
<v Speaker 2>why that could have failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1978
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of problems with,</v>

1979
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:11.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically damage to the tissue from the</v>

1980
01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:13.950
<v Speaker 2>radio frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1981
01:30:13.951 --> 01:30:16.230
<v Speaker 2>so it was weakening things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1982
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I say yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1983
01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:20.760
<v Speaker 2>that what was the benefit of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1984
01:30:20.761 --> 01:30:23.610
<v Speaker 2>you could watch it and you were seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decrease in the volume of the</v>

1985
01:30:23.611 --> 01:30:26.160
<v Speaker 2>capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are where structures had become</v>

1986
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:29.910
<v Speaker 2>loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were seeing it become tight in at</v>

1987
01:30:29.911 --> 01:30:33.840
<v Speaker 2>the time zero period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about doing that in conjunction</v>

1988
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:37.720
<v Speaker 2>with some sort of a stem cell therapy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1989
01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.050
<v Speaker 2>does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:30:40.051 --> 01:30:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It must be a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1991
01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:43.800
<v Speaker 2>You're very close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1992
01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:47.430
<v Speaker 2>you're only a 10 years in school.</v>

1993
01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.530
<v Speaker 2>The only 14 years away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>14.</v>

1994
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all 14 for regular people.</v>

1995
01:30:51.661 --> 01:30:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Give me 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1996
01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:57.180
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why did they think that it would work</v>

1997
01:30:57.181 --> 01:30:58.200
<v Speaker 2>in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

1998
01:30:58.201 --> 01:30:59.100
<v Speaker 2>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1999
01:30:59.101 --> 01:31:00.900
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2000
01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:05.400
<v Speaker 2>there's early published papers that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that the outcomes were better if</v>

2001
01:31:05.401 --> 01:31:06.580
<v Speaker 2>you used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2002
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:08.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's murky.</v>

2003
01:31:08.461 --> 01:31:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's things that over time we</v>
<v Speaker 2>discover that what we thought we were</v>

2004
01:31:11.881 --> 01:31:12.960
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2005
01:31:12.961 --> 01:31:15.360
<v Speaker 2>we didn't fully understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long did it take before it</v>

2006
01:31:15.361 --> 01:31:19.440
<v Speaker 2>became malpractice or that problem and</v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated term problematic?</v>

2007
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2008
01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact year that his</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper was published,</v>

2009
01:31:23.071 --> 01:31:25.140
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2010
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:28.650
<v Speaker 2>it was before my residency training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>

2011
01:31:28.651 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I graduated medical school in 2006 so it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was before that that people weren't</v>

2012
01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:34.860
<v Speaker 2>doing that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2013
01:31:34.861 --> 01:31:35.910
<v Speaker 2>So I'll bring it back around.</v>

2014
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:39.660
<v Speaker 2>So when someone has had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you talk to some due to play</v>

2015
01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:42.540
<v Speaker 2>football or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had multiple shoulder dislocations,</v>

2016
01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:44.820
<v Speaker 2>like what would you do to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you would encourage surgery?</v>

2017
01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

2018
01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the typical</v>

2019
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:56.570
<v Speaker 2>course for recurrent instability of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder would be a stabilization</v>

2020
01:31:57.151 --> 01:32:00.850
<v Speaker 2>procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a lot of that's based on the exam</v>

2021
01:32:00.851 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 2>and what you see on imaging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people can do well with a simple</v>

2022
01:32:04.901 --> 01:32:07.450
<v Speaker 2>shoulder arthroscopy and then you pass a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple stitches,</v>

2023
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.300
<v Speaker 2>you repair the labor from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tighten the capsule at the same</v>

2024
01:32:10.301 --> 01:32:13.060
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And young patients progressed really</v>

2025
01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:15.910
<v Speaker 2>well through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2026
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:18.640
<v Speaker 2>when there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2027
01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:23.470
<v Speaker 2>more complicated problems such as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's bone loss on the front of the</v>

2028
01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:26.020
<v Speaker 2>socket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you have a dislocation,</v>

2029
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:27.700
<v Speaker 2>the head goes forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2030
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.990
<v Speaker 2>it goes out the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the typical and anterior shoulder</v>

2031
01:32:31.991 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 2>dislocation is the usual one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as it tries to come back into</v>

2032
01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:39.400
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head bangs into the glenoid or the</v>

2033
01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:41.380
<v Speaker 2>socket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>

2034
01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:43.280
<v Speaker 2>you'll tear the front of the Labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2035
01:32:43.281 --> 01:32:46.870
<v Speaker 2>you'll stretch the front of the capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you can also get a dent in the</v>

2036
01:32:46.871 --> 01:32:51.871
<v Speaker 2>back of the humeral head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the correct procedure,</v>

2037
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2038
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I keep throwing you off track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when someone does have a shoulder</v>

2039
01:32:56.031 --> 01:32:58.010
<v Speaker 1>dislocation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you supposed to do?</v>

2040
01:32:58.020 --> 01:32:59.840
<v Speaker 1>He supposed to pull on it and just take</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to the hospital.</v>

2041
01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably no harm in doing that.</v>

2042
01:33:04.981 --> 01:33:07.530
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great technique called the</v>

2043
01:33:07.531 --> 01:33:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Zahiri technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spell it.</v>

2044
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:10.491
<v Speaker 2>Z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2045
01:33:10.491 --> 01:33:13.080
<v Speaker 2>H I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>R I and it's just the name of the guy</v>

2046
01:33:13.081 --> 01:33:14.820
<v Speaker 2>that wrote the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2047
01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:17.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a really easy thing for you</v>

2048
01:33:17.521 --> 01:33:19.200
<v Speaker 2>learn cause it's kind of a leverage</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2049
01:33:20.190 --> 01:33:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a way to,</v>

2050
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage the,</v>

2051
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:28.710
<v Speaker 2>the arm so that you can get the muscles</v>
<v Speaker 2>to relax.</v>

2052
01:33:28.711 --> 01:33:33.240
<v Speaker 2>It's easy on the person and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do it awake and like at the</v>

2053
01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:36.930
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I actually did it on a,</v>

2054
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:37.833
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2055
01:33:37.890 --> 01:33:40.310
<v Speaker 2>professional steer wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2056
01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.700
<v Speaker 2>at the Rodeo.</v>

2057
01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:47.060
<v Speaker 1>How hilarious is it that you can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional steer wrestler like the</v>

2058
01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Seattle Sandwich</v>

2059
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:50.150
<v Speaker 2>for a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2060
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:51.050
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2061
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:52.970
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty serious about stuff.</v>

2062
01:33:52.971 --> 01:33:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Super serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were talking about you're a bucket</v>

2063
01:33:55.311 --> 01:33:58.430
<v Speaker 2>handle meniscus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first Rodeo cowboy that I took care</v>

2064
01:33:58.431 --> 01:34:01.220
<v Speaker 2>of had a flipped bucket handle meniscus</v>
<v Speaker 2>tear,</v>

2065
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:05.810
<v Speaker 2>and he came in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day that the national finals Rodeo</v>

2066
01:34:05.811 --> 01:34:08.840
<v Speaker 2>was starting and he was also a steer</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler by the way.</v>

2067
01:34:08.841 --> 01:34:11.670
<v Speaker 2>And had been a previous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was a champ or he,</v>

2068
01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:13.010
<v Speaker 2>he won a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

2069
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they basically,</v>

2070
01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.680
<v Speaker 2>they taped his knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to come closer.</v>

2071
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:19.580
<v Speaker 2>They taped his knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2072
01:34:19.730 --> 01:34:24.730
<v Speaker 2>in about 30 degrees of flection and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>competed the whole nine days.</v>

2073
01:34:25.670 --> 01:34:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just roped up knee.</v>

2074
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Just taped it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got on his horse and was jumping off and</v>

2075
01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.180
<v Speaker 1>throwing 600 pounds steers on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

2076
01:34:35.190 --> 01:34:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2077
01:34:36.710 --> 01:34:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see stuff on TV.</v>

2078
01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I've never even been to one live because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified.</v>

2079
01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:43.880
<v Speaker 1>You need to come to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2080
01:34:43.881 --> 01:34:47.730
<v Speaker 1>we did an episode of fear factor.</v>

2090
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wrote here and the guy and the horse</v>

2091
01:35:08.481 --> 01:35:10.070
<v Speaker 1>take off at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You jump off,</v>

2092
01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you grab it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grab it by the horns and turn its</v>

2093
01:35:11.811 --> 01:35:13.710
<v Speaker 1>neck and throw it in the ground and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wrapped it.</v>

2094
01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See with steer is a bull that doesn't</v>

2095
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:18.290
<v Speaker 1>have any balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2096
01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that polls.</v>

2097
01:35:20.141 --> 01:35:23.250
<v Speaker 1>But the same animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're younger than the ones that they</v>

2098
01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.950
<v Speaker 1>cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They chopped their balls off before they</v>

2099
01:35:24.951 --> 01:35:26.960
<v Speaker 1>get a chance to mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when they,</v>

2100
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.420
<v Speaker 1>they rules are terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2101
01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:33.440
<v Speaker 1>and write down next to the bucking chute</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like frightening actually had a</v>

2102
01:35:33.441 --> 01:35:36.050
<v Speaker 1>clot of dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get one of them kicked it up and it hit</v>

2103
01:35:36.051 --> 01:35:37.850
<v Speaker 1>me in the head like a baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2104
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:40.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See they're a little babies and they</v>

2105
01:35:40.821 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 1>have no balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy jumps off.</v>

2106
01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:43.600
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2107
01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:48.410
<v Speaker 1>and you tell him that is so whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a stupid fucking thing to be</v>

2108
01:35:48.411 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 1>excited about these ideas.</v>

2109
01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:53.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to ask what of that thing I</v>
<v Speaker 6>was trying to get away.</v>

2110
01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:56.250
<v Speaker 6>I grab him by his natural handles and</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd tuck them down.</v>

2111
01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.000
<v Speaker 6>Look how quick,</v>

2112
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.940
<v Speaker 1>look at their move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a darce choke and the cows</v>

2113
01:35:59.941 --> 01:36:01.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2115
01:36:03.610 --> 01:36:06.980
<v Speaker 1>the cows like what is going on?</v>

2116

<v Speaker 1>always do it the same way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

2117
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:11.600
<v Speaker 1>It's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's similar to like a a chokehold.</v>

2118
01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2119
01:36:12.841 --> 01:36:17.350

2120
01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:19.170
<v Speaker 1>backs.</v>

2121
01:36:19.171 --> 01:36:23.370
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you outside of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are some of the nicest guys I've</v>

2122
01:36:23.371 --> 01:36:24.960
<v Speaker 1>ever met in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

2123
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:26.790
<v Speaker 1>and there are some of the toughest</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

2124
01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine those guys are tough as</v>

2125
01:36:28.891 --> 01:36:29.970
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be,</v>

2126
01:36:30.090 --> 01:36:32.730
<v Speaker 1>they got to do it on fearful pete</v>
<v Speaker 1>through every injury.</v>

2127
01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:35.910
<v Speaker 1>There is no injury that they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they won't compete.</v>

2128
01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.710
<v Speaker 1>You're always broken up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2129
01:36:37.711 --> 01:36:39.040
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to do it on food.</v>

2130
01:36:39.041 --> 01:36:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had nine don't make money if</v>

2131
01:36:40.801 --> 01:36:42.810
<v Speaker 1>they're not competing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so right.</v>

2132
01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:46.350
<v Speaker 1>We have to do it on fear factor was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>steer champion or a Rodeo champion</v>

2133
01:36:46.351 --> 01:36:48.300
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had nine shoulder surgeries,</v>

2134
01:36:48.301 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 1>his shoulder was just like sliced all</v>
<v Speaker 1>open and he,</v>

2135
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long off it has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dislocated,</v>

2136
01:36:53.121 --> 01:36:56.070
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get me anytime I could open up a car</v>

2137
01:36:56.071 --> 01:36:57.210
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will pop out of socket.</v>

2138
01:36:57.230 --> 01:36:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yikes.</v>

2139
01:36:59.160 --> 01:36:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

2140
01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2141
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:04.980
<v Speaker 1>so back around to where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2142
01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

2143
01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:10.800
<v Speaker 1>How does this xy here technique?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you describe it?</v>

2144
01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:13.980
<v Speaker 1>That I say right is that hearing Tahirih</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erie techniques.</v>

2145
01:37:13.981 --> 01:37:18.981
<v Speaker 1>So that one of the guys that we trained</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a in are my sports medicine program</v>

2146
01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:24.720
<v Speaker 1>and Alabama showed us this and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of the first things that</v>

2147
01:37:24.721 --> 01:37:26.100
<v Speaker 1>we reviewed at the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

2148
01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically you have the person lying</v>

2149
01:37:29.101 --> 01:37:34.101
<v Speaker 1>flat on their back and I would hold your</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrist and then I loop my arm under your</v>

2150
01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:39.690
<v Speaker 1>arm and then grab onto mine for</v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage.</v>

2151
01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And then I literally just sort of lean</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and I'm using the muscles in my</v>

2152
01:37:44.521 --> 01:37:48.570
<v Speaker 1>back so I'm not pulling with my arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a small person can do this on a very</v>

2153
01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:51.240
<v Speaker 1>big athlete and you're fine because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2154
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:53.700
<v Speaker 1>you're using all of the strongest</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles in your body,</v>

2155
01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you literally just</v>

2156
01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.790
<v Speaker 2>lean back and you hold traction in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

2157
01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:01.650
<v Speaker 2>So you've got the arm is positioned like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2158
01:38:01.670 --> 01:38:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to describe to people that are</v>

2159
01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:04.400
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2160
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:06.890
<v Speaker 2>the arm is in front of the person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2161
01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.610
<v Speaker 2>while they're laying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laying on their back.</v>

2162
01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:12.780
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my right hand on your right</v>

2163
01:38:12.781 --> 01:38:14.610
<v Speaker 2>wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a right shoulder dislocation,</v>

2164
01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:15.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just see a video.</v>

2165
01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:16.850
<v Speaker 3>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a video of it.</v>

2166
01:38:17.170 --> 01:38:20.060
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to find him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to hopefully guests that</v>

2167
01:38:20.061 --> 01:38:22.130
<v Speaker 3>this is maybe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully.</v>

2168
01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2169
01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Let me explain to people at home what</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like as if you were trying to</v>

2170
01:38:26.691 --> 01:38:28.370
<v Speaker 3>give someone an armbar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2171
01:38:28.371 --> 01:38:31.040
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a hook on the left side and so</v>

2172
01:38:31.041 --> 01:38:32.590
<v Speaker 3>the hook is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your left,</v>

2173
01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.580
<v Speaker 3>if you're trying to arm bar someone on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right,</v>

2174
01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:37.010
<v Speaker 3>the right arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you were inside control,</v>

2175
01:38:37.210 --> 01:38:40.910
<v Speaker 3>you would hook it with your left arm and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you would trap it in place.</v>

2176
01:38:40.911 --> 01:38:43.340
<v Speaker 3>And what a person does when they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to get arm barred,</v>

2177
01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:46.490
<v Speaker 3>their defense is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grabbed their hands together and so</v>

2178
01:38:46.491 --> 01:38:49.820
<v Speaker 3>you loop your arm in that and pull it</v>
<v Speaker 3>back like that.</v>

2179
01:38:49.821 --> 01:38:51.800
<v Speaker 3>So that'd be real similar what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

2180
01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:55.400
<v Speaker 3>you're using the left arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of connecting it like this</v>

2181
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:58.310
<v Speaker 3>and then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually just using traction.</v>

2182
01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2183
01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:03.140
<v Speaker 3>the treater in this case on the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

2184
01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:08.460
<v Speaker 2>he just going to lean back and hold and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just wait and in about 10 seconds</v>

2185
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:12.000
<v Speaker 2>pops in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deltoid and the pack and the biceps</v>

2186
01:39:12.001 --> 01:39:14.040
<v Speaker 2>relax and it just slides in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2187
01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:16.380
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can actually do that.</v>

2188
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:20.700
<v Speaker 2>And I mean the kinder way to do this as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2189
01:39:20.701 --> 01:39:24.190
<v Speaker 2>with some anesthesia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times you can do that and</v>

2190
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:28.800
<v Speaker 2>they're perfectly comfortable in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Immediately better on the shoulders back</v>

2191
01:39:28.801 --> 01:39:31.650
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're not completely better,</v>

2192
01:39:31.651 --> 01:39:33.900
<v Speaker 2>but the pain is relieved from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>initial event.</v>

2193
01:39:34.210 --> 01:39:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Now you told me when you looked at my</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mri that you think that my shoulder was</v>

2194
01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:38.710
<v Speaker 3>dislocated at some point in time.</v>

2195
01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember it exactly your Mri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you had a tear of the front of</v>

2196
01:39:43.201 --> 01:39:44.340
<v Speaker 2>the Labor Room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had,</v>

2197
01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:47.520
<v Speaker 2>and you had that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any evidence of that little dent in the</v>

2198
01:39:47.521 --> 01:39:52.200
<v Speaker 2>back of the humeral head and then that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be consistent with that.</v>

2199
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I just do not remember ever having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dislocated shoulder,</v>

2200
01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:58.830
<v Speaker 3>but I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been Kamora you've had a bunch of</v>

2201
01:39:58.831 --> 01:40:01.500
<v Speaker 3>times that you've had it slip maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

2202
01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when just the nature of your shoulder</v>

2203
01:40:03.871 --> 01:40:05.250
<v Speaker 3>locked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2204
01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:10.260
<v Speaker 3>there's been a many American as in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>past and Maura's and all these different</v>

2205
01:40:10.261 --> 01:40:12.060
<v Speaker 3>like hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2206
01:40:12.061 --> 01:40:13.790
<v Speaker 3>the thing is we're on the receiving end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2207
01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:16.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before this injury,</v>

2208
01:40:16.831 --> 01:40:19.140
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americana you could definitely have at</v>

2209
01:40:19.141 --> 01:40:21.330
<v Speaker 3>least a subluxation of the shoulder for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2210
01:40:21.331 --> 01:40:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

2211
01:40:22.561 --> 01:40:24.870
<v Speaker 3>And you fight it off too because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want it to happen.</v>

2212
01:40:24.871 --> 01:40:27.130
<v Speaker 3>So you're resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2213
01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:30.090
<v Speaker 3>before this injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do any shoulder exercises.</v>

2214
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.360
<v Speaker 3>I just worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't do any specific exercises</v>

2215
01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:36.090
<v Speaker 3>just to strengthen my shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that was a big mistake.</v>

2216
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:41.310
<v Speaker 3>And I kind of emphasize that with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>like doing a external and internal</v>

2217
01:40:41.311 --> 01:40:42.770
<v Speaker 3>rotation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2218
01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:45.550
<v Speaker 3>exercises doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2219
01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:50.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan now of a inverted</v>
<v Speaker 3>kettlebell presses and yeah,</v>

2220
01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.250
<v Speaker 3>that's what had been one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a giant right.</v>

2221
01:40:52.251 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>My favorite lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely a challenge.</v>

2222
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't need much weight and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2223
01:40:56.501 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 1>this little 40 pound iron man</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebell,</v>

2224
01:40:59.051 --> 01:41:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I use this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2225
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:03.820
<v Speaker 1>That exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

2226
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>

2227
01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:10.740
<v Speaker 1>they say you should be able to do 50% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Max weight or is that 50% or 90% I</v>

2228
01:41:12.341 --> 01:41:14.140
<v Speaker 1>forget what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget me.</v>

2229
01:41:14.290 --> 01:41:15.101
<v Speaker 1>Don't listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2230
01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:17.890
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on,</v>

2231
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I said 90.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2232
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the injured patient or the person</v>

2233
01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:24.730
<v Speaker 1>that's recovering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be starting with much</v>

2234
01:41:24.731 --> 01:41:25.750
<v Speaker 1>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much lower,</v>

2235
01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:28.350
<v Speaker 1>much lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but focus is on your motion,</v>

2236
01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.100
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your posture,</v>

2237
01:41:30.101 --> 01:41:32.580
<v Speaker 1>engaging your core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping your ribs down in,</v>

2238
01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:35.800
<v Speaker 1>in having the full motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strong first protocol.</v>

2239
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I think what they're trying to say is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to have really powerful shoulders,</v>

2240
01:41:39.941 --> 01:41:43.750
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to do 90% of your Max</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebell press.</v>

2241
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you can Max Kettle press 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

2242
01:41:47.110 --> 01:41:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Now that's with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the handle down,</v>

2243
01:41:50.411 --> 01:41:51.460
<v Speaker 1>build down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2244
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:53.830
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With Max,</v>

2246
01:41:53.831 --> 01:41:56.080
<v Speaker 1>that would be your Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what you go with one rep Max.</v>

2247
01:41:56.081 --> 01:41:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you know what,</v>

2248
01:41:57.431 --> 01:42:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you would pretty much be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2249
01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:02.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could do two or three if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really had to,</v>

2250
01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a lot of weight.</v>

2251
01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2252
01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:09.190
<v Speaker 1>you know what you would normally like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max out at like there's,</v>

2253
01:42:09.191 --> 01:42:11.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a protocol that this guy,</v>

2254
01:42:11.351 --> 01:42:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Pavel Tatsu lean follows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really kind of interesting in,</v>

2255
01:42:14.881 --> 01:42:15.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pavel,</v>

2256
01:42:15.581 --> 01:42:15.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2257
01:42:15.971 --> 01:42:17.350
<v Speaker 1>he's the Kettle Bell Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2258
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:19.510
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that brought him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call him the godfather of</v>

2259
01:42:19.511 --> 01:42:21.190
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells and America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2260
01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.410
<v Speaker 1>the guy that I trained with talks about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all the time.</v>

2261
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2262
01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.410
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2263
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:30.010
<v Speaker 1>don't do your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you could do 10 reps,</v>

2264
01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you do five and you wait a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you do another five and you wait a</v>

2265
01:42:34.801 --> 01:42:37.150
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you do another five and he never</v>

2266
01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:37.984
<v Speaker 1>worked a failure.</v>

2267
01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:40.750
<v Speaker 1>And that working to failure is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>not healthy.</v>

2268
01:42:40.751 --> 01:42:43.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not smart and you don't really get</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger that way would be my</v>

2269
01:42:43.781 --> 01:42:47.380
<v Speaker 1>recommendation is that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2270
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:49.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is coming from not,</v>

2271
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:51.280
<v Speaker 1>this isn't from the orthopedic surgery</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2272
01:42:51.281 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 1>This is what I've read from strength and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning people.</v>

2273
01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:59.610
<v Speaker 1>The thing you want to avoid in doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to failure is with load in a</v>

2274
01:42:59.801 --> 01:43:03.070
<v Speaker 1>skill activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

2275
01:43:03.071 --> 01:43:08.071
<v Speaker 1>like a clean or a snatch or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that involve coordination.</v>

2276
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where you have to time it requires,</v>

2277
01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound mechanics,</v>

2278
01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:14.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're doing it with load.</v>

2279
01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:19.180
<v Speaker 1>It's bad to do that to failure because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens as you fatigue is your</v>

2280
01:43:19.181 --> 01:43:20.510
<v Speaker 1>mechanics are going to break down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2281
01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:21.880
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're gonna get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2282
01:43:21.881 --> 01:43:26.881
<v Speaker 1>what Pavel talks about is that strength</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a skill and that all these different</v>

2283
01:43:27.341 --> 01:43:30.190
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of them as a skill and then don't</v>

2284
01:43:30.191 --> 01:43:31.240
<v Speaker 1>do things to failure.</v>

2285
01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And if you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2286
01:43:34.061 --> 01:43:36.370
<v Speaker 1>endurance or something along those</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>

2287
01:43:36.371 --> 01:43:40.270
<v Speaker 1>you want to do light weights and you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do multiple repetitions is not</v>

2288
01:43:40.271 --> 01:43:41.890
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing when you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get stronger.</v>

2289
01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:43.330
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:44.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2291
01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:45.250
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2292
01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:47.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different arguments one way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

2293
01:43:47.891 --> 01:43:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to power lifters and they're like,</v>

2294
01:43:49.421 --> 01:43:51.410
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to do it to failure.</v>

2295
01:43:52.150 --> 01:43:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2296
01:43:53.970 --> 01:43:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Talk to crossfit people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to do 100 reps,</v>

2297
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:57.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2298
01:43:58.030 --> 01:44:00.260
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are activities that you can train</v>

2299
01:44:00.261 --> 01:44:03.110
<v Speaker 1>to failure and there's no risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

2300
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:04.580
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pull ups,</v>

2301
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you fail,</v>

2302
01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't get up.</v>

2303
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2304
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you just going to come off the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2305
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:13.720
<v Speaker 1>The battle ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just going to fatigue out like there</v>

2306
01:44:13.721 --> 01:44:15.240
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hurt yourself,</v>

2307
01:44:15.241 --> 01:44:15.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2308
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Do they even believed that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing chin ups,</v>

2309
01:44:18.110 --> 01:44:19.580
<v Speaker 1>like if you're doing pull ups or Chin</v>
<v Speaker 1>ups,</v>

2310
01:44:19.930 --> 01:44:22.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you're doing it,</v>

2311
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.560
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't go to failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should just stop,</v>

2312
01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:29.090
<v Speaker 1>like close to it or halfway there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then take a long time off and then do</v>

2313
01:44:29.091 --> 01:44:31.000
<v Speaker 1>another five reps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if your,</v>

2314
01:44:31.001 --> 01:44:33.770
<v Speaker 1>your Max is 10 reps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to five,</v>

2315
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:35.780
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a break,</v>

2316
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:38.960
<v Speaker 1>do another five stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take another five,</v>

2317
01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:40.310
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do another five,</v>

2318
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:45.430
<v Speaker 1>keep going and just you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working on form and your muscles</v>

2319
01:44:46.311 --> 01:44:49.550
<v Speaker 1>are performing these actions in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>

2320
01:44:49.551 --> 01:44:54.551
<v Speaker 1>smooth delivery and that this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best way to recover or to build strength</v>

2321
01:44:54.591 --> 01:44:57.980
<v Speaker 1>and that you just do it more often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it to failure once a week and</v>

2322
01:44:57.981 --> 01:45:00.530
<v Speaker 1>then be a wreck for like three or four</v>
<v Speaker 1>days afterwards.</v>

2323
01:45:00.531 --> 01:45:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Because you know that feeling when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you lift weights and you lift</v>

2324
01:45:03.261 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 1>weights for a week or you lift weights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you lift weights to failure rather,</v>

2325
01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:09.920
<v Speaker 1>and you're sore for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get anything done.</v>

2326
01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:15.370
<v Speaker 1>This idea is you do more frequent</v>
<v Speaker 1>workouts and you don't go to failure but</v>

2327
01:45:17.121 --> 01:45:22.121
<v Speaker 1>don't go over five Reps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the biggest mistakes that</v>

2328
01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:25.580
<v Speaker 1>we see in reasons that people show up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my office,</v>

2329
01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:31.300
<v Speaker 1>it is because of overload and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no time for recovery,</v>

2330
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:34.280
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the training that you're doing.</v>

2331
01:45:34.281 --> 01:45:38.930
<v Speaker 1>So you don't see people period ising and</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporating the times when they're</v>

2332
01:45:38.931 --> 01:45:40.190
<v Speaker 1>just allowing rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2333
01:45:40.191 --> 01:45:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you can't be working at Max capacity all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2334
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.411
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2335
01:45:45.411 --> 01:45:48.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big thing with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

2336
01:45:48.330 --> 01:45:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeping them for working hard is so hard</v>

2337
01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:52.400
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:45:52.401 --> 01:45:55.190
<v Speaker 1>So I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to emphasize with [inaudible] and</v>

2339
01:45:55.191 --> 01:45:58.490
<v Speaker 1>we have to really talk about this with</v>
<v Speaker 1>our acl rehab.</v>

2340
01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a group that,</v>

2341
01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:02.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so eager to get back,</v>

2342
01:46:03.110 --> 01:46:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're a competitive athlete that,</v>

2343
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:06.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to remind them that,</v>

2344
01:46:06.771 --> 01:46:08.360
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have steps to go through.</v>

2345
01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to work smart.</v>

2346
01:46:09.921 --> 01:46:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Not Hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2347
01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:13.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a plan and there's a reason why</v>

2348
01:46:13.671 --> 01:46:18.470
<v Speaker 1>this week may not be a whole lot of work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your body needs rest and recovery in</v>

2349
01:46:18.471 --> 01:46:22.730
<v Speaker 1>order to put stress on it again so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can continue to make your progress.</v>

2350
01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point you're either going to</v>

2351
01:46:24.651 --> 01:46:26.440
<v Speaker 1>plateau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be making changes,</v>

2352
01:46:26.441 --> 01:46:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna get frustrated or you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to get hurt.</v>

2353
01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2354
01:46:29.931 --> 01:46:32.780
<v Speaker 1>we got to bring this home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything else we need to,</v>
