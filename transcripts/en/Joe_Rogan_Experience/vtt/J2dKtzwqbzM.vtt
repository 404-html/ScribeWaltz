1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
Right,

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.723
too.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:08.891
<v 1>Boom.</v>

4
00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:09.724
And we're alive.

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.713
My man.

6
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.643
What's up baby?

7
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.603
First of all,

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.860
how the fuck do you punched so hard,

9
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.160
hard punches,

10
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:18.371
man.

11
00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:20.290
I've been watching boxing since I was a little kid.

12
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.210
You've got some freakish power,

13
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:23.020
man.

14
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.740
Weird.

15
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.690
You got weird power the most definitely.

16
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:25.991
Oh,

17
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:27.490
we always say I'm a freak of nature.

18
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.290
I definitely got some type of freakish power.

19
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.060
Um,

20
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.520
I always tell the story that my grandmother said I was anointed by God.

21
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.930
She was always like,

22
00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:36.610
if I got suspended for school and stuff,

23
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:37.600
she was always like,

24
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.940
God is trying to use you.

25
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.620
You're the one you are chosen.

26
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:42.430
You know?

27
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.030
She was very big and you know,

28
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.630
she was big in the,

29
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:46.540
in the spirit,

30
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.210
spirituality and Christianity,

31
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.871
you know,

32
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:51.910
so she's always be a teacher.

33
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.331
You know,

34
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:54.010
she wasn't really a discipline,

35
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.990
disciplinary type of woman.

36
00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:56.830
She was a teacher.

37
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.900
She wanted to teach or tell you certain things.

38
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:00.800
She used to always say how I was annoying.

39
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.200
She won't even let my parents woke me.

40
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.681
Well,

41
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:03.550
not in front of her.

42
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.020
That's how serious you were.

43
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.393
She like,

44
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.061
she like,

45
00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:08.220
don't you been out with him?

46
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.880
He's going to be the one that bring you up.

47
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.310
He didn't want to be the one that bring you guys up.

48
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:13.090
Don't whoop him.

49
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.923
You know?

50
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.530
Um,

51
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.540
somebody tells you something like that at a young age,

52
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:17.374
you might believe it.

53
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.071
Well,

54
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:19.380
I didn't even realize that really,

55
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.871
you know,

56
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.010
just being so young,

57
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:21.431
you know,

58
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:22.264
just being,

59
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.440
you know,

60
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.751
we,

61
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:24.230
we,

62
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.760
we,

63
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.870
we did as children.

64
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:26.380
Do,

65
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.213
you know,

66
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.030
I didn't really think too much about it because I didn't understand what she was

67
00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:31.540
saying.

68
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.051
You know,

69
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:35.560
I ain't started understanding until you start putting away child his ways and

70
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:39.820
you become a grown man and you start venturing out in life and experience in

71
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:42.310
life on your own and started seeing certain things.

72
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.173
And then even,

73
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.890
even when I got out on my own,

74
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.731
you know,

75
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.540
I really,

76
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.321
there's a lot of things,

77
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.450
I didn't start on understanding until I was 30,

78
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.590
you know what I'm saying?

79
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.670
Just to,

80
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.001
you know,

81
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:52.834
cause certain things,

82
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.591
different things,

83
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:54.610
what happened in my life,

84
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.511
you know,

85
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:55.931
and that you,

86
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:56.410
you know,

87
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.400
sometimes you just give you the,

88
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.711
you,

89
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:01.060
you deal with it and you handle it the best way you can handle.

90
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.120
But it's certain things that starts to happen.

91
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.871
He was like,

92
00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:06.450
my grandma said something about this or,

93
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.790
you know,

94
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.623
it's just,

95
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.523
you know,

96
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.981
and,

97
00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:09.340
um,

98
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.540
that's how my life been.

99
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.570
But it's amazing how I can come in at two oh nine and father God is that coming

100
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:18.480
in at two 16 and,

101
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.320
and able to drop him like I did.

102
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:20.650
Like,

103
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.310
it's crazy,

104
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.820
but we all are always been stronger than mine than what I've looked.

105
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.670
It's interesting that the cruiserweight division doesn't get any love.

106
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.031
I mean,

107
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:30.290
the last time it got lovers with Evander Holyfield was fine.

108
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.880
Yeah.

109
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.490
That was really the last time people cared about the cruiserweight division.

110
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.900
Now it's a forgotten division.

111
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.810
Kinda almost.

112
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.220
Yeah.

113
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.401
Yeah,

114
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:37.090
that's true.

115
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.690
You know,

116
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.523
um,

117
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.041
you know,

118
00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:40.420
my brother just starting in the,

119
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.841
in the,

120
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:42.460
in the cruiserweight division,

121
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.890
hopefully he can bring some excitement to it because you,

122
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:46.720
you're so right.

123
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.051
You know,

124
00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:49.180
it's almost like they don't even talk about it.

125
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.880
It doesn't make any sense because the light heavyweight division gets a lot of

126
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:52.480
love,

127
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.230
love watching light.

128
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.270
Heavyweight fights always gets lots of attention.

129
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:57.550
But the cruiserweight division is always like people looking at like,

130
00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:58.320
why are you here?

131
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.153
Yeah.

132
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.760
But on some weight go up.

133
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.270
Yup.

134
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.540
Yup.

135
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.110
It's true.

136
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.520
It's true because the heavier ways always overshadow those guys.

137
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.010
Did you really wait two oh nine the night of the fight?

138
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.110
I weighed two on the night of the fight.

139
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.870
I was out when they came in the way media,

140
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.940
it would just want to get an official way in and see,

141
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.230
see where you are.

142
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.570
So I'm all confident and like I like,

143
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:23.490
I know I didn't went up from two 12 and um,

144
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.830
I get on the scale and it says two are now like,

145
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.770
I like what you mean to tell me I lost three more pounds.

146
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.480
You know,

147
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.270
I'm like,

148
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.150
how did I,

149
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.383
how did I do that?

150
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.403
My manager,

151
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.951
you know,

152
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.951
he thinks it's come from stress and a lot of little different things or whatever

153
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.010
the last couple of days.

154
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.520
Right before the fight that allow your body just,

155
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.670
just overall,

156
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:49.504
a lot of stuff was,

157
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.403
you know,

158
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.610
a lot of stuff going on.

159
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.500
He thinks it's because of that,

160
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.281
you know,

161
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:55.000
cause your body,

162
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.120
you're the balance of your,

163
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.540
your body and all that and stuff like that.

164
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.130
But I really don't know.

165
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.730
I really don't really care about weight because majority of my fighter,

166
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.950
the majority of the fighters that have fought me,

167
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.160
they've all waved me like almost all my career,

168
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.701
you know?

169
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:14.701
So I always say I'd rather be the park then looked apart because I've been in

170
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.550
many situations where I've seen guys looking the part,

171
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.384
but then when it's,

172
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.790
when it get to the nitty gritty,

173
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.770
then not depart.

174
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.081
Well,

175
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:24.070
you look the part too.

176
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.150
You don't get it twisted

177
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.870
<v 2>giant Tommy Hearns yeah.</v>

178
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.330
You know,

179
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.530
when Tommy was in his prime,

180
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.371
it's just,

181
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:30.740
uh,

182
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.750
it's what,

183
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.990
what makes sense though is that you keep that power in the 12th round.

184
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.920
Where's those bigger,

185
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:36.731
heavier guys?

186
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:39.250
Maybe because the blood's got to push through all that extra muscle and all that

187
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.270
extra body tissue.

188
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.350
Maybe they can't keep that power of the way you can because in the 12th round,

189
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.400
first of all,

190
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.950
I don't know how the fuck he got up.

191
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.940
I do not understand.

192
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:50.230
I remember watching it on TV.

193
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:50.531
I'm like,

194
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:50.831
wow,

195
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:52.270
he knocked him out in the 12th round.

196
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.500
That is crazy.

197
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.891
Right.

198
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:54.724
It's crazy.

199
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.550
And then of course you played that thing on your Instagram,

200
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.800
which basically shows that you did knock them out.

201
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.220
<v 1>Right.</v>

202
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.850
Oh,

203
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.810
definitely knocked him out.

204
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.310
He definitely didn't get up in time.

205
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.200
He definitely didn't,

206
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.034
you know,

207
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.270
but it was his job to just get up

208
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.711
<v 2>10.</v>

209
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.660
It's not his job to know exactly when,

210
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:10.411
10 seconds.

211
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:10.710
Yes.

212
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.310
<v 1>Correct.</v>

213
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.143
Correct.

214
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.361
No,

215
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:14.360
jet Reese definitely had delays on that account.

216
00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:16.320
I haven't seen the fight like six times.

217
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:18.600
And then definitely when he got to eight,

218
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.320
you know,

219
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.200
eight was a very long delay.

220
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.770
Eight then he said no,

221
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.700
you know,

222
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.450
um,

223
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.871
like I said,

224
00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:30.030
99 out of 10 judges would have waved at all,

225
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.840
you know,

226
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.151
easily.

227
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.080
Especially when you've seen the guy our rolling in the back of his head and he

228
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.540
and him hitting the canvas and his,

229
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.960
his,

230
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.793
his,

231
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.690
his whole head meat penetrate penetrated.

232
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.400
Like it started getting tight.

233
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:43.650
The muscles in the head getting tight in the back.

234
00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:44.484
And

235
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.270
you know what,

236
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.763
it's,

237
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.640
it's so much with that.

238
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.510
I know how he got,

239
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.280
I didn't understand how he got up either.

240
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.990
And God is a good God.

241
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.250
Well,

242
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.990
he believed it.

243
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.681
That's what he believed.

244
00:05:57.681 --> 00:05:58.514
He believed it.

245
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.100
He got up man and he got up and he boxed.

246
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:02.380
Well he recovered

247
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.960
<v 2>you.</v>

248
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.810
You mean you came after him and you hit him with some more big shots and he kept

249
00:06:06.811 --> 00:06:07.201
moving,

250
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.780
but then he started getting his legs back under them and then he started Landen

251
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.770
<v 1>does also other things as well too.</v>

252
00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:12.011
You know,

253
00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:13.210
he's still a gypsy though.

254
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.910
Yeah.

255
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.291
You know,

256
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:14.561
you know,

257
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:15.700
they believe in a lot of things,

258
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.733
right.

259
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.320
So you never know,

260
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.263
you know,

261
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.220
fucking phenomenal fight though.

262
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.051
Epic.

263
00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:25.270
It was absolutely amazing to watch.

264
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:25.970
Most definitely.

265
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.390
I watched it by myself with family was gone.

266
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:29.380
They went out for the day.

267
00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:29.861
So I was like,

268
00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:30.581
this is great.

269
00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:31.414
Just me.

270
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.310
Did you watch it on mute now?

271
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.180
See what I'm saying?

272
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.770
The commentators,

273
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:35.951
man,

274
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:36.850
they was horrible.

275
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.810
It was horrible.

276
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.910
I felt it was very biased.

277
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.201
It was a lot of things.

278
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:42.850
They was pulling out what period we're doing,

279
00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:43.870
but a lot,

280
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.160
a lot of things what I was doing,

281
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.383
it just,

282
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.580
even when I knocked down in the knife round,

283
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:49.840
they had all this to say,

284
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.061
but when I'm not done,

285
00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:51.621
the knife went on.

286
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:54.820
It was so quiet and it wasn't even a devastating knockout.

287
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.340
I was getting hit behind the head,

288
00:06:57.341 --> 00:07:00.550
but they want to call out me hitting him behind the ear.

289
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.390
But how many times I got hit behind the head never was revealed.

290
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.190
It was like even just this,

291
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.053
just the whole,

292
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.050
you know,

293
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.883
bill up to it,

294
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.161
you know,

295
00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:10.090
he sold his story,

296
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.790
he sold his go over to America and you know,

297
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.170
any combat sport it did with emotional emotions,

298
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.010
you know,

299
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.900
people got emotionally tied to it.

300
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:20.410
People,

301
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.300
a lot of people could relate to his story,

302
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:22.631
you know,

303
00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:23.231
certain things.

304
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:24.070
I could relate to it.

305
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:24.550
And then,

306
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.851
you know,

307
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:25.101
when,

308
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:25.790
when you,

309
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.050
you,

310
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.950
when you capture,

311
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.271
you know,

312
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:29.710
the world and you capture people that,

313
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.551
that,

314
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:31.180
um,

315
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.500
they get emotional involved,

316
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.520
they want you to win.

317
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.670
Right.

318
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.120
You know,

319
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.000
just because of the stuff I've worn them and when and stuff like that.

320
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:37.181
And,

321
00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:38.014
um,

322
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.070
um,

323
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.910
the commentators,

324
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.570
you know,

325
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.100
especially Paul especially,

326
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.383
uh,

327
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.263
uh,

328
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.910
got very emotional with it.

329
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.130
A lot of the other cats as well too,

330
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.911
just going back,

331
00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:49.900
listening to them,

332
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.580
I didn't saw the fight six times,

333
00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:52.414
you know?

334
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.290
Um,

335
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.190
I definitely had it.

336
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.050
You can see a very,

337
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.490
a better look on the fight,

338
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.600
muting the TV,

339
00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.200
you know,

340
00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.820
well,

341
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.030
listen

342
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.781
<v 2>to the commentary,</v>

343
00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:01.051
but,

344
00:08:01.051 --> 00:08:01.291
you know,

345
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:04.200
I do commentary myself or UFC.

346
00:08:04.201 --> 00:08:05.100
So a lot of times,

347
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:07.410
even if I'm listening and I'm not really listen that much,

348
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.380
I'm just watching you watching what's happening.

349
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.640
It's like I'm having a conversation in a room with a bunch of people,

350
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.000
right?

351
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.630
I was watching what was happening but it was interesting to me was a you made

352
00:08:15.631 --> 00:08:16.464
adjustments,

353
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.040
you know and one thing that you made it big adjustment is um,

354
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.960
when you landed in the 12th round,

355
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.430
you shorten everything up.

356
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.050
You shorten that right hand up.

357
00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:26.370
It wasn't a winging punch at all.

358
00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:29.460
It came straight down the pipe and then that left hand behind him in the fucking

359
00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:31.650
timing cause he was already going down.

360
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.581
You already hit,

361
00:08:32.581 --> 00:08:33.151
I'm clean.

362
00:08:33.151 --> 00:08:33.841
He's going down.

363
00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:36.570
Then that fucking left hook man.

364
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.793
Whew.

365
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.260
That was what was really crazy that he got up from,

366
00:08:40.261 --> 00:08:42.510
cause we'll snapped him around like the extra cyst.

367
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.440
It was when he went flying and then flat line and laid back.

368
00:08:46.441 --> 00:08:47.191
I was like it's over.

369
00:08:47.191 --> 00:08:50.580
I can't believe he knocked him out in the 12 fucking round cause all fight.

370
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.530
I was saying all this guy needs is one punch.

371
00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:55.980
Like you got that scary creepy power and boom,

372
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.810
what you could say that all day long.

373
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.450
But if it never lands it doesn't mean anything.

374
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.060
Right.

375
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.450
And it landed and the way it lands,

376
00:09:02.451 --> 00:09:04.170
it was like Holy Shit.

377
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.041
I told her,

378
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.341
I said,

379
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:07.470
you're going to have to be perfect for 12 wells.

380
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.840
I only have to be perfect for a couple of seconds.

381
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.720
That's one thing that I did hear the commentators say.

382
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.480
They said that he's proven that he doesn't have to be perfect cause he got hit,

383
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.853
but it was like he,

384
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.720
but he didn't get hit clean.

385
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.130
He got hit one time,

386
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.020
like pretty solid behind the year,

387
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.090
but the big one was in the 12th.

388
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.670
I'm so impressed with both things.

389
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:28.320
With you being able to land like that with him,

390
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:29.154
been able to get up.

391
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.150
That was probably one of the best heavyweight fights by fucking ever seen

392
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.750
<v 1>crush on me that night.</v>

393
00:09:34.751 --> 00:09:34.990
You don't?

394
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.300
Sure.

395
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.133
I'm,

396
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.520
the heavyweight division has,

397
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.880
has been dead for,

398
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:40.780
for long time.

399
00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:44.380
And then we started with last year or something to just started religious

400
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.020
progressing and people started talking about it.

401
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.583
Um,

402
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.470
especially been dead in America.

403
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.120
I remember a time when no one knew who was,

404
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.250
who was the heavyweight champion of the World War,

405
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:54.611
you know,

406
00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:56.590
it was a European guys and stuff like that.

407
00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:58.930
So I always made it my business,

408
00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.190
like I want to bring it back,

409
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.600
I want to do it like I lead it and a lot of the other former champions did it

410
00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:08.980
where people knew where understand the sport of boxing then who was the champion

411
00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:09.740
and stuff like that.

412
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.930
I always felt I had that,

413
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.310
that duty to fulfill even when I was in the Olympics because a lot of people

414
00:10:15.311 --> 00:10:16.750
don't even know I was in the Olympics,

415
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:17.741
you know?

416
00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:18.370
Um,

417
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.840
I was the only American tomato because in 2008 Olympics as well.

418
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.490
And just from that point it has felt like I had to be the one to bring it back

419
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.800
and to come to la.

420
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.100
They bring all the stars and like I got everyone here.

421
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.630
<v 2>And you met with the Olympics,</v>

422
00:10:34.631 --> 00:10:35.980
quit pretty soon.

423
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.980
Pretty young in your boxing career from the time you started training?

424
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.630
Correct.

425
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:39.921
Like what,

426
00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:42.370
how long was it in until you were fighting the Olympics?

427
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.110
I made the Olympic team in a year and a half.

428
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.040
I started boxing.

429
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.610
I started boxing at 21 you know how fucking crazy that is.

430
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.830
So a year and a half a boxing,

431
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.990
he make the Olympic team and you won a bronze medal.

432
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.893
<v 1>That's,</v>

433
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.973
that's insane.

434
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.551
You know,

435
00:10:56.551 --> 00:11:00.090
they didn't even have my name written on the list of the one that's going to be

436
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:00.780
on the team.

437
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.530
You know,

438
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.131
they always say,

439
00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:02.491
I was,

440
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:03.000
uh,

441
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.050
I just came out of nowhere.

442
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.310
Wouter came out of nowhere,

443
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:06.240
you know,

444
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.500
I remember being in the,

445
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:11.610
I'm in a tournament and he had this elder man,

446
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:11.881
you know,

447
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:15.660
he's seen these kids like year after year after year.

448
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.471
And um,

449
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:17.040
he,

450
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.120
I remember him saying,

451
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.130
I said,

452
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:20.963
who are you?

453
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:21.871
I said,

454
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:22.950
I'm Deontay wilder.

455
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.530
And he looked at as the guy next to him,

456
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:28.370
you know,

457
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.203
where are you from?

458
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:29.821
I said,

459
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:30.840
I'm from Alabama,

460
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:31.951
Alabama.

461
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:32.830
He laughed at me

462
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.960
because they never seen or from Alabama,

463
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.831
you know,

464
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:38.131
you know,

465
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:41.250
we was based off with football and basketball and stuff like that.

466
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:41.790
I didn't even,

467
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.640
I was surprised it was a gym in Alabama when I did start,

468
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:44.911
you know,

469
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:45.421
I was like,

470
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:46.020
wow.

471
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.070
Like I can't believe,

472
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:48.270
like I'm in a boxing gym.

473
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:49.590
I never thought one would be here.

474
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:50.850
We didn't do that,

475
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.330
you know,

476
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.163
just Steve about it.

477
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.840
But I started because of my daughter that was born with spinal Bifida.

478
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.350
So you know,

479
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.160
I couldn't play football and basketball a little more because you had to go to

480
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:01.030
school for that.

481
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.400
I needed money right now,

482
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.731
you know,

483
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:04.980
so I was looking at a,

484
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.990
a way of making money like right now and you know,

485
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.380
I had a friend in college,

486
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:14.010
we was always talking about what we want to try to do and what are the things we

487
00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:16.030
were trying to do to get to that point because you know,

488
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:16.730
talk is cheap.

489
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.441
We can always say,

490
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:18.274
well we want,

491
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.570
but if you're not applying any type of action towards what you w with your

492
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:23.050
words,

493
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:23.530
you just,

494
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.100
it just,

495
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.690
it's just talk,

496
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:26.643
you know,

497
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.010
he said he thought I said [inaudible] he thought I should start boxing.

498
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.063
Um,

499
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.010
I thought it was a great idea as well too.

500
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:34.630
He thought he thought I should start,

501
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:38.590
but only for the simple fact that I handled myself well streetwise.

502
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.190
You know,

503
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.710
nobody ever seen me just lose or get beat up streetwise.

504
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.900
I was this quiet guy.

505
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:45.430
I tell people I never look for trouble,

506
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.380
but trouble always found me for some reason.

507
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:48.221
And,

508
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:48.820
um,

509
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.920
and when I did release the anger,

510
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.813
when I release,

511
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.810
like it was,

512
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.970
it was even back then was dramatic,

513
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.133
you know what I'm saying?

514
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.651
And I'm a kid.

515
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.800
You not even back then I believe in,

516
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:59.683
you know,

517
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.011
and,

518
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:00.550
um,

519
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.770
I could never come down though at that point.

520
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:03.850
I was like the hulk,

521
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.320
I couldn't come down.

522
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:06.460
It took me a lot to come down.

523
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.660
Even if I will see blood,

524
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:08.980
I still wouldn't calm down.

525
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.280
And he used to be scary for me because I,

526
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:12.880
you know,

527
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.350
even back then I had power,

528
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.460
but I was just,

529
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.780
I had a lot of aggression.

530
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.030
I had a lot of anger for some reason.

531
00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:19.900
I never know why,

532
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:20.951
you know,

533
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:21.161
and,

534
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:21.820
um,

535
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.990
and we thought it was a great idea.

536
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:23.170
Like,

537
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:23.561
you know what?

538
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:24.070
I'm gonna do it,

539
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:24.341
you know,

540
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:25.091
I can't lose,

541
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:25.871
what can I lose,

542
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:26.704
you know?

543
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.101
And,

544
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:27.430
um,

545
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.880
just went to the [inaudible] with the guy,

546
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.830
went to the gym.

547
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.580
You know,

548
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.391
I've been in Tuscaloosa,

549
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:32.450
Alabama and I walked in there.

550
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.191
I kid you not,

551
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:35.190
I felt like I heard the bells.

552
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:35.741
I mean,

553
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:36.041
the heart,

554
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:37.150
the sounds to heavily said,

555
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.273
Ooh,

556
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.061
I swear I kicked,

557
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:41.140
when I walked up in there,

558
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.700
it was just to the speed bag and the heavy band being hitting the conversations

559
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:49.560
and then the guys sparring and my eyes everywhere like this.

560
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.620
I never been in some,

561
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.200
a place like this before ever.

562
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.061
You know what?

563
00:13:54.061 --> 00:13:54.360
I'm just,

564
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.193
it's just,

565
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.650
it's like new to me and how like I felt like this was it.

566
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.640
This is my last opportunity to be someone,

567
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:01.340
uh,

568
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:01.730
to be a,

569
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.290
a professional athlete and be able to make money for my daughter.

570
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.240
I didn't know I came in as a journey.

571
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.190
Me Julius man,

572
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.420
that's what I wanted to be.

573
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:10.991
I didn't want to,

574
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:11.351
you know,

575
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.970
I didn't know nothing about amateur.

576
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.870
And I knew about Ali and the Wa,

577
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:15.521
you know what?

578
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:16.510
He did his journey,

579
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:17.081
his amateur.

580
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:20.200
But I knew that I didn't even knew the term or of an amateur.

581
00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:20.641
Like what,

582
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:21.160
what is it?

583
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:21.993
You know what I'm saying?

584
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.290
So walking into the gym,

585
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.170
my whole mentality was to make money from my daughter.

586
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:26.711
I didn't like,

587
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:26.891
Yo,

588
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:29.410
let me learn just the fundamentals.

589
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.150
It's just stick me out of there.

590
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.380
But then we also,

591
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:37.180
we had this conversation in the gym about the Olympic trials and the Olympics.

592
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.890
So I remember it briefly,

593
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:43.060
like we started talking about me and my trainer now.

594
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.660
We started talking about it and then it just became a whole big Jim discussion.

595
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:50.380
Everybody stopped doing what they was doing just to get in on this conversation.

596
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.070
We didn't know how to get there.

597
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.660
Well we knew that if we kept winning that we or will we eventually get to that

598
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:57.020
point.

599
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.910
So I just kept knocking guys out.

600
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:00.200
It's just kept winning and kept winning.

601
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.450
And then that's how I got on the Olympics team.

602
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.740
And then I told my daughter when w you know,

603
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:06.130
I met,

604
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.130
made the Olympic team,

605
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:08.540
I metal and did all that.

606
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.320
And then I turned pro shortly after and I don't remember telling my daughter

607
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:13.220
when she was one years old,

608
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:13.461
I said,

609
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:16.550
daddy going to be a world champion and he's going to be able to support you

610
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:17.540
beyond your belief.

611
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.530
You know,

612
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.360
for me it meant a lot for me to say that to her because I come from a playful

613
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.720
offer for your purposes.

614
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.321
You know,

615
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:27.800
you ever had someone promised you something and you wait for years and gears,

616
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:28.634
it don't happen.

617
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.241
You know,

618
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:31.700
you still holding on to that promise that they told you,

619
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:32.990
especially being a child,

620
00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:33.680
you know,

621
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.660
you still are like are,

622
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.210
you know,

623
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.010
until it just don't happen no more.

624
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:41.020
Or you see that certain thing that was positive being given is no more there is

625
00:15:41.021 --> 00:15:41.280
it,

626
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.380
it's gone,

627
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.483
you know,

628
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.150
and um,

629
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.020
that really hurting me,

630
00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:45.261
you know,

631
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:46.460
at times just coming up.

632
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.280
That's why I'm a man of my word now,

633
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.641
you know,

634
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:50.840
if I sell someone something,

635
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.460
you can take it to the bank,

636
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.340
you know,

637
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:53.990
Eh,

638
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.823
it's going to happen.

639
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:55.551
You know,

640
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:56.384
it's just,

641
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:56.691
you know,

642
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:57.880
God is on time guys,

643
00:15:57.881 --> 00:15:58.720
so they don't come.

644
00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.271
We want it,

645
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:01.340
but it's always on time when he's involved.

646
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.630
And when I'm involved,

647
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:03.351
when I say something,

648
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:04.250
I try to make it,

649
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.440
it's gone.

650
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.160
You know,

651
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.210
I'm a man of my word.

652
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:09.110
No matter what I say.

653
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.130
See Walking the gym,

654
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:11.090
you have this feeling,

655
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.360
you,

656
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:11.591
you,

657
00:16:11.591 --> 00:16:13.130
you know that this is where you're meant to be.

658
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.590
And do you just how far ways it's Jen from your house

659
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:17.991
at that time?

660
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:18.860
This gym,

661
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.400
I'm still in touch with the more important,

662
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:23.234
that's about 30,

663
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.810
probably about 45 minutes from where I live too far.

664
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.270
You can go,

665
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.103
you can get there.

666
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.110
How often are you going there?

667
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:29.960
Every day.

668
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.360
Every day.

669
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.140
Every day.

670
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.080
Change Life.

671
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.331
Yeah.

672
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:32.721
You know what?

673
00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:34.520
I was still working for Budweiser.

674
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.200
I was driving the truck for Budweiser.

675
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:36.740
So,

676
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.250
um,

677
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.083
at times,

678
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.021
you know,

679
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:40.840
anybody work at Budweiser know that you,

680
00:16:40.841 --> 00:16:43.010
you got a specific time to come in,

681
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.870
but you don't have a time where you get off.

682
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.651
You know,

683
00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:50.210
sometimes you can work from five hours depending on if you have a bar,

684
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.303
Baruch,

685
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.670
which is the easiest.

686
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.691
And then,

687
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:54.470
um,

688
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.120
you can have a 17 hour day,

689
00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.260
which I didn't have before where you had to go to way deep in the south,

690
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:02.450
way deep in other cities or whatever.

691
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.440
I used to have a stop that took me two hours to get that before I even,

692
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.633
you know,

693
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.580
two hours to get there before I even can work my first stop.

694
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.510
And you're talking about having 17 stops on your,

695
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.970
on your,

696
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.970
on your list to do you want me on your to do list and your first stop is two

697
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:20.084
hours,

698
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.050
you know what I mean?

699
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.440
That's,

700
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.480
that was a hell of a ride just to be able to,

701
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.630
it's depressed.

702
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.370
It makes you depressed just because you got to wait two hours just to get

703
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:28.641
started.

704
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:28.970
You Ready?

705
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.770
You want to go home as soon as possible.

706
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.400
I remember times where I used to drive the big truck to the,

707
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.180
to the,

708
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:35.870
to the gym.

709
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.980
So you would have a big Budweiser truck advertising but like outside of the

710
00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:43.070
cheer and you'll see me out there.

711
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:46.220
It used to be times where I used to sleep in my car right there at the gym.

712
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.270
You know,

713
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.380
I really wanted to get it.

714
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.950
I told my that will be a world champion and I was devoted to the sport,

715
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:55.410
which I still am still there to this day.

716
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:56.490
Uh,

717
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.960
but it was a lot of sacrifices.

718
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:59.780
I had to sacrifice for my daughter to,

719
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.440
to religious be here,

720
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.610
to be able to support her with spinal Bifida because I knew I knew nothing about

721
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:06.181
the disorder.

722
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:07.320
I'm 19 years old,

723
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.183
you know,

724
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.470
I'm just trying to a father,

725
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.341
a loving father,

726
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.660
just trying to support his daughter.

727
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:13.830
That's amazing.

728
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.663
Yeah.

729
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.360
That's a different kind of motivation,

730
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:18.930
man.

731
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.160
Then being in Alabama,

732
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.060
we had to scrape up money to go to other states because we didn't really have

733
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.200
too many heavy weights here,

734
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:25.740
you know,

735
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.870
so we had to go find sparring elsewhere.

736
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.910
My trainer tells the story to this day,

737
00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:33.300
you know how we had to scrape up because you get a lot of people want to come

738
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:34.440
apart and be a part now,

739
00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:34.771
whatever.

740
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:35.430
He always said,

741
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.551
why?

742
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:35.851
What's your,

743
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:36.390
how?

744
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.580
What?

745
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.130
We were scraping up to change and,

746
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.241
and you know,

747
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:39.541
we,

748
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:39.781
we,

749
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:40.141
you know,

750
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:42.760
we had to scrape up money for gas and something to eat and stuff,

751
00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.680
which is all true,

752
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.543
you know,

753
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:45.840
all had to scrape it up.

754
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.770
Did anybody ever teach you to punch before you started boxing?

755
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.830
Did you ever have an uncle that helped pads for you or anything?

756
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.660
Nah,

757
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.460
now we're not nothing and I didn't know nothing about boxing.

758
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:56.920
Right.

759
00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.151
You,

760
00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:58.830
you definitely knew how to punch people.

761
00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.341
Of course.

762
00:18:59.341 --> 00:18:59.911
For sure.

763
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:00.301
For sure.

764
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:01.100
For sure.

765
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.910
Did you learn just from watching TV?

766
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:03.540
Like you know,

767
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.070
just like street wise,

768
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.933
you know what I mean?

769
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.511
I mean,

770
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:07.410
the best thing,

771
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.880
the best thing in life is,

772
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:09.181
is,

773
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:09.530
is,

774
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.880
is experience it for yourself.

775
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.980
Life teaches you everything.

776
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.431
You know,

777
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:16.260
sometimes you can get knowledge from books,

778
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.510
but it's nothing like real life,

779
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.710
real reality.

780
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.560
So you went the same trainers that you were when you first started.

781
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:22.980
I,

782
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.813
one of the few,

783
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.500
you still with the same one.

784
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.910
That's amazing too.

785
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.480
Yeah.

786
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.590
So how long did it take before it started feeling right to you in terms of like

787
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:34.380
throwing combinations and move in and it took awhile.

788
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.640
It took awhile because I had to,

789
00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.560
I had to wait in the Olympics,

790
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:38.810
I had to play catch up.

791
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.440
I'm always,

792
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.760
I always was playing catch up because these guys,

793
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.870
they'd been bikes and ever since they was young little boys and stuff.

794
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.703
And you know,

795
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.980
that's how I learned a really about boxing and,

796
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.500
and how it would take your life away from you.

797
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:52.891
You know,

798
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:53.724
I'm looking at,

799
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.710
I'm looking at these young guys,

800
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.270
they coming up and several of them,

801
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.190
several of them cannot go to school because I boxing,

802
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:02.820
you know,

803
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.700
some of them that they were telling me how they've missed birthdays,

804
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.530
they've missed holidays,

805
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.730
they've missed classes from school just to fulfill the dreams,

806
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.270
you know,

807
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.960
it could take,

808
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.730
it'll take everything away from you.

809
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:17.940
And I've seen some have graduated high school,

810
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:18.721
you know,

811
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:21.870
and that's a great accomplishment when you inbox and to graduate high school,

812
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.530
you know,

813
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.700
because there's so much,

814
00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:27.090
there's so many tournaments in so many different things.

815
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.560
Cause boxing a year round sport,

816
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.131
you know what I mean?

817
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:33.120
So it's so many different things that would go on to these kids.

818
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.481
You know,

819
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:34.530
these guys would try to,

820
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.160
you know,

821
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.380
make this team made that team go to this trip,

822
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:41.280
go over that trip just to get their spirits and I'm listening to them tell they

823
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.200
story and here I am,

824
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.333
you know,

825
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.410
just coming from Tuscaloosa,

826
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:46.861
Alabama,

827
00:20:46.861 --> 00:20:47.681
just picking it up,

828
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:48.520
playing catch up.

829
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:51.430
I'm listening to everyone's story and what a conference,

830
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.400
how they do this and I'm studying the Amo certain things.

831
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:59.050
Like it was amazing to be able to just go to the Olympics and just do what I did

832
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:00.790
a complete with these guys.

833
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.450
I was the least least experienced guy in the whole tournament.

834
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.770
Of course the Olympics

835
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.300
<v 2>snobby a year and a half.</v>

836
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:09.490
And you probably the least experienced guy to ever medal ever.

837
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.090
Yeah,

838
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.550
probably so else even come close to that.

839
00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:15.820
I bet if you went over the Olympic records of guys who have boxed and metaled,

840
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.870
I bet you're number one with a bullet prior to so close,

841
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.820
<v 1>a year and a half in.</v>

842
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:22.640
It was.

843
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.260
It was.

844
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.090
It was amazing spiritual just to beat her,

845
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:25.924
you know what I mean?

846
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.400
If it wasn't for boxing,

847
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.130
I probably would have never been able to,

848
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.540
to travel outside the country.

849
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:32.590
You know,

850
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.423
boxing,

851
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.810
show me everything.

852
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.880
You know

853
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.140
<v 2>what's amazing is one of the things that you'd said that the heavyweight</v>

854
00:21:39.141 --> 00:21:39.471
division,

855
00:21:39.471 --> 00:21:40.970
which has always been the glamor division,

856
00:21:40.971 --> 00:21:41.151
right?

857
00:21:41.151 --> 00:21:43.670
When Tyson was the champ and Holyfield was a champ and all these different

858
00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.980
fighters to the Holyfield Riddick Bowe era.

859
00:21:45.981 --> 00:21:47.630
I mean these were gigantic fights.

860
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.400
Everybody in the world was watching.

861
00:21:49.401 --> 00:21:50.270
It was a big deal,

862
00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.830
but then when Klitschko one,

863
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.400
I remember I was on a plane with a buddy of mine is a comedian and I said,

864
00:21:55.401 --> 00:21:56.110
you know who that is?

865
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.481
And he goes,

866
00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:56.661
no,

867
00:21:56.661 --> 00:21:56.901
I go,

868
00:21:56.901 --> 00:21:58.070
that's the heavyweight champion of the world.

869
00:21:58.071 --> 00:21:58.251
He goes,

870
00:21:58.251 --> 00:21:59.084
get the fuck out of here.

871
00:21:59.300 --> 00:21:59.511
He said,

872
00:21:59.511 --> 00:21:59.601
well,

873
00:21:59.601 --> 00:21:59.841
he goes,

874
00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:00.471
it's a white guy.

875
00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:00.681
I go,

876
00:22:00.681 --> 00:22:01.514
isn't that crazy

877
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.030
like Russia?

878
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.670
And nobody knows who it is because it was a weird thing.

879
00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:09.830
It's like everybody been that Tommy Morrison days,

880
00:22:09.831 --> 00:22:10.310
people,

881
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.840
there's always the great white hope to,

882
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.820
it's always wanted a white guy to be the heavyweight champion.

883
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.653
Cherry Kone,

884
00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.213
Larry Holmes,

885
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.130
Larry Holmes beat the fuck out of Jericho.

886
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.491
And then her,

887
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:19.790
I was in high school when that happened.

888
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.280
Everybody was hoping that a white guy was going to win.

889
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.810
And then when a white guy,

890
00:22:23.811 --> 00:22:24.740
finally one,

891
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.320
nobody gave a shit cause he was kind of,

892
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.880
he's got very effective style,

893
00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:29.301
but it's,

894
00:22:29.301 --> 00:22:29.541
you know,

895
00:22:29.541 --> 00:22:30.920
it's not the most fan friendly.

896
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.270
He wouldn't jab and grab,

897
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.780
you know,

898
00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.590
grab ahold une,

899
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.960
he could knock you out if he hits you clean.

900
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:37.400
And he knocked a lot of guys out and he was a big fucking guy.

901
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:37.650
Right.

902
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:38.481
And no one cared.

903
00:22:38.481 --> 00:22:39.200
It was weird.

904
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.100
It was weird because he was a guy living in Germany and he,

905
00:22:43.101 --> 00:22:43.340
you know,

906
00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.480
it's huge in Germany and speaking Russian and English and everything else.

907
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:47.900
And he's a really smart guy.

908
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.303
Nobody cared.

909
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:49.910
It was weird.

910
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:50.810
It was fucking weird.

911
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.861
I know.

912
00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:54.050
I remember because boxing was still huge.

913
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.140
People were still paying attention to Floyd Mayweather and Canelo Alvarez.

914
00:22:57.141 --> 00:22:58.150
And Manny Pacquiao meters,

915
00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.780
all the lighter weight classes,

916
00:22:59.781 --> 00:23:00.890
they're still getting all this love.

917
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.320
Bernard Hopkins people were watching all these fights.

918
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.480
Nobody gave a shit about the heavyweight division.

919
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.770
It was strange.

920
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.020
<v 1>They said,</v>

921
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.620
you know,

922
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.060
once you all have an elite America heavyweight,

923
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.640
you know it dies down on it.

924
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.800
They said what goes to heavyweight division?

925
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.130
So does boxing and it's kind of true in some sense,

926
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.993
but,

927
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.680
but if it,

928
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.970
if it didn't happen that way,

929
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:23.800
it was the heavyweight division died down.

930
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:28.801
A lot of these guys that got a lot of one wouldn't have gotten no shine halfway

931
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:29.020
through.

932
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.200
It would've been within the old forest probably.

933
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.780
<v 2>Sure.</v>

934
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.080
Well maybe it would've just made the whole sport bigger because you know,

935
00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:36.461
this,

936
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:36.820
this,

937
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.180
this,

938
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.590
this is a good time now for boxing,

939
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:44.620
there's a lot of really high level champions is a fun time to be a boxing fan to

940
00:23:44.721 --> 00:23:45.440
watch.

941
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.510
But to look at your record like when you went,

942
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.480
went into the wilder fight or what you see is me wanting to,

943
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.800
the Tyson fury fight.

944
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.110
You wouldn't even 39 and [inaudible] 39 and

945
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.000
40 now with 39 knockouts.

946
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.480
That's a movie record like you put,

947
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.530
that's like a guy fighting someone in creed,

948
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.041
right?

949
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:04.731
If you looked at that,

950
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:05.600
that's what it would be like.

951
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.760
What is 40 like this is the guy you're fighting.

952
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.620
He's 40 no 39 knockouts.

953
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.513
What?

954
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.690
Like that would be a movie scene.

955
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:15.080
Like you would be a bad guy in a movie just designed to fuck people up.

956
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.300
But the fact that no one,

957
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.170
you know was was looking at this as this is a,

958
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:23.750
this was a gigantic cultural moment.

959
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.930
This wasn't just a big heavyweight fight between two the tallest guys and odd,

960
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.040
big tall but move good.

961
00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:31.320
Both.

962
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.540
You guys move real good.

963
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.180
Me and Tyson for two for six foot,

964
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:35.601
what is he?

965
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:40.601
Nine six nine two 56 and he's bobbing and moving a lot and he's got that weird

966
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:42.580
Herky jerky style.

967
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.790
He's a trip man.

968
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.700
It's very unusual to have the two of you guys together.

969
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:47.620
To me,

970
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.453
in my eyes,

971
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.100
this was like a reemergence of the heavyweight division in pop culture.

972
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.310
It's like everybody was finally paying attention to the heavyweight division in

973
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:55.711
boxing.

974
00:24:55.711 --> 00:24:57.440
Like finally this was it.

975
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.951
And I was like,

976
00:24:57.951 --> 00:24:58.150
dude,

977
00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.270
this is a big fight.

978
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:00.470
This isn't just a big fight.

979
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.050
But June two guys who are undefeated,

980
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.460
who are at the top of their game,

981
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:04.851
who will,

982
00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:05.151
you know,

983
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:06.770
Tyson didn't lose his title.

984
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.610
He had it.

985
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:08.001
And you know,

986
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:08.990
they took it away from him,

987
00:25:08.991 --> 00:25:10.130
but he was still undefeated.

988
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.680
So that was a giant cultural moment.

989
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.980
And when the fight went down and turned out to be one of the best heavyweight

990
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:17.120
title fights ever,

991
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.410
I mean fuck

992
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.820
<v 1>is amazing.</v>

993
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.530
Even just to listen to you,

994
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.311
you know,

995
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:23.390
describing and stuff.

996
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:24.470
I still feel those,

997
00:25:24.471 --> 00:25:24.861
those,

998
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:25.694
the assignment,

999
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.563
I'm sure.

1000
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.730
Why?

1001
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.910
Like it was amazing.

1002
00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:29.744
It was amazing.

1003
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.060
You know,

1004
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.900
I'm just ready for the rematch and like if people was incited it and enjoy it,

1005
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.450
doubt,

1006
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:38.870
just imagine the rematch.

1007
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.620
You know,

1008
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.850
this is going to be amazing.

1009
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:41.960
It's going to be incredible.

1010
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.270
And it puts Anthony Joshua and a terrible situation,

1011
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.830
but he looks off,

1012
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:46.521
are they big?

1013
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:47.810
And now he looks terrible.

1014
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.910
He's going to fight some other guy.

1015
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.650
No one gives a fuck.

1016
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.170
And it's like your titles,

1017
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.170
whatever title you got,

1018
00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:55.750
their bullshit mean anything.

1019
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.721
Everybody knows.

1020
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:58.130
This is where the real title is.

1021
00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.420
I mean this is just a,

1022
00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:00.530
it's a wrap now.

1023
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.120
Yes,

1024
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.340
it's,

1025
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:01.500
they,

1026
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.670
they definitely begging now he's trying to reach out.

1027
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:09.671
All of a sudden now his management has been trying to reach out to minds as

1028
00:26:09.861 --> 00:26:10.580
well,

1029
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.200
you know?

1030
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:11.930
Um,

1031
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.340
but he could have had this opportunity.

1032
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:14.400
He had me near opportunity.

1033
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.920
He could've fall Louise or teas.

1034
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.380
Yeah.

1035
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.630
We could've followed me.

1036
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.970
He had a chance to fall in fury as well,

1037
00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:21.900
like clean and safe over on that side of it,

1038
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:23.510
playing it safe.

1039
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.450
But no,

1040
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.670
but you know,

1041
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:27.410
people want to know who's the best now.

1042
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.400
You know what I'm saying?

1043
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.010
Especially after seeing the theory,

1044
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.320
this theory fight,

1045
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.211
you know,

1046
00:26:32.211 --> 00:26:34.200
people want to see what was the best and,

1047
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.050
and I'm trying to,

1048
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.550
I've been trying to show people,

1049
00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:37.911
you know,

1050
00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:38.421
who's the best,

1051
00:26:38.421 --> 00:26:39.380
I always say all the best.

1052
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:41.570
I'm going to forever say I'm the best until I get to feed it,

1053
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.561
you know?

1054
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:42.810
And,

1055
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:43.500
um,

1056
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.690
right now I'm in a candidate for,

1057
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.350
you know,

1058
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.000
fight of the year and also,

1059
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:48.540
you know,

1060
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.120
um,

1061
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:49.600
fight,

1062
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:49.951
uh,

1063
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:50.784
um,

1064
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.500
fights are the years I didn't have the cane,

1065
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.570
I came back with Louisa,

1066
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.180
a tease that was an epic one and then it came back with theory,

1067
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.150
another app we fight and then we're going to hit the two again.

1068
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.450
<v 2>That's the thing about you that makes it interesting is that you're not just a</v>

1069
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:04.710
guy who knocks guys out,

1070
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:06.180
but you're a guy who can take it.

1071
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:06.700
You're not,

1072
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.060
you can take it and you're a guy who figures out a way to win.

1073
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.550
Cause there's a lot of guys that when it's going bad,

1074
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.440
they don't come back going good.

1075
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:14.310
They went forever.

1076
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.360
But when it's going bad,

1077
00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:16.560
it's hard for them to come back.

1078
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:21.210
But you figure your way through bad situations and you make adjustments

1079
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.641
<v 1>even,</v>

1080
00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:23.860
even when something is going wrong with my body.

1081
00:27:23.861 --> 00:27:27.250
Like I had seven operations on my arm,

1082
00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:28.031
you know,

1083
00:27:28.031 --> 00:27:31.070
it'd been the meditations like surgery breaking,

1084
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:31.341
you know,

1085
00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:33.680
just breaking my arm turned my boss up,

1086
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.170
um,

1087
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.120
break breaking my hand.

1088
00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:37.840
You know,

1089
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.710
many times in my,

1090
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.151
in my fights,

1091
00:27:40.151 --> 00:27:42.310
I broken my hands is still fought,

1092
00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:42.701
you know,

1093
00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:43.461
tore my boss.

1094
00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.040
He'll come in with third degree burns,

1095
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.731
you know,

1096
00:27:45.731 --> 00:27:46.481
all that stuff.

1097
00:27:46.481 --> 00:27:47.150
Like I'm a,

1098
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.460
I'm a true warrior,

1099
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:49.443
you know,

1100
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.120
I always think I'm like if I do something,

1101
00:27:52.121 --> 00:27:55.450
like if I break my hand or when I tore my bicep in the rain,

1102
00:27:55.451 --> 00:27:57.630
my whole mentality is train change it to what?

1103
00:27:57.631 --> 00:27:59.020
That motherfucker had a fall off.

1104
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.270
That's why I'm glad I got to keep fighting.

1105
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.531
I got to keep going.

1106
00:28:02.531 --> 00:28:03.364
I'm a warrior,

1107
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:03.881
you know,

1108
00:28:03.881 --> 00:28:08.881
and you can never tell you no because I still throw it with bad intention.

1109
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.521
You know,

1110
00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:10.354
I'm still,

1111
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.140
you know,

1112
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.090
Lennon and hitting it.

1113
00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:12.731
Just like with the,

1114
00:28:12.731 --> 00:28:12.970
uh,

1115
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.080
Chris Areola fight.

1116
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.920
When I broke my hand and took,

1117
00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:16.990
tore my bicep,

1118
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:18.161
my camp,

1119
00:28:18.161 --> 00:28:19.900
my team knew I broke my hand,

1120
00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:20.861
but I didn't mention,

1121
00:28:20.861 --> 00:28:22.300
I told my boss he'll cause I'm like,

1122
00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:22.421
well,

1123
00:28:22.421 --> 00:28:24.910
I tell them I don't want no one to panic.

1124
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:26.140
I'm not worrying about it.

1125
00:28:26.141 --> 00:28:27.070
I'm going to keep throwing it.

1126
00:28:27.071 --> 00:28:27.851
I got to keep me in.

1127
00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:31.630
Chris was so surprised that I did all these things and we're still able to throw

1128
00:28:31.631 --> 00:28:32.230
it.

1129
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.530
It's just a mentality when it comes to comeback,

1130
00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.740
like my mentality,

1131
00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:37.210
just overall,

1132
00:28:37.211 --> 00:28:37.900
it just,

1133
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.140
I feel I'm the best and if you're going to come and beat me,

1134
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.240
you got to come and beat me.

1135
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.980
He's just not going to be easy.

1136
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:46.300
That's why most of the guys,

1137
00:28:46.301 --> 00:28:47.134
when they fight me,

1138
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.960
they bring their a game every last one of them,

1139
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.680
you know,

1140
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.220
because they know it's going to be tough and they also know I have the power to

1141
00:28:54.221 --> 00:28:55.090
get them out of there.

1142
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.163
You know?

1143
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:57.100
And a lot of guys,

1144
00:28:57.101 --> 00:28:57.630
you know,

1145
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.880
th they're afraid of that because I mean over and over again,

1146
00:29:00.881 --> 00:29:01.391
like I said,

1147
00:29:01.391 --> 00:29:04.750
my power last from the first through the 12th round,

1148
00:29:04.751 --> 00:29:08.620
you can never be in like too comfortable with me because of that,

1149
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:09.221
you know?

1150
00:29:09.221 --> 00:29:09.651
And,

1151
00:29:09.651 --> 00:29:10.484
and

1152
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.610
that's big for me to have.

1153
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.473
You know,

1154
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.720
I've always sat back and like saying,

1155
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.091
you know,

1156
00:29:16.091 --> 00:29:17.460
I've said the same question myself.

1157
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:18.360
Like damn well you,

1158
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.760
you got all this power like,

1159
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.340
and you know,

1160
00:29:21.341 --> 00:29:23.110
me being the person with it,

1161
00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.660
I felt many times where I felt dangerous.

1162
00:29:25.661 --> 00:29:26.494
I felt like,

1163
00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:31.720
I felt like at times it can be too much power because I get scared of myself at

1164
00:29:31.721 --> 00:29:36.130
times because I know I've got the potential to potential to hurt someone

1165
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.263
seriously.

1166
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.583
You know,

1167
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.671
just dealing with it.

1168
00:29:39.671 --> 00:29:43.330
Just looking back and seeing some of the guys I've knocked out and seeing the

1169
00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:45.310
reactions and you know,

1170
00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.080
the unbroke guy's arms out and broke the ice.

1171
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:48.933
Soccer's Adam,

1172
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:49.540
you know,

1173
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.830
put them in seizures,

1174
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.023
you know,

1175
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.060
almost killed speaker in New York.

1176
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:55.571
You know,

1177
00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:58.000
he laid there for for a while,

1178
00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:58.271
you know,

1179
00:29:58.271 --> 00:29:59.590
I didn't even see him breathing,

1180
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:00.431
you know,

1181
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:02.560
and so forth for so long.

1182
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.101
You know,

1183
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:03.231
it,

1184
00:30:03.231 --> 00:30:05.800
it's been amazing to have so much power,

1185
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.250
but still trying to understand it as well too,

1186
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.203
you know?

1187
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.710
And that fire with fear I couldn't,

1188
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.010
like,

1189
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:12.940
it was crazy.

1190
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.111
I couldn't,

1191
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:14.680
I couldn't,

1192
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.480
I couldn't stream out right arm off.

1193
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:16.861
They say.

1194
00:30:16.861 --> 00:30:19.280
It felt like something was stopping me from really,

1195
00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.700
really just throwing it straight.

1196
00:30:21.701 --> 00:30:23.860
And to the end for some reason like it was,

1197
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:24.181
it was,

1198
00:30:24.181 --> 00:30:26.530
it was it because you were trying to knock them out.

1199
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:27.700
So I definitely was trying to knock,

1200
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:29.800
I was very anxious of knocking him out,

1201
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.450
but it was something that was holding like I couldn't straighten it out.

1202
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.630
I kept going back to my corner.

1203
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.473
Like why?

1204
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.090
Why you can't throw the right hand is right that this dude would bend down like

1205
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:41.380
right here in slow motion.

1206
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.670
It seemed like to me,

1207
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.250
I've seen this look many times.

1208
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.520
I'm not guys are many a time than spar in their competition.

1209
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.840
That put it right there because you have your,

1210
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.170
you have your,

1211
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.570
your tempo exposed and you know when you get hit in the temple and knocked April

1212
00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.620
or Librium off,

1213
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:56.951
you know,

1214
00:30:56.951 --> 00:30:57.581
you can't get,

1215
00:30:57.581 --> 00:31:02.140
your body's not responding like the mind is and he'll be right there in his,

1216
00:31:02.141 --> 00:31:04.390
like I still over over loop,

1217
00:31:04.391 --> 00:31:06.070
my punches are telegraphing.

1218
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:06.371
I'm like,

1219
00:31:06.371 --> 00:31:08.770
it felt like someone stopping me or something like that.

1220
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:09.341
Like it was crazy.

1221
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:10.090
That's why I said that.

1222
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:10.720
Ooh.

1223
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.553
You know what I mean?

1224
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:12.820
I kid you not,

1225
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.580
I kid you not like some Gypsy man.

1226
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.413
Come on with it.

1227
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:17.730
I don't understand that.

1228
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.760
I understand it now.

1229
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:19.930
You know,

1230
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.190
I understand everything,

1231
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.290
but you to have to give some credit to him and he's,

1232
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.410
he's a phenomenal boxer.

1233
00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.600
His style and his movement.

1234
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.390
I mean,

1235
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:33.640
and to see him pull that off and be that fresh even in the 12th me,

1236
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:36.790
how to have that kind of endurance to get up after you knocked him down.

1237
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:37.871
Yeah.

1238
00:31:37.871 --> 00:31:38.321
You definitely,

1239
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:39.680
I definitely take nothing from him.

1240
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:40.000
He was,

1241
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.480
he was,

1242
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.550
he was a great fighter that night.

1243
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:42.941
You know,

1244
00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:45.880
he definitely brought his best and that's all you can.

1245
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.430
That's all you can bring is your best and put on a performance.

1246
00:31:48.431 --> 00:31:48.821
That's why,

1247
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:49.654
you know,

1248
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.250
when we made this fight happen,

1249
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:53.560
because it didn't take long for us to make this fight him.

1250
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:54.070
He was just,

1251
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.640
we both,

1252
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.070
he reached out to me and said,

1253
00:31:56.071 --> 00:31:56.904
you know,

1254
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:57.520
you know,

1255
00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.730
I feel embarrassed for what,

1256
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.940
what Josh dealing doing to you and then,

1257
00:32:00.941 --> 00:32:01.420
you know,

1258
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.320
and I want to fight it.

1259
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.041
Let's make it happen.

1260
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:04.810
Let's show the world who's the best,

1261
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.070
who's the two best in the,

1262
00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:06.321
in the,

1263
00:32:06.321 --> 00:32:06.611
in the,

1264
00:32:06.611 --> 00:32:07.330
in the business,

1265
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:07.541
like,

1266
00:32:07.541 --> 00:32:07.721
Bro,

1267
00:32:07.721 --> 00:32:08.560
let's make it happen.

1268
00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:08.801
You know,

1269
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:10.630
it was just like that for a conversation.

1270
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:15.430
I like the build up to the fight too because both of you were very confident and

1271
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:16.390
Bolty we're talking,

1272
00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:16.600
you know,

1273
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.670
you're going to beat the other and knock each other out.

1274
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:20.770
But at the end of the fight,

1275
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:21.461
when it was over,

1276
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:22.870
it was nothing but respect.

1277
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.430
It was nothing but respect.

1278
00:32:24.431 --> 00:32:24.851
And in,

1279
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:25.960
in this day and age,

1280
00:32:25.961 --> 00:32:26.321
man,

1281
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:26.860
it's just,

1282
00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.720
there's something nice to see about two dudes who just went to war for 12 rounds

1283
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:33.220
and it turned out to be a draw.

1284
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.720
And even after all of that,

1285
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:35.890
nothing but respect,

1286
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.280
right?

1287
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:36.911
Most definitely.

1288
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:38.080
And that's what it's all about.

1289
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:38.973
You know,

1290
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.170
two guys can be to be at each other and you know,

1291
00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.570
let's say we want to hurt each other even to the point and say,

1292
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:45.500
you want to kill each other.

1293
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.131
You know what I mean?

1294
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:48.260
It's just the buildup is part of the sport,

1295
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.123
you know?

1296
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:50.123
Um,

1297
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.260
it's to,

1298
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.850
it's up to us to be as professional as possible when it comes to that because

1299
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.120
we're not going to really punch is other than the wins.

1300
00:32:59.150 --> 00:32:59.381
What are,

1301
00:32:59.381 --> 00:33:02.180
why would we mess up on Monday when we were trying to support our children,

1302
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.321
you know,

1303
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:04.130
um,

1304
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.390
a lot of things that happened in the,

1305
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:05.751
in the,

1306
00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:08.960
in the press conferences and stuff was because of others.

1307
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.790
Everybody else want to push and shove.

1308
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:12.380
The ones that don't really matter,

1309
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:13.610
they're not going to be in the ring.

1310
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.300
Everybody want to push and shove.

1311
00:33:15.301 --> 00:33:18.410
So it makes it look worse than what it really is.

1312
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:19.820
When you got two guys that really,

1313
00:33:19.821 --> 00:33:21.290
that matters that's getting in the ring,

1314
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:22.124
you know,

1315
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.023
but even,

1316
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:23.690
you know,

1317
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.261
a lot of people like,

1318
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:25.610
oh they smiling at each other,

1319
00:33:25.611 --> 00:33:26.250
they're doing this.

1320
00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.530
Like that don't mean nothing.

1321
00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:31.040
We still got to get in the ring at the end of the day and punch each other in

1322
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:31.874
the face.

1323
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.440
And that's the big thing about it.

1324
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.790
He wanted to put on a great performance and support his family as well as I,

1325
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.540
you know,

1326
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.820
especially cause it's been in my country,

1327
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.160
I felt like I had the world attention.

1328
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.310
Now I've been waiting for this moment for so long.

1329
00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:51.311
It's like I gotta make it gotta make a great stand and you know,

1330
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:52.440
that wouldn't all the um,

1331
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.070
the pressure and,

1332
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.391
and,

1333
00:33:54.391 --> 00:33:55.940
and so anxious.

1334
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.461
I,

1335
00:33:56.461 --> 00:33:57.110
this is,

1336
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:02.110
I was anxious to do something that I already does and that's in fights in

1337
00:34:02.271 --> 00:34:03.230
devastating fashion.

1338
00:34:03.231 --> 00:34:04.280
I didn't have to force that.

1339
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:08.630
And I know that if I force it never happens like I wanted,

1340
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.291
you know what I mean?

1341
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:10.340
But it was just,

1342
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.980
it's just overwhelming to have the world attention,

1343
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:14.263
you know?

1344
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.330
How much would it have visit field then a regular fight.

1345
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.730
It felt just,

1346
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.660
it was amazing.

1347
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.100
It was amazing man.

1348
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.700
I swear it was just to come out there and just,

1349
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.091
you know,

1350
00:34:26.091 --> 00:34:28.340
come out and just feel the energy of the people.

1351
00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:30.920
They were so excited and I was like,

1352
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:34.010
I already knew who all was concerned peoples coming cause we was,

1353
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.850
you know,

1354
00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.410
but it doesn't matter who was there.

1355
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:40.460
It's just the point of just having the center of attention.

1356
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.240
I didn't have to fight against no other sport and then like they,

1357
00:34:43.241 --> 00:34:44.600
cause you know his hard here in America,

1358
00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:46.580
it's hard to make it in the word America.

1359
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.530
Every time I fought I've had to fight against other sports and certain things,

1360
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:52.364
you know?

1361
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.410
And it's always always been difficult.

1362
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.440
Especially every fight I've had to promote it by myself cause these guys are

1363
00:34:59.691 --> 00:35:01.760
scared to talk or then some of them,

1364
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:02.180
you know,

1365
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.013
or teeth,

1366
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.561
you know,

1367
00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:04.700
he spoke Spanish,

1368
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.740
although it was an epic fight.

1369
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:09.770
He spoke Spanish and sometime I had to do something to Spanish TV,

1370
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:10.940
you know,

1371
00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.390
for my,

1372
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.190
because they went through it like it was.

1373
00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:13.910
Yeah.

1374
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.301
You know,

1375
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:15.170
just to get it out,

1376
00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:15.770
you know.

1377
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:16.970
But we're fury.

1378
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.800
I knew I had the right dancing partner.

1379
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:24.190
Well it seems for you that considering how recently you actually started boxing,

1380
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.701
I mean,

1381
00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:26.210
what do you,

1382
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.560
what do you 11 years in now?

1383
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.573
How many of us?

1384
00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.560
That's fucking crazy.

1385
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.630
You just still learning,

1386
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.890
which is insane.

1387
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.043
If you're getting,

1388
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.020
you're getting better.

1389
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.830
I mean as you're the champion,

1390
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.040
you're

1391
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.873
<v 2>getting better.</v>

1392
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.811
That is a,

1393
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:44.510
I mean a guy like Louis Ortiz is an epic dance partner for that cause you're

1394
00:35:44.511 --> 00:35:47.010
dealing with this guy who goes to the cube and amateur program.

1395
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.630
He's a southpaw is a big motherfucker,

1396
00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:50.580
you know,

1397
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.690
good boxer man.

1398
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.260
Real

1399
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.350
<v 1>over 360 some elders or flights,</v>

1400
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.221
you know,

1401
00:35:55.221 --> 00:35:55.790
that's a lie.

1402
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.830
If I had that meant that much experience,

1403
00:35:57.831 --> 00:35:58.490
you know,

1404
00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:02.330
you just never know and he's another one you knocked out late in the fight.

1405
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.020
Yeah,

1406
00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:03.170
yeah,

1407
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:04.003
for sure.

1408
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.020
I think he had the most difficult style.

1409
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.890
Anyone on fault though thus far though?

1410
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:09.200
Just being South Pole,

1411
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:13.580
you don't really get too much training guys with Southport and not too many

1412
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.600
around us heavyweight and,

1413
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:15.931
and,

1414
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:20.150
and he's a very slick and fast counter puncher.

1415
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.290
That's what he waits on.

1416
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:22.520
No,

1417
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.241
with fighting him.

1418
00:36:23.241 --> 00:36:23.841
I really,

1419
00:36:23.841 --> 00:36:24.111
really,

1420
00:36:24.111 --> 00:36:26.540
really had to think about my next move.

1421
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:27.120
We're going there,

1422
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:27.953
what I had to do,

1423
00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.120
you know.

1424
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.953
Um,

1425
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:31.480
so our teeth,

1426
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:34.200
I understand why a lot of these guys don't want to fight or to use.

1427
00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.450
They say he owed,

1428
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.950
but they don't want to get in there.

1429
00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.240
They don't want to go against this old,

1430
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.380
the old man though,

1431
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.040
you know,

1432
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.410
<v 2>he's not tool now he's nine years old,</v>

1433
00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:43.244
but he's not,

1434
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.170
he moved his last fight.

1435
00:36:48.171 --> 00:36:48.560
Man,

1436
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.580
he looked phenomenal.

1437
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.691
You know what I mean?

1438
00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:51.171
He just,

1439
00:36:51.171 --> 00:36:52.130
he moves good.

1440
00:36:52.131 --> 00:36:52.430
He's,

1441
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:56.210
his jab is outstanding and he's so well schooled.

1442
00:36:56.211 --> 00:36:56.541
You know,

1443
00:36:56.541 --> 00:36:58.730
it's like you see the little stutter faint that he does.

1444
00:36:58.731 --> 00:36:59.301
He Pops Out,

1445
00:36:59.301 --> 00:37:02.990
jab on it and he's always reading you looking for your reactions.

1446
00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.940
He's a beast.

1447
00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.020
<v 1>Yes he is.</v>

1448
00:37:05.021 --> 00:37:08.530
And I always give him credit for that until I see someone just come in and

1449
00:37:08.531 --> 00:37:09.364
dominate him.

1450
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.653
We,

1451
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.800
even with me and him,

1452
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:13.390
we had,

1453
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.040
we had,

1454
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:14.800
uh,

1455
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.570
uh,

1456
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.830
a connection between our daughters,

1457
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:18.041
you know,

1458
00:37:18.041 --> 00:37:19.690
cause he's got an year daughter as well.

1459
00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.010
And as well as I,

1460
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.881
that's why I,

1461
00:37:21.881 --> 00:37:24.340
when a lot of stuff started coming out with him,

1462
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:24.851
you know,

1463
00:37:24.851 --> 00:37:27.790
saying that he did drugs and not passing the test,

1464
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:28.750
the um,

1465
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.950
the bottle tests and stuff,

1466
00:37:29.951 --> 00:37:30.784
all that,

1467
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:31.900
I still wanted to fight him.

1468
00:37:31.901 --> 00:37:35.590
I still wanted the blessing with the opportunity because of his daughter cause I

1469
00:37:35.591 --> 00:37:37.150
can relate to him just like,

1470
00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:38.163
just like I say this,

1471
00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:41.180
the store w were fear reselling with the uh,

1472
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:42.460
mental illness and stuff.

1473
00:37:42.461 --> 00:37:44.290
Like how people was emotionally tired.

1474
00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:48.670
Like I got emotionally tied to our teas because he was a father that dealt with

1475
00:37:48.671 --> 00:37:50.920
a child with a disability as well as I,

1476
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.120
so I know how hard it is to take care of children with disabilities.

1477
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.070
And I know it takes a lot of money,

1478
00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:57.641
you know,

1479
00:37:57.641 --> 00:37:59.450
so I'm,

1480
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.820
I'm always for him,

1481
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.420
you know,

1482
00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:01.621
I've,

1483
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:05.200
I've been talking about him every since that time we fought win,

1484
00:38:05.201 --> 00:38:05.891
lose or draw.

1485
00:38:05.891 --> 00:38:09.850
I would've still been talking about him because of the emotional ties that I had

1486
00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:10.121
with them.

1487
00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:11.020
I understand them.

1488
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:12.880
And when you understand the person,

1489
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.260
you root for that person,

1490
00:38:14.261 --> 00:38:15.094
no matter what,

1491
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.080
no matter who's side you're on or whatever,

1492
00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.720
when a person has something,

1493
00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.190
you feel like it's worser than the next person.

1494
00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.420
Or you can relate,

1495
00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.493
you know,

1496
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.011
you,

1497
00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:24.191
you,

1498
00:38:24.191 --> 00:38:25.090
you want them to win.

1499
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:26.380
You know,

1500
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.213
<v 2>it's beautiful man.</v>

1501
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.840
And I think that,

1502
00:38:28.841 --> 00:38:29.674
uh,

1503
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.210
having a guy like Ortiz,

1504
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:31.600
uh,

1505
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:31.871
as,

1506
00:38:31.871 --> 00:38:32.410
uh,

1507
00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:36.610
an opponent that's one of those fights that think for a guy like you who doesn't

1508
00:38:36.611 --> 00:38:38.050
have a lot of amateur experience,

1509
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:38.800
when you,

1510
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.490
when you fight a guy that's that seasoned and you get to see you like what it

1511
00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:43.324
looks like,

1512
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:46.030
you get to see what it looks like when you're in the ring with a guy who's had

1513
00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:46.930
just as he said,

1514
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:49.930
300 plus amateur fights or overall,

1515
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:50.651
that's a,

1516
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:50.921
I mean,

1517
00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:52.570
that's an amazing learning opportunity,

1518
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:53.350
right?

1519
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:53.650
<v 1>Stuff.</v>

1520
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.483
Then most affluent.

1521
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:54.730
Then,

1522
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:55.563
um,

1523
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:55.931
you know,

1524
00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:58.540
I just just had the confident that I was,

1525
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.531
I was the best.

1526
00:38:59.531 --> 00:38:59.890
I was,

1527
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:03.610
no matter what he had always going with that confident though I blocked

1528
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.470
everything that um,

1529
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.260
his accomplishments in that we knew what we was up against,

1530
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.123
you know,

1531
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:09.881
but you know,

1532
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:13.090
they was calling him the bogeyman or the division and at that point of time I

1533
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:15.640
still needed to prove myself because you know,

1534
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:16.750
people still doubting me.

1535
00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.200
They had been down to me from the start of my career.

1536
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:21.761
I was like,

1537
00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:23.050
since nobody don't want to fight them,

1538
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.360
I want to bless them with this opportunity.

1539
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.750
So these next moves that I've made,

1540
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.540
which the Vern to Dan or teeth,

1541
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.960
<v 2>the inferi well there's to Vern highlight knockouts,</v>

1542
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:38.810
one of the most ridiculous all time when you stand there with your hands down,

1543
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.390
step forward and it's like,

1544
00:39:41.391 --> 00:39:42.740
it was a comic book scene.

1545
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:44.390
It's like the way you knocked him out.

1546
00:39:44.391 --> 00:39:46.850
Like I said about like you being a bad guy in a movie.

1547
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.010
It seemed like you were a bad guy in a boxing movie,

1548
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.090
but it didn't make any sense.

1549
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:50.811
You are the guy.

1550
00:39:50.811 --> 00:39:51.620
Like if I was,

1551
00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.000
say if there's someone who was a,

1552
00:39:53.001 --> 00:39:56.750
I was a coach of a good guy and I was sitting ringside and I was watching you do

1553
00:39:56.751 --> 00:39:56.931
that,

1554
00:39:56.931 --> 00:39:57.351
we'd be like,

1555
00:39:57.351 --> 00:39:58.184
Shit.

1556
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.100
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1557
00:39:59.100 --> 00:39:59.610
okay.

1558
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:00.301
I'm going to tell you,

1559
00:40:00.301 --> 00:40:01.134
man,

1560
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.330
when I stood over him like that,

1561
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.680
I was outside of my body.

1562
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:08.400
I could see me and him standing there and like I was a third person.

1563
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.700
I can't explain it,

1564
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.713
you know?

1565
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.550
And then when I started throwing the punches,

1566
00:40:14.551 --> 00:40:17.670
like I went back into my body and start wailing on him or whatever.

1567
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.533
I can't,

1568
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.520
I can't explain that feeling.

1569
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.570
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1570
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.800
There's so many different things.

1571
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.330
That one too,

1572
00:40:25.331 --> 00:40:27.000
because I got shared so much online.

1573
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.590
Yeah.

1574
00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.600
That was the start of it.

1575
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.790
Millions and millions of people saw that online and they're like,

1576
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:33.810
what in the fuck is this guy got in his hand?

1577
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:34.820
And that's when they started.

1578
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.710
Who is this guy?

1579
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.710
We haven't heard about this guy before him.

1580
00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.663
Yeah.

1581
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.530
It's like everybody's waking up to the heavyweight division.

1582
00:40:41.531 --> 00:40:44.290
All of a sudden it was so true and it was the perfect convert.

1583
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:44.621
There it is.

1584
00:40:44.621 --> 00:40:44.691
I,

1585
00:40:44.691 --> 00:40:45.850
that dude play it for the beginning,

1586
00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:46.684
Jamie.

1587
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.273
Here it goes.

1588
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:50.220
Come on.

1589
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:50.500
You know,

1590
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.670
straight boxing skills.

1591
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:51.980
You know,

1592
00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.570
I,

1593
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:53.710
I got boxing skills.

1594
00:40:53.711 --> 00:40:54.011
You know,

1595
00:40:54.011 --> 00:40:54.191
when,

1596
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:55.150
when I first Fordham,

1597
00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:57.130
I showed all that I stayed disciplined.

1598
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.170
I didn't abandon the game plan,

1599
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.401
you know,

1600
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:01.990
and I showed people that I could box.

1601
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:02.591
Yeah.

1602
00:41:02.591 --> 00:41:05.560
And he told that was probably the only time I just really just stay super

1603
00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:06.071
disciplined.

1604
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:06.730
Not despite,

1605
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.950
but the first one and this one right here.

1606
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:10.660
I went outside of my body right here.

1607
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:11.130
I was standing,

1608
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.070
then I came back.

1609
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.391
I kid you not,

1610
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:16.060
I don't know what the hell was going on with me.

1611
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.980
That was ridiculous.

1612
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.540
It was ridiculous.

1613
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:20.440
No,

1614
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.273
he did.

1615
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:21.641
Yeah,

1616
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:22.300
he was,

1617
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.170
he was quite upset.

1618
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.280
That's the strangest little concoction he's got on dreadlocks there.

1619
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:27.203
Yeah,

1620
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.210
look like tape.

1621
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:28.601
Yeah,

1622
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:30.070
that seems like that would get in the way,

1623
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.953
but keep it up.

1624
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.100
You know the Haitians believe in that too.

1625
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.270
That was,

1626
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.140
that was sweet too.

1627
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.290
<v 1>And then the referee get calmed.</v>

1628
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.140
Me Ref I don't,

1629
00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.053
is

1630
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:41.760
that,

1631
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.380
it wouldn't be funny of the web with the Lego.

1632
00:41:43.381 --> 00:41:45.090
He wrote to the other corner,

1633
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.750
you talk about a movie that would have been,

1634
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:49.590
but you know,

1635
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.220
they're five Ryder was to real store or you know,

1636
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:54.810
in of public perception.

1637
00:41:54.811 --> 00:41:55.530
Exactly.

1638
00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:56.221
Exactly.

1639
00:41:56.221 --> 00:41:57.310
I knew I was really good.

1640
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.740
So with that,

1641
00:41:58.741 --> 00:42:03.741
especially when it went viral and then coming back with the Ortiz maybe cause

1642
00:42:04.111 --> 00:42:08.850
the people that were more interesting to see what I'm going to do now cause

1643
00:42:08.851 --> 00:42:11.880
people tune in now whether they they love me or hate me,

1644
00:42:11.881 --> 00:42:13.980
they tune in to see can I knock the next personnel,

1645
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:14.371
you know,

1646
00:42:14.371 --> 00:42:15.390
at this point of time,

1647
00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:15.871
you know,

1648
00:42:15.871 --> 00:42:18.120
because a lot of people didn't even know I was an Olympian.

1649
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.983
You know?

1650
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.853
Um,

1651
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:20.880
you know,

1652
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.290
people I don't really even get recognized for really being the WBC champion,

1653
00:42:25.291 --> 00:42:25.621
you know,

1654
00:42:25.621 --> 00:42:26.190
and others,

1655
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.821
people eyes,

1656
00:42:26.821 --> 00:42:27.150
he just,

1657
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.983
that motherfucker

1658
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.103
<v 2>you out.</v>

1659
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:29.931
You know what I'm saying?

1660
00:42:29.931 --> 00:42:32.180
Everywhere I go now it's different.

1661
00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:32.751
Tyson fight,

1662
00:42:32.751 --> 00:42:33.770
they realize you're the champ.

1663
00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.260
I mean you used to be,

1664
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:37.291
I mean obviously the,

1665
00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:40.280
the belts are fragmented because there's a lot of sanctioning organizations,

1666
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:43.010
but it used to be there was Anthony Joshua in you.

1667
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.370
But people are not paying attention to Anthony Joshua right now.

1668
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:46.730
No,

1669
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:47.180
it's just,

1670
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.010
it's like he's literally had been forgotten.

1671
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.970
Most definitely.

1672
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:50.460
And that's a,

1673
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.560
that's a great way to put it.

1674
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.330
It's really been forgotten.

1675
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:56.000
He's defended his title since the Klitschko fight.

1676
00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:56.601
How many times?

1677
00:42:56.601 --> 00:42:57.434
Twice.

1678
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.220
<v 1>Maybe three.</v>

1679
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.053
I'm not sure.

1680
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.630
I remember the Parker was Parker.

1681
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.320
Yeah,

1682
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.180
Parker was after Parker.

1683
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.410
Um,

1684
00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:10.741
<v 2>was it,</v>

1685
00:43:10.741 --> 00:43:12.410
the attacker was tackling before then?

1686
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:13.230
Well,

1687
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.550
what is interesting is if,

1688
00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.740
if this continues,

1689
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:17.341
you know,

1690
00:43:17.341 --> 00:43:20.880
if you entice and have a rematch and then you eventually get to fight Anthony,

1691
00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:21.540
Joshua,

1692
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.130
if you guys fight in Europe,

1693
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:27.480
I mean you might be able to fill up some giant fucking crazy ass soccer arena.

1694
00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:27.900
Sometimes.

1695
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:28.650
It's going to be crazy.

1696
00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.221
I mean if you,

1697
00:43:29.221 --> 00:43:30.840
if you go over to England and fight him there,

1698
00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:34.170
that would be insane because he's a giant superstar over there.

1699
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:35.063
Most definitely.

1700
00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:35.460
<v 1>I,</v>

1701
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:36.293
I definitely,

1702
00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.653
um,

1703
00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.273
um,

1704
00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.230
would definitely be able to go over there.

1705
00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:41.640
You know,

1706
00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.270
you get an opportunity to go over there.

1707
00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:43.600
You know,

1708
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.130
even if for any willful Joshua,

1709
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.700
even if it was someone I want to expand out there as well too.

1710
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:49.360
Uh,

1711
00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:49.990
but um,

1712
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:54.850
we definitely get a fight with Joshua out there and then probably bring a

1713
00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:54.880
hundred hundred thousand or plus.

1714
00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.713
You know,

1715
00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:56.980
the only thing about the UK,

1716
00:43:56.981 --> 00:43:57.520
a lot of people,

1717
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.560
a lot of people think that's where the money is,

1718
00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.790
but that's not true.

1719
00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:01.061
You know,

1720
00:44:01.061 --> 00:44:02.290
they got a cap on their money,

1721
00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:02.711
you know,

1722
00:44:02.711 --> 00:44:03.310
it ain't like,

1723
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.570
it ain't like here in America.

1724
00:44:04.571 --> 00:44:08.470
America always be will be the Mecca of boxing.

1725
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.560
Anything pertaining to that because the money is here,

1726
00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.011
you know,

1727
00:44:12.011 --> 00:44:14.530
how they sell their paper view and how we sell.

1728
00:44:14.531 --> 00:44:15.880
I was just like day and night.

1729
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.160
They $20 a week go from shit,

1730
00:44:18.161 --> 00:44:23.050
the cheapest 50 sum on up to $100 and people pay for people.

1731
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:23.411
You know,

1732
00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:27.250
it's fascinating and people think because you see more people equals more

1733
00:44:27.251 --> 00:44:28.084
dollars,

1734
00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.320
but you know,

1735
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:30.190
and that's,

1736
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.790
you know,

1737
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.400
it's a cow is a cow per day.

1738
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:34.230
You can only make so much over there.

1739
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.453
And that's it.

1740
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.300
If it was that,

1741
00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:37.470
if it wasn't that fact,

1742
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:41.400
then you'll see more people from America going to the UK to fight.

1743
00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:41.760
Right.

1744
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.500
You know,

1745
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.030
<v 2>casinos in Vegas or they're,</v>

1746
00:44:44.031 --> 00:44:45.920
they're probably gonna want to do this fight next.

1747
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:49.460
That's where they want it because they want all that extra gambling money in

1748
00:44:49.461 --> 00:44:50.690
restaurant money and show money.

1749
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:51.800
Right.

1750
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.090
That's where I would likely,

1751
00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:53.840
I would,

1752
00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.240
I would say it's likely gonna want

1753
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.070
<v 1>it could be,</v>

1754
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:56.411
you know,

1755
00:44:56.411 --> 00:44:57.510
we got a lot of places,

1756
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.260
you know,

1757
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.190
I wouldn't mind going back to New York as well.

1758
00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.240
Boxing's recording.

1759
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.910
Yeah.

1760
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:02.743
I mean,

1761
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:03.601
you know,

1762
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:05.340
you've got so many diverse people there,

1763
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.321
you know,

1764
00:45:06.321 --> 00:45:06.730
um,

1765
00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.300
a lot of people look at travels and stuff like that,

1766
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:09.541
you know,

1767
00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:11.670
all those be busy and stuff,

1768
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:11.941
you know,

1769
00:45:11.941 --> 00:45:12.774
people won't still,

1770
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.980
to be easy access.

1771
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:14.131
He,

1772
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:14.964
Vegas,

1773
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.550
Vegas makes it easy for people because you know,

1774
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:20.640
the airport is right there and then five minutes away you're on the Strip and

1775
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.800
that's what most of the people be at and stuff.

1776
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.360
But you know,

1777
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:24.830
we'll,

1778
00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:26.040
we'll see when the time comes.

1779
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:26.491
You know,

1780
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:27.480
I'm open for any,

1781
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:28.111
any,

1782
00:45:28.111 --> 00:45:28.870
any place,

1783
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:29.010
you know,

1784
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.350
when you guys talking about a rematch maybe,

1785
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.193
uh,

1786
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.970
we're looking at April,

1787
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:35.970
May,

1788
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:36.000
June,

1789
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.833
somewhere up in there,

1790
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:38.040
you know,

1791
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.490
and uh,

1792
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:39.211
we'll see what happens.

1793
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:40.110
I'm excited though,

1794
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:40.411
you know,

1795
00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:41.490
he said he back in the gym,

1796
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:41.870
he text,

1797
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:42.703
he hit me up,

1798
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:47.490
he sent me a video saying how you back in the gym and stuff like that.

1799
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.660
And I just hit back him likewise because it's crazy because his mindset is,

1800
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.930
it's being back in the gym and mine's is the same way.

1801
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.560
You know,

1802
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.010
I been,

1803
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.890
I been traveling a lot talking about this fight.

1804
00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.810
Like it's been like I'm already,

1805
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.853
you know,

1806
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.520
it in discussion with certain outlets or whatever.

1807
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:07.130
It's like we've been boosting up this neck,

1808
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.010
this rematch fight.

1809
00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:08.480
Like it's,

1810
00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.000
it's,

1811
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.110
it's almost here.

1812
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.250
It's been crazy though.

1813
00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:13.560
This is what my career needed as well too,

1814
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:14.240
you know?

1815
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:14.820
Um,

1816
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.601
so I don't mind,

1817
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:17.430
I've been from La to New York.

1818
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:20.100
I'm just again from New York now I'm back here.

1819
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.500
They're now offering to go to my original home time.

1820
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:24.540
I got some things I got to do out there.

1821
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.760
Enjoy the holidays.

1822
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.440
I'm going to take a vacation with my family and then once I get back on back

1823
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:32.490
into the gym myself.

1824
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.840
<v 2>Boxing fans,</v>

1825
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:35.670
hardcore boxy fans already knew who you are,

1826
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:38.820
but this was the breakthrough fight for the general public.

1827
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:43.320
This is a breakthrough fight where people know about it now and the next fight.

1828
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.220
The rematch.

1829
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:44.761
First of all,

1830
00:46:44.761 --> 00:46:47.160
you couldn't ask for a better dance partner when it comes to promotion.

1831
00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:47.340
I mean,

1832
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.740
Tyson's fantastic on the microphone.

1833
00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:50.461
He's hilarious.

1834
00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:51.510
He's got that great accent.

1835
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.040
It's fun to listen to him talk,

1836
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.330
so you guys promoting this and getting ready for whatever it is,

1837
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:57.240
April,

1838
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:57.240
May,

1839
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:57.241
June,

1840
00:46:57.241 --> 00:46:58.110
whenever it takes place.

1841
00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:58.531
I mean,

1842
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:00.810
this is going to be probably one of the biggest heavyweight fights,

1843
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:02.700
if not the biggest of all time.

1844
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:03.783
<v 1>Oh Man.</v>

1845
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.980
I'm just so excited.

1846
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:05.641
You know what I mean?

1847
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:06.960
Because I could see,

1848
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:08.400
I can visualize it now.

1849
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.610
I couldn't really visualize how big this could be come.

1850
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.260
I knew it was going to be big,

1851
00:47:13.261 --> 00:47:14.730
but you just don't know how people are.

1852
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.180
You know?

1853
00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.013
People are funny.

1854
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.041
Especially,

1855
00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:17.874
you know,

1856
00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.170
you know,

1857
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.910
people always have things to do.

1858
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:21.480
You know,

1859
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.313
you nailed it.

1860
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:22.781
There was nothing,

1861
00:47:22.781 --> 00:47:22.960
nothing

1862
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.980
<v 2>else competing with you.</v>

1863
00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.330
There's nothing else there to watch.

1864
00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:26.170
It was perfect.

1865
00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.900
It was a perfect storm and then it was in la,

1866
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:30.070
so stars came out.

1867
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.000
<v 1>It was a big deal,</v>

1868
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:32.110
man.

1869
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:32.950
It was amazing.

1870
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:34.000
And I'll never forget it,

1871
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:34.834
you know.

1872
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:37.143
Excuse me.

1873
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:37.841
Like I said,

1874
00:47:37.841 --> 00:47:38.710
I've been waiting for this.

1875
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.560
I've been waiting for that moment for so long.

1876
00:47:41.561 --> 00:47:42.250
You know,

1877
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:45.070
they don't have this problem in the UK because no matter,

1878
00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:45.611
you know,

1879
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:47.290
no matter what they love boxing.

1880
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:48.460
It's the second nature of sport.

1881
00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:52.450
They don't have college sports and professional sports that they had to deal

1882
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:53.200
with boxes.

1883
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:53.691
Like I said,

1884
00:47:53.691 --> 00:47:56.320
they're second nature of sport and you know,

1885
00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:57.600
Eh,

1886
00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.060
you know,

1887
00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.650
they don't have as many as people.

1888
00:47:59.651 --> 00:48:02.200
We have here the here like with maybe 66 million,

1889
00:48:02.201 --> 00:48:02.980
something like that.

1890
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.730
Uh,

1891
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.140
Alabama and Mississippi,

1892
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.620
they can fit UK in Alabama and Mississippi combined to be other,

1893
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:13.980
but they could fit the whole state and in Texas and still have space,

1894
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.200
which over here we got so much.

1895
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:21.190
We got how many colleges and professional sports and you know,

1896
00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:23.350
boxing is like probably the last sport,

1897
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.191
you know,

1898
00:48:24.191 --> 00:48:24.910
on the list.

1899
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:25.361
You know,

1900
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:26.194
I probably,

1901
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:26.501
you know,

1902
00:48:26.501 --> 00:48:27.910
exaggerating with that a little bit,

1903
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:30.280
but it definitely seemed like that we definitely,

1904
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:30.701
you know,

1905
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:33.160
in the back and there's so much to compete with.

1906
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.971
It's so,

1907
00:48:33.971 --> 00:48:35.980
it's so hard here to do it.

1908
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:37.143
And then when you,

1909
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.540
when you,

1910
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.010
when you finally get that shine,

1911
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.413
you know,

1912
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.950
that's where it comes from.

1913
00:48:41.951 --> 00:48:42.784
You know,

1914
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.520
when a minute and when you're in it and you understand it,

1915
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.770
it's like how it's so hard.

1916
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.470
It was to get it to get to this point,

1917
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.550
you know,

1918
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.760
down there 11 years and like to get to this point.

1919
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.140
And then when you finally get his life here.

1920
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.650
Yeah.

1921
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:01.330
Big Time.

1922
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:02.050
Yeah.

1923
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.510
When you think back when you're driving that Budweiser truck,

1924
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:05.651
I just,

1925
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:05.830
ah,

1926
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.080
I appreciate every job that I had.

1927
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:08.531
You know,

1928
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:09.460
I appreciate every,

1929
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.350
everything that you know,

1930
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.540
that it happened to me in my life.

1931
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.130
It may allow me to appreciate,

1932
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:15.791
you know,

1933
00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:19.270
who I am now allowed me to appreciate just the smaller things.

1934
00:49:19.271 --> 00:49:21.100
It allowed me to just be myself.

1935
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:21.940
You know,

1936
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.310
I'm a type of person that I don't really care about fame.

1937
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.080
I don't even want to be called the celebrity.

1938
00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:26.740
You know what I mean?

1939
00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.190
I want to be able to live my life and do what I do.

1940
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:33.730
I want to be able to enjoy just the smallest things in life.

1941
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.040
I don't want people to take that away from me.

1942
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:36.874
You know what I mean?

1943
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:41.770
Being able to go to a movie or a grocery store or whatever and spend time with

1944
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:42.850
the family you can't shut,

1945
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:43.684
cause I like cooking.

1946
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.700
I like going to the grocery stores,

1947
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:46.600
the fresh market,

1948
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:51.880
pick out my fruit and stuff that I want to put in my whatever I'm preparing for

1949
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:53.080
the night and stuff like that.

1950
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.030
I'm a people's person as well,

1951
00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:56.650
so I don't mind being bothered,

1952
00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.060
but you know,

1953
00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:59.200
it can't get crate.

1954
00:49:59.201 --> 00:50:02.320
I've seen other people get it get crazy for an iron man,

1955
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:02.591
you know?

1956
00:50:02.591 --> 00:50:04.720
And they said it themselves like they don't,

1957
00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.240
they wished that they could do certain things,

1958
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:08.170
normal things,

1959
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:09.004
but people,

1960
00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:09.963
people,

1961
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.860
people take it to the next level,

1962
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.581
you know?

1963
00:50:12.581 --> 00:50:13.301
Get all in your bit,

1964
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:14.200
especially after this fight,

1965
00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:16.540
like I of had to cut some people,

1966
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:17.080
you know,

1967
00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.020
I didn't had to cut some people because they intentions was already wrong.

1968
00:50:20.021 --> 00:50:21.040
They seen a potential.

1969
00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:22.420
I put they,

1970
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.240
they seen the opportunity and they tried to make moves on me,

1971
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.910
you know,

1972
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:27.560
already you know,

1973
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:28.201
in different than,

1974
00:50:28.201 --> 00:50:29.720
that's why I said lonely at the top,

1975
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.261
you know,

1976
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:32.300
because you get to the point where you don't know who to trust.

1977
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:34.370
You start down everybody around you.

1978
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:35.361
You know,

1979
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:40.220
I'm an energy person so I'm always re refreshing the feeling of the energy.

1980
00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:41.570
Let me see what it feels like.

1981
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:42.950
You know what I'm saying?

1982
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:43.820
Another,

1983
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:48.820
I always allow me to meet certain people to be around certain people because if

1984
00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:51.590
you change your presence,

1985
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:52.570
the energy just to just,

1986
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:53.800
it will change as well too.

1987
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.860
It changes.

1988
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.810
It shifts the way you feel when you're around.

1989
00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.600
Then all of a sudden you feel like they're looking for angles and trying to

1990
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:00.560
profit off of you.

1991
00:51:00.561 --> 00:51:02.000
They're trying to get you to do things.

1992
00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:02.720
Yes.

1993
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.310
You know?

1994
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:03.680
Eh,

1995
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.220
you know,

1996
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:04.501
I'm a,

1997
00:51:04.501 --> 00:51:05.630
I'm a strong minded person.

1998
00:51:05.631 --> 00:51:08.120
I got a lot of strong minded men around me.

1999
00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:10.070
I always tell people we speak positive.

2000
00:51:10.071 --> 00:51:12.060
We think positive and re surround.

2001
00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:13.160
I was helped by positive,

2002
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:14.383
you know,

2003
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.380
positive energy,

2004
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.771
you know,

2005
00:51:15.771 --> 00:51:16.471
and then I will,

2006
00:51:16.471 --> 00:51:17.960
results is always positive.

2007
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.460
The only time you ever see me,

2008
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.983
you know,

2009
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.520
acting out.

2010
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:25.280
I would say if someone come and break that piece,

2011
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.230
you'll never find me and my brothers,

2012
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:28.573
you know out,

2013
00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:29.181
you know,

2014
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:31.130
mess with someone's starting in anything.

2015
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:31.541
I'm not a,

2016
00:51:31.541 --> 00:51:31.970
I'm not,

2017
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:32.630
I'm not,

2018
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.690
I'm not the one that started anything because I want peace.

2019
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.640
I don't even want to see a fight outside.

2020
00:51:37.641 --> 00:51:39.020
If it's not in the boxing ring,

2021
00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.920
I'll walk away if I see it on the outside because I feel like they don't know

2022
00:51:42.921 --> 00:51:43.754
what they doing.

2023
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:44.511
You know what I mean?

2024
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:46.640
Is there something could happen easily.

2025
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:51.641
You see guns being pulled out now a days and you know any little thing.

2026
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:55.970
So I started to stay away from confrontation as much as possible.

2027
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.110
That's why I thank God that I'm a homebody.

2028
00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:58.670
You know,

2029
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:59.810
if I'm not here,

2030
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.033
I'm at home,

2031
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:01.670
you know,

2032
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.770
back and forth because they say when you had to find,

2033
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.120
when you had to,

2034
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:05.630
you know,

2035
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:07.880
find things to do when you had to leave home all the time,

2036
00:52:07.881 --> 00:52:09.050
you don't have a peaceful home.

2037
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:10.450
And um,

2038
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:11.330
I believe in that,

2039
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.990
you know,

2040
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:13.220
I don't understand when you're,

2041
00:52:13.221 --> 00:52:14.001
when it's busy,

2042
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:14.870
you have to work and stuff.

2043
00:52:14.871 --> 00:52:15.740
That's one thing.

2044
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:16.761
But you know,

2045
00:52:16.761 --> 00:52:17.241
when you just said,

2046
00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:17.481
man,

2047
00:52:17.481 --> 00:52:18.081
let's go here.

2048
00:52:18.081 --> 00:52:18.914
Let's get out and do it.

2049
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.431
See,

2050
00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:19.941
I don't want to,

2051
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:20.510
I don't,

2052
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.390
I don't put myself out there to be a risk for no one.

2053
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:24.583
You know,

2054
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:25.850
my risk is at home.

2055
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.470
If something's going to happen,

2056
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:28.221
then you know,

2057
00:52:28.221 --> 00:52:29.570
the Auntie who was at home,

2058
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.493
you know,

2059
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:30.981
I don't,

2060
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:34.470
I don't put myself out there to the half chance chances at the chances of where

2061
00:52:34.471 --> 00:52:36.380
people look down and it's like,

2062
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.561
Hey,

2063
00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:37.221
let's do this.

2064
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:38.150
Let's do that to him.

2065
00:52:38.151 --> 00:52:39.020
Or I tried to,

2066
00:52:39.021 --> 00:52:41.330
because I know what I'm capable of doing.

2067
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.373
You know what I mean?

2068
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.940
And I like being me.

2069
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.670
I just like being laid back down to Earth,

2070
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.260
get along with everyone.

2071
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:51.590
I'm a people's person and a lot of people will never know it because they only

2072
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:53.270
see the perspective of me and the ring.

2073
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:57.050
Or they see me on youtube and those interviews,

2074
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:57.740
yes.

2075
00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.700
You're a very mellow guy.

2076
00:52:58.701 --> 00:52:59.534
Like right now

2077
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:01.791
I'm just,

2078
00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:02.630
I'm the coolest.

2079
00:53:02.631 --> 00:53:03.350
I'm the best,

2080
00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:03.651
you know,

2081
00:53:03.651 --> 00:53:05.480
and what's got to help to the train a lot.

2082
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:05.811
So,

2083
00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:06.560
you know,

2084
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:06.890
yeah.

2085
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:07.290
It,

2086
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:08.123
the stress

2087
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.130
training constantly,

2088
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:10.720
right?

2089
00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:10.910
Yeah.

2090
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:11.571
I mean,

2091
00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:12.680
I get my times in,

2092
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:13.730
you know,

2093
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.600
if I'm not with my family,

2094
00:53:14.601 --> 00:53:15.470
I love my family.

2095
00:53:15.471 --> 00:53:15.831
You know,

2096
00:53:15.831 --> 00:53:16.191
I love,

2097
00:53:16.191 --> 00:53:19.140
I got some beautiful churches and I got a beautiful woman and I just,

2098
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.410
I love being around them.

2099
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:23.480
I love being able to see my children grow,

2100
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:25.250
being able to see them smile,

2101
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.153
you know,

2102
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:30.900
tell me good morning or kiss me just own freewill without me having to tell

2103
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:31.151
them.

2104
00:53:31.151 --> 00:53:31.950
We'll ask them.

2105
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:35.280
They just come up and kiss me and say how much they love me and stuff.

2106
00:53:35.281 --> 00:53:36.060
It feels good.

2107
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:36.893
The only way you want it.

2108
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.280
If you want to see me cry,

2109
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.110
deal with kids.

2110
00:53:40.111 --> 00:53:41.580
They don't even have to be my kids.

2111
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:42.690
It can be others as well.

2112
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.100
I love kids.

2113
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:44.963
It's nothing.

2114
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:49.740
And what hurts me so bad with kids is that to see some kids have to have to grow

2115
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:50.280
fast,

2116
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.300
faster than what they,

2117
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:53.010
they normally would have to,

2118
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:53.371
you know,

2119
00:53:53.371 --> 00:53:54.720
have to be a adult fast.

2120
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:55.554
Because I,

2121
00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:00.930
I think your childhood years are some of your best years of your life because

2122
00:54:00.931 --> 00:54:03.000
you don't have really no responsibilities.

2123
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.400
And when you get out into the real world,

2124
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.810
that's when reality hits.

2125
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:07.500
That's when it was like,

2126
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.333
oh,

2127
00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:09.061
this,

2128
00:54:09.061 --> 00:54:09.391
this,

2129
00:54:09.391 --> 00:54:10.224
this,

2130
00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:11.370
this is real.

2131
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.241
You know?

2132
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:14.040
So my heart goes out to a lot of kids.

2133
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:14.550
I love,

2134
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:15.420
I love children.

2135
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.670
And that what keeps me strong in this sport,

2136
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:18.510
you know?

2137
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.520
Do you worry about getting more famous?

2138
00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:23.010
Do you worry about the consequences?

2139
00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.030
I don't think about,

2140
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.950
I don't think about getting more famous,

2141
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:26.550
you know,

2142
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:26.700
I,

2143
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:27.533
I know it comes,

2144
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.160
it comes with the territory,

2145
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:29.911
you know,

2146
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:30.181
and I,

2147
00:54:30.181 --> 00:54:32.430
and even if people know everything,

2148
00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:33.660
I just want people just,

2149
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:35.881
you know,

2150
00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:36.361
don't,

2151
00:54:36.361 --> 00:54:36.751
don't,

2152
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:37.680
don't hold me,

2153
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.301
don't,

2154
00:54:39.301 --> 00:54:40.840
don't look at me as someone that,

2155
00:54:40.841 --> 00:54:44.280
that holds me higher than then you know,

2156
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.390
people who have high,

2157
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.010
high expectations for you.

2158
00:54:47.011 --> 00:54:48.510
And when you do something,

2159
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.823
they think,

2160
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:50.760
you know,

2161
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.480
the biggest thing in the world that happened,

2162
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:53.491
you know,

2163
00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:56.840
you can do the same thing is as a being that weren't getting met.

2164
00:54:56.841 --> 00:54:57.674
Donna does.

2165
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:01.200
But because I have the name and he doesn't,

2166
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.970
then it makes it even more,

2167
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.541
you know,

2168
00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:05.000
worse than what he done.

2169
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:05.690
You know,

2170
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:06.390
I'm like,

2171
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.430
we are humans.

2172
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:09.440
We are gonna make mistakes.

2173
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:10.380
We're going to do things.

2174
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:13.200
They probably do some things that you don't supposed to do.

2175
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.670
You get in trouble with doing.

2176
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:15.061
You know what I mean?

2177
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:16.200
It's just part of life,

2178
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.790
you know?

2179
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:17.623
And I never,

2180
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:21.240
I never make myself seem like I'm better than anyone,

2181
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.841
you know,

2182
00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:22.600
I'm a type of God.

2183
00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.670
I've talked to a homeless man and if the,

2184
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:26.160
if the conversation led,

2185
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:27.450
we until we a go,

2186
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:28.710
I'm a people's person.

2187
00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:29.980
My mother was a people person.

2188
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.430
The term is she never met strangers.

2189
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:34.860
I never meet strangers because you can never know,

2190
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:35.720
um,

2191
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:36.990
by me and the active with a person.

2192
00:55:36.991 --> 00:55:38.280
Do I know that person or not?

2193
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:41.490
Because of the how we are interacting with each other and that's just me.

2194
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:42.381
I'm a people's person.

2195
00:55:42.381 --> 00:55:46.080
Cause you just never know who you may meet and what they can give you.

2196
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.090
What advice or what you can kill them,

2197
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:48.421
you know,

2198
00:55:48.421 --> 00:55:49.530
to make their day better,

2199
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.151
you know,

2200
00:55:50.151 --> 00:55:51.250
or hug us say,

2201
00:55:51.251 --> 00:55:52.490
man I love you man.

2202
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:53.190
You know,

2203
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.550
that's,

2204
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.480
that's the final things.

2205
00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:56.340
Like that's what life of Bach all about.

2206
00:55:56.341 --> 00:56:00.060
It ain't all so much about who you are and how much money you got because that

2207
00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:01.590
can be gone tomorrow.

2208
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:02.401
You know,

2209
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:03.300
it ain't about that,

2210
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:03.601
you know,

2211
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:05.430
it's about treating people with respect.

2212
00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:06.780
You treat me with respect.

2213
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:08.510
I treat you no matter what,

2214
00:56:08.511 --> 00:56:11.010
what you are in life because you are human being.

2215
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:12.120
And that's what I'm all about.

2216
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:13.860
As you get more famous though,

2217
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:14.790
you're going to get more.

2218
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:15.800
The numbers are just,

2219
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.250
that's where it gets unmanageable.

2220
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.570
People start waiting for it.

2221
00:56:18.571 --> 00:56:18.831
Like you,

2222
00:56:18.831 --> 00:56:20.850
you ever see what it looks like when Manny Pacquiao is training?

2223
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:22.260
No,

2224
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.093
when he was in his,

2225
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:23.980
especially when he's

2226
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.030
<v 2>trained in the Philippines,</v>

2227
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:26.290
is it was insane.

2228
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:28.150
Like Freddie Roach was there with them and you know,

2229
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:30.730
they'd be look outside and people be holding their phones up,

2230
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:32.350
just waiting for him to look outside the window.

2231
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:34.810
Just hundreds of people everywhere he goes.

2232
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:35.981
And you know,

2233
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:37.180
he lives in the Philippines,

2234
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:37.931
so it's a,

2235
00:56:37.931 --> 00:56:41.200
he's the superstar and this incredibly poor country.

2236
00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.820
And he's a really humble guy too.

2237
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.080
But it almost seemed,

2238
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:44.231
I mean,

2239
00:56:44.231 --> 00:56:46.090
he handles it in an amazing way.

2240
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.380
I don't know how that guy does it,

2241
00:56:47.381 --> 00:56:47.681
but he's,

2242
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:48.760
he's very chill too.

2243
00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:49.211
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2244
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:50.230
Well he had to have,

2245
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:50.711
you know,

2246
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:51.700
he'd had been knocked down.

2247
00:56:51.701 --> 00:56:53.830
I had to be good and to be brought back up.

2248
00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.930
Light life teaches you lessons and,

2249
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.513
and um,

2250
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:00.310
and God bless you sometime with second chances,

2251
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.800
you know,

2252
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.280
and when you do get the second chance and you know how to handle a little bit

2253
00:57:03.281 --> 00:57:04.540
better than the first time,

2254
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:05.471
you know,

2255
00:57:05.471 --> 00:57:07.930
hopefully you don't never have to go through nothing,

2256
00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.240
um,

2257
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.000
dramatic,

2258
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:10.421
you know,

2259
00:57:10.421 --> 00:57:11.620
or nothing severe,

2260
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:12.461
you know,

2261
00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:12.781
to,

2262
00:57:12.781 --> 00:57:13.810
to learn a lesson,

2263
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.033
you know,

2264
00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.121
because he definitely,

2265
00:57:16.121 --> 00:57:17.430
he probably would tell you itself,

2266
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:17.651
you know,

2267
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:20.770
there's a lot of things that he was doing that he had the correct,

2268
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:21.140
you know,

2269
00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:23.980
I had to get herself right or whatever because it can take you away.

2270
00:57:23.981 --> 00:57:24.814
You know,

2271
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:26.280
if a person dwell,

2272
00:57:26.281 --> 00:57:26.540
somebody,

2273
00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:27.910
not saying Manny did this,

2274
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:29.590
but just talking in general,

2275
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.720
if a person dwell so much on,

2276
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:32.261
you know,

2277
00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:35.800
being famous and people loving them and knowing them and stuff like that,

2278
00:57:35.801 --> 00:57:39.550
like it can take that minor way from there and they'll become this type of

2279
00:57:39.551 --> 00:57:39.910
person.

2280
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:40.541
That's when people say,

2281
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:40.661
Oh,

2282
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:41.471
you've changed,

2283
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:42.490
you've changed.

2284
00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:43.413
You know,

2285
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.261
and then they'll make,

2286
00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:45.490
I've seen it firsthand,

2287
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.850
I've seen a person with no money and then when they get some money,

2288
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.421
they don't know.

2289
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:50.254
They changing,

2290
00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.370
you know,

2291
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:54.880
it's just something that's happening and people would say you changing.

2292
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.481
And I'd be like,

2293
00:57:55.481 --> 00:57:56.170
no,

2294
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:56.780
I'm just,

2295
00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:56.960
they,

2296
00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.000
I think they're just them.

2297
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.843
And you know what I'm saying,

2298
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.460
but not in reality,

2299
00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:01.294
you know,

2300
00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:01.840
uh,

2301
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.110
slowly but surely they're changing and stuff like,

2302
00:58:05.111 --> 00:58:05.321
and I,

2303
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:06.154
I'm a,

2304
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.310
I'm a type of person that I'm not judging mental people alive.

2305
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.410
I'm a type of person that whatever you're doing your life,

2306
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.530
you chose to do that.

2307
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:13.871
I mean,

2308
00:58:13.871 --> 00:58:15.670
who am I to judge you?

2309
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.820
I don't judge people because I don't want them to judge me.

2310
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:19.803
You know what I mean?

2311
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:20.650
Whatever.

2312
00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:23.980
I'm the type of person that whatever you get involved with,

2313
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:25.630
it's a consequences.

2314
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:29.140
That is consequences behind your ashes that you,

2315
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.620
you're going to have to face whether you do the right thing or the wrong thing,

2316
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.080
you're going to have to face the consequences behind it.

2317
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:37.420
And only you going to have to face it,

2318
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.170
you know,

2319
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.040
at the end of the day.

2320
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:40.360
And that's why I respect people.

2321
00:58:40.361 --> 00:58:40.520
I,

2322
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:40.750
you know,

2323
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:41.583
whatever you do,

2324
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.480
you know that show,

2325
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:44.463
it's your life.

2326
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.700
Have Fun with your life.

2327
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:46.840
You know,

2328
00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.310
we make mistakes to correct them.

2329
00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:49.960
Loan we learned from my mistakes,

2330
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:50.891
then,

2331
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:51.300
hey,

2332
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:52.390
we're all human,

2333
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.220
you know,

2334
00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.910
now coming this rematch,

2335
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:57.400
what would you do differently then?

2336
00:58:57.401 --> 00:58:58.150
This rematch,

2337
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:59.200
what I would do differently.

2338
00:58:59.201 --> 00:58:59.770
I would,

2339
00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:01.120
I wouldn't abandon the body.

2340
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:03.010
I heard him twice in the body.

2341
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:04.790
I should have kept going with the body mark.

2342
00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:07.240
What kept telling me to keep going to the body,

2343
00:59:07.241 --> 00:59:07.870
going to the head,

2344
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:08.411
go to the hair,

2345
00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:09.160
go,

2346
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:09.993
go to the body.

2347
00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:11.980
And I've been in that whole thing.

2348
00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:12.970
Um,

2349
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:17.800
I would probably be jam more and I'd definitely be more calmer this time around.

2350
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:18.671
You know,

2351
00:59:18.671 --> 00:59:19.504
when you,

2352
00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:20.011
you know,

2353
00:59:20.011 --> 00:59:20.290
though,

2354
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:20.651
when you,

2355
00:59:20.651 --> 00:59:25.651
when you find the god twice you the first time you get to experience him,

2356
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:29.270
the second time y'all kind of know each other a little bit better than the first

2357
00:59:29.271 --> 00:59:30.104
time.

2358
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:30.943
And um,

2359
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:32.100
I really feel fear.

2360
00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:34.910
We brought his fear about the best of theory,

2361
00:59:34.911 --> 00:59:37.010
but it definitely wasn't the best of Deontay wilder.

2362
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:37.851
And,

2363
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:38.150
uh,

2364
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:41.100
at this point of how we know what to train for because I don't think he's going

2365
00:59:41.101 --> 00:59:42.050
to change nothing up.

2366
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.160
He fought a great game,

2367
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:43.760
you know,

2368
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.593
a great fight.

2369
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:45.670
And I don't think isn't,

2370
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:46.131
you know,

2371
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:47.630
nothing that could be changed up.

2372
00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.270
Maybe he'd probably lose.

2373
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.540
If you get into GM now,

2374
00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:50.810
he'll,

2375
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:52.820
he'll be a little bit lighter for sure.

2376
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.140
And that could be me.

2377
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:56.120
That could mean a little bit light on the feet though,

2378
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:57.043
you know what I'm saying?

2379
00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.040
Uh,

2380
00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.930
but we definitely gonna adjust,

2381
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.080
make some small adjustments and I can't wait.

2382
01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:03.411
It's going to,

2383
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:04.490
it's going to be explosive.

2384
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.950
Now when you do a training camp for a big fight like this,

2385
01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:09.080
how many weeks do you prepare for this?

2386
01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:10.160
Five was three months.

2387
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.023
Three months.

2388
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:15.330
And so do you start up and start slowly ramping and who,

2389
01:00:15.331 --> 01:00:18.110
who sets your schedule in terms of like what you do every day?

2390
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:19.460
Um,

2391
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.293
with camp,

2392
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.850
my,

2393
01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.340
my time train and Jay,

2394
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.950
he sets up like all the sparring partners and stuff.

2395
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.480
I got strength and conditioning coach and,

2396
01:00:27.481 --> 01:00:30.020
and different and in shelves and stuff like that.

2397
01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:30.854
So we,

2398
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.020
I got all that under,

2399
01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:32.890
uh,

2400
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:33.723
um,

2401
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:34.723
I got all that,

2402
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:35.301
you know,

2403
01:00:35.301 --> 01:00:36.020
or someone else.

2404
01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.180
Here's all your foods or prepared to die.

2405
01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:38.490
Yeah.

2406
01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:38.781
Yeah,

2407
01:00:38.781 --> 01:00:39.350
for sure.

2408
01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:39.621
For sure.

2409
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:42.260
That's why I was surprised I came in so such a low,

2410
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:43.400
even at two 12

2411
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:46.940
because you know in cabinet stuff

2412
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.600
I got to such a high metabolism.

2413
01:00:50.601 --> 01:00:51.020
It just,

2414
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.040
I just never know.

2415
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:52.461
I don't,

2416
01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:54.260
I don't really just keep up with my weight.

2417
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:57.650
I'm not in type of guy that I weigh in all the time or whatever.

2418
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.630
I think because I've got an item gotten by with this power for so long,

2419
01:01:02.631 --> 01:01:03.280
it's like,

2420
01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:03.620
you know,

2421
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.040
it just,

2422
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:04.970
it's just an image,

2423
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:05.750
you know,

2424
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:06.620
I can't gain weight.

2425
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:07.021
Like I,

2426
01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:08.030
I don't understand.

2427
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.571
You know,

2428
01:01:08.571 --> 01:01:11.660
I may have to do that blood testing thing and see like they got to where you can

2429
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:15.770
take your blood and they can do a test and see what types of food would make you

2430
01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:16.604
gain weight.

2431
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:17.631
And I think I'm,

2432
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:17.831
I'm,

2433
01:01:17.831 --> 01:01:18.101
I'm,

2434
01:01:18.101 --> 01:01:20.120
I'm a try that out.

2435
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:21.380
But you want to get anyway.

2436
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:21.861
Yeah.

2437
01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:22.041
Well,

2438
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:22.821
I want to get a little bit,

2439
01:01:22.821 --> 01:01:25.400
I always had the goal being to 45 with my six,

2440
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:25.750
seven,

2441
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:26.170
six,

2442
01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:27.110
600 frame.

2443
01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:32.150
But being two 45 you might get tired or in the later rounds you say you gained,

2444
01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.620
you gained weight and keep the speed.

2445
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:35.450
So you know,

2446
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:36.643
as you gaining,

2447
01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:37.760
you continue to,

2448
01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:38.361
to work,

2449
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.051
keep your speed.

2450
01:01:39.051 --> 01:01:39.530
That's how we,

2451
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.030
that's how we always wanted to,

2452
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:42.650
to uh,

2453
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.100
to go edit because we had a lot of guys that,

2454
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:46.940
you know,

2455
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.550
that specialize in bulking and stuff like that.

2456
01:01:49.551 --> 01:01:50.301
And we didn't want that.

2457
01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:50.691
We didn't want,

2458
01:01:50.691 --> 01:01:51.650
I didn't want to bulk up,

2459
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.611
you know what I mean?

2460
01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:54.530
I wanted to gain weight and keep the speed,

2461
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.490
you know,

2462
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:57.710
but just as much as I gained weight,

2463
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:59.720
it much as I work out in my tablet lives,

2464
01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:00.440
I'm so high.

2465
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.273
So it's like,

2466
01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.340
it's like I lose weight and my sleep.

2467
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.100
How many times a day?

2468
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:08.180
We was eating about three,

2469
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:08.901
three times.

2470
01:02:08.901 --> 01:02:10.010
Three to four times a day.

2471
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.900
And like what kind of foods?

2472
01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.253
Special?

2473
01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:13.620
Yeah,

2474
01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.840
we was eating steak,

2475
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:15.800
fish and chicken.

2476
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:16.820
You know,

2477
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.300
a lot of,

2478
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:17.660
lot of,

2479
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.050
uh,

2480
01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:18.580
low carb.

2481
01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.850
He okay.

2482
01:02:19.851 --> 01:02:20.390
You know,

2483
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:21.223
um,

2484
01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:21.990
we were eating,

2485
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.321
you know,

2486
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:24.570
I definitely have us with some in the south,

2487
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:24.961
you know,

2488
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:27.180
I had to have me some Greens and cornbread,

2489
01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.153
you know.

2490
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.213
Um,

2491
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.480
we was doing a lot of,

2492
01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:31.314
um,

2493
01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:32.893
um,

2494
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:36.023
let me see.

2495
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:36.480
Damn.

2496
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.313
Getting rid of my,

2497
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.000
I know we had mashed potatoes,

2498
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:41.550
we had a lot of a hop and Johns.

2499
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:42.480
How John is like,

2500
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:43.523
um,

2501
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:47.850
like a pinto beans and rice together with onions and stuff like that.

2502
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:48.960
You'll put up squash,

2503
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.460
do a lot of spinach,

2504
01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:51.603
spinach.

2505
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:53.370
I was doing a lot of tuna.

2506
01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:54.480
Um,

2507
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.460
so just whole foods.

2508
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:56.010
Yeah,

2509
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:56.900
most definitely beverage,

2510
01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.840
very happy food.

2511
01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:57.991
You know,

2512
01:02:57.991 --> 01:03:02.460
I get all my stuff from the whole food vitamins or anything like that.

2513
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.200
Correct.

2514
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.620
I was using the vitamins and stuff.

2515
01:03:04.621 --> 01:03:05.900
I was using the vitamins.

2516
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.900
I did the vitamins,

2517
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:09.790
I did the whole nine with the vitamin things like I really had to,

2518
01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.621
they would bring me,

2519
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:11.370
uh,

2520
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:11.620
I,

2521
01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.453
um,

2522
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.540
a kind of holder for the pills and stuff for each day of the week and stuff like

2523
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:18.751
that.

2524
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:22.830
And just and still like I wouldn't gain with the RTS for,

2525
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:27.330
I didn't gain like still like I'm like what the world going on with my body.

2526
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.270
I don't know what type of freakish body I have.

2527
01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:30.931
You know,

2528
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:32.160
because I tried to put on the weight,

2529
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.030
we're going to try another method this time I'm going to actually try to eat,

2530
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.570
try to eat every three hours or so like that.

2531
01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:42.210
I'm going to have my assistant with me and whatever.

2532
01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:46.200
So he'll bring me protein shakes and you know,

2533
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:47.040
and being able to,

2534
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:48.720
I just eating something,

2535
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:49.851
I want to put it,

2536
01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:51.450
I want to see what this weight thing a little like,

2537
01:03:51.451 --> 01:03:52.110
you know,

2538
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:52.943
um,

2539
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:53.670
we're going to,

2540
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:54.330
like I said,

2541
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.770
this next fight is going to be good,

2542
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.990
but the problem is you're doing so well.

2543
01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.110
<v 2>I don't know if I would do shit different.</v>

2544
01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:01.920
No,

2545
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.120
fix it if it's not broken.

2546
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:03.954
In terms of that,

2547
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.610
I know you're eating,

2548
01:04:05.611 --> 01:04:08.520
the thing about you is your endurance is so consistent.

2549
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.020
When you're in the 12th round,

2550
01:04:10.021 --> 01:04:11.730
your endurance is very consistent.

2551
01:04:11.731 --> 01:04:13.320
It's not like a lot of big guys.

2552
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:17.390
They drop off later in the fight and you see them leaning on each other more,

2553
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.620
taking more time in between exchanges,

2554
01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:19.831
you know,

2555
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:21.420
trying to pace themselves out,

2556
01:04:21.421 --> 01:04:22.890
trying to restore that energy.

2557
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:27.570
You've got that energy in the 12th round and part of that might be because

2558
01:04:27.571 --> 01:04:31.530
you're walking around to 12 to 15 and you fighting two oh nine,

2559
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:32.340
it might,

2560
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:36.510
that might be up a real big positive because obviously the power is not an

2561
01:04:36.511 --> 01:04:37.080
issue.

2562
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.700
So why else would you want any weight?

2563
01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:39.891
<v 1>You know,</v>

2564
01:04:39.891 --> 01:04:40.724
uh,

2565
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:41.833
like I was telling him about,

2566
01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.673
you know,

2567
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.140
some of my team want to see it.

2568
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:50.060
They want to see cer certain adjustments or whatever and they know,

2569
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.180
they know that I'm only going to do what I want to do,

2570
01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:53.811
you know,

2571
01:04:53.811 --> 01:04:56.130
they know they can't make me a forced me to do then.

2572
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.460
But I am a team player though.

2573
01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.473
You know what I'm saying?

2574
01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:04.340
I am a type of person that if everybody in agreeance on something,

2575
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.020
no matter how I feel about it,

2576
01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:06.741
I'm like,

2577
01:05:06.741 --> 01:05:07.574
all right,

2578
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.690
because we are a team.

2579
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:09.650
We always been this way.

2580
01:05:09.651 --> 01:05:11.150
Like with my team,

2581
01:05:11.151 --> 01:05:11.600
I got,

2582
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.740
I got a great team,

2583
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:13.603
you know,

2584
01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:16.820
we never leave a discussion with dollar.

2585
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.610
We just never do.

2586
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:19.690
You know,

2587
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:20.740
no matter what it is,

2588
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:22.750
we always come to a green some something.

2589
01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.700
And with this situation I told them,

2590
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:25.031
I like,

2591
01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:25.864
all right,

2592
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.430
I'm gonna try to,

2593
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:28.210
what do they want?

2594
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.230
How much they want you to gain.

2595
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.910
They haven't said how much they want you to put some way,

2596
01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:33.940
put some weight on.

2597
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:34.601
And I told him,

2598
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:39.340
your strength and conditioning coach is this your boss management and stuff like

2599
01:05:39.341 --> 01:05:39.491
that.

2600
01:05:39.491 --> 01:05:39.671
Yeah.

2601
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:40.780
Everybody in the grants.

2602
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:41.980
So you know,

2603
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:42.701
I could use to say,

2604
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:43.021
Nah,

2605
01:05:43.021 --> 01:05:44.440
I ain't doing this and my power,

2606
01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:44.830
you know,

2607
01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:45.663
you know,

2608
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:46.540
which I've said before,

2609
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:46.871
I like,

2610
01:05:46.871 --> 01:05:49.290
well I really don't need to wait.

2611
01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.060
It's just like what you were just describing.

2612
01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:51.341
I like,

2613
01:05:51.341 --> 01:05:52.450
I was saying the same thing.

2614
01:05:52.451 --> 01:05:53.284
I mean my,

2615
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:56.860
I got power and I got true power and,

2616
01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:57.100
um,

2617
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.620
but I just started thinking,

2618
01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:00.454
I'm like,

2619
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:02.290
I'm a team player as well,

2620
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:02.741
you know,

2621
01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:03.850
I'm never feel like,

2622
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.790
although I'm the fighter that's going to be in the ring,

2623
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:07.760
they not going to be fighting.

2624
01:06:07.761 --> 01:06:08.730
But we were a team.

2625
01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.230
I'm a team sport.

2626
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:11.571
So how much,

2627
01:06:11.571 --> 01:06:13.990
I mean I'm a team player and you know,

2628
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.340
they have you doing weightlifting.

2629
01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:16.511
Yeah.

2630
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:17.960
We're going to do the weight lifting.

2631
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.600
What are you doing it for this camp?

2632
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:20.860
Most definitely.

2633
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.693
What kinds of stuff?

2634
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.720
We live for strength,

2635
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.420
so we do a lot of stuff lifting for strips,

2636
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.021
cleans,

2637
01:06:26.021 --> 01:06:27.700
that kind of stuff all at the ropes,

2638
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:28.440
you know,

2639
01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.250
um,

2640
01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:30.083
pull ups,

2641
01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.210
different things like that.

2642
01:06:31.211 --> 01:06:31.451
But,

2643
01:06:31.451 --> 01:06:31.920
um,

2644
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.250
I'm going to go back to,

2645
01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:33.880
uh,

2646
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.580
not only lifting for strength but for balance as well too.

2647
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:37.391
You know,

2648
01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:40.090
we used to do a lot of things with the balance ball and different ways with the

2649
01:06:40.091 --> 01:06:40.924
balance ball.

2650
01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.760
There's a lot of stuff with the man's ball.

2651
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.020
Um,

2652
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.060
I used to have this training that I loved.

2653
01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.140
You know,

2654
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.120
he was amazing what happened to him

2655
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.360
when I had my title fight.

2656
01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:53.603
You know,

2657
01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.110
I think he started listening to people,

2658
01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.273
you know,

2659
01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:58.143
think he should,

2660
01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.340
he saw the potential he taught.

2661
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:01.203
He saw,

2662
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.320
he saw,

2663
01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.260
he saw opportunity where he,

2664
01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:08.440
he felt like he can make a lot of money off of me,

2665
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:09.431
you know,

2666
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:10.480
and it wasn't the case.

2667
01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.190
It's like we wouldn't short cutting him.

2668
01:07:12.191 --> 01:07:13.024
We was,

2669
01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.740
he was getting paid the right amount of money.

2670
01:07:14.741 --> 01:07:16.870
But you know how people don't understand boxing,

2671
01:07:16.871 --> 01:07:19.150
they think it's more intuitive or you can get more.

2672
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.950
He tried to get rich off of me,

2673
01:07:20.951 --> 01:07:21.784
really,

2674
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.130
you know,

2675
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:23.110
off of one client.

2676
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:23.501
I'm like,

2677
01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:23.950
Bro,

2678
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:26.020
it's many of it meant ease of use.

2679
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.881
You know what I'm saying?

2680
01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:28.681
It's very fused.

2681
01:07:28.681 --> 01:07:29.514
I mean,

2682
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.031
you know what I'm saying?

2683
01:07:31.031 --> 01:07:32.370
And it's like we won.

2684
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:33.283
I'm like,

2685
01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.750
I miss him.

2686
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.370
I miss him.

2687
01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:36.203
And,

2688
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.271
but when you,

2689
01:07:37.271 --> 01:07:37.511
when you,

2690
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:37.751
when you,

2691
01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:37.991
when you,

2692
01:07:37.991 --> 01:07:38.800
when you,

2693
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.280
when you look at me like a piece of meat and try to benefit more than what it

2694
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.230
really tried to do,

2695
01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:44.741
then you know,

2696
01:07:44.741 --> 01:07:45.100
you didn't,

2697
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:45.940
you didn't cross me.

2698
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.390
Like you can't be trusted at that point.

2699
01:07:48.391 --> 01:07:49.750
But he had me write,

2700
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:50.681
he used to have me write,

2701
01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:52.090
I loved everything he used to do.

2702
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.870
We still talk about him to this day and we had to move on though,

2703
01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:56.410
you know,

2704
01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:58.850
because we know what his intentions were.

2705
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.540
And just imagine now you let them back in.

2706
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.033
You know,

2707
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:04.690
they may do right then they may not,

2708
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:05.340
you know,

2709
01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.400
you just never know.

2710
01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:07.360
But that is a problem.

2711
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:08.440
Once you have conflict,

2712
01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:13.530
once you started having conflict and you continue to have conflict escalates and

2713
01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.190
then people always do think that they're worth more.

2714
01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:18.140
Now is it,

2715
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.093
say it though,

2716
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:20.263
because I'll toggle my,

2717
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.550
he used to have me write everything.

2718
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.830
Oh Man.

2719
01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.090
<v 2>This is a thing that I think that there's a lot of good trainers out there.</v>

2720
01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.680
All you have to do is you kind of explain what the guy was doing and how he was

2721
01:08:34.681 --> 01:08:35.281
setting it up.

2722
01:08:35.281 --> 01:08:36.300
And you'll find a guy,

2723
01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:39.930
especially when you consider all the d mean it's not just for boxing,

2724
01:08:39.931 --> 01:08:44.931
but there's so many guys that do that for pro sports and now they're adapting to

2725
01:08:44.941 --> 01:08:46.440
boxing and MMA scene.

2726
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:47.430
A lot of this as well.

2727
01:08:47.431 --> 01:08:51.600
You're seeing all these guys who are organizing these programs that,

2728
01:08:51.601 --> 01:08:51.781
you know,

2729
01:08:51.781 --> 01:08:56.580
they might've been doing NFL or NBA now instead they're doing it for boxing for

2730
01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:57.410
Ellie Mae.

2731
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.640
Yeah.

2732
01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:57.941
<v 1>It's a,</v>

2733
01:08:57.941 --> 01:08:59.080
it's a lot of things that,

2734
01:08:59.170 --> 01:08:59.980
um,

2735
01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.400
in strength training that,

2736
01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:07.510
that we do is a lot of things that we didn't do because,

2737
01:09:07.570 --> 01:09:08.230
you know,

2738
01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:09.550
I'm getting away with a lot of things.

2739
01:09:09.551 --> 01:09:11.860
There's a lot of things in training that I,

2740
01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:15.760
that we does that a lot of fighter just don't do.

2741
01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:15.971
Like,

2742
01:09:15.971 --> 01:09:16.631
you know what I'm saying?

2743
01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:17.890
It's like the,

2744
01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.790
you know,

2745
01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:20.110
most of them when I go in,

2746
01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.213
I'm hitting,

2747
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.031
you know,

2748
01:09:22.031 --> 01:09:24.090
when I have account is mostly just a,

2749
01:09:24.091 --> 01:09:25.600
I'm hitting the speed,

2750
01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:26.140
uh,

2751
01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:26.973
hitting the Mitts,

2752
01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:27.711
you know,

2753
01:09:27.711 --> 01:09:29.920
hitting the mitts and going over different things.

2754
01:09:30.190 --> 01:09:32.220
I barely go in and hit speed bad.

2755
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:34.270
I definitely don't do no jump roads,

2756
01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.553
you know,

2757
01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.540
sometime hit the heavy bags,

2758
01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:38.403
you know what I'm saying?

2759
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:39.590
Because of the,

2760
01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.750
the power that I have is certain thing we trying to get coordination down and

2761
01:09:43.751 --> 01:09:44.584
timing.

2762
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.513
You know what I mean?

2763
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:46.900
Because I know if I hit any man,

2764
01:09:46.901 --> 01:09:47.734
they're going to sleep.

2765
01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.431
You know what I mean?

2766
01:09:48.431 --> 01:09:50.220
We know this and I'm,

2767
01:09:50.221 --> 01:09:51.630
this is just a lot of things that,

2768
01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:52.420
that I just,

2769
01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.150
I didn't do because I'm getting away with it and I'm still,

2770
01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:56.290
I still get away with it,

2771
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:57.183
you know what I mean?

2772
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:59.800
But at this point in time in my career,

2773
01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:02.410
now we have the world attention.

2774
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:03.431
You know,

2775
01:10:03.431 --> 01:10:04.270
I want a better me,

2776
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:05.081
I want a new me.

2777
01:10:05.081 --> 01:10:06.280
It's a new Deontae coming,

2778
01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:07.451
you know,

2779
01:10:07.451 --> 01:10:07.831
and uh,

2780
01:10:07.831 --> 01:10:09.220
I'm so serious about it.

2781
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:12.190
That's why when my team talk about certain things,

2782
01:10:12.191 --> 01:10:12.530
I'm like,

2783
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:13.301
I'm down for it.

2784
01:10:13.301 --> 01:10:13.901
Let's make it happen.

2785
01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:14.734
Let's see what happens.

2786
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:16.400
We can at least try you.

2787
01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.340
That's how I can get him the benefit of doubt.

2788
01:10:18.341 --> 01:10:21.070
Although I may feel a certain way because I'm still,

2789
01:10:21.071 --> 01:10:22.240
I'm the one in there fighting.

2790
01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:23.650
But like again,

2791
01:10:23.651 --> 01:10:24.140
like they did,

2792
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.860
we were a team so I at least can get him the benefit of the doubt and,

2793
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:31.080
and put forth an effort and to try.

2794
01:10:31.081 --> 01:10:31.280
And

2795
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.480
<v 2>when you're going through a camp,</v>

2796
01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:32.810
uh,

2797
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:35.630
how many days a week are you doing strength conditioning and are you running in

2798
01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:36.171
the mornings?

2799
01:10:36.171 --> 01:10:36.481
Like how,

2800
01:10:36.481 --> 01:10:37.880
how are you scheduling your workouts?

2801
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.680
<v 1>Um,</v>

2802
01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.210
stress right.

2803
01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:39.410
Is,

2804
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.691
is,

2805
01:10:39.691 --> 01:10:40.900
is three times a week,

2806
01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:42.243
you know,

2807
01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.580
we go light on sparring days because,

2808
01:10:45.581 --> 01:10:45.851
you know,

2809
01:10:45.851 --> 01:10:48.430
I got all these big guys in there and stuff,

2810
01:10:48.431 --> 01:10:50.140
so it needs some strength for sparring.

2811
01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:51.010
Um,

2812
01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:54.640
but we were going three times a Monday,

2813
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:54.670
Wednesdays and Fridays.

2814
01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:57.790
So on sparring days you go light or you go light on sparring,

2815
01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.130
sparring days we go light with the weights,

2816
01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:00.471
life,

2817
01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:01.304
stuff like that.

2818
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.700
<v 2>You have energy for sparring?</v>

2819
01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:03.031
Correct.

2820
01:11:03.031 --> 01:11:03.690
Right.

2821
01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:05.370
And then on days where you're not sparring,

2822
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.240
then you hit it hard.

2823
01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:06.960
Correct.

2824
01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.380
So,

2825
01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:07.621
um,

2826
01:11:07.621 --> 01:11:10.770
so somebody organizes all this stuff for you now when you do strength and

2827
01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:11.191
conditioning,

2828
01:11:11.191 --> 01:11:12.030
are you running as well?

2829
01:11:12.031 --> 01:11:12.410
Well,

2830
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:13.360
<v 1>swimming to did we,</v>

2831
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.130
we don't,

2832
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:15.150
we don't like jogging.

2833
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.140
I don't do my jog and you know,

2834
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.510
we do everything fast.

2835
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.373
We want to,

2836
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:20.310
to,

2837
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:21.143
to act.

2838
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:24.660
We want to activate the fast twitch muscles.

2839
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.381
You know what I'm saying?

2840
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:27.150
We do everything with rapid speed.

2841
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:27.751
If I'm,

2842
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:29.820
if I'm doing anything consist of me moving,

2843
01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:31.790
my feet is spreading and stuff,

2844
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.411
stuff like that.

2845
01:11:32.411 --> 01:11:36.810
And I worry a 45 pound vest on me as well too.

2846
01:11:36.811 --> 01:11:38.970
And all my exercise and everything that I do,

2847
01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:41.590
they have that extra weight on chin,

2848
01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:43.203
ups,

2849
01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:43.980
school,

2850
01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.813
everything,

2851
01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:45.360
everything.

2852
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.700
I used to do that with this training I was talking about,

2853
01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:47.940
you know,

2854
01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:49.440
we used to do everything with this.

2855
01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.630
Do you do plyometrics like that as well?

2856
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:53.543
Not so much.

2857
01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:56.010
I still do every now and again,

2858
01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.060
every now and again,

2859
01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.650
but we're going to do a lot of things.

2860
01:11:58.650 --> 01:11:58.811
We've,

2861
01:11:58.811 --> 01:11:59.000
we've,

2862
01:11:59.000 --> 01:11:59.431
we've been,

2863
01:11:59.431 --> 01:12:00.264
uh,

2864
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:02.040
we fin to enhance it.

2865
01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.360
Or like I said,

2866
01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:03.870
I'm here.

2867
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:08.870
I feel like I'm here and I know just being regular me just doing things that I

2868
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:10.950
would normally would do,

2869
01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.510
gotten me to this point.

2870
01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.560
But now I just feel like I'm on a whole nother level now.

2871
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.753
I just feel like,

2872
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:22.860
like now it's time to apply the things that need to be really done and not the

2873
01:12:22.861 --> 01:12:23.671
things that you know,

2874
01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:24.960
you can do and get away with.

2875
01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.393
You know what I'm saying?

2876
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:28.530
And that's just how I feel at this point in time.

2877
01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:30.200
So come to rematch.

2878
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.980
They will see a new Deontay wilder.

2879
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:32.341
Well,

2880
01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:33.870
that is one of the things that's exciting about it.

2881
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:33.961
You're,

2882
01:12:33.961 --> 01:12:34.441
like I said,

2883
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:36.870
is that if you're an only been boxing for 11 years,

2884
01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:38.940
when you're just starting that really touch your potential,

2885
01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.100
you're still putting combinations together,

2886
01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:43.830
you're still putting your foot work with those combinations and learning the

2887
01:12:43.831 --> 01:12:44.664
moves.

2888
01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:44.970
I mean,

2889
01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:48.810
you're not talking about a guy like Louise or teas who's gone through it,

2890
01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:52.380
just this gigantic amateur career and professional career.

2891
01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:53.640
And he knows what he knows.

2892
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:54.901
He's not learning.

2893
01:12:54.901 --> 01:12:56.310
He's maintaining your learning.

2894
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.910
Yeah,

2895
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:57.743
most definitely.

2896
01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:01.340
It's one of the things that's so exciting about you in this stage of your career

2897
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.240
being an emerging as a star.

2898
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:03.571
Yeah,

2899
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:04.201
most definitely.

2900
01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:04.441
You know,

2901
01:13:04.441 --> 01:13:04.801
just to,

2902
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:05.311
just to learn.

2903
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:06.810
I always said that when a,

2904
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:07.230
when a,

2905
01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:08.100
when a witness,

2906
01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:09.090
nothing else to learn,

2907
01:13:09.091 --> 01:13:10.950
then I don't want to be in this sport.

2908
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.900
I don't want to be a know it all.

2909
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.580
Do you have an exit strategy?

2910
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.750
Do you know when you want to get out?

2911
01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.470
Um,

2912
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:18.240
my goal is to unify the division,

2913
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:19.370
whether it'd be one chapter,

2914
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.831
one face,

2915
01:13:19.831 --> 01:13:20.580
one name,

2916
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:21.510
it'd be the undisputed,

2917
01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:22.231
the undefeated,

2918
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:25.020
the unified heavyweight champion of the world.

2919
01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.600
I want to defend that for a couple of years.

2920
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:31.860
Maybe until I be all the top guys in the division,

2921
01:13:31.861 --> 01:13:32.800
even maybe in the,

2922
01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:33.990
in the second tier.

2923
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:35.850
And then once I complete that,

2924
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:37.110
I'm like,

2925
01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:38.510
I'm done to,

2926
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.600
maybe I got more years.

2927
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:40.681
I say,

2928
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:42.930
I say I have 10 or less,

2929
01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:44.910
but I'm more on the tenure.

2930
01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.320
I'm on the less,

2931
01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:48.840
lesser of the years to anything.

2932
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:50.580
I just want to accomplish my [inaudible] old man.

2933
01:13:50.581 --> 01:13:50.731
And,

2934
01:13:50.731 --> 01:13:51.080
uh,

2935
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:51.510
you are,

2936
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.350
you're 30 now,

2937
01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:56.700
(313) 033-0330 three started at 21.

2938
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:57.833
You know,

2939
01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.290
though too,

2940
01:13:58.290 --> 01:13:59.760
I don't take too much punishment,

2941
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.653
you know what I mean?

2942
01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:01.563
Um,

2943
01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:03.330
that's it.

2944
01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:04.050
I always tell,

2945
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:04.321
you know,

2946
01:14:04.321 --> 01:14:06.270
I got a great team outside of boxing.

2947
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.170
You know,

2948
01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:09.570
one day I will get that phone call and they will say,

2949
01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:10.150
Mr. Wilder,

2950
01:14:10.150 --> 01:14:11.860
you don't have to work no more than your life.

2951
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.240
You know,

2952
01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.373
I built for,

2953
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:16.450
for four generation wealth.

2954
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:20.260
This is not just for the moment in time or you know,

2955
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.360
just right now what I can do,

2956
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.590
it's all for my children and will always be for my children.

2957
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.200
A lot of people can come in with different stories about themselves during this,

2958
01:14:29.201 --> 01:14:29.650
this and this.

2959
01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:31.630
But when they're dealing with your children,

2960
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:32.110
you know,

2961
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:33.940
you always want to see them outgrow you.

2962
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.540
Right.

2963
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:34.931
You know?

2964
01:14:34.931 --> 01:14:36.040
So with that being said,

2965
01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:40.570
they got a long life to live and it's up to me to be able to provide for them so

2966
01:14:40.571 --> 01:14:41.440
they can be able to,

2967
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:42.760
to do what they,

2968
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.511
they need to do.

2969
01:14:43.511 --> 01:14:43.841
I want to,

2970
01:14:43.841 --> 01:14:44.830
I want them to be able to,

2971
01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.900
to do what they need to do,

2972
01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:47.750
but,

2973
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:48.700
but definitely not.

2974
01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:51.690
Do not just sit on the ass where they don't want to have to do Nafta.

2975
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.200
I ain't into that business.

2976
01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:54.253
I,

2977
01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:56.801
man,

2978
01:14:56.801 --> 01:14:58.150
it's always been hard for me.

2979
01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.013
You know what I mean?

2980
01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:02.740
No opportunities that haven't really been given and if it hasn't been the

2981
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:04.870
opportunity to given it's a smaller,

2982
01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:09.400
what I had to create opportunity inside of opportunity is always been like that

2983
01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:10.100
for my life.

2984
01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.590
<v 2>But don't you think that's also part of the reason why you have so much power</v>

2985
01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.150
behind you and not just physical power,

2986
01:15:14.151 --> 01:15:14.721
punching power,

2987
01:15:14.721 --> 01:15:15.700
but determinations?

2988
01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:16.070
Yes.

2989
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:18.230
Because you've had to overcome adversity.

2990
01:15:18.231 --> 01:15:19.970
You've had to push through and that,

2991
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:22.280
that gives you that willpower and most of,

2992
01:15:22.281 --> 01:15:22.820
and then you hit it,

2993
01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.020
you hit the nail right on the head.

2994
01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:25.280
Now,

2995
01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.620
are you a boxing fan outside of your own career?

2996
01:15:27.621 --> 01:15:28.700
Do you enjoy boxing?

2997
01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:29.420
<v 1>I do.</v>

2998
01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:29.721
I do.

2999
01:15:29.721 --> 01:15:33.110
I try to attend as many as twice as I can,

3000
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:34.401
you know,

3001
01:15:34.401 --> 01:15:35.234
um,

3002
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.901
I have,

3003
01:15:35.901 --> 01:15:36.290
uh,

3004
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.561
you know,

3005
01:15:36.561 --> 01:15:39.740
I definitely have a lot of stuff that goes on and tried to get me out there even

3006
01:15:39.741 --> 01:15:40.540
more.

3007
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.150
Um,

3008
01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:41.570
so,

3009
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.170
you know,

3010
01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.020
we definitely be working on the outside of boxes,

3011
01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:44.841
but I'm definitely,

3012
01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:44.990
yeah,

3013
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:46.340
I definitely enjoyed the sport.

3014
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:47.510
Just see all other guys.

3015
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.051
<v 2>Do you,</v>

3016
01:15:48.051 --> 01:15:48.470
um,

3017
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:52.460
when you think about yourself as being this heavyweight who is a,

3018
01:15:52.461 --> 01:15:52.731
you know,

3019
01:15:52.731 --> 01:15:54.050
at the top of the division now,

3020
01:15:54.051 --> 01:15:56.540
and you look at all these younger,

3021
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:57.050
uh,

3022
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:58.070
lighter weight fighters,

3023
01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:58.611
you know,

3024
01:15:58.611 --> 01:15:59.930
like guys like Terrence Crawford,

3025
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.741
Mama Chanko,

3026
01:16:00.741 --> 01:16:03.200
all these really fantastic up and coming fighters.

3027
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:04.011
Do you,

3028
01:16:04.011 --> 01:16:04.400
uh,

3029
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.680
do you try to apply any of this stuff that they do?

3030
01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:07.491
<v 1>No,</v>

3031
01:16:07.491 --> 01:16:08.420
not necessarily.

3032
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:09.011
You know,

3033
01:16:09.011 --> 01:16:09.230
um,

3034
01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:10.700
it's good to look at it and stuff like that,

3035
01:16:10.701 --> 01:16:11.690
but I'm just me,

3036
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.190
I like my style.

3037
01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:14.840
Um,

3038
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:16.243
and you know,

3039
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:17.060
uh,

3040
01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:17.421
I never,

3041
01:16:17.421 --> 01:16:17.811
I never,

3042
01:16:17.811 --> 01:16:18.980
I never looked to see what those,

3043
01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.440
what those God does and tried to apply to,

3044
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:22.783
to my style.

3045
01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:26.410
No,

3046
01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:26.571
no.

3047
01:16:26.571 --> 01:16:27.590
Parents have ways either,

3048
01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.513
you know,

3049
01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.530
my ultimate all time.

3050
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:31.310
Um,

3051
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.551
well,

3052
01:16:31.551 --> 01:16:33.030
my idol is Muhammad Ali,

3053
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.431
you know,

3054
01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:37.040
a love Mohamani and not only just what he did in the inside of the ring,

3055
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.490
you know,

3056
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:39.020
cause he's lost many a times.

3057
01:16:39.021 --> 01:16:39.770
He,

3058
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:40.340
you know,

3059
01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.660
he could predict certain things,

3060
01:16:41.661 --> 01:16:43.760
but then sometimes he petitioned don't come true.

3061
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.090
It was basically what he did on the outside.

3062
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.721
He was,

3063
01:16:47.721 --> 01:16:48.650
he knew who you were.

3064
01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.790
He knew what he represented,

3065
01:16:49.791 --> 01:16:51.200
he knew where he stood for.

3066
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:52.070
And you know,

3067
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:54.380
and that was strong for me because I'm the same way,

3068
01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.101
you know,

3069
01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:56.600
to this day I know who I am.

3070
01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.450
I know what I represent,

3071
01:16:57.451 --> 01:16:58.670
I know what I stand for,

3072
01:16:58.730 --> 01:16:59.300
you know,

3073
01:16:59.300 --> 01:16:59.601
and,

3074
01:16:59.601 --> 01:17:00.230
uh,

3075
01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:04.640
that meant a lot to me just to see him just specially in those times and days to

3076
01:17:04.641 --> 01:17:07.010
be so strong and just paved the way,

3077
01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:07.430
you know,

3078
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:09.790
just like Jack Johnson paid the way from home line of eating,

3079
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:11.000
you know,

3080
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.741
and in Mohammad,

3081
01:17:11.741 --> 01:17:15.020
Ali paid away for us and so forth and so on with all the other great fighters.

3082
01:17:15.670 --> 01:17:15.921
Um,

3083
01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:17.540
but you know,

3084
01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:21.320
we have tried to add certain moves,

3085
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:21.761
you know,

3086
01:17:21.761 --> 01:17:22.310
uh,

3087
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:25.010
Evander Holyfield used to do this year step,

3088
01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:25.670
step back,

3089
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:26.720
like a counter punch.

3090
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:30.470
He had tried to come in on you and then when he gets you to react,

3091
01:17:30.471 --> 01:17:32.210
he has stepped back and tried to come and punch.

3092
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:34.690
We got certain codes that we will,

3093
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:36.440
it's just like baseball or whatever.

3094
01:17:36.441 --> 01:17:38.000
We got certain things that we can say,

3095
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.140
you know,

3096
01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:39.973
um,

3097
01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:44.390
and then I'll know what they saying just so it won't be like,

3098
01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:45.650
it's just regular boxing.

3099
01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:46.761
Do the one,

3100
01:17:46.761 --> 01:17:47.200
two,

3101
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.640
or staying like this because they understand what you're saying.

3102
01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:53.150
But if you lose it in terms like give it nicknames or whatever,

3103
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:53.960
uh,

3104
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.280
we tried to do that or whatever,

3105
01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:56.630
but how bad,

3106
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.690
how beneficial would it be for you to work with different people?

3107
01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:01.490
I don't know.

3108
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.971
I don't know.

3109
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:02.420
I don't,

3110
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.253
um,

3111
01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:04.610
I love my team,

3112
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:05.563
you know what I mean?

3113
01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:06.101
<v 2>Say Ever.</v>

3114
01:18:06.101 --> 01:18:07.210
Not have your team,

3115
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:07.630
right.

3116
01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:07.961
I mean,

3117
01:18:07.961 --> 01:18:09.610
but I feel like a guy like you,

3118
01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:10.660
you have so much talent.

3119
01:18:10.661 --> 01:18:12.370
It would be fascinating to see you just,

3120
01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:13.210
you know,

3121
01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:15.070
take a day with Virgil Hill,

3122
01:18:15.071 --> 01:18:16.150
take your day with this guy.

3123
01:18:16.151 --> 01:18:18.470
Would you get together with different people to see,

3124
01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:22.270
it just seems like you have so much possibility.

3125
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:23.530
There's so much.

3126
01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:27.080
<v 1>My only thing is my own thing with it is that will,</v>

3127
01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.790
would they egos,

3128
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:29.831
you know,

3129
01:18:29.831 --> 01:18:31.210
be able to handle mines,

3130
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:32.780
you know a lot of these trainings.

3131
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.120
How Big Egos,

3132
01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.380
not saying that the the,

3133
01:18:35.381 --> 01:18:35.651
you know,

3134
01:18:35.651 --> 01:18:37.930
not saying that the guys you name have,

3135
01:18:37.931 --> 01:18:38.920
I'm just saying in general,

3136
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:39.831
you know,

3137
01:18:39.831 --> 01:18:43.420
I never worked with none of them but you know when the egos coming together,

3138
01:18:43.421 --> 01:18:44.560
when the train to feel like they,

3139
01:18:44.561 --> 01:18:45.490
you need him,

3140
01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.820
you know what I'm saying and stuff like that then that's when things go wrong.

3141
01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:49.931
You know what I'm saying?

3142
01:18:49.931 --> 01:18:51.580
Cause some trying to do you need me,

3143
01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:52.391
you know,

3144
01:18:52.391 --> 01:18:57.010
they feel like if you don't have them then you know you're not going to be

3145
01:18:57.011 --> 01:18:57.671
successful.

3146
01:18:57.671 --> 01:18:57.881
You know,

3147
01:18:57.881 --> 01:18:59.280
cause I didn't have guys coming,

3148
01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.240
you know,

3149
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.320
and with,

3150
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:04.060
because I'm very dominant,

3151
01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:04.810
you know,

3152
01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:06.580
if if I don't see it that way,

3153
01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.773
you know what I'm saying?

3154
01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:08.950
Not saying that,

3155
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:11.530
not saying that I would not do it,

3156
01:19:11.531 --> 01:19:13.780
but I would put my input into,

3157
01:19:13.781 --> 01:19:15.280
I'm not a type of person that just,

3158
01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.740
if I see it some way you see it a certain way.

3159
01:19:17.741 --> 01:19:21.760
If I see it some way then you know I'm not gonna Express,

3160
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:22.480
Eh,

3161
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.090
I'm not that type of part that just going to be quiet and just go along.

3162
01:19:25.091 --> 01:19:26.260
I'm going to suppress my opinion.

3163
01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:27.160
I'm going to tell you like,

3164
01:19:27.161 --> 01:19:27.410
Nah,

3165
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:28.930
this is how I see it as well too.

3166
01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.970
That's why my team is so great.

3167
01:19:30.971 --> 01:19:33.790
Like they can see it and I could see a whole nother way,

3168
01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:35.260
but we put it in together.

3169
01:19:35.261 --> 01:19:37.630
We kind of make it mix where it can work.

3170
01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:38.350
Like all right,

3171
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:40.510
I'm trying this and I see it.

3172
01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:41.201
I could see,

3173
01:19:41.201 --> 01:19:43.210
I could see one thing as well too in the ring,

3174
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:44.021
you know?

3175
01:19:44.021 --> 01:19:45.640
And then we just make it work together.

3176
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.810
<v 2>The things is that you don't have any conflict in your team.</v>

3177
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:50.760
You know how giant that is.

3178
01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:51.351
Like,

3179
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:51.520
Hey,

3180
01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.100
Jake is a fucking distraction.

3181
01:19:53.101 --> 01:19:56.070
When you see fighters that aren't getting along with their coaches or I can

3182
01:19:56.071 --> 01:19:59.010
along with their strength and conditioning trainer or whoever the fuck it is,

3183
01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:00.121
man.

3184
01:20:00.121 --> 01:20:01.950
As soon as you have issues with management,

3185
01:20:01.951 --> 01:20:02.790
you hate your manager.

3186
01:20:02.791 --> 01:20:04.080
I want to get out of my contracts.

3187
01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:06.180
That fucks up so many fighters,

3188
01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:08.970
careers it puts on the sideline for a long time.

3189
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.433
Andre Ward,

3190
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.780
I know so many of them on the sideline for awhile.

3191
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.591
<v 1>Brother Malique,</v>

3192
01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:14.280
Scott,

3193
01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.530
you know there's a cro closest one of my does.

3194
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:21.840
He was a great fighter but because of management and stuff like that,

3195
01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:22.900
he wasted so

3196
01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:23.560
<v 2>many years.</v>

3197
01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:23.980
Yeah,

3198
01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.060
it's very common.

3199
01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:25.931
It's very common.

3200
01:20:25.931 --> 01:20:27.760
So that's the beautiful thing about your arrangement.

3201
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:29.170
You seem to have everything in order.

3202
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.751
<v 1>Right?</v>

3203
01:20:29.751 --> 01:20:30.470
Most definitely.

3204
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.681
You know,

3205
01:20:30.681 --> 01:20:31.640
I've got a great team man.

3206
01:20:31.641 --> 01:20:32.101
You know,

3207
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:32.840
uh,

3208
01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.790
Mark Jay,

3209
01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:34.960
you know,

3210
01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:35.330
no got,

3211
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:37.160
because you know,

3212
01:20:37.161 --> 01:20:37.461
I've got to,

3213
01:20:37.461 --> 01:20:39.270
I've got a great team of guys and um,

3214
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.620
they,

3215
01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.431
they understand,

3216
01:20:40.431 --> 01:20:40.731
you know,

3217
01:20:40.731 --> 01:20:43.100
Jay never been in situation like this,

3218
01:20:43.101 --> 01:20:43.401
you know,

3219
01:20:43.401 --> 01:20:47.600
my long time trainer and I'm the first to come out of Alabama to do certain

3220
01:20:47.601 --> 01:20:48.590
things that I've done.

3221
01:20:48.591 --> 01:20:50.510
So we both have learned on the way,

3222
01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:51.973
you know,

3223
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:54.410
especially being in the spotlight where you got more breathing,

3224
01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:55.311
you know,

3225
01:20:55.311 --> 01:20:56.870
two times welterweight champion,

3226
01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.350
84 Olympic gold medalists talks off.

3227
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:02.030
It's amazing how I can hear him though.

3228
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:03.383
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

3229
01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:07.620
Well it's amazing too that you got mark because mark when he was a welter weight

3230
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:12.630
was a phenomenal knockout artist and similar to you and that he was long and

3231
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:17.631
tall and Mark's always been like a very like even keeled intelligent guy,

3232
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:18.961
you know.

3233
01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:22.140
So it's really interesting to see him make that transition to a trainer and with

3234
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:22.381
you.

3235
01:21:22.381 --> 01:21:23.970
I think that's like a perfect fit.

3236
01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:24.461
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3237
01:21:24.461 --> 01:21:25.120
most definitely.

3238
01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.010
Most w w when you can understand him,

3239
01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:27.400
you know,

3240
01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.390
he talks so soft,

3241
01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:30.130
but you know,

3242
01:21:30.170 --> 01:21:32.560
I'd been with him for a very long time so I could like,

3243
01:21:32.561 --> 01:21:32.771
I could,

3244
01:21:32.771 --> 01:21:34.190
you can be a thousand people in the,

3245
01:21:34.191 --> 01:21:34.931
in the audience.

3246
01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:35.230
I can,

3247
01:21:35.230 --> 01:21:36.063
I can.

3248
01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:36.913
<v 2>Oh,</v>

3249
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:40.460
I remember back in the day,

3250
01:21:40.461 --> 01:21:40.761
man,

3251
01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:41.001
when,

3252
01:21:41.001 --> 01:21:42.230
when mark was in the Olympics,

3253
01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.040
man,

3254
01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.160
I remember watching him fight on ABC wide world of sports.

3255
01:21:46.161 --> 01:21:47.720
I remember when he fought Marlin's starling.

3256
01:21:47.721 --> 01:21:48.560
I remember those days.

3257
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.720
You know,

3258
01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.411
<v 1>he's a great guy.</v>

3259
01:21:50.411 --> 01:21:50.691
You know,

3260
01:21:50.691 --> 01:21:54.190
the one thing about it is just everybody got positive energy,

3261
01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:55.070
you know,

3262
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:56.290
that's big for me.

3263
01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:57.160
It was just like you said,

3264
01:21:57.161 --> 01:21:59.890
like when you get management and stuff you hate,

3265
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:01.510
you hate them or you know,

3266
01:22:01.511 --> 01:22:02.470
don't want to work with them,

3267
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:03.131
you know,

3268
01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:04.000
it'd be it,

3269
01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:08.500
it brings a voice or some type of avoidance in the,

3270
01:22:08.501 --> 01:22:09.131
in the group.

3271
01:22:09.131 --> 01:22:09.791
Like when you,

3272
01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:10.211
you know,

3273
01:22:10.211 --> 01:22:10.991
want to do something,

3274
01:22:10.991 --> 01:22:12.910
you don't love you like you love going to train.

3275
01:22:12.911 --> 01:22:14.770
But because of this certain person,

3276
01:22:14.771 --> 01:22:15.760
you don't want to be there,

3277
01:22:15.761 --> 01:22:16.271
you know,

3278
01:22:16.271 --> 01:22:18.070
it just knock your energy level down.

3279
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.910
Like I said,

3280
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:19.960
I've never dealt with it,

3281
01:22:19.961 --> 01:22:23.650
but I've had friends that have dealt with it before.

3282
01:22:23.651 --> 01:22:24.580
I've had my brother,

3283
01:22:24.581 --> 01:22:26.020
he'd dealt with it before,

3284
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.861
you know,

3285
01:22:26.861 --> 01:22:27.031
and I,

3286
01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:27.670
so I,

3287
01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:29.040
I've seen you know,

3288
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:30.010
firsthand.

3289
01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:31.270
You don't have to go to court and

3290
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:32.731
<v 2>can't do nothing.</v>

3291
01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:34.590
You are on the shelf because of this and like,

3292
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.170
uh,

3293
01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:36.920
over and over and over again.

3294
01:22:36.921 --> 01:22:37.680
Parts the crazy,

3295
01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.481
oh my goodness.

3296
01:22:38.481 --> 01:22:39.180
Lawsuits.

3297
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:39.740
Yes.

3298
01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:44.300
Trying to figure out how you get out of your promotional content outlines a lot

3299
01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:45.080
of guys.

3300
01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:45.270
Yeah.

3301
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:46.340
There's a lot of distractions.

3302
01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.760
Make you not want to train because you'll feel like your career's not going

3303
01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:50.400
nowhere.

3304
01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:50.640
Well,

3305
01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.840
there's somebody that needs guys because that becomes their primary focus

3306
01:22:53.841 --> 01:22:56.420
instead of just getting better and preparing for the next challenge and always

3307
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:58.340
thinking about this legal issue you're going through.

3308
01:22:58.341 --> 01:22:59.174
Exactly.

3309
01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:00.270
Yeah.

3310
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:01.103
No,

3311
01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:01.551
no.

3312
01:23:01.551 --> 01:23:03.020
You're fortunate in that regard.

3313
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:03.410
You know,

3314
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.981
most definitely,

3315
01:23:03.981 --> 01:23:06.280
no matter what people you look up on the mass,

3316
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:07.630
<v 1>because a lot of people like,</v>

3317
01:23:07.631 --> 01:23:09.040
well you need another trainer's it.

3318
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:10.060
But the thing about it,

3319
01:23:10.061 --> 01:23:12.310
you got to look at it and we didn't made it thus far.

3320
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.863
Now,

3321
01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:14.890
what other,

3322
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:18.490
what other guys in this sport is knocking every guy out,

3323
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.473
you know?

3324
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:20.403
Yeah,

3325
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:23.230
definitely making them hit the hit the canvas like me,

3326
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:23.591
you know,

3327
01:23:23.591 --> 01:23:24.790
40 and over 39 k.

3328
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:24.941
Oh,

3329
01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:25.774
that's just not,

3330
01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:26.351
I know,

3331
01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:27.790
I know I got power,

3332
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:28.601
but it still,

3333
01:23:28.601 --> 01:23:29.980
it still takes more than that.

3334
01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:30.971
You know what I mean?

3335
01:23:30.971 --> 01:23:35.020
Just you still gotta be able to throw the JAB and set it up to throw the right

3336
01:23:35.021 --> 01:23:37.690
hand and throw the hook behind that and stuff like that.

3337
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:39.120
I got great trainers,

3338
01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:40.060
especially in mark,

3339
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:40.601
you know,

3340
01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:41.530
he's a great trainer.

3341
01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:44.890
He teaches me as ways to throw the jab in different ways,

3342
01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:45.641
you know?

3343
01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:47.460
Although when I get in there and I,

3344
01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:48.383
I,

3345
01:23:48.930 --> 01:23:51.490
I look at it and I take my own judgment,

3346
01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:54.580
but I also listened to him as well too.

3347
01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.440
And at this point in time,

3348
01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.313
you know,

3349
01:23:57.370 --> 01:23:58.203
it's gonna be,

3350
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:00.430
it's gonna be a lot more listening.

3351
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:05.350
Like I see certain things because one thing I never want to do is if I hear you,

3352
01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:06.520
I see what you're saying,

3353
01:24:06.521 --> 01:24:08.320
but it's not right there at that moment in time.

3354
01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:13.030
And then I started taking what you see and then I wouldn't been getting hit in

3355
01:24:13.031 --> 01:24:14.500
the head or get knocked out.

3356
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:16.720
Now I just never want to say,

3357
01:24:16.721 --> 01:24:17.380
well,

3358
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:18.730
I'll listen to you when you,

3359
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:20.200
you got me put on the ground,

3360
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:21.910
but still listening to myself and getting,

3361
01:24:21.911 --> 01:24:22.631
putting on the ground,

3362
01:24:22.631 --> 01:24:23.464
you know what I mean?

3363
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:24.280
Um,

3364
01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.001
but you know,

3365
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:25.870
I love my guys.

3366
01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:27.220
I love my guys and um,

3367
01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:28.480
I can't wait for this.

3368
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.380
I can't wait for the,

3369
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:30.730
for the get back into the gym.

3370
01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:31.630
It's going to be a new,

3371
01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.040
a new me.

3372
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.540
<v 2>I can't wait to watch the rematch,</v>

3373
01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:35.300
man.

3374
01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.970
It was a phenomenal and,

3375
01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:37.091
uh,

3376
01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:38.380
I really appreciate you coming in here.

3377
01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:39.101
I'm a big fan.

3378
01:24:39.101 --> 01:24:42.250
I was a big fan before that fight and I think the world's a big fan now.

3379
01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:42.911
So,

3380
01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:43.360
uh,

3381
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.141
best of luck to you,

3382
01:24:44.141 --> 01:24:44.570
sir.

3383
01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:45.130
Blessing.

3384
01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:45.963
Thank you so much.

3385
01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.080
Thank you so much.
