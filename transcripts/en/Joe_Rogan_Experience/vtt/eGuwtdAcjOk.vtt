<v Speaker 2>When you look at the back of your book </v>

131
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.500
<v Speaker 2>and it says a worthy successor to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Crighton,</v>

132
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.250
<v Speaker 2>powerful praise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

133
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it awesome,</v>

134
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.360
<v Speaker 2>and someone else has something super </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool about it was like,</v>

135
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

137
00:06:34.051 --> 00:06:39.051
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty bad ass dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said a nocturnals being turned </v>

138
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:42.001
<v Speaker 2>into a TV show right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the process of working on it </v>

139
00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:42.001
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

140
00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.230
<v Speaker 2>How much control do you have as a writer</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that happened?</v>

141
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 4>I've been shocked by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Normally you have very little or no </v>

142
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.941
<v Speaker 4>control at all and a couple of points in</v>
<v Speaker 4>my career I've been very lucky to work </v>

143
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:52.941
<v Speaker 4>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

144
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:55.350
<v Speaker 4>let's get this as close to the vision </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want as possible.</v>

145
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 4>And this is the guy who produced hellboy</v>
<v Speaker 4>in hell boy too.</v>

146
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.150
<v Speaker 4>And the watchman's name's Lloyd Levin </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Lloyd has been.</v>

147
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.120
<v Speaker 4>They've kept me involved at all phases </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>

148
00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:07.950
<v Speaker 4>Right now they're fishing up the pilot </v>
<v Speaker 4>script for it.</v>

149
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 4>So I don't write the pilot script,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

150
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.040
<v Speaker 4>the guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

151
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.110
<v Speaker 4>who are writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it kind of sent me the plot steps.</v>

152
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:17.550
<v Speaker 4>Here's what we want the episode to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

153
00:07:17.551 --> 00:07:22.551
<v Speaker 4>is that sort of match what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at and then because I'm writing </v>

154
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:23.310
<v Speaker 4>the Bible for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're going to look at the 12 episode</v>

155
00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:28.311
<v Speaker 4>arc of the first season and make sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything fits in so we don't have any </v>

156
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:30.630
<v Speaker 4>crazy ending that doesn't make any sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I get to give them feedback.</v>

157
00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:32.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could try these things and it's very</v>

158
00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:33.120
<v Speaker 4>collaborative,</v>

159
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.910
<v Speaker 2>so that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful thing to hear.</v>

160
00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:40.911
<v Speaker 2>I love when you hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most frustrating things </v>

161
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:43.881
<v Speaker 2>to listen to when you hear someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a vision and they tried to express </v>

162
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:48.411
<v Speaker 2>this vision to these other people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the money and the people with the </v>

163
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:48.411
<v Speaker 2>money like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

164
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:48.411
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

165
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:48.411
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got this.</v>

166
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:49.740
<v Speaker 2>We're going to fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need a girl.</v>

167
00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:51.330
<v Speaker 2>You need this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a.</v>

168
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.470
<v Speaker 2>We need to add a black guy.</v>

169
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 4>It works though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the guys who can raise </v>

170
00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 4>$20,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>get to kind of call the shots.</v>

171
00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

172
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.190
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing to see.</v>

173
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told this story before,</v>

174
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.240
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy named Dave,</v>

175
00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his last name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize,</v>

176
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.660
<v Speaker 2>but he was a really funny guy and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>really funny actor.</v>

177
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>It's been in a bunch of movies like real</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the top hilarious guy.</v>

178
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Well he got his first starring role in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and I had a very small part in </v>

179
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.850
<v Speaker 2>this movie and I watched all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in suits.</v>

180
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.670
<v Speaker 2>This man had cuff links on like </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

181
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:28.000
<v Speaker 2>like expensive cufflinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a perfectly tailored,</v>

182
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.060
<v Speaker 2>expensive fucking suit pin stripe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fat rolex with diamonds on it.</v>

183
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy was fucking loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

184
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 2>And he's doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see?</v>

185
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.570
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's giving this guy like line reads,</v>

186
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.550
<v Speaker 2>telling them how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he should do it.</v>

187
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:50.551
<v Speaker 2>Like I want you to come and like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thing that the guy thinks he's </v>

188
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:51.310
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's actually,</v>

189
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 2>he's got so much power and so much money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's.</v>

190
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>He literally is telling</v>

191
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 5>the comedian how to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>

192
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 5>it was a horrific thing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the movie,</v>

193
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 5>the movie was called Frank mccluskey CSI</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that,</v>

194
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 5>but a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible,</v>

195
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 5>and they gutted it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had two ideas.</v>

196
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:14.871
<v Speaker 5>They had one that was going to be a pg </v>
<v Speaker 5>13 and one was going to be pg or almost </v>

197
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 5>going to be armed when they went </v>
<v Speaker 5>wherever they went,</v>

198
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.850
<v Speaker 5>less it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

199
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 5>It was all toilet jokes like you cut </v>
<v Speaker 5>them out,</v>

200
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 5>you have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

201
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 5>It was written.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You stop the people who are good at what</v>

202
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:29.601
<v Speaker 5>they do from doing what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hired them for that purpose in the </v>

203
00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 5>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of counterintuitive,</v>

204
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.260
<v Speaker 5>but you got to think a guy who is such a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad motherfucker that he did the </v>

205
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.260
<v Speaker 5>watchman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he produced the watchman.</v>

206
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.830
<v Speaker 5>That guy knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's.</v>

207
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.650
<v Speaker 5>He's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

208
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 5>it's been great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's such a good movie.</v>

209
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 5>It was an excellent movie and great </v>
<v Speaker 5>source material to start with,</v>

210
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 5>but I'm a huge fan of hellboy when this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When this popped up.</v>

211
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:51.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean I watch helpline like because my </v>
<v Speaker 5>style is super hard science space.</v>

212
00:09:51.671 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 5>We try to make all the bad things </v>
<v Speaker 5>plausible,</v>

213
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 5>so when you get to the nasty bits and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the bloods flying,</v>

214
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 5>you're fully bought in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

215
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:03.531
<v Speaker 5>I know how I know this works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I learned about this in science class </v>

216
00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:03.650
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you go watch hellboy,</v>

217
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.070
<v Speaker 5>which just a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 5>supernatural,</v>

218
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:10.071
<v Speaker 5>but the creature effects in the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything was shot and it was just one </v>

219
00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:13.161
<v Speaker 5>of the most beautiful things I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>seen to look up on the screen and now </v>

220
00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:13.161
<v Speaker 5>that guy's interested in turning this.</v>

221
00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 5>It's like it could not wish for anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>close more closely matched.</v>

222
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 5>Dad's kind of be an amazing feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A perfect combination.</v>

223
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Universe is probably about to send </v>

224
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.400
<v Speaker 5>an asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are way my fault.</v>

225
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 5>Things are going to die and it's my </v>
<v Speaker 5>fault.</v>

226
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

227
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.420
<v Speaker 5>That must be very comforting to know </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you've got a.</v>

228
00:10:31.421 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 5>A guy that's willing to listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had the first book infected.</v>

229
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.820
<v Speaker 5>That was a whirlwind because I started </v>
<v Speaker 5>out giving all my books,</v>

230
00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 5>always free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Audiobooks,</v>

231
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 5>recorded myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shot was podcast giveaways,</v>

232
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.050

<v Speaker 5>audience because I couldn't get anybody </v>

233
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 5>New York to pay attention because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>

234
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know if your horror,</v>

00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 5>we don't know if your Psi Phi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know if you're thriller.</v>

236
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:54.741
<v Speaker 5>We didn't know if you're military.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these different ass kickings genres </v>

237
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:54.741
<v Speaker 5>coming together so I couldn't get a book</v>
<v Speaker 5>deal.</v>

238
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 5>Start giving the books away for free,</v>
<v Speaker 5>build up an audience,</v>

239
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.690
<v Speaker 5>landed a print deal with random house </v>
<v Speaker 5>for infected and part of that deal is </v>

240
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 5>immediately optioned by rogue pictures </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a movie and that's the last I heard </v>

241
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 5>it for like two years and I got to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>down and have a couple of meetings with,</v>

242
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with some people but scriptwriter and </v>

243
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.521
<v Speaker 5>never got to meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never got to see the script and </v>

244
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:19.631
<v Speaker 5>immediately just kind of went off into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the weeds and nothing ever came out of </v>

245
00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:22.701
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is pretty exciting so far to to </v>

246
00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:22.701
<v Speaker 5>see things progressing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

247
00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all I really don't.</v>

248
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an awesome thing to hear when </v>

249
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 5>things are just falling into place in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the proper order.</v>

250
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 5>Now when you write a book and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna,</v>

251
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.330
<v Speaker 5>have your book turned into a television </v>
<v Speaker 5>series and you're sort of giving up,</v>

252
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your ideas to other people.</v>

253
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:41.370
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how does that feel?</v>

254
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 5>Is that a strange feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what does,</v>

255
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.560
<v Speaker 5>what does that like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

256
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 5>this the second time around for me for </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing this and it is.</v>

257
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.730
<v Speaker 5>It's a little bit strange,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but largely it's very exciting because </v>

258
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:53.730
<v Speaker 5>what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do.</v>

259
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm not the guy</v>

260
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 4>with the Rolex who's trying to control </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

261
00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who can paste this out for a </v>

262
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.200
<v Speaker 4>one hour television show and can kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>visualize the twelfth episode arc and </v>

263
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.821
<v Speaker 4>then get someone to pay for it and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>it shot correctly and get up on a </v>

264
00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:08.821
<v Speaker 4>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a skill set.</v>

265
00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't have it all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's really.</v>

266
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm giving up a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but largely it's exciting.</v>

267
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Like I want to see the shit in this book</v>
<v Speaker 4>on TV.</v>

268
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:17.490
<v Speaker 4>I want to see it on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a.</v>

269
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 4>it's really not that nerve racking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

270
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 4>You have no idea how it's gonna turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

271
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.940
<v Speaker 4>but at this point in my career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see that I realized that the end </v>

272
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.320
<v Speaker 4>product,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have a tiny amount of </v>

273
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:31.320
<v Speaker 4>control on it and you just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hoping for the best.</v>

274
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.801
<v Speaker 4>You hope these guys got the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got the right vibe and they're </v>

275
00:12:34.801 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 4>going to want to put something as kick </v>
<v Speaker 4>ass on the screen is in the book.</v>

276
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be a very,</v>

277
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 1>very interesting process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish you luck with that.</v>

278
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.050
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a fascinating journey.</v>

279
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And tell us what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the plot of the,</v>

280
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and a summary.</v>

281
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Not Turtle is a it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a kind of a throwback to eighties </v>

282
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.511
<v Speaker 4>buddy cop movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I grew up on know the whole trading </v>

283
00:12:57.511 --> 00:13:02.191
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beverly Hills cop 48 hours on that huge </v>

284
00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 4>turn turn and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

285
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:07.711
<v Speaker 4>just love that genre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this starts out as sort of a buddy </v>

286
00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 4>cop procedural where there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

287
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 4>Brian clouser and Pooky Chang to San </v>
<v Speaker 4>Francisco homicide inspectors.</v>

288
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.840
<v Speaker 4>And Brian's having these really nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nasty dreams about killing people,</v>

289
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.140
<v Speaker 4>and early on in the book they go to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>site and the murder scene matches his </v>

290
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.311
<v Speaker 4>dream exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And suspicion falls on him immediately </v>

291
00:13:26.311 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 4>that he's doing these borderline </v>
<v Speaker 4>superhuman things to go shred people and</v>

292
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 4>body parts all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it,</v>

293
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:37.110
<v Speaker 4>it turns into the procedural from there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kind of have to follow the rabbit </v>

294
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.030
<v Speaker 4>trail and it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

295
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to.</v>

296
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:41.940
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to summarize it without giving</v>
<v Speaker 4>a spoiling it,</v>

297
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets kind of paranormal,</v>

298
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 4>not really the supernatural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a rational explanation for </v>

299
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.770
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they uncover this massive conspiracy</v>

300
00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 4>within the police department.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been a coverup that's been going</v>

301
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:56.250
<v Speaker 4>on for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for 200 years to stop this,</v>

302
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 4>to let this particular group of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are sacrificing innocence,</v>

303
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:05.250
<v Speaker 4>let them continue to sacrifice Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you gotta figure out how to shut </v>

304
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:05.250
<v Speaker 4>that down and stay alive.</v>

305
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

306
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 1>That's some deep conspiratorial shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

307
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred years of people keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mouth shut.</v>

308
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

309
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:11.720
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

310
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.730
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it plays off of the police department </v>

311
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.400
<v Speaker 4>and one is as researching this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the phrases that came up,</v>

312
00:14:17.401 --> 00:14:22.401
<v Speaker 4>like the biggest gang in New York is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cops and that goes back to when they </v>

313
00:14:22.401 --> 00:14:23.850
<v Speaker 4>first put in the police department and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they start to get a lot of power.</v>

314
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.970
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the organized crime and the gangs were,</v>

315
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.040
<v Speaker 4>you can get away with a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of stuff,</v>

316
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.890
<v Speaker 4>but at some point if you crossed the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cops,</v>

317
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:33.810
<v Speaker 4>whether they be good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cops are corrupt cops,</v>

318
00:14:33.811 --> 00:14:38.811
<v Speaker 4>you were screwed because you just had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>level of power you couldn't match so </v>

319
00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:42.441
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're the ones who have been </v>

320
00:14:42.441 --> 00:14:43.791
<v Speaker 4>keeping this thing quiet because there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are a pattern of serial killers in San </v>

321
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Francisco and this other organization </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a way of getting rid of the serial </v>

322
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.580
<v Speaker 4>killers when the cops can't even find </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

323
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.700
<v Speaker 4>So the cops were actually trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep,</v>

324
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 4>keep this quiet and protect it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end result is more people live in </v>

325
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.530
<v Speaker 4>less people die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's completely illegal as hell.</v>

326
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.720
<v Speaker 1>When you write a book like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>

327
00:15:00.721 --> 00:15:04.830
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at human corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cop corruption,</v>

328
00:15:04.831 --> 00:15:09.831
<v Speaker 1>how much did you investigate the Jew go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at actual cases to find out </v>

329
00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:12.840
<v Speaker 1>what's plausible or do you just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely on your instincts and what,</v>

330
00:15:12.841 --> 00:15:14.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by general information.</v>

331
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.890
<v Speaker 4>There's a significant amount of research</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

332
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 4>but it's broad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

333
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 4>it's not deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's broad research.</v>

334
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:26.201
<v Speaker 4>Let's look into what kind of corruption </v>
<v Speaker 4>there has been and how is organized </v>

335
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:30.221
<v Speaker 4>crime set up in San Francisco and </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning a lot of things that way </v>

336
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 4>because fortunately at this point in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing career,</v>

337
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:38.051
<v Speaker 4>I've learned to try and stay away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>diving down the rabbit hole because you </v>

338
00:15:38.051 --> 00:15:41.081
<v Speaker 4>can learn all this incredible amazing </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and then one percent of it </v>

339
00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:43.901
<v Speaker 4>actually makes it into the book and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time you've invested in researching </v>

340
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.290
<v Speaker 4>that for these kind of thriller style </v>
<v Speaker 4>books is time that you.</v>

341
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 4>Did you get nothing out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of,</v>

342
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the superficial stuff learning </v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

343
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

344
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.800
<v Speaker 4>the mafia was run out of San Francisco </v>
<v Speaker 4>and replaced by the tongues and the </v>

345
00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.581
<v Speaker 4>Russians and in a lot of other groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff is super cool and a ton </v>

346
00:16:00.581 --> 00:16:01.430
<v Speaker 4>of that goes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

347
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.510
<v Speaker 4>the police department was pretty helpful</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

348
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 4>in research for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a it,</v>

349
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:12.100
<v Speaker 4>it's not your typical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are dirty cops and they're going </v>

350
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:12.290
<v Speaker 4>to shake you down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually are trying to do something</v>

351
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:17.291
<v Speaker 4>that benefits the greater good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have to totally ignore the law </v>

352
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 4>they're sworn to protect in order to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>the end result.</v>

353
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.290
<v Speaker 4>So it's a bit more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Corruption,</v>

354
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 4>if you can imagine that.</v>

355
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

356
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:27.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fascinating subject and I've </v>

357
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.581
<v Speaker 1>always been fascinated by like the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of secret societies that have been </v>

358
00:16:30.581 --> 00:16:33.110
<v Speaker 1>around for 200 years doing horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and pulling it off.</v>

359
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.060
<v Speaker 1>And usually you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:38.610
<v Speaker 1>even in jest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one takes those things serious.</v>

361
00:16:38.611 --> 00:16:39.230
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:41.300
<v Speaker 1>discuss skull and bones or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

363
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Real police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking fraternity.</v>

364
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 1>They do fall off there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no big deal.</v>

365
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that good stuff.</v>

366
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

367
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the idea of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a constantly fascinating source for</v>

368
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:54.500
<v Speaker 1>people because every now and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find one that's real.</v>

369
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then you find a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Jerry Sandusky case where no one </v>

370
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.180
<v Speaker 1>really did tell the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for 20 years of trauma lasting,</v>

371
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 1>it really did happen and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

372
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 1>like these things can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the Miami.</v>

373
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see Billy Corbin's </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary cocaine cowboys for cocaine </v>

374
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:17.201
<v Speaker 1>cowboys won and cocaine cowboys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two or two of my favorite documentaries </v>

375
00:17:17.201 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing.</v>

376
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

377
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Billy Corbin who directed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he pulled out was that</v>

378
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.000
<v Speaker 1>there was one year where the mind police</v>
<v Speaker 1>departments,</v>

379
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 1>a graduating class from the police </v>
<v Speaker 1>academy,</v>

380
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:35.050
<v Speaker 1>half of them eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them either wound up in jail or </v>

381
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.470
<v Speaker 1>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

382
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.520
<v Speaker 1>For like half of them were murdered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of them went to jail.</v>

383
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was like a crazy </v>

384
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.271
<v Speaker 1>criminal organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the entire police force was </v>

385
00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 1>massively corrupt in the cocaine</v>

386
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 5>era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's when,</v>

387
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you go to Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you ever been.</v>

388
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never been to Miami.</v>

389
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's avoidable Ed.</v>

390
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 5>It's not totally necessary amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>money involved.</v>

391
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:04.191
<v Speaker 5>Back then it was just astronomical and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know somebody's going to bite on </v>

392
00:18:04.191 --> 00:18:04.410
<v Speaker 5>that sooner or later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The amount of banks there,</v>

393
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.470
<v Speaker 5>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The per capita there are much higher </v>

394
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.760
<v Speaker 5>than anywhere else because they were all</v>
<v Speaker 5>laundering cocaine.</v>

395
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 5>Money for real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's really the root of it all.</v>

396
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:14.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

397
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 5>the actual impact that cocaine had on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the economy of Miami is undeniable.</v>

398
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 5>But this guy wrote about how crazy the </v>
<v Speaker 5>police corruption was.</v>

399
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:26.350
<v Speaker 5>Bank debt or rather did this </v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary,</v>

400
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 5>showed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so it's possible,</v>

401
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can go off the rails.</v>

402
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.320
<v Speaker 5>That was just a couple of decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

403
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:37.510
<v Speaker 5>where you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got the money and you've got the </v>

404
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.060
<v Speaker 5>power and they're isolated from a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the self examination.</v>

405
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.560
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you.</v>

406
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.720
<v Speaker 5>The question at the upper top levels of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the police department can make a lot of </v>

407
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.330
<v Speaker 5>shit go away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

408
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.360
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the place it seems most likely </v>

409
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.360
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's realistic there.</v>

410
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 5>They had their hands on the drugs or </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands on.</v>

411
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 5>The criminals are hands on the money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If somebody is going to go bad,</v>

412
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Speaker 5>that's a good place to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

413
00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating when you find out that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's true though.</v>

414
00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:58.850
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

415
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 5>corrupt cop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of corrupt cops.</v>

416
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:06.111
<v Speaker 5>Like they tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You almost wonder why it doesn't happen </v>

417
00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:06.111
<v Speaker 5>more often.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It probably does.</v>

418
00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it probably,</v>

419
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 5>they probably pretty good at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>

420
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.210
<v Speaker 5>it's the biggest gang around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you want to piss off the gang,</v>

421
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>plenty of little subtle corruption.</v>

422
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.530
<v Speaker 5>A little bit of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit of the guys who can shoot </v>

423
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:21.530
<v Speaker 5>you and it's legal.</v>

424
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.330
<v Speaker 5>Thank everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Knows at the end of the day.</v>

425
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 5>Really got to be careful around those </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys because it can kill you and it's </v>

426
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're licensed to kill and they can just</v>

427
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:30.410
<v Speaker 5>say you attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

428
00:19:30.411 --> 00:19:35.411
<v Speaker 5>I mean how many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many times we've seen a cell phone </v>

429
00:19:35.411 --> 00:19:37.671
<v Speaker 5>camera of someone videotaping or cop and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cop beat the shit out of the kid.</v>

430
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:38.840
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

431
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.140
<v Speaker 5>you hear from the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

432
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.680
<v Speaker 5>the arrest papers that the police </v>
<v Speaker 5>officer lied,</v>

433
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:48.681
<v Speaker 5>that the kid attacked him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of the kids spit on him or said </v>

434
00:19:48.681 --> 00:19:48.750
<v Speaker 5>something or there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy and Alex Jones recently,</v>

435
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 5>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these cops just,</v>

436
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.860
<v Speaker 5>they have ultimate power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I know if that's a bad thing,</v>

437
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:56.980
<v Speaker 5>whenever any human beings got ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>power over other people and there's the,</v>

438
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.100
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing people I think tend to forget </v>

439
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.610
<v Speaker 5>is there's millions of cuts across the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

440
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.660
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and with that many per sample set that </v>

441
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.401
<v Speaker 5>big and those opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of those individuals or very small </v>

442
00:20:10.401 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 5>percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those individuals are going to take that</v>

443
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:13.560
<v Speaker 5>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them are going to be nuts.</v>

444
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.060
<v Speaker 5>You only hear about those guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear about the 900,</v>

445
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 5>99,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are just,</v>

446
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing their job and willing to take a </v>

447
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 5>bullet for you everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

448
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happens.</v>

449
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And went to like a Christopher Dorner </v>

450
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:27.760
<v Speaker 5>case happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People go,</v>

451
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.460
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

452
00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:32.010
<v Speaker 5>this could be a comp to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did that guy get through?</v>

453
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:37.070
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or what happened to him in overseas and </v>

454
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.070
<v Speaker 5>turned them into that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

455
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.890
<v Speaker 5>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how much of that plays a part of </v>

456
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.471
<v Speaker 5>your writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just sort of in a broad educational </v>

457
00:20:45.471 --> 00:20:48.261
<v Speaker 5>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you just pay attention to all that </v>

458
00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:48.261
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's largely to weave cap,</v>

459
00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 5>history of reality.</v>

460
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean people are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain amount of things </v>

461
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.430
<v Speaker 4>people are expecting from a fictional </v>
<v Speaker 4>novel.</v>

462
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:58.020
<v Speaker 4>Things that feel familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While there's got to be some level of </v>

463
00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 4>corruption is one cops got to be a total</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad ass.</v>

464
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.570
<v Speaker 4>Somebodies going to rub some guys up </v>
<v Speaker 4>just because you're familiar with it.</v>

465
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 4>You've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of those things go into.</v>

466
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.570
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them are invisible in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tend both with the science and with </v>

467
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.191
<v Speaker 4>culture is to put in a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're already familiar with so that </v>

468
00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:14.191
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

469
00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

470
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.010
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

471
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 4>And if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

472
00:21:15.791 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 4>20 or 30 times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I know that I know that.</v>

473
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:23.370
<v Speaker 4>Then when it starts to go up to the next</v>
<v Speaker 4>level where the crazy shit starts to </v>

474
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've already got this rapport.</v>

475
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:28.381
<v Speaker 4>I've already got a rapport with you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your you've allowed yourself to buy in </v>

476
00:21:28.381 --> 00:21:28.900
<v Speaker 4>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So having those elements like,</v>

477
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>realistic police things,</v>

478
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 4>actually using the real history of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mafia and San Francisco,</v>

479
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 4>anything like that allows you to fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>further into the story.</v>

480
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 4>So it's very important to use real stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>and kind of create that illusion.</v>

481
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

482
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always wanted to be a writer in </v>

483
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.570
<v Speaker 2>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had the time,</v>

484
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:48.960
<v Speaker 2>but I've always thought a bad awesome </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to like</v>

485
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.810
<v Speaker 4>carb wrote a terrible script once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we can do that in a way up here.</v>

486
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about starting a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>show called getting my shorts were.</v>

487
00:21:56.981 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 4>I talked to people who like say exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you said,</v>

488
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:05.130
<v Speaker 4>we sound for 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I interviewed about the fiction stuff </v>

489
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:05.130
<v Speaker 4>that you liked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie stuff you like,</v>

490
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.130
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me you think this stupid idea.</v>

491
00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:07.960
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about this and then at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end like,</v>

492
00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:12.961
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well let's throw out some ideas for a </v>

493
00:22:12.961 --> 00:22:14.491
<v Speaker 4>story and I'll help bounce stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and then when we get done you </v>

494
00:22:14.491 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 4>get up and walk away and then like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>week later I've got like a five,</v>

495
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:21.050
<v Speaker 4>10 page short story and then that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of thing that a human,</v>

496
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:26.080
<v Speaker 4>if you're close that joe got naked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds like it would be a fun idea </v>

497
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:32.130
<v Speaker 4>that you get to write a story without </v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual grunt work of getting down in</v>

498
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:34.240
<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You come up with a big idea and then you</v>

499
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 4>turn it over to somebody who does this </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a regular basis.</v>

500
00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:39.220
<v Speaker 4>It's like exactly like taking lessons </v>
<v Speaker 4>for something like here's what I want to</v>

501
00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:44.221
<v Speaker 4>do and wanted to have this and then this</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy in and this chick should get naked </v>

502
00:22:44.221 --> 00:22:46.741
<v Speaker 4>because obviously that's very important </v>
<v Speaker 4>to his story and then this sort of </v>

503
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:46.741
<v Speaker 4>things happening and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

504
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 4>let's go see what we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll go back and look that up.</v>

505
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.250
<v Speaker 2>There's so many fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

506
00:22:50.251 --> 00:22:51.990
<v Speaker 2>There's so many fascinating occupations </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

507
00:22:51.991 --> 00:22:53.280
<v Speaker 2>There's just not enough time in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

508
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.100
<v Speaker 2>but writing has always been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly romantic one.</v>

509
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:01.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the idea of putting together </v>

510
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.880
<v Speaker 2>something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crafting a story entirely in your head,</v>

511
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:07.910
<v Speaker 2>slapping it down on paper and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists entirely in the heads of the </v>

512
00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:07.910
<v Speaker 2>people that are reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

513
00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.240
<v Speaker 4>The romance of it is so utterly </v>
<v Speaker 4>overblown.</v>

514
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I've been lucky enough to do this </v>

515
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 4>full time for five years now it's my </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

516
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 4>All I do is my job and it's similar to </v>
<v Speaker 4>mma.</v>

517
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 4>When you see the guys come in the ring </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

518
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:25.620
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at all this pageantry and all this </v>

519
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:25.620
<v Speaker 4>wonderful stuff and the spotlight's on </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and you know,</v>

520
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.130
<v Speaker 4>except for the ultimate fighter show you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't see.</v>

521
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.030
<v Speaker 4>You don't see the years that go in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just getting crushed and working all the</v>

522
00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:36.031
<v Speaker 4>time and all the sacrifice and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things you got to do and then you get </v>

523
00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:36.031
<v Speaker 4>that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

524
00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Speaker 4>the books in the store and I'm on tour </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that last two weeks,</v>

525
00:23:37.511 --> 00:23:39.730
<v Speaker 4>and then you'd go right back into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dungeon and do it some more.</v>

526
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.100
<v Speaker 4>And it's great fun job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do anything else.</v>

527
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm so happy to be doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

528
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:49.051
<v Speaker 4>those moments of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like little tiny things that pop up </v>

529
00:23:49.051 --> 00:23:49.051
<v Speaker 4>every now and then.</v>

530
00:23:49.051 --> 00:23:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well to everybody outside of it,</v>

531
00:23:50.561 --> 00:23:55.561
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have to do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's romantic or can be </v>

532
00:23:55.561 --> 00:23:58.260
<v Speaker 2>grueling sitting there smoking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette in front of your typewriter.</v>

533
00:23:58.261 --> 00:24:03.261
<v Speaker 2>Like you're a hunter Thompson crap who </v>
<v Speaker 2>your favorite writers when you were a </v>

534
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:03.261
<v Speaker 2>coming up?</v>

535
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:07.360
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely a Stephen King is the single </v>

536
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.761
<v Speaker 4>biggest influence on me watching his </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to tell a story and </v>

537
00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:13.990
<v Speaker 4>characterized and like a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that always mesmerized me </v>

538
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.990
<v Speaker 4>about him is he can take a secondary </v>
<v Speaker 4>character,</v>

539
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.620
<v Speaker 4>give you one paragraph of description,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like here's a vocal twitch,</v>

540
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 4>here's a physical twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here's this thing.</v>

541
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 4>They believe in that you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

542
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:24.890
<v Speaker 4>that guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years later he's the master of that.</v>

543
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then Anne McCaffrey was a huge Scifi</v>

544
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 4>writer that the dragon writers per net </v>
<v Speaker 4>series.</v>

545
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 4>So that was kind of the more of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>science fiction area of things.</v>

546
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.650
<v Speaker 4>And Tom Clancy was another big one too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom Clancy's,</v>

547
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:41.180
<v Speaker 4>the ability to take thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things,</v>

548
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:46.181
<v Speaker 4>research them in detail and kind of put </v>
<v Speaker 4>them all together where they come </v>

549
00:24:46.181 --> 00:24:46.640
<v Speaker 4>together at the end for a super over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>top ending.</v>

550
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Those are probably the biggest three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Jack London's and other gigantic one</v>

551
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:50.360
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

552
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:55.770
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid I read something </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere where they were criticizing </v>

553
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Stephen King's books and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some.</v>

554
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Boston and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Newton,</v>

555
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.710
<v Speaker 2>one of the suburbs of Boston and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a lot of snobby people.</v>

556
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephen King,</v>

557
00:25:08.471 --> 00:25:12.120
<v Speaker 2>like what base writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking that,</v>

558
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you ever criticize a guy?</v>

559
00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.810
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucking prolific.</v>

560
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really fun stuff.</v>

561
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Like how stuffy do you have to be to not</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate a good Stephen King Book?</v>

562
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.200
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

563
00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:30.290
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's on a completely different level </v>

564
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 4>than say the twilight writer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you still run into that today.</v>

565
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.880
<v Speaker 4>50 shades of gray and twilight and these</v>
<v Speaker 4>books come out.</v>

566
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:34.910
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

567
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.990
<v Speaker 4>and they blow up because that resonates </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the end reader and all of this,</v>

568
00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.330
<v Speaker 4>all this pompous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>arrogant bullshit about I'm writing art.</v>

569
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.540
<v Speaker 4>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless your book has sold a 200,</v>

570
00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:47.560
<v Speaker 4>300,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>copies,</v>

571
00:25:47.561 --> 00:25:48.560
<v Speaker 4>no one's gonna remember your name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

572
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:51.250
<v Speaker 4>50 years you're going to be gone unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get your book dusted off somewhere.</v>

573
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.130
<v Speaker 4>So the guys who are actually making </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff that resonates with people,</v>

574
00:25:54.131 --> 00:25:57.940
<v Speaker 4>that makes millions of people extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy to read it again and again,</v>

575
00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.870
<v Speaker 4>and then go see the movies they get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get shat on all the time,</v>

576
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.080
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Stephen King now is getting an </v>

577
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.090
<v Speaker 4>enormous amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's getting as props now from the </v>

578
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:09.090
<v Speaker 4>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

579
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:09.090
<v Speaker 4>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25,</v>

580
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.430
<v Speaker 4>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody was all pissed that this dirty</v>

581
00:26:12.431 --> 00:26:17.431
<v Speaker 4>but kid from Maine came out of nowhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>and is eating all their lunches because </v>

582
00:26:17.431 --> 00:26:18.190
<v Speaker 4>he writes great stories that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>love.</v>

583
00:26:18.191 --> 00:26:19.180
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were pissed.</v>

584
00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:20.800
<v Speaker 4>They wanted those books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So not him.</v>

585
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're crazy.</v>

586
00:26:22.121 --> 00:26:24.760
<v Speaker 2>If you read the shining and tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign an amazing.</v>

587
00:26:24.761 --> 00:26:26.530
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie's Great.</v>

588
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.440
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

589
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:33.690
<v Speaker 2>the TV show didn't really dig that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the movie was that Jack Nicholson </v>

590
00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:34.450
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although very different from the,</v>

591
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.110
<v Speaker 2>from the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the books great.</v>

592
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.200
<v Speaker 4>My favorite book of his is misery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

593
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.150
<v Speaker 4>You go through misery and know and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know he doesn't,</v>

594
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 4>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just with a story</v>

595
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.280
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he actually played with the topography </v>

596
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:49.280
<v Speaker 5>on the page.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you actually read the page,</v>

597
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.750
<v Speaker 5>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the main character has to write this </v>

598
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.750
<v Speaker 5>story for Annie and then they switched </v>
<v Speaker 5>font,</v>

599
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.110
<v Speaker 5>bring in the margin so it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular typewriter page.</v>

600
00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.500
<v Speaker 5>And then as the story's progressing </v>
<v Speaker 5>letter start to fall off of the </v>

601
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.830
<v Speaker 5>typewriter and the farther and it goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>first,</v>

602
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:06.831
<v Speaker 5>it's the end and the eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the ell and as you get towards the </v>

603
00:27:06.831 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 5>end of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not only as Paul's real life story</v>

604
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:11.961
<v Speaker 5>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the fictional stories coming to a </v>

605
00:27:11.961 --> 00:27:13.910
<v Speaker 5>conclusion to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all these scrawled pencil marks </v>

606
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:13.910
<v Speaker 5>in there and just looking at the page </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts,</v>

607
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:18.861
<v Speaker 5>distress you the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it wasn't until like the third time </v>

608
00:27:18.861 --> 00:27:18.861
<v Speaker 5>I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

609
00:27:18.861 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 5>because I read it once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

610
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was killer.</v>

611
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.940
<v Speaker 5>It was killer and read it again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I'm like,</v>

612
00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm reading third time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

613
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:25.020
<v Speaker 5>why am,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why am I so angry?</v>

614
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.120
<v Speaker 5>What is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I stopped and looked at him like,</v>

615
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 5>it's just so even understands the art </v>
<v Speaker 5>form of what vision,</v>

616
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 5>how visually things look on a page,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

617
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is that?</v>

618
00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:38.601
<v Speaker 5>Who's on all sorts of drugs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Back in the day he was on some heavy </v>

619
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 5>duty Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that.</v>

620
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:43.560
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Christine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't even remember writing.</v>

621
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:48.650
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them did or didn't remember </v>

622
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:48.870
<v Speaker 5>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is alive,</v>

623
00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was just fucked up man.</v>

624
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

625
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:55.950
<v Speaker 5>he did a lot of cocaine and smoked a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>

626
00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:01.010
<v Speaker 5>It was fascinating that you said that </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes were one of the things that </v>

627
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.940
<v Speaker 5>he really missed when it came to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

628
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:07.941
<v Speaker 5>the creative process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you talking about that with David </v>

629
00:28:07.941 --> 00:28:07.941
<v Speaker 5>Lee Roth the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That nicotine is such a huge part?</v>

630
00:28:07.941 --> 00:28:08.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Process.</v>

631
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:09.670
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

632
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't partake in it,</v>

633
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:16.971
<v Speaker 5>but there seems to be undeniable proof </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's some sort of a mental </v>

634
00:28:16.971 --> 00:28:19.470
<v Speaker 5>stimulant and it does something to </v>
<v Speaker 5>accelerate thinking or does something to</v>

635
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:24.471
<v Speaker 5>the mind because too many people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like intelligent people at Bertrand </v>

636
00:28:24.471 --> 00:28:28.010
<v Speaker 5>Russell would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't get on a plane if you couldn't </v>

637
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.731
<v Speaker 5>smoke in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if it didn't have room in the </v>

638
00:28:31.731 --> 00:28:31.731
<v Speaker 5>smoking section,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wouldn't get a plant.</v>

639
00:28:31.731 --> 00:28:35.490
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking poor guy was just </v>
<v Speaker 5>attached it to this 10 tobacco tit.</v>

640
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.490
<v Speaker 5>Try some nicotine Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if it,</v>

641
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:43.330
<v Speaker 5>it's just nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it comes out of here and go fuck </v>

642
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.251
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to get me out of that </v>

643
00:28:46.251 --> 00:28:46.251
<v Speaker 5>crazy horse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

644
00:28:46.251 --> 00:28:46.251
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

645
00:28:46.251 --> 00:28:46.630
<v Speaker 5>so many writers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

646
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 5>have been smokers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

647
00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 5>but the thing about Stephen King and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>quit and so he still puts out great </v>

648
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

649
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 5>I think he struggles more.</v>

650
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.710
<v Speaker 5>Do you hear what he does though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Supposedly,</v>

651
00:28:57.711 --> 00:29:02.711
<v Speaker 5>I mean because this is a bit of teams </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he allows himself that one </v>

652
00:29:02.711 --> 00:29:04.360
<v Speaker 5>cigarette every time he finishes a novel</v>
<v Speaker 5>under,</v>

653
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:08.640
<v Speaker 5>he writes so many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No joke is like I wrote 32 novels today.</v>

654
00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's funny.</v>

655
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:17.270
<v Speaker 5>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting that he allows </v>

656
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.891
<v Speaker 5>himself one cigarette a year or so as I </v>
<v Speaker 5>guess he's probably kicking out about a </v>

657
00:29:18.891 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 5>novel a year if not more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just.</v>

658
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.930
<v Speaker 5>He's got a different different style of </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing to when you can,</v>

659
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 5>when you can effortlessly bringing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>supernatural the way he does.</v>

660
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.990
<v Speaker 5>There's not an enormous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>research that's necessary.</v>

661
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:36.010
<v Speaker 5>I know when he wrote the green mile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he researched a lot of things about the </v>

662
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 5>prison system and actual history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it's a modern day go story,</v>

663
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:43.671
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to research anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just sit down and do your thing and </v>

664
00:29:43.671 --> 00:29:43.671
<v Speaker 5>then that</v>

665
00:29:43.671 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 4>allows him to allow him to write a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit faster than a lot of people.</v>

666
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.550
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever read the Tommy knockers?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

667
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 4>I love that one man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got the best,</v>

668
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.210
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best supernatural a scenarios.</v>

669
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:59.590
<v Speaker 4>He comes up with so many different </v>
<v Speaker 4>maximum maximum overdrive.</v>

670
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.630
<v Speaker 4>Did you realize that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

671
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 4>I love that movie and it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm coming to my fifth and final </v>

672
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:11.041
<v Speaker 4>book with Random House and I write these</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard science techno thrillers with the </v>

673
00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:11.550
<v Speaker 4>fuck ton of monsters and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

674
00:30:11.551 --> 00:30:13.900
<v Speaker 4>and super and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a science fiction stuff,</v>

675
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 4>so they always start out normally like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

676
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:18.340
<v Speaker 4>I've seen this before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this the CIA CSI episode.</v>

677
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:21.370
<v Speaker 4>Then things go absolutely haywire and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in for the ride,</v>

678
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:24.660
<v Speaker 4>but I've been kind of Jonesing to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the,</v>

679
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 4>the Stephen King that inspired me when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a kid,</v>

680
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:29.320
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

681
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 4>you can spend so much more time on </v>
<v Speaker 4>character and plot and developing things</v>

682
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:38.970
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have these large structural</v>
<v Speaker 4>organizations like the cops were trying </v>

683
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:38.970
<v Speaker 4>to get.</v>

684
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 4>Like the one I'm writing now is </v>
<v Speaker 4>pandemic.</v>

685
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:44.821
<v Speaker 4>It's the final book and the infected </v>
<v Speaker 4>trilogy and I'm trying to get help on </v>

686
00:30:44.821 --> 00:30:48.241
<v Speaker 4>what it's actually like in the situation</v>
<v Speaker 4>room and the series is taken itself to </v>

687
00:30:48.241 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 4>that level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't follow politics for shit.</v>

688
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 4>I have no fucking idea what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

689
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:52.630
<v Speaker 4>The situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mean the situation room?</v>

690
00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:53.510
<v Speaker 4>The President?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

691
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.310
<v Speaker 4>the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The like the CNN show with Wolf Blitzer,</v>

692
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 4>first buck infected is head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody reads it as read,</v>

693
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Stephen King will see the influences </v>
<v Speaker 4>plain as day because it's largely,</v>

694
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.700
<v Speaker 4>it's a one university of Michigan </v>
<v Speaker 4>linebacker who blew out his knee in the </v>

695
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:08.770
<v Speaker 4>rose bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So never not to go,</v>

696
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:13.830
<v Speaker 4>never got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pro was would have been a number one </v>

697
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.830
<v Speaker 4>draft pick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands down,</v>

698
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.610
<v Speaker 4>but now he works in computer support </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he didn't finish his degree and </v>

699
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:17.610
<v Speaker 4>he can't play ball anymore.</v>

700
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:22.410
<v Speaker 4>So this is giant super dangerous guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a lot of rage issues and works </v>

701
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.030
<v Speaker 4>really hard to control his rage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he gets infected by this,</v>

702
00:31:24.031 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this alien vector,</v>

703
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:30.391
<v Speaker 4>this other thing going on and it turned </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he spends a lot large part of the </v>

704
00:31:30.391 --> 00:31:33.841
<v Speaker 4>book trying to not kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most of that takes place in his </v>

705
00:31:33.841 --> 00:31:35.940
<v Speaker 4>apartment and in the town of Ann Arbor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the Stephen King Angle,</v>

706
00:31:35.941 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 4>which is we're gonna take a small town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can develop this out.</v>

707
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:43.650
<v Speaker 4>I can do whatever I want and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to justify why isn't the swat team </v>

708
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 4>kicking in the door?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all these other things,</v>

709
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.800
<v Speaker 4>so now that I'm writing this complicated</v>
<v Speaker 4>crap,</v>

710
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 4>the situation room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I think that's kind of run its </v>

711
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.191
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get back to the smaller cast </v>

712
00:31:53.191 --> 00:31:55.440
<v Speaker 4>in the smaller towns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in small town Michigan and I </v>

713
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:55.440
<v Speaker 4>think that's why a lot of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>resonated with me.</v>

714
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.940
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a different accent and I want to </v>

715
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.640
<v Speaker 4>for the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would probably try and get back more </v>

716
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:02.640
<v Speaker 4>into that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>

717
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.910
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was amazing that Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 4>King wrote so many books about a writer </v>

718
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:05.910
<v Speaker 4>from Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

719
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like after awhile you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on man,</v>

720
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:11.821
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you've got another book about a </v>

721
00:32:11.821 --> 00:32:12.400
<v Speaker 4>writer from Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Jesus,</v>

722
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.550
<v Speaker 4>I know you want to write a book a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fucking come.</v>

723
00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.750
<v Speaker 4>I can't be a baseball player or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fireman or some shit.</v>

724
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got to be a goddamn writer from.</v>

725
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:27.170
<v Speaker 4>That's why you got into the Green Mile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is about as different than </v>

726
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:27.170
<v Speaker 4>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's written an amazing.</v>

727
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.600
<v Speaker 4>Christine is another one of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>favorites.</v>

728
00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:31.630
<v Speaker 4>Have you read any of his sons work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe?</v>

729
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.470
<v Speaker 4>Joe Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

730
00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:37.471
<v Speaker 4>I've read a horns and have read the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first couple collections,</v>

731
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:42.661
<v Speaker 4>have the lock and key a comic book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what he's becoming most well </v>

732
00:32:42.661 --> 00:32:42.790
<v Speaker 4>known for it.</v>

733
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

734
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the locking key comic book lock </v>

735
00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.170
<v Speaker 4>and key is um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

736
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.640
<v Speaker 4>I forget where the family originates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they wind up moving to a,</v>

737
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mansion they inherit in Rhode Island.</v>

738
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 4>So it's very similar to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forgive me,</v>

739
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 4>lock and key fans by have this strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very similar to old school.</v>

740
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:04.631
<v Speaker 4>Stephen King,</v>
<v Speaker 4>small town family goes moves into this </v>

741
00:33:04.631 --> 00:33:07.331
<v Speaker 4>haunted house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of shining ask and there's a </v>

742
00:33:07.331 --> 00:33:10.781
<v Speaker 4>lot of different keys that will open up </v>
<v Speaker 4>different rooms in the house and the </v>

743
00:33:10.781 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 4>rooms in the house or all these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>paranormal portal type things.</v>

744
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

745
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:13.880
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the artists,</v>

746
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:16.790
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's Gabriel Rodriguez and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they both one eisner awards,</v>

747
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 4>which is the academy award of comic </v>
<v Speaker 4>books for this.</v>

748
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 4>So he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

749
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.300
<v Speaker 4>although obviously he's had an enormous </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of press coverage from being </v>

750
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 4>Stephen King's son and writing core a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ton.</v>

751
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.220
<v Speaker 4>He's also developed this comic book </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing with the Idw is the publisher and </v>

752
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.070
<v Speaker 4>it's an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enormous success.</v>

753
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.910
<v Speaker 4>I read the one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called little yellow,</v>

754
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.380
<v Speaker 4>yellow box or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

755
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to even give away what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>plot is,</v>

756
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.440
<v Speaker 4>but it was great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

757
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:48.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll pull it up.</v>

758
00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 4>The dark tower series is that can the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dark.</v>

759
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.560
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read the first one a lot when it first</v>

760
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:59.561
<v Speaker 4>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all my friends are so addicted to </v>

761
00:33:59.561 --> 00:33:59.561
<v Speaker 4>that series.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you read,</v>

762
00:33:59.561 --> 00:33:59.561
<v Speaker 4>have you followed that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I followed up,</v>

763
00:33:59.561 --> 00:34:02.640
<v Speaker 4>I think through book six and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

764
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a spoiler at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

765
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:08.951
<v Speaker 4>It's 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a point in the series where </v>

766
00:34:08.951 --> 00:34:08.951
<v Speaker 4>Stephen King actually writes himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the series,</v>

767
00:34:08.951 --> 00:34:11.780
<v Speaker 4>so the characters are actually talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>to Stephen King who's going like,</v>

768
00:34:11.781 --> 00:34:13.130
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote you guys.</v>

769
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.330
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

770
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.710
<v Speaker 4>that's just to Metta for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

771
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:16.970
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>

772
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

773
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:22.930
<v Speaker 4>I think the first three dark tower books</v>
<v Speaker 4>are the single best trilogy of,</v>

774
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.140
<v Speaker 4>of any kind anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those three books are just f man,</v>

775
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.990
<v Speaker 4>if he just stopped right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's still a masterpiece.</v>

776
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.460
<v Speaker 4>The series went on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the first three books or there's</v>

777
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.160
<v Speaker 4>never been anything better written in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion,</v>

778
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.390
<v Speaker 4>so it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

779
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a bad motherfucker and still is.</v>

780
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:42.430
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heart shaped box is his heart shaped </v>

781
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:42.430
<v Speaker 4>box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

782
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:42.430

<v Speaker 4>I read that one.</v>

783
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 4>It's about a haunted funded suit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

<v Speaker 4>really good stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's kind of creepy shades of his dad,</v>

786
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.350
<v Speaker 4>but he's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His style is unique.</v>

787
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very much his sort of influence you</v>

<v Speaker 4>A lot of people get into it specifically</v>

794
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:12.620

<v Speaker 4>little bit of that little bit of that in</v>

00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 4>if you read myself closely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see their stuff in the book.</v>

803
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.390
<v Speaker 4>It's just the way it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

804
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:37.391
<v Speaker 4>He was actually a big proponent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reading other guys' stuff to help your </v>

805
00:35:37.391 --> 00:35:37.960
<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

806
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 2>read Stephen King on writing.</v>

807
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great book.</v>

808
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:46.100
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a bible for me because it's </v>

809
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.910
<v Speaker 4>specifically because it gets rid of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of the pomp and circumstance and </v>

810
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.910
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

811
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:50.560
<v Speaker 4>the nose up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

812
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 4>it's so blue collar and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a small town guy like me,</v>

813
00:35:54.991 --> 00:35:59.991
<v Speaker 4>you read that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can read on writing by </v>

814
00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 4>Stephen King and see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop falling in love with yourself.</v>

815
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Stop sucking your own dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pardon the phrase.</v>

816
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 4>You're not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not that great.</v>

817
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:10.011
<v Speaker 4>Just tell the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop putting in words that are going to </v>

818
00:36:10.011 --> 00:36:12.491
<v Speaker 4>make everybody realize how important you</v>
<v Speaker 4>are and just tell your tell your story </v>

819
00:36:12.491 --> 00:36:12.491
<v Speaker 4>and that's like the main jest of it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to,</v>

820
00:36:12.491 --> 00:36:17.360
<v Speaker 4>how to streamline everything and not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a pompous windbag but still tell your </v>

821
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:17.730
<v Speaker 4>great story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>

822
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 4>it really resonated with me</v>

823
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 2>being a pompous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Windbag is a problem and pretty much </v>

824
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 2>everything is.</v>

825
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can everybody,</v>

826
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 4>everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

827
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

828
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.520
<v Speaker 4>when I my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I give away all my books is free</v>

829
00:36:27.521 --> 00:36:32.521
<v Speaker 4>audio books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I play up the pompous windbag that's </v>

830
00:36:32.521 --> 00:36:33.580
<v Speaker 4>like the joke within a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I come on and talk about awesome.</v>

831
00:36:33.581 --> 00:36:35.950
<v Speaker 4>The story is going to be in all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>other stuff and the fans that they,</v>

832
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.630
<v Speaker 4>they eat it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>

833
00:36:37.631 --> 00:36:39.000
<v Speaker 4>That's my shtick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do standup,</v>

834
00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.880
<v Speaker 4>but I can do that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because you're,</v>

835
00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:44.440
<v Speaker 4>you get used to it after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when people get very successful</v>

836
00:36:44.441 --> 00:36:49.060
<v Speaker 4>at something and then they start to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They start to believe their own bullshit</v>

837
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.820
<v Speaker 4>and that's when you start to get that </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy self-importance coming on.</v>

838
00:36:51.821 --> 00:36:54.370
<v Speaker 4>And what the sad thing about that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you start to see people like that,</v>

839
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.620
<v Speaker 4>the majority of their fans are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh god,</v>

840
00:36:56.621 --> 00:36:58.690
<v Speaker 4>he was so awesome back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now look at him.</v>

841
00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

842
00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.230
<v Speaker 2>it happens to a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pressure or something.</v>

843
00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:04.750
<v Speaker 2>The pressure of a success,</v>

844
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.010
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

845
00:37:06.011 --> 00:37:11.011
<v Speaker 4>the success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're surrounded by yes men </v>

846
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:12.490
<v Speaker 4>all the time and nobody's there </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticizing your ideas</v>

847
00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 2>and you're not objective and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't sort of self analyze.</v>

848
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't like to self </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze.</v>

849
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.430
<v Speaker 2>It gets them confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we've all seen the,</v>

850
00:37:21.431 --> 00:37:23.020
<v Speaker 2>the real life pompous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>windbag.</v>

851
00:37:23.021 --> 00:37:24.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's a shocking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

852
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.760
<v Speaker 2>it's so gross to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why it's so gross is </v>

853
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:29.760
<v Speaker 2>because you hope and pray that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>never be that guy.</v>

854
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hope and pray that if the situation </v>

855
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.650
<v Speaker 2>was reversed and you were in his shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you wouldn't be possible.</v>

856
00:37:35.651 --> 00:37:36.460
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't be possible.</v>

857
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.480
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's a lot of you getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ass kicked early in life and just </v>

858
00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.710
<v Speaker 4>failure after failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an enormous amount to be said </v>

859
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.231
<v Speaker 4>for trying things and failing as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to people who like the first thing they </v>

860
00:37:48.231 --> 00:37:50.280
<v Speaker 4>try out of the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge success and then you know,</v>

861
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:55.340
<v Speaker 4>then you haven't developed that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that humble nature of I tried 28 things </v>

862
00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Speaker 4>in 27 of them failed miserably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this one thing,</v>

863
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to get too crazy with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

864
00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're having success.</v>

865
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:00.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

866
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 4>you tend to see that in hollywood and in</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>

867
00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Some people come out of the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that big novel,</v>

868
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.160
<v Speaker 4>it blows up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then after that they don't have much </v>

869
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:10.170
<v Speaker 4>access and they can't figure out what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on because they think they're very</v>

870
00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:12.070
<v Speaker 4>important in this amazingly</v>

871
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:17.090
<v Speaker 2>chicken j changed their own frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're putting out because of their </v>

872
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.500
<v Speaker 2>success and that sabotages them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in that.</v>

873
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the sad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

874
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.700
<v Speaker 2>that's what hamstrings a happens to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many though.</v>

875
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To so many different art forms to music </v>

876
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:27.740
<v Speaker 2>musicians that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

877
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:27.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

878
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:32.890
<v Speaker 2>the guys that are the lead singers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these big bands and they go fucking </v>

879
00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:33.180
<v Speaker 2>loony tunes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The band falls apart and.</v>

880
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

881
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Was it partying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

882
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:36.390
<v Speaker 2>adulation.</v>

883
00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Undulations a serious possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adulation is a big drug.</v>

884
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 4>The scary one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get delusional in that shit.</v>

885
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

886
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.880
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fascinating one for character </v>

887
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:49.880
<v Speaker 4>development though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

888
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:49.880
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

889
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.450
<v Speaker 4>you can play off them anytime you've got</v>
<v Speaker 4>a story where you've got someone in </v>

890
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:58.860
<v Speaker 4>position of power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost impossible to write them </v>

891
00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.070
<v Speaker 4>from here's a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humble person.</v>

892
00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.240
<v Speaker 4>This position of power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're writing About,</v>

893
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:06.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mayor of san francisco isn't the </v>

894
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:06.480
<v Speaker 4>story that the police chief of san </v>
<v Speaker 4>francisco,</v>

895
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.890
<v Speaker 4>it's almost impossible for them to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that position if they're a nice </v>

896
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.741
<v Speaker 4>regular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humble person because at some point in </v>

897
00:39:13.741 --> 00:39:15.811
<v Speaker 4>any political construct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to become cutthroat and you </v>

898
00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:15.811
<v Speaker 4>have to looK at other people as an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

899
00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:18.850
<v Speaker 4>as an obstacle to be removed and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't be humanity involved.</v>

900
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody at the top politics right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

901
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.480
<v Speaker 4>Those are some cutthroat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cutthroat people.</v>

902
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.090
<v Speaker 4>Even baracK obama didn't get worried was</v>
<v Speaker 4>by playing nice,</v>

903
00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:30.091
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you writing a character </v>

904
00:39:30.091 --> 00:39:30.091
<v Speaker 4>about someone in that higher position of</v>
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>

905
00:39:30.091 --> 00:39:31.570
<v Speaker 4>you have to channel some of that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

906
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:36.571
<v Speaker 4>There has to be that level of a self </v>
<v Speaker 4>assuredness all the way up to arrogance </v>

907
00:39:36.571 --> 00:39:38.830
<v Speaker 4>and that dismissive nature as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

908
00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 4>if you're in my way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna tell you probably shouldn't be</v>

909
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:42.940
<v Speaker 4>in my way because not going to go well </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

910
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.950
<v Speaker 4>And then that full on confidence and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they just,</v>

911
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 4>you just get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you crush them then too bad.</v>

912
00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I told you when you start to write a </v>
<v Speaker 4>story,</v>

913
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:54.330
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have like a full idea in your </v>

914
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 4>head before you sit down in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer or do you have like,</v>

915
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 4>I want to write a vampire cop drama.</v>

916
00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 4>Like you mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it that.</v>

917
00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.870
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a bunch of different ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it gives birth in your mind that </v>

918
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:08.670
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It tends to come from several different </v>

919
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:11.191
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watch and I watch as much science tv </v>

920
00:40:11.191 --> 00:40:11.790
<v Speaker 4>as I can and I read up as much as i can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the,</v>

921
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.720
<v Speaker 4>in the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's always something like,</v>

922
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:14.740
<v Speaker 4>oh my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that,</v>

923
00:40:14.741 --> 00:40:16.300
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this creature can do that thing.</v>

924
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:18.030
<v Speaker 4>The water bear can survive in space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

925
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.990
<v Speaker 4>holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that'll stick.</v>

926
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.720
<v Speaker 4>And then at some other point you will </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch something about,</v>

927
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:23.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

928
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:28.170
<v Speaker 4>here's asexual reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're in this particular chemical </v>

929
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:28.170
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that'll stick.</v>

930
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:32.460
<v Speaker 4>And then a couple things stick and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>at some point I'll just be working on </v>

931
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:32.620
<v Speaker 4>something else and four or five things </v>
<v Speaker 4>will come together.</v>

932
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 4>And then that's the center point of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

933
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

934
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:38.080
<v Speaker 4>what if we had creatures that did this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then this happened,</v>

935
00:40:38.081 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Speaker 4>and then they took over the world kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of thing.</v>

936
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:43.090
<v Speaker 4>From there you have to go and hammer out</v>
<v Speaker 4>an outline.</v>

937
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:48.430
<v Speaker 4>I try and hammer out an outline with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny bit of science knowledge that I </v>

938
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm really fortunate again,</v>

939
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:51.640
<v Speaker 4>because of the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started getting people,</v>

940
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.040
<v Speaker 4>scientists emailing me going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

941
00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:59.041
<v Speaker 4>I love what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're really trying to get the science </v>

942
00:40:59.041 --> 00:40:59.041
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fuck this up.</v>

943
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:01.210
<v Speaker 4>So if you get into neurochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again here I'm a phd,</v>

944
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:06.211
<v Speaker 4>give me a call and like these I started </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting all this shit in and now it's </v>

945
00:41:06.211 --> 00:41:06.520
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I've got this battery of people.</v>

946
00:41:06.521 --> 00:41:10.150
<v Speaker 4>I'll do the outline and then I will send</v>
<v Speaker 4>them all the outline and say,</v>

947
00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tear it up.</v>

948
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.520
<v Speaker 4>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shred it,</v>

949
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.630
<v Speaker 4>they shred it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'll come back.</v>

950
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Well you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's some other.</v>

951
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.830
<v Speaker 4>We just found out about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do this.</v>

952
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.110
<v Speaker 4>That is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What an amazing.</v>

953
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:21.030
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

954
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.730
<v Speaker 4>they have a blast with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I restructure my outline,</v>

955
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 4>do a detailed first draft and then we </v>
<v Speaker 4>repeat for people that are listening </v>

956
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 4>right now to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

957
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.190
<v Speaker 4>what's his podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>

958
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 4>what's the name of your podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Podcast.</v>

959
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Just got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's audio books and you can,</v>

960
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:33.990
<v Speaker 4>if you</v>

961
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 5>go to itunes and search for scott </v>
<v Speaker 5>sigler,</v>

962
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 5>s c o,</v>
<v Speaker 5>t t s I g l e r,</v>

963
00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 5>you'll find that and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or scott's lego.com.</v>

964
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.730
<v Speaker 5>We have them there and we've been goIng </v>
<v Speaker 5>on seven years now.</v>

965
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.880
<v Speaker 5>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So every sunday for seven years we put </v>

966
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 5>out an episode,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want you to pull a picture up of those</v>

967
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 5>water bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're also called tardigrades.</v>

968
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:51.950
<v Speaker 5>Tardigrades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

969
00:41:51.951 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can survive in space.</v>

970
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 5>It's so weird when nature is as crazy as</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything you could ever think of.</v>

971
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.220
<v Speaker 5>Fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

972
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.690
<v Speaker 5>And it's just undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there it is.</v>

973
00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 5>Here's a photograph of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a real thing.</v>

974
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.860
<v Speaker 5>That's why the sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

975
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.910
<v Speaker 5>maybe those things fucking great and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're super tiny.</v>

976
00:42:10.911 --> 00:42:15.911
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course my brain immediately looks </v>

977
00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:15.911
<v Speaker 5>this goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

978
00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:16.040
<v Speaker 5>what if that was eight feet long?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's make that thing eight feet long,</v>

979
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 5>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and let's make that hide,</v>

980
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty much bulletproof.</v>

981
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 5>Let's do those two things to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For the folks listening and not watching</v>

982
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:27.580
<v Speaker 5>this thing looks like it looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>giant rhino with like a circular diamond</v>

983
00:42:29.451 --> 00:42:34.451
<v Speaker 5>drill for a mouth flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is the waY it looks like a super </v>

984
00:42:34.451 --> 00:42:38.390
<v Speaker 5>diamond alien fleshlight and the thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a star wars creature.</v>

985
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.920
<v Speaker 5>It also looks like it Has that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a cotton capon or something like </v>

986
00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it doesn't look like it's dude,</v>

987
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:49.241
<v Speaker 5>that thing survives in space so it can </v>
<v Speaker 5>survive in space and the membranes get a</v>

988
00:42:49.821 --> 00:42:51.590
<v Speaker 5>little different when you get down that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that small,</v>

989
00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:56.591
<v Speaker 5>but that's the kind of thing where maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>a graphic artist who does a lot of acid </v>

990
00:42:57.261 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 5>could come up with that maybe shows up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>

991
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's my god.</v>

992
00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:06.851
<v Speaker 5>look at it's fucking mouth for the folks</v>
<v Speaker 5>at home,</v>

993
00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 5>it's literally got a giant shark mouth.</v>

994
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:12.400
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That.</v>

995
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 5>And I see this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to this,</v>

996
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.990
<v Speaker 5>I just realized this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm finishing up a book called pandemic,</v>

997
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.730
<v Speaker 5>which goes infected then contagious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then pandemic and,</v>

998
00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 5>and there's a creature in pandemic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

999
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:28.630
<v Speaker 5>and the mouth is similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I just realized that that's where I </v>

1000
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:32.801
<v Speaker 5>got it from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's been floating in the </v>

1001
00:43:32.801 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Speaker 5>back of my head forever and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually popped out in this book.</v>

1002
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.900
<v Speaker 5>Look at that photo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is insane.</v>

1003
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 5>That is insane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>folks.</v>

1004
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could find them.</v>

1005
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:41.960
<v Speaker 5>They're called either water bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People call them that,</v>

1006
00:43:41.961 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 5>or tardigrades I think is the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 5>name for it.</v>

1007
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 5>And they are the creepiest looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>

1008
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.580
<v Speaker 5>How small are those things there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There a microscopic.</v>

1009
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.820
<v Speaker 5>They're microscopic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're incredibly couple of microns.</v>

1011
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:59.441
<v Speaker 5>I think it's spooky little creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you get in that gives you so </v>

1012
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:06.251
<v Speaker 5>many storytelling possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got a creature that seems </v>

1013
00:44:06.251 --> 00:44:06.251
<v Speaker 5>insignificant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't even see it,</v>

1014
00:44:06.251 --> 00:44:07.850
<v Speaker 5>and yet if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

1015
00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 5>if we suddenly lost her atmosphere for </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever reason or the kennedy,</v>

1016
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 5>the environment changed significantly </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the humans died,</v>

1017
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.870
<v Speaker 5>this thing could still be around and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then this thing could start evolving in </v>

1018
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:22.980
<v Speaker 5>columbia zone may be the universe really</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have a sense of time and just </v>

1019
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.740
<v Speaker 5>sets up these little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1020
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:28.870
<v Speaker 5>extra seeds laying around genetic </v>
<v Speaker 5>material like tardigrades just in case </v>

1021
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 5>you assholes hit that button and nuke </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole planet sideways.</v>

1022
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 2>These little motherfuckers can grow into</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that can survive in a vacuum.</v>

1023
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 4>It would start over real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we got wiped out,</v>

1024
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 4>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would Start over again pretty fast.</v>

1025
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what it would be next.</v>

1026
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Would it be dolphins?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be some sort of.</v>

1027
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.430
<v Speaker 4>They see this is this shit I thinK about</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time for the buck.</v>

1028
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.940
<v Speaker 4>And odds are you're not going to get any</v>
<v Speaker 4>sea creature for a couple of reasons.</v>

1029
00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:54.590
<v Speaker 4>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no hands.</v>

1030
00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.700
<v Speaker 4>There's no tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Use it.</v>

1031
00:44:55.701 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 4>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no fire.</v>

1032
00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:59.720
<v Speaker 4>The two biggest factors that go in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>tool use and fire.</v>

1033
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:04.780
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I think you also are not going </v>

1034
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.911
<v Speaker 4>to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This drives me crazy tO watch a scifi </v>

1035
00:45:06.911 --> 00:45:07.400
<v Speaker 4>shows about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men lion lions don't need to evolve.</v>

1036
00:45:07.401 --> 00:45:12.401
<v Speaker 4>They're an apex predator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no need for them to change </v>

1037
00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:12.401
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the most part,</v>

1038
00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:15.940
<v Speaker 4>it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the little things that have to run </v>

1039
00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:16.190
<v Speaker 4>from everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially with humanity.</v>

1040
00:45:16.191 --> 00:45:21.191
<v Speaker 4>I think as we evolved as the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing was losing the hair and having to </v>

1041
00:45:21.191 --> 00:45:24.581
<v Speaker 4>invent some way to stay warm and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>start to use tools to make clothes and </v>

1042
00:45:24.581 --> 00:45:24.581
<v Speaker 4>tools to hunt.</v>

1043
00:45:24.581 --> 00:45:26.000
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as someThing has to use a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tool and figures that out,</v>

1044
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.470
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the flashpoint.</v>

1045
00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:28.970
<v Speaker 4>From there it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes crazy.</v>

1046
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.570
<v Speaker 4>Why did we lose the hair?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not entirely sure.</v>

1047
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:37.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there wasn't a large need for it in </v>

1048
00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:37.690
<v Speaker 4>a greatly temperate environment like </v>
<v Speaker 4>savannah,</v>

1049
00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.530
<v Speaker 4>africa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the human Body,</v>

1050
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:42.350
<v Speaker 4>all evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's something that you just don't</v>

1051
00:45:42.351 --> 00:45:47.351
<v Speaker 4>need anymore and you're burning calories</v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep that thing going and it takes </v>

1052
00:45:47.351 --> 00:45:51.520
<v Speaker 4>energy to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have success of mutations where </v>

1053
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.580
<v Speaker 4>that thing gets smaller and smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no penalty.</v>

1054
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:57.910
<v Speaker 4>There's no penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh well his hands are this big and he </v>

1055
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:58.370
<v Speaker 4>can't use a spear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to survive that long.</v>

1056
00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.890
<v Speaker 4>But if your ear lobes shrink and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>hear just fine,</v>

1057
00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:01.920
<v Speaker 4>there's no penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this,</v>

1058
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.480
<v Speaker 4>the evolution kind of gets rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff that you don't need.</v>

1059
00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:06.470
<v Speaker 4>It is a</v>

1060
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:11.530
<v Speaker 2>fascinating what you say though about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the intelligent sea creatures never be </v>

1061
00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:13.790
<v Speaker 2>able to get like their physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment to change.</v>

1062
00:46:13.791 --> 00:46:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1063
00:46:14.361 --> 00:46:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>

1064
00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:17.690
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really thought about the no fire</v>

1065
00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:19.260
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they create it?</v>

1066
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:20.960
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't</v>

1067
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:26.400
<v Speaker 4>make fire and refined metal than you are</v>
<v Speaker 4>cut off at the knees as far as what you </v>

1068
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.601
<v Speaker 4>can do from there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And James Cameron played with that in </v>

1069
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:32.410
<v Speaker 4>the abyss with having his intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>water based species.</v>

1070
00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:37.620
<v Speaker 4>But it would be very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult to conceive any way </v>

1071
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.080
<v Speaker 4>you could get that going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's your land based,</v>

1072
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.770
<v Speaker 4>it's got to have hands or appendages </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are ready to become hands.</v>

1073
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:46.990
<v Speaker 4>Couple of basic things so it could </v>
<v Speaker 4>easily start out with some kind of </v>

1074
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.680
<v Speaker 4>primate or some kind of small mammal </v>
<v Speaker 4>right off the bat,</v>

1075
00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.170
<v Speaker 4>but there's also some pretty kick ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>reptiles out there and</v>

1076
00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.910
<v Speaker 6>hurts g you hear about the ukrainian </v>
<v Speaker 6>army has been training.</v>

1077
00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:58.911
<v Speaker 6>Dolphins can use like knives and and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they've been attaching knives and </v>

1078
00:46:58.911 --> 00:47:00.960
<v Speaker 6>pistols to their head and they've </v>
<v Speaker 6>trained them to use them so they can now</v>

1079
00:47:00.961 --> 00:47:03.200
<v Speaker 6>use these knives to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1080
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:08.210
<v Speaker 6>so now that right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this was on the news today that they </v>

1081
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:11.090
<v Speaker 6>lost the dolphins that had the pistols </v>
<v Speaker 6>are the guns on them and they're on the </v>

1082
00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:15.081
<v Speaker 6>loose right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there is these rogue dolphins that </v>

1083
00:47:15.081 --> 00:47:15.680
<v Speaker 6>have guns on them that are just </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrorizing the sea.</v>

1084
00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:17.250
<v Speaker 6>But come on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I swear to god,</v>

1085
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:17.790
<v Speaker 6>it's true.</v>

1086
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.560
<v Speaker 4>Dolphins apparently swam away to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>laid.</v>

1087
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.930
<v Speaker 4>They were out there looking for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason they haven't come back.</v>

1088
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.610
<v Speaker 4>That's why would they come back?</v>

1089
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 6>Guns man guns.</v>

1090
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got guns and they're trying to get </v>

1091
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 4>some things or one of the few creatures </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they murder.</v>

1092
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd kill</v>

1093
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 5>for no other reason than just to kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>and also dolphins rape,</v>

1094
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:37.740
<v Speaker 5>which is messed up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so now you've got these things swimming </v>

1095
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:37.740
<v Speaker 5>around and they're trained to kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>diverse as the problem.</v>

1096
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.810
<v Speaker 5>They're specifically trained to kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>divers,</v>

1097
00:47:38.811 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 5>so I'm going to rape a dolphin saturday </v>
<v Speaker 5>at zero than san diego.</v>

1098
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 5>Dolphins are trained to kill divers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're military.</v>

1099
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Speaker 5>They're trained to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the program.</v>

1100
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:51.050
<v Speaker 5>It's program specific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Diverse or not diverse.</v>

1101
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:56.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure the ukrainian controllers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is inherited from the russian </v>

1102
00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:59.641
<v Speaker 5>program and they would have specific </v>
<v Speaker 5>parameters to train them to go out and </v>

1103
00:47:59.641 --> 00:48:03.091
<v Speaker 5>kill a certain shape or a certain color </v>
<v Speaker 5>or have I fucked up that train dolphins </v>

1104
00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:04.760
<v Speaker 5>to go out and be assassins?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.480
<v Speaker 5>What a douchey move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1106
00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:09.990
<v Speaker 5>these things rule.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dolphins are very creepy though.</v>

1107
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:13.320
<v Speaker 5>Would they kill babies?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They killed the baby of a.</v>

1108
00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 5>When a female it gives birth.</v>

1109
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.860
<v Speaker 5>I think she won't meet with the mail for</v>
<v Speaker 5>several years.</v>

1110
00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.650
<v Speaker 5>So if a male comes along and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>his babies,</v>

1111
00:48:20.651 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 5>he just kills them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1112
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:22.480
<v Speaker 5>get a main.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1113
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.230
<v Speaker 5>it's dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dolphins are gangs there.</v>

1114
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:29.240
<v Speaker 5>The gangsters of the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are not messing around except for </v>

1115
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:29.860
<v Speaker 5>killer whales.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Separate killer whales eat them.</v>

1116
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 5>nobody screws with the killer whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The apex of the apac,</v>

1117
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.270
<v Speaker 5>other than humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've got no.</v>

1118
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 5>They've got no predator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing that hunted.</v>

1119
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:44.840
<v Speaker 5>Killer whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought happy feet was a kind of a </v>

1120
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.181
<v Speaker 5>fascinating monster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Moving sort of away a monster alien </v>

1121
00:48:48.181 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 5>movie because it dealt with the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of living in this,</v>

1122
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>semi-aquatic world.</v>

1123
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:56.650
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden these aliens from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other part of the world from the surface</v>

1124
00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:01.310
<v Speaker 5>come and fuck everything up and kidnap </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and take photographs and shit.</v>

1125
00:49:01.311 --> 00:49:03.100
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really kind of interesting when you</v>

1126
00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:08.101
<v Speaker 5>think about how much life must suck if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you live in the ocean and these crazy </v>

1127
00:49:08.101 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 5>assholes live out above the ocean with </v>
<v Speaker 5>these giant metal machines that they've </v>

1128
00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 5>created a scoop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally scoop life in nets.</v>

1129
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 5>Take your right and just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't give a fuck what they get.</v>

1130
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 5>Dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoops,</v>

1131
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.790
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they get dolphins on purpose.</v>

1132
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:26.820
<v Speaker 5>Imagine what it was like for whales,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are pretty f and intelligent and </v>

1133
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 5>have language for communication and for </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I think 100 million years,</v>

1134
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:33.691
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nobody screws as well because </v>

1135
00:49:33.691 --> 00:49:33.691
<v Speaker 5>you can't because they're gigantic and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just ignore you.</v>

1136
00:49:33.691 --> 00:49:38.281
<v Speaker 5>Then all of a sudden here come these </v>
<v Speaker 5>ships and here come these harpoons and </v>

1137
00:49:38.281 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 5>they're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing they can do.</v>

1138
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:44.580
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's the first guy to try to harpoon a </v>

1139
00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:44.580
<v Speaker 5>whale?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fat guy was a bad motherfucker.</v>

1140
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.430
<v Speaker 5>You gotta think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sets a gangster movie.</v>

1141
00:49:47.431 --> 00:49:49.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1142
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:51.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy's not playing games.</v>

1143
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what I've heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably,</v>

1144
00:49:54.761 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of an ice age thing or a place</v>

1145
00:49:57.941 --> 00:50:02.941
<v Speaker 5>where there's ice so the whales have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>break the ice to come up to breathe and </v>

1146
00:50:02.941 --> 00:50:04.420
<v Speaker 5>a whale breaking through the ice to its </v>
<v Speaker 5>blowhole can get out there.</v>

1147
00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:06.690
<v Speaker 5>You just stabbed that son of a bItch and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1148
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but somebody figured out that's a lot of</v>

1149
00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:10.180
<v Speaker 5>good eaton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1150
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.630
<v Speaker 5>That's harsh life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.710
<v Speaker 5>Harsh life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you get to eat a whale.</v>

1152
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:18.880
<v Speaker 5>The dolphin thing reminds me of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got,</v>

1153
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:24.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of my fans were tweeting today </v>

1154
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:24.350
<v Speaker 5>because that basically the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens in my book,</v>

1155
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:26.800
<v Speaker 5>the gfl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I've got a title fight,</v>

1156
00:50:26.801 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 5>which is what I emailed you</v>

1157
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 4>on to start with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was an mma scifi story.</v>

1158
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.140
<v Speaker 4>And then we have the galactic football </v>
<v Speaker 4>league,</v>

1159
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:38.141
<v Speaker 4>which is young adult series,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's an american profile bullied a </v>

1160
00:50:38.141 --> 00:50:39.460
<v Speaker 4>800 years in the future with aliens </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing the different positions based on</v>

1161
00:50:39.461 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 4>the physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got like 1500 pound lineman,</v>

1162
00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:47.370
<v Speaker 4>you've got receivers and d backs can </v>
<v Speaker 4>jumped 20 feet in the air and it'S this </v>

1163
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:48.260
<v Speaker 4>crazy hodgepodge of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1164
00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 4>intelligent dolphins are part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole thing too.</v>

1165
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:55.430
<v Speaker 4>So it's a that with the neglect of </v>
<v Speaker 4>football league series,</v>

1166
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:56.840
<v Speaker 4>which is the rooKie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the starter,</v>

1167
00:50:56.841 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 4>the allpro in the mvp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the title fight.</v>

1168
00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:05.180
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm one of the few guys is </v>
<v Speaker 4>merging sports and science fiction </v>

1169
00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:07.940
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of time the jock is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>authentic too.</v>

1170
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 4>Science fiction guys don't like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>jocks very much.</v>

1171
00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

1172
00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:12.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that story about?</v>

1173
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:17.180
<v Speaker 4>A title fight is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a classic rocky type story,</v>

1174
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 4>but there is a heavyweight champion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the galaxy and correct the cutter.</v>

1175
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:24.130
<v Speaker 4>And this is octagon full octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's straight out.</v>

1176
00:51:24.131 --> 00:51:27.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge mma champion of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight champ of the galaxy.</v>

1177
00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:28.490
<v Speaker 4>So in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this,</v>

1178
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:31.250
<v Speaker 4>in this universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have korean sigler verse.</v>

1179
00:51:31.251 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to be a combat fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't have any body modifications.</v>

1180
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.840
<v Speaker 4>It has to be all natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's no hydro,</v>

1181
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:41.890
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no hydraulics or no cybernetics or </v>

1182
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.961
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he is of a race called the quiff </v>

1183
00:51:43.961 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 4>which have three cats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a leader,</v>

1184
00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 4>there's a warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a worker,</v>

1185
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:50.141
<v Speaker 4>kind of an insect tile type approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the warriors have these giant bad </v>

1186
00:51:50.141 --> 00:51:53.231
<v Speaker 4>ass things with an extra set of arms and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very mean and very tough and </v>

1187
00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:58.331
<v Speaker 4>they are perennially the champions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then along comes this nasty ass </v>

1188
00:51:58.331 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 4>human fighter named kyle north who comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of a place called the purest nation,</v>

1189
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:03.580
<v Speaker 4>which is in my universe.</v>

1190
00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:08.580
<v Speaker 4>ThiS is the backwater human only world </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they hate all the alien races and </v>

1191
00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:11.621
<v Speaker 4>won't get along with anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're mean and they're nasty and </v>

1192
00:52:11.621 --> 00:52:14.321
<v Speaker 4>this guy's name is kyle north and he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>created by an author named matt wallace </v>

1193
00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:15.830
<v Speaker 4>who co wrote this with me and matt to ex</v>
<v Speaker 4>pro wreStler.</v>

1194
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:20.831
<v Speaker 4>So he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a bad mf and that it's following </v>

1195
00:52:20.831 --> 00:52:22.460
<v Speaker 4>their arcs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human who will do anything to be the</v>

1196
00:52:22.461 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 4>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice his own body,</v>

1197
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:26.210
<v Speaker 4>kill whoever has got to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make any deal.</v>

1198
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 4>And the highly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1199
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:31.580
<v Speaker 4>almost a ronan like the honor honorable </v>
<v Speaker 4>existing champion.</v>

1200
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:36.970
<v Speaker 4>And the two different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two Different mentalities clashed for </v>

1201
00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:40.211
<v Speaker 4>that final championship ring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the second half of the book is </v>

1202
00:52:40.211 --> 00:52:40.211
<v Speaker 4>nothing but the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a brutal fight.</v>

1203
00:52:40.211 --> 00:52:40.980
<v Speaker 4>How big is the human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1204
00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:42.830
<v Speaker 4>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is trying to.</v>

1205
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:47.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to track out the growth of </v>
<v Speaker 4>humans in just the last 50 years in the </v>

1206
00:52:48.051 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 4>nfl in Particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 years ago,</v>

1207
00:52:49.581 --> 00:52:51.950
<v Speaker 4>the average nfl lineman weighed 253 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>

1208
00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:54.230
<v Speaker 4>At 253 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You came to play college ball.</v>

1209
00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Now these guys like the starting opens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the line for the dallas cowboys 50 years</v>

1210
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:00.590
<v Speaker 4>ago could not get a job anywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 4>football,</v>

1211
00:53:00.591 --> 00:53:01.790
<v Speaker 4>probably couldn't even get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scholarship.</v>

1212
00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 4>TheY're just not big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we've seen the average weight go from</v>

1213
00:53:05.421 --> 00:53:07.040
<v Speaker 4>2:53,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere like three,</v>

1214
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:08.180
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>3:15,</v>

1215
00:53:08.181 --> 00:53:10.880
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in that ballpark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not evolution.</v>

1216
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:16.090
<v Speaker 4>That's just better nutrition and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys getting the opportunity and </v>

1217
00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.361
<v Speaker 4>cultivating the big guys because 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years is enough time for evolution to </v>

1218
00:53:19.361 --> 00:53:22.181
<v Speaker 4>kick in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but eight centuries from now you can </v>

1219
00:53:22.181 --> 00:53:24.371
<v Speaker 4>kind of see that progressing out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the main character in the black </v>

1220
00:53:24.371 --> 00:53:24.371
<v Speaker 4>football league name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quintin barnes,</v>

1221
00:53:24.371 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 4>he's a quarterback and he's</v>

1222
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 2>seven feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>380 pounds and he's.</v>

1223
00:53:28.591 --> 00:53:29.160
<v Speaker 2>And theY're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1224
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:30.630
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could play tight end,</v>

1225
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 2>he'd be a small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tight end and then I'll.</v>

1226
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's exponentially larger based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on quarterback to lyman.</v>

1227
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.160
<v Speaker 2>So kyle north I think is a in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bookies.</v>

1228
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 2>He's six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

1229
00:53:39.241 --> 00:53:44.241
<v Speaker 2>three 80 and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the heavyweight champ of the </v>

1230
00:53:44.241 --> 00:53:44.241
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ,</v>

1231
00:53:44.241 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just just cut too,</v>

1232
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 2>because this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is our cover with them.</v>

1233
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.330
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just looks like gay porn,</v>

1234
00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:52.200
<v Speaker 2>so on it does not want to switch that </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1235
00:53:52.201 --> 00:53:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so hard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is he flexing so hard?</v>

1236
00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:01.480
<v Speaker 2>We grabbed the image and we search for </v>
<v Speaker 2>mma fighter and all the image sites and </v>

1237
00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 2>that we had a lot of gay part and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>because all we got like,</v>

1238
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:08.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately and fortunately depending </v>

1239
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.211
<v Speaker 2>on your sexual preference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping to find just some gigantic </v>

1240
00:54:11.211 --> 00:54:13.360
<v Speaker 2>like dan severn type dude and none of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was available for a million inco.</v>

1241
00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:16.200
<v Speaker 2>One of the greateSt of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did have a body,</v>

1242
00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his that looks like a james irvin more </v>

1243
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.640
<v Speaker 2>but even bigger than james or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>james irvin when he was a heavyweight,</v>

1244
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:28.670
<v Speaker 2>he was a very muscular mma fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most guys aren't built like that </v>

1245
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:32.060
<v Speaker 2>because it's either you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme genetics to be built like that </v>

1246
00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.900
<v Speaker 2>or you've got to spend too much time </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights.</v>

1247
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.960
<v Speaker 2>You get more of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you get some really cut zeke's at</v>

1248
00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.890
<v Speaker 2>the middleweights and light heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys together.</v>

1249
00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Not as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1250
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:46.470
<v Speaker 2>the best guys are longer and leaner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the really heavily muscled guys.</v>

1251
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:51.810
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much fuel that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies require.</v>

1252
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a guy like spiders,</v>

1253
00:54:55.081 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 2>spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scott,</v>

1254
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:57.240
<v Speaker 2>you know he's got that cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:54:57.241 --> 00:55:02.241
<v Speaker 2>Anderson silva is a perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think is like the ultimate </v>

1256
00:55:02.241 --> 00:55:05.691
<v Speaker 2>fighter body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally you'll see a guy who's </v>

1257
00:55:05.691 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 2>like really thickly muscled at one 85 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to tell them,</v>

1258
00:55:06.301 --> 00:55:06.840
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1259
00:55:06.841 --> 00:55:08.610
<v Speaker 2>you need to just get rid of all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>

1260
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Just do a aerobics exercises only from </v>
<v Speaker 2>now on.</v>

1261
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 2>You have plenty of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wrestle and kickbox and,</v>

1262
00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.850
<v Speaker 2>and run like a lot and drop some weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1263
00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:20.550
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hindering yourself by having this</v>

1264
00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:22.230
<v Speaker 2>crazy beach body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1265
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:25.290
<v Speaker 2>dee dee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that affects their fighting</v>

1266
00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:27.480
<v Speaker 2>performance to be overly muscle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly.</v>

1267
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not effective.</v>

1268
00:55:29.281 --> 00:55:29.920
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1269
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:32.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like having too much horsepower and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a car where your,</v>

1270
00:55:32.781 --> 00:55:33.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brakes can't.</v>

1271
00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Can they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1272
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:35.960
<v Speaker 2>you rather your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1273
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:39.420
<v Speaker 2>your wheels can't get any traction </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're just spinning your wheels</v>

1274
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.150
<v Speaker 2>and then you run out of gas quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens.</v>

1275
00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:45.660
<v Speaker 2>If you have too much horsepower car and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it happens at a person to.</v>

1276
00:55:45.661 --> 00:55:50.661
<v Speaker 2>If you have an overly muscular body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the resources that requires or </v>

1277
00:55:50.661 --> 00:55:54.710
<v Speaker 2>substantial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to pump blood through all </v>

1278
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.780
<v Speaker 2>these extra tissues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's serious shit.</v>

1279
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of work for your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you should be,</v>

1280
00:55:57.391 --> 00:55:59.430
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be strong,</v>

1281
00:55:59.431 --> 00:56:04.431
<v Speaker 2>but as lean as you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a natural weight close to natural </v>

1282
00:56:04.431 --> 00:56:04.950
<v Speaker 2>weight is great if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>

1283
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:08.060
<v Speaker 2>if you can compete against the larger </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1284
00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

1285
00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:14.550
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been really cool to watch a wc </v>

1286
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:18.060
<v Speaker 2>come in the nma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually getting more weight classes </v>

1287
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:18.060
<v Speaker 2>because I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1288
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:21.911
<v Speaker 2>I wrestled at 1:26</v>
<v Speaker 2>in college and there was nowhere when </v>

1289
00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:25.580
<v Speaker 2>watching mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nowhere to see guys have that </v>

1290
00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.681
<v Speaker 2>size at least until wc came along and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they started to get more of the </v>

1291
00:56:27.681 --> 00:56:27.810
<v Speaker 2>flyweight in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1292
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.790
<v Speaker 2>is the ufc going to continue to expand </v>
<v Speaker 2>all to all the way classes?</v>

1293
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.310
<v Speaker 2>They're thinking about going to 1:15</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1294
00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:36.150
<v Speaker 2>We went to one slash 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yes,</v>

1295
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:41.160
<v Speaker 2>those guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people don't like it because they </v>

1296
00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:47.761
<v Speaker 2>say those fights aren't as exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think for the most technical </v>

1297
00:56:47.761 --> 00:56:50.641
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mighty mouse johnson is one of my </v>

1298
00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:50.641
<v Speaker 2>favorite fighters.</v>

1299
00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Demetrius johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the flyweight champion and people </v>

1300
00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.230
<v Speaker 2>were saying that are the same people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like back in ufc one,</v>

1301
00:56:56.231 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 2>two and three when they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1302
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:00.610
<v Speaker 2>gracie and would be all tied up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

1303
00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:01.690
<v Speaker 2>well this is an exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1304
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.580
<v Speaker 2>it's because you have no idea what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at.</v>

1305
00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:07.840
<v Speaker 2>This is mesmerize dan severn fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>like gracie is mesmerizing to watch.</v>

1306
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I think for some people bigger's better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially americans were such </v>

1307
00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:14.140
<v Speaker 2>knuckleheads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to see the biggest guy and we'll</v>

1308
00:57:14.141 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 2>see the biggest gun in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like John L.</v>

1309
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Sullivan can look any man in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1310
00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:22.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the say like that lick.</v>

1311
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he can't really say </v>

1312
00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:28.650
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I can look any man in this room,</v>

1313
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:29.560
<v Speaker 2>everybody like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1314
00:57:29.561 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1315
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I think I was six and I got in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>at my grandma's house and my grandmother</v>

1316
00:57:34.351 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 2>was german immigrant and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you such a liquid.</v>

1317
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what the hell she was </v>

1318
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.861
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know what's going on </v>

1319
00:57:43.861 --> 00:57:43.861
<v Speaker 2>grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just going to behave from now on</v>

1320
00:57:43.861 --> 00:57:46.300
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to crush it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying threat.</v>

1321
00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

1322
00:57:49.541 --> 00:57:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Old woman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you mean by that.</v>

1323
00:57:51.241 --> 00:57:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Held me down the liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck outta here.</v>

1324
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1325
00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1326
00:57:56.381 --> 00:57:57.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for fighters,</v>

1327
00:57:57.850 --> 00:57:58.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1328
00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:03.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the correct weight class and going in </v>

1329
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:04.150
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fighting a to your,</v>

1330
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:09.151
<v Speaker 2>your optimum weight class can be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between being a successful </v>

1331
00:58:09.151 --> 00:58:12.751
<v Speaker 2>fighter with a championship career and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a guy who never quite rise to the </v>

1332
00:58:12.751 --> 00:58:13.360
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you see an mma,</v>

1333
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:16.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a few guys that are like sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I call tweeners by.</v>

1334
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:17.680
<v Speaker 2>They're not really a 1:50</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber.</v>

1335
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.720
<v Speaker 2>They're really too big for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're really too small for one </v>

1336
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:22.720
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

1337
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few guys like that that are </v>

1338
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:25.440
<v Speaker 2>just like somewhere in the middle there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't be like maybe a one slash</v>

1339
00:58:25.441 --> 00:58:29.470
<v Speaker 2>65 like bj penn fighting crazy given up </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways.</v>

1340
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bj penn and that's his choice.</v>

1341
00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Know he just chooses to fight the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1342
00:58:34.671 --> 00:58:39.671
<v Speaker 2>She's not afraid to fight bigger guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he was younger and he was able </v>

1343
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:39.671
<v Speaker 2>to pull it off pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1344
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game is moving forward and </v>

1345
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:48.270
<v Speaker 2>progressing direction constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to slow down the </v>

1346
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 2>progress of these young guys that are up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and coming.</v>

1347
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:51.640
<v Speaker 2>They're better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be better,</v>

1348
00:58:51.641 --> 00:58:53.500
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be more technical.</v>

1349
00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:58.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that the older guys </v>

1350
00:58:58.501 --> 00:58:59.380
<v Speaker 2>can't still when occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those guys have to evolve as well.</v>

1351
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 2>You see like in boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bernard hopkins this week,</v>

1352
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:03.030
<v Speaker 2>one of already.</v>

1353
00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.440
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it and it's a beautiful </v>

1354
00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.930
<v Speaker 2>performance because he just did </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything correctly.</v>

1355
00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:14.290
<v Speaker 2>He's like such a craftsman in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1356
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:19.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got these old school sort of moves </v>

1357
00:59:19.291 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 2>and just knows how to cover up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows where the punches are going before</v>

1358
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 2>you even think about throwing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows what you're going to do,</v>

1359
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:28.460
<v Speaker 2>fines your patterns and then knows how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to step around you and knows how to keep</v>

1360
00:59:28.461 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 2>you moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful to watch.</v>

1361
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in mma there's not a whole lot of those </v>

1362
00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:38.291
<v Speaker 2>guys that are like these old school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a perfect fighters.</v>

1363
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anderson anderson's one of them and then</v>

1364
00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:44.160
<v Speaker 2>you've got a John Jones who's just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenom,</v>

1365
00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:49.660
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although he has all this great success </v>

1366
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:49.660
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got so much to learn still too,</v>

1367
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.890
<v Speaker 2>which is the most scary thing about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't even tapped into his branch.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1388
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:50.160
<v Speaker 4>was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big mma fan and it when it was created </v>

1389
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:50.160
<v Speaker 4>this crazy spectacle because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing like,</v>

1390
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.810
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a ninja beat up a karate master.</v>

1391
01:00:51.811 --> 01:00:52.950
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then somebody said,</v>

1392
01:00:52.951 --> 01:00:57.951
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's find out and put everybody </v>

1393
01:00:57.951 --> 01:00:59.271
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember watching the early oneS </v>

1394
01:00:59.271 --> 01:00:59.271
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a fifth degree ninjitsu black</v>

1395
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:04.161
<v Speaker 4>belt comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just gets his ass handed to them and a </v>

1396
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.651
<v Speaker 4>lot of the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was excited because I was a </v>

1397
01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:08.691
<v Speaker 4>wrestler and you were watching this </v>
<v Speaker 4>early on and I'd never heard of </v>

1398
01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:08.691
<v Speaker 4>brazilian jiu jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea what these guys are doing.</v>

1399
01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:11.520
<v Speaker 4>But when the wrestlers would come in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just mop the floor with these dudes,</v>

1400
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.800
<v Speaker 4>and it was exciting for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was justifying.</v>

1401
01:01:13.801 --> 01:01:14.340
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>

1402
01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:19.341
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took taekwondo and like there's all </v>

1403
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:19.341
<v Speaker 4>these forms and I fully appreciate what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1404
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:19.800
<v Speaker 4>what did you guys do?</v>

1405
01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.000
<v Speaker 4>but the forums,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

1406
01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:22.890
<v Speaker 4>It's going to go flights going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground anyways,</v>

1407
01:01:22.891 --> 01:01:24.900
<v Speaker 4>and you would watch that and mma and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight will go to the ground.</v>

1408
01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:26.910
<v Speaker 4>The guys know to do things in the ground</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the guys who would win.</v>

1409
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.840
<v Speaker 4>And so really got into it then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when dan severn came out,</v>

1410
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.520
<v Speaker 4>he's a Michigan boy and watching his </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights with it and he was just,</v>

1411
01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:36.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

1412
01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.480
<v Speaker 4>Awesome to watch watching him watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight a kickboxer and do full on </v>

1413
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.600
<v Speaker 4>suplexes on guys who had no idea what a </v>
<v Speaker 4>suplex was.</v>

1414
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:45.900
<v Speaker 4>And it was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So me and all my wrestling buddies,</v>

1415
01:01:45.901 --> 01:01:47.970
<v Speaker 4>we'd get together and watch those and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just go ape shit.</v>

1416
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
<v Speaker 4>We were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't even get through one of </v>

1417
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.000
<v Speaker 4>those without beating the crap out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

1418
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.010
<v Speaker 4>It Was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was awesome.</v>

1419
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.910
<v Speaker 4>And then to watch it come up and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's happened since dana has taken</v>

1420
01:01:56.911 --> 01:01:58.230
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just been,</v>

1421
01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.060
<v Speaker 4>it's just been one of the coolest things</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever seen.</v>

1422
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:00.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1423
01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:01.180
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1424
01:02:01.181 --> 01:02:02.370
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1425
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.620
<v Speaker 2>as you were talking about the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>football players changing,</v>

1426
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a period of 50 years.</v>

1427
01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at how much better the mma fighters</v>

1428
01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:14.350
<v Speaker 2>was in the 20 years that has existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really shocking.</v>

1429
01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:16.330
<v Speaker 2>It's shocking the scene now like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1430
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:19.930
<v Speaker 2>like diaz and george st pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of guys to us,</v>

1431
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.830
<v Speaker 2>nobody liked them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten years ago they didn't exist.</v>

1432
01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Nobody was that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are on a complete.</v>

1433
01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:28.050
<v Speaker 2>This is the highest level we've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>

1434
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:30.960
<v Speaker 2>And every time st pierre improves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he,</v>

1435
01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:35.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be carlos condit had a long time </v>

1436
01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:36.360
<v Speaker 2>off and re re cooping from his knee </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery.</v>

1437
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 2>He recovered from that and has the kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fighter,</v>

1438
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:41.070
<v Speaker 2>good solid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>

1439
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 2>tough fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1440
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 2>just a couple months later he's going in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there against diaz.</v>

1441
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.700
<v Speaker 2>I love that because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1442
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.860
<v Speaker 2>since it's only like four months later </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is,</v>

1443
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:54.660
<v Speaker 2>he's got time to recover time to rest up</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bill a little bit and then boom,</v>

1444
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:55.740
<v Speaker 2>get right back into it.</v>

1445
01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 2>So he'll be more use of the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably put on a better performance,</v>

1446
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:03.870
<v Speaker 2>won't feel the ring rust as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just experienced it recently.</v>

1447
01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:06.750
<v Speaker 2>That is that enough time for him to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1448
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.960
<v Speaker 2>to analyze the other fighters style </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work it in because they're not </v>

1449
01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:11.960
<v Speaker 2>enormous on the train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has gOt to be.</v>

1450
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 2>he's going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's this tendency,</v>

1451
01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.660
<v Speaker 2>when he puts his right foot forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going to happen.</v>

1452
01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:20.661
<v Speaker 2>And you think four months is enough time</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him to [inaudible] that guy's f and </v>

1453
01:03:20.661 --> 01:03:20.661
<v Speaker 2>killer man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's both guys are killers,</v>

1454
01:03:20.661 --> 01:03:24.711
<v Speaker 2>but I think first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>st pierre has been [inaudible] for a </v>

1455
01:03:24.711 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 2>long time because they were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight before,</v>

1456
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:29.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the as a tested positive and a marijuana</v>

1457
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:30.630
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1458
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1459
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.960
<v Speaker 2>it took him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.490
<v Speaker 2>all this time before he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1461
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.850
<v Speaker 2>was able to get a fight again after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>condit fight.</v>

1462
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.280
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1463
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.300
<v Speaker 2>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had some,</v>

1464
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of,</v>

1465
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:47.220
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of weird issues like outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cage and that one,</v>

1466
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.810
<v Speaker 2>that one being a big one that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspended him for a long time for,</v>

1467
01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 2>for marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just really fucking ridiculous.</v>

1468
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.120
<v Speaker 2>That really drives me bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's been wanting this fight for </v>

1469
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:04.010
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Des has been calling out for this fight </v>

1470
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:06.501
<v Speaker 2>for ever and george st pierre has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>caged for his fights and talk to you </v>

1471
01:04:06.501 --> 01:04:10.431
<v Speaker 2>about fighting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these guys have been sizing each </v>

1472
01:04:10.431 --> 01:04:12.420
<v Speaker 2>other up for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just four months to get ready.</v>

1473
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.020
<v Speaker 2>This is a long time coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We played this yesterday.</v>

1474
01:04:16.021 --> 01:04:20.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of nick diaz hitting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed bag for 23 minutes in a row.</v>

1475
01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the craziest things I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen.</v>

1476
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:27.420
<v Speaker 2>He just took 23 minutes.</v>

1477
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:32.510
<v Speaker 2>That is so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most folks have no idea how to get my </v>

1478
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:35.430
<v Speaker 2>arms up for 23 minutes and hit the bag </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's hammering at it.</v>

1479
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are both in amazing,</v>

1480
01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:41.610
<v Speaker 2>amazing shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm so excited about it.</v>

1481
01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Not just because it's the championship </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

1482
01:04:43.351 --> 01:04:48.351
<v Speaker 2>because I think it represents these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are to all time great to my opinion,</v>

1483
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.870
<v Speaker 2>and it represents them in their perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>primes.</v>

1484
01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:57.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both in the best situation they </v>

1485
01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.221
<v Speaker 2>could possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick diaz comes off the bj penn fight </v>

1486
01:04:59.221 --> 01:04:59.221
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1487
01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:04.220
<v Speaker 2>fantastic performance to carlos condit </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight were questionable decision and you</v>

1488
01:05:04.381 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1489
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:09.910
<v Speaker 2>a close fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but carlos condit used a very good </v>

1490
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:13.251
<v Speaker 2>strategy of moving and keeping away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>nick and nick has that aggressive in </v>

1491
01:05:14.551 --> 01:05:17.170
<v Speaker 2>your face style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to commit to a fight.</v>

1492
01:05:17.171 --> 01:05:22.171
<v Speaker 2>And George George was not dance around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't dance around and with his </v>

1493
01:05:22.171 --> 01:05:25.621
<v Speaker 2>wrestling style as well as it can be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting fight because first </v>

1494
01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:26.260
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nick diaz is a nasty guard.</v>

1495
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:31.260
<v Speaker 2>He's got very good sweeps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a very good submissions off of </v>

1496
01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:31.450
<v Speaker 2>his back and it gets real comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1497
01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:33.220
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to tie you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1498
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:33.620
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1499
01:05:33.621 --> 01:05:37.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not an amateur that you have on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and he's dangerous off his back.</v>

1500
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to mind your p's and q's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

1501
01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:44.851
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he going to be able to stop the tape </v>

1502
01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:44.851
<v Speaker 2>down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he does stop the take down,</v>

1503
01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:45.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the standup look like?</v>

1504
01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Does george kick them from the outside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does nick pressure him into a standup </v>

1505
01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 2>slug fast?</v>

<v Speaker 2>what does it become?</v>

1507
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:53.290
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>

1508
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited for that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1510
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 2>very excited for as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were like one of the first guys that</v>

1511
01:05:59.711 --> 01:06:04.711
<v Speaker 2>I ever heard of that took his books and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on the internet as an audio </v>

1512
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:06.050
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1513
01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.230
<v Speaker 2>what led you to decide to do that?</v>

1514
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:11.910
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't get a book deal to frankly </v>
<v Speaker 4>going back,</v>

1515
01:06:11.911 --> 01:06:12.900
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>geez,</v>

1516
01:06:12.901 --> 01:06:17.901
<v Speaker 4>I guess 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>16 years that I was trying to get </v>

1517
01:06:17.901 --> 01:06:18.960
<v Speaker 4>published for about 11 or 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrIting,</v>

1518
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:21.480
<v Speaker 4>writing a book every two years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working a full time job,</v>

1519
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:24.450
<v Speaker 4>all the regular stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then back in the day,</v>

1520
01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:29.451
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually writing the submission letter </v>

1521
01:06:29.451 --> 01:06:29.451
<v Speaker 4>and sending it to publisher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sending it to agents,</v>

1522
01:06:29.451 --> 01:06:29.451
<v Speaker 4>going to conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to meet,</v>

1523
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.950
<v Speaker 4>make the right connections to get just </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get somebody look at the book.</v>

1524
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 4>And I got an agent and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1525
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.500
<v Speaker 4>I wound up with a deal with the aol time</v>
<v Speaker 4>warner when my book earthcorps was </v>

1526
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.160
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be in every store in may of </v>
<v Speaker 4>2002.</v>

1527
01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:47.480
<v Speaker 4>And then the 9:11</v>
<v Speaker 4>recession hit before it went to press </v>

1528
01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.040
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The economy drops in time warner </v>

1529
01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:52.040
<v Speaker 4>scrapped everything that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>profitable.</v>

1530
01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.741
<v Speaker 4>So I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd gotten to that point where I had a </v>

1531
01:06:54.741 --> 01:06:54.741
<v Speaker 4>book deal.</v>

1532
01:06:54.741 --> 01:06:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Then the publisher folded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happens and it took me three years to</v>

1533
01:06:57.061 --> 01:07:02.061
<v Speaker 4>get the rights back to my book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now when I get the rights back in </v>

1534
01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:02.610
<v Speaker 4>2005,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this professionally edited book.</v>

1535
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.130
<v Speaker 4>The other's name was Paul Witt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cover was a great guy.</v>

1536
01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:10.370
<v Speaker 4>it was a really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was really solid piece of </v>

1537
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:11.070
<v Speaker 4>work and we can't get another book deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>

1538
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Then I learned about podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see what dave winer and Adam Curry or </v>

1539
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.470
<v Speaker 4>dealing with podcasting and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1540
01:07:16.471 --> 01:07:17.970
<v Speaker 4>that's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Serialized stuff.</v>

1541
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
<v Speaker 4>So I went to look for audio books to </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to because the first thing that </v>

1542
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.751
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my head being a writer was somebody </v>

1543
01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:26.751
<v Speaker 4>putting out serialized books just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the radio dramas,</v>

1544
01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:29.700
<v Speaker 4>the forties and fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started googling it and after two days</v>

1545
01:07:29.701 --> 01:07:32.880
<v Speaker 4>of trying to figure out what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong to google it and I can't find any,</v>

1546
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I then realized nobody has done this </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

1547
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:41.300
<v Speaker 4>And at that point I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a professionally edited book </v>

1548
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.300
<v Speaker 4>and it was ready for mass market </v>
<v Speaker 4>production.</v>

1549
01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Here's thIs new technology that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody hears an episode,</v>

1550
01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:48.270
<v Speaker 4>they can immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instant message it to a friend,</v>

1551
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.310
<v Speaker 4>email it to a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chat room it,</v>

1552
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.890
<v Speaker 4>and anybody who clicks on that is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to start hearing the story right away.</v>

1553
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:55.740
<v Speaker 4>I've got speed of light marketing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and it speed of light,</v>

1554
01:07:55.741 --> 01:07:57.300
<v Speaker 4>word of mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'm like,</v>

1555
01:07:57.330 --> 01:08:00.150
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I figured out how to record,</v>

1556
01:08:00.151 --> 01:08:05.151
<v Speaker 4>how to make an rss feed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to make a website and got it all </v>

1557
01:08:05.151 --> 01:08:07.521
<v Speaker 4>done just so I could get out there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then puts some marketing to work like </v>

1558
01:08:07.521 --> 01:08:10.641
<v Speaker 4>the first guy to ever do a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only novel and hope it will get picked </v>

1559
01:08:10.641 --> 01:08:11.160
<v Speaker 4>up by some blogs and different sites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it did.</v>

1560
01:08:11.161 --> 01:08:12.510
<v Speaker 4>And I started to get a followership.</v>

1561
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:18.020
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I got to the end earthcorps I had </v>

1562
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:18.740
<v Speaker 4>three other books done and I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>started podcasting them.</v>

1563
01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:23.741
<v Speaker 4>And I've been going ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was of the mind that if the </v>

1564
01:08:23.991 --> 01:08:28.991
<v Speaker 4>publishers are the gatekeepers and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't let me in because it's not a </v>

1565
01:08:28.991 --> 01:08:29.360
<v Speaker 4>western,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a horror story.</v>

1566
01:08:29.361 --> 01:08:34.361
<v Speaker 4>It's not a vampire story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want very specific things they can </v>

1567
01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:34.361
<v Speaker 4>sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got a lot of different genres.</v>

1568
01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:36.350
<v Speaker 4>They don't like you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1569
01:08:36.351 --> 01:08:39.310
<v Speaker 4>if I can get to the end user,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can go to the end listener and show</v>

1570
01:08:39.311 --> 01:08:44.311
<v Speaker 4>him how kick ass my stuff really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm betting money that my shit is so </v>

1571
01:08:44.311 --> 01:08:48.041
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can give it to you for free and then </v>

1572
01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:48.041
<v Speaker 4>they'll still pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1573
01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:51.160
<v Speaker 4>that was the thought process and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought I would get a lot of followers </v>

1574
01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:51.160
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of followers would turn into a</v>
<v Speaker 4>book deal.</v>

1575
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 4>Initially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That didn't happen because I was going </v>

1576
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 4>to publish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have 10,000</v>

1577
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.440
<v Speaker 4>people listening meet every sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can you not put this out?</v>

1578
01:08:57.730 --> 01:08:58.880
<v Speaker 4>And and their question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1579
01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 4>what's a podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had no idea what it was like,</v>

1580
01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 4>here's verifiable stats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't.</v>

1581
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know what the internet was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had no idea.</v>

1582
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know what the internet was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1583
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.530
<v Speaker 4>I swear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got it.</v>

1584
01:09:06.531 --> 01:09:07.730
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know what that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>

1585
01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:12.731
<v Speaker 4>and it was ms dot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I had this awesome plan and </v>

1586
01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:15.611
<v Speaker 4>everything's gonna work out great and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>get to the point where I'm supposed to </v>

1587
01:09:15.611 --> 01:09:18.101
<v Speaker 4>get the contract and get the book deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they didn't care about the podcast </v>

1588
01:09:18.101 --> 01:09:21.791
<v Speaker 4>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then I just kept on doing it and </v>

1589
01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.471
<v Speaker 4>eventually things kinda caught up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finally at the end of the story is we </v>

1590
01:09:23.471 --> 01:09:25.220
<v Speaker 4>put out that novel ancestor as a print </v>
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

1591
01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:27.950
<v Speaker 4>The one you've got is the one that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been rewritten for random house,</v>

1592
01:09:27.951 --> 01:09:32.951
<v Speaker 4>but this was just a little little trade </v>
<v Speaker 4>paperback put out by a small canadian </v>

1593
01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:33.470
<v Speaker 4>imprint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One lady working out of her garage,</v>

1594
01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.210
<v Speaker 4>we put that out on April 1st,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2007 and it was the number one or number</v>

1595
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:41.960
<v Speaker 4>one scifi book and amazon and it was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>number two fiction book on amazon behind</v>

1596
01:09:41.961 --> 01:09:44.290
<v Speaker 4>one of the Harry Potter potter novels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1597
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 4>In New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cracked an egg roll.</v>

1598
01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was awesome because I had a new agent</v>

1599
01:09:48.741 --> 01:09:51.230
<v Speaker 4>at that point who had the book infected </v>
<v Speaker 4>on their desks and people are like,</v>

1600
01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:51.680
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is good.</v>

1602
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden this guy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've never heard of anywhere is </v>

1603
01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 4>number one and for number one inside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then that got us into an auction for</v>

1604
01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:03.170
<v Speaker 4>infected and then I've been rolling ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>since.</v>

1605
01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.970
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

1606
01:10:04.971 --> 01:10:06.410

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.900
<v Speaker 4>So you're sorT of self created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's a love stories like that.</v>

1609
01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.090
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is my,</v>

1610
01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:14.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my audience.</v>

1611
01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:16.730
<v Speaker 4>so a lot of the day when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1612
01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go sell this book on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

1613
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:20.360
<v Speaker 4>spread the word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they went out and spread the word.</v>

1614
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:25.390
<v Speaker 4>And this is the audience that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>created with this blog or this podcast </v>

1615
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:26.710
<v Speaker 4>of your novels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you profit off of it?</v>

1616
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.720
<v Speaker 4>how did you have it setup?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you have to pay for it to download </v>

1617
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:31.720
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1618
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.240
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always been free from square one.</v>

1619
01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.190
<v Speaker 4>The whole book is free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole book is free.</v>

1620
01:10:34.191 --> 01:10:39.191
<v Speaker 4>that's the model we have now is if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just want it for free or you can't </v>

1621
01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:43.541
<v Speaker 4>afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you liked the story because </v>

1622
01:10:43.541 --> 01:10:43.541
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets into pickles here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1623
01:10:43.541 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 4>You can listen to every episode every </v>
<v Speaker 4>week and you can get the whole thing for</v>

1624
01:10:45.081 --> 01:10:47.360
<v Speaker 4>free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you download a book I've done before,</v>

1625
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:52.570
<v Speaker 4>you're going to hear 30 episodes with an</v>
<v Speaker 4>ad inserted before every episode just </v>

1626
01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:52.820
<v Speaker 4>like what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's going to be ad supported,</v>

1627
01:10:52.821 --> 01:10:54.590
<v Speaker 4>free content,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can listen to it.</v>

1628
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:58.190
<v Speaker 4>If you don't want to hear me talk before</v>
<v Speaker 4>the episode and you don't hear the ads,</v>

1629
01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.440
<v Speaker 4>then you can go spend money and buy the </v>
<v Speaker 4>audio book,</v>

1630
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 4>so I totally leave it up to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience.</v>

1631
01:11:02.031 --> 01:11:03.530
<v Speaker 4>If you want to buy the printer by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ebook,</v>

1632
01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:05.510
<v Speaker 4>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to buy the audio book?</v>

1633
01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we're in business.</v>

1634
01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:08.720
<v Speaker 4>If you don't want to do that or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't afford it,</v>

1635
01:11:08.721 --> 01:11:10.670
<v Speaker 4>you can go get all my books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every word of it for free.</v>

1636
01:11:10.671 --> 01:11:12.770
<v Speaker 4>EveryThing on abridged way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been from square one.</v>

1637
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 4>That's a beautiful way to do it,</v>

1638
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:19.100
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that way you pay for the bandwidth </v>

1639
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:19.100
<v Speaker 5>costs and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Through the advertising,</v>

1640
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:24.350
<v Speaker 5>everything we've covered everything with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the advertising and advertising has </v>

1641
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.780
<v Speaker 5>become a a solid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>solid thing for us.</v>

1642
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 5>After seven years we're doing pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>good with it.</v>

1643
01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.410
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but largely it's just the,</v>

1644
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:31.860
<v Speaker 5>the general attitude by this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>has been,</v>

1645
01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:35.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anyone out there mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>spending money for shit that they like.</v>

1646
01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 5>The problem Is when you buy that record </v>
<v Speaker 5>or you buy that audio book and you heard</v>

1647
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:40.770
<v Speaker 5>the sampling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1648
01:11:40.771 --> 01:11:41.340
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was great.</v>

1649
01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 5>Then you get to the end of it and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1650
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.710
<v Speaker 5>this guy got lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1651
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:47.040
<v Speaker 5>this story ends crappy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have wasted my time.</v>

1652
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:49.170
<v Speaker 5>I've wasted my money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're pissed off,</v>

1653
01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.900
<v Speaker 5>angry that you spent money on something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you didn't like.</v>

1654
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:56.930
<v Speaker 5>So I flipped that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to give it to you and you're </v>

1655
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.930
<v Speaker 5>gonna.</v>

1656
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.930
<v Speaker 5>Listen to it and when you get to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>end,</v>

1657
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:59.620
<v Speaker 5>you are going to miss work and you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to go all night long and not,</v>

1658
01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.770
<v Speaker 5>not be able to sleep because I'm in your</v>
<v Speaker 5>skull,</v>

1659
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:04.020
<v Speaker 5>taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when they get done lIke that,</v>

1660
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 5>I liked that book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked the way that ended.</v>

1661
01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:10.940
<v Speaker 5>This is my author.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they go buy everything that I've </v>

1662
01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.491
<v Speaker 5>ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if people get to the end and they </v>

1663
01:12:13.491 --> 01:12:13.491
<v Speaker 5>didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's no sweat off anybody's ball.</v>

1664
01:12:13.491 --> 01:12:13.491
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1665
01:12:13.491 --> 01:12:15.060
<v Speaker 5>I didn't spend anything on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not really for me.</v>

1666
01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 5>It creates this sense of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this crazy sense of goodwill that even </v>

1667
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 5>people who don't really like your stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as they hear somebody going,</v>

1668
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:23.320
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1669
01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.360
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really like a hard science monster </v>

1670
01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:28.360
<v Speaker 5>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1671
01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:28.360
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to check out the sigler guy.</v>

1672
01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.930
<v Speaker 5>And like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody loves the fact that you leave </v>

1673
01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:31.930
<v Speaker 5>it up to the customer and just leave it </v>
<v Speaker 5>up to.</v>

1674
01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:32.550
<v Speaker 5>It's up to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's their money.</v>

1675
01:12:32.551 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 5>You decided you want to spend it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not up to me to trick you.</v>

1676
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.330
<v Speaker 5>That's an awesome ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>

1677
01:12:36.331 --> 01:12:39.420
<v Speaker 5>And that's sort of the same thing we do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with this podcast.</v>

1678
01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:44.421
<v Speaker 5>We know there's some people hAve like </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have where you sign up and you can </v>

1679
01:12:44.421 --> 01:12:48.810
<v Speaker 5>pay x amount of money and access the old</v>
<v Speaker 5>podcasts and some of them have it set up</v>

1680
01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 5>where if you want to watch on ustream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to pay for a monthly thing.</v>

1681
01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:57.531
<v Speaker 5>but I've always felt like what this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing does is so amazing is the word of </v>

1682
01:12:57.531 --> 01:13:02.271
<v Speaker 5>mouth and the best way to do that is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make it as accessible as possible,</v>

1683
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.120
<v Speaker 5>to put it out there as quickly and as </v>
<v Speaker 5>easy and as to make to make it as </v>

1684
01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 5>downloadable as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1685
01:13:08.881 --> 01:13:13.881
<v Speaker 5>if going back to Stephen King,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stephen King was a start doing a weekly </v>

1686
01:13:13.881 --> 01:13:14.580
<v Speaker 5>podcast of his fiction and actually read</v>
<v Speaker 5>his fiction,</v>

1687
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:15.750
<v Speaker 5>he's.</v>

1688
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:18.960
<v Speaker 5>He could charge for that and would make </v>
<v Speaker 5>a significant amount of money for that.</v>

1689
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.770
<v Speaker 5>Stephen king's the worst guy ever to </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>

1690
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:26.970
<v Speaker 5>His books are awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when he's reading them,</v>

1691
01:13:26.971 --> 01:13:27.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1692
01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:30.210
<v Speaker 5>this mother fuckers read books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not his thing.</v>

1693
01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:31.620
<v Speaker 5>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not.</v>

1694
01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't command it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1695
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:38.481
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you have a strong voice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stephen king has sort of most like a </v>

1696
01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:43.120
<v Speaker 5>mumbling voice while he's reading his </v>
<v Speaker 5>family are,</v>

1697
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:45.270
<v Speaker 5>would never be able to pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1698
01:13:45.271 --> 01:13:48.630
<v Speaker 5>the performance of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had seven years to polish that up.</v>

1699
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:49.950
<v Speaker 5>when I started out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first one earthcorps.</v>

1700
01:13:49.951 --> 01:13:54.951
<v Speaker 5>It's like I just use all the voices they</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to use to make my buddies laughed </v>

1701
01:13:54.951 --> 01:13:55.320
<v Speaker 5>in high school and like I have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I'm doing.</v>

1702
01:13:55.321 --> 01:14:00.321
<v Speaker 5>Just throw it in there and we'll make it</v>
<v Speaker 5>as entertaining as possible and I've </v>

1703
01:14:00.321 --> 01:14:00.810
<v Speaker 5>alwaYs tried to be as make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every book is over the top as it can be.</v>

1704
01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:04.140
<v Speaker 5>So there's a loud rock intro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loud rock outros.</v>

1705
01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:09.141
<v Speaker 5>I'm peaking the meters when I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just trying to make it exciting and </v>

1706
01:14:09.141 --> 01:14:09.480
<v Speaker 5>energetic and fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not just money.</v>

1707
01:14:09.481 --> 01:14:11.430
<v Speaker 5>It's people's time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to take an hour,</v>

1708
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 5>somebody time.</v>

1709
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.590
<v Speaker 4>You better have some good shit because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't get that hour back ever.</v>

1710
01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying all the right shit.</v>

1711
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.120
<v Speaker 4>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you should think,</v>

1712
01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.490
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be awesome if everybody thought</v>

1713
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:26.491
<v Speaker 4>that was the biggest thing is the free </v>
<v Speaker 4>because now there's so many </v>

1714
01:14:26.491 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 4>entertainment options.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when Stephen King was coming up</v>

1715
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 4>in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was movies,</v>

1716
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:33.150
<v Speaker 4>books and tv and that was all there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now I got to compete against fucking</v>

1717
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:38.280
<v Speaker 4>xbox and playstation and downloaded </v>
<v Speaker 4>content and podcasts and vid cast and </v>

1718
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.790
<v Speaker 4>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to compete against all that just </v>

1719
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.790
<v Speaker 4>to try and get somebody to get like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1720
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:42.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go and ask for 10 hours of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your time to read this,</v>

1721
01:14:42.771 --> 01:14:44.530
<v Speaker 4>this book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't really mean anything.</v>

1722
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:47.470
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough sell today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a super tough sell,</v>

1723
01:14:47.471 --> 01:14:52.471
<v Speaker 4>especially with the younger kids because</v>
<v Speaker 4>video games are amazing entertainment </v>

1724
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:52.471
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1725
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:55.270
<v Speaker 4>for you to get them to put that down and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick this book up for awhile,</v>

1726
01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.590
<v Speaker 4>you've really got.</v>

1727
01:14:56.650 --> 01:15:01.650
<v Speaker 4>You got to bring good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many hours do you think it would </v>

1728
01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:01.650
<v Speaker 4>take to rebuild these books?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can read one of these and 10 hours.</v>

1729
01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:02.560
<v Speaker 4>I think somebody could read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten,</v>

1730
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:03.950
<v Speaker 4>10 to 20 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1731
01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 4>10 to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My stuff reads a little.</v>

1732
01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:11.090
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's looks thicker than it is because </v>

1733
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.501
<v Speaker 4>there's an enormous amount of dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of regular guy dialogue </v>

1734
01:15:13.501 --> 01:15:13.970
<v Speaker 4>and that means like two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three words,</v>

1735
01:15:13.971 --> 01:15:14.740
<v Speaker 4>line two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three words,</v>

1736
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:15.280
<v Speaker 4>line pop up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

1737
01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:15.580
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1738
01:15:15.581 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 4>Stuff goes real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people are surprised at how fast they</v>

1739
01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:21.040
<v Speaker 4>read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this giant hunking thing.</v>

1740
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I finished it so fast,</v>

1741
01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:23.580
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1742
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 4>there's an enormous amount of dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>

1743
01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.230
<v Speaker 4>And this other book that I have here is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestor.</v>

1744
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 4>WhaT?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's this one about?</v>

1745
01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Ancestor is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1746
01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 4>an effort by a biotech company to create</v>
<v Speaker 4>a herd animal with transplantable horn,</v>

1747
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:36.730
<v Speaker 4>human organs.</v>

1748
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Every year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands of people die </v>

1749
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:42.360
<v Speaker 4>because there's just not enough organs </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go around.</v>

1750
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.060
<v Speaker 4>And if you've got a bad liver for you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>live,</v>

1751
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:45.010
<v Speaker 4>somebody else has to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a zero sum game.</v>

1752
01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:48.130
<v Speaker 4>So they try and come up with a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1753
01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 4>it's an animal with jeans from multiple </v>
<v Speaker 4>species.</v>

1754
01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.440
<v Speaker 4>So basically something along the lines </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a sheep or a cow.</v>

1755
01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.690
<v Speaker 4>But with transplantable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lungs,</v>

1756
01:15:55.691 --> 01:15:56.860
<v Speaker 4>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kidneys,</v>

1757
01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.980
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A growing body could need if they can </v>

1758
01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:01.980
<v Speaker 4>pull this off and put this thing out to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pasture.</v>

1759
01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 4>It's just like raising cows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just harvest them when you need them</v>

1760
01:16:04.511 --> 01:16:09.511
<v Speaker 4>and you make trillions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is old school horror movie saifai.</v>

1761
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:14.790
<v Speaker 4>So something goes horribly wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of winding up with a 200 pound </v>

1762
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:19.051
<v Speaker 4>hurt animal with a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 4>transplantable organs and is that goes </v>

1763
01:16:19.051 --> 01:16:22.801
<v Speaker 4>out and eats grass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wind up with a 650 pound pack </v>

1764
01:16:22.801 --> 01:16:24.970
<v Speaker 4>predator and this of course happens on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>remote island in lake superior.</v>

1765
01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 4>So we wind up with all of our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of our characters stuck on an island</v>

1766
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:32.990
<v Speaker 4>with 100 of these 650 pound pack </v>
<v Speaker 4>predators that just go through you like </v>

1767
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 4>they go through like a knife through </v>
<v Speaker 4>butter.</v>

1768
01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.400
<v Speaker 4>These things look like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1769
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:41.430
<v Speaker 4>they're not all that dissimilar from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>american werewolf in london and got out </v>

1770
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:45.600
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the biggest thing I did with the </v>

1771
01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:45.730
<v Speaker 4>night kind of combined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little bit of a bar,</v>

1772
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:49.660
<v Speaker 4>a bear and a gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the defining thing they have in fans</v>

1773
01:16:49.661 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 4>draw tons of pictures of the feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Google sigler,</v>

1774
01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:53.980
<v Speaker 4>sigler ancestry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll probably see this.</v>

1775
01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:59.370
<v Speaker 4>they have this giant sale thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they've got a variation on the </v>

1776
01:16:59.370 --> 01:16:59.370
<v Speaker 4>demetra non-cell fin because it's based </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1777
01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:02.230
<v Speaker 4>The genome is based on the ancestor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all mammals.</v>

1778
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:06.010
<v Speaker 4>The thought is if they read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dial back the genetic clock,</v>

1779
01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:11.040
<v Speaker 4>let's get back to the base set of code,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we will have exactly what we want </v>

1780
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.140
<v Speaker 4>and there won't be any dashes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>retroviruses,</v>

1781
01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:14.690
<v Speaker 4>there won't be any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any crazy stuff we can then from there,</v>

1782
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.280
<v Speaker 4>customize the animal we want.</v>

1783
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:17.930
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they.</v>

1784
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.970
<v Speaker 4>But they don't get it all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1785
01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.080
<v Speaker 4>The thing is is that that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things it says that's from predator.</v>

1786
01:17:24.081 --> 01:17:29.081
<v Speaker 4>Scroll back over to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of my fans did a full four </v>

1787
01:17:29.081 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 4>foot tall mock out of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the monster right there,</v>

1788
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:34.670
<v Speaker 4>and they had the sale fan that they keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and you and you start to find out,</v>

1789
01:17:34.671 --> 01:17:39.671
<v Speaker 4>they start to use it for communication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they signal each other when they're </v>

1790
01:17:39.671 --> 01:17:40.350
<v Speaker 4>closing in on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you see that fin pop up somewhere,</v>

1791
01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 4>the kind of like a land shark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your efin screwed.</v>

1792
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:46.100
<v Speaker 4>You're pretty fully there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fully cgi in the trailer.</v>

1793
01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:47.780
<v Speaker 4>You want to get the trailer out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1794
01:17:47.781 --> 01:17:49.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's cgi.</v>

1795
01:17:49.101 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 4>This my buddy kevin copysea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's amazingly talented.</v>

1796
01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Look for a go to youtube and search for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sigler nocturnal trailer,</v>

1797
01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:01.120
<v Speaker 4>and so you're doing a a movie of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nocturnal but ancestors to sigler </v>

1798
01:18:01.311 --> 01:18:02.240
<v Speaker 4>ancestor trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>

1799
01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:07.241
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ancestor or this is going to be a tv </v>

1800
01:18:07.241 --> 01:18:07.241
<v Speaker 4>series.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is going on with ancestor?</v>

1801
01:18:07.241 --> 01:18:08.390
<v Speaker 4>Nothing right now have been a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have been like,</v>

1802
01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do trailers for the books.</v>

1803
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.060
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to compete against youtube.</v>

1804
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:19.180
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing with a book trailer is if you </v>

1805
01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:21.881
<v Speaker 4>make a really kick ass book trailer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the kind of thing that people will </v>

1806
01:18:21.881 --> 01:18:24.881
<v Speaker 4>share,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the money you spend on that is money </v>

1807
01:18:24.881 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 4>that will continue to work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People keep watching that for years.</v>

1808
01:18:26.811 --> 01:18:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four minutes,</v>

1809
01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 8>someone dies while waiting for a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Liver,</v>

1810
01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.310
<v Speaker 8>a kidney.</v>

1811
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1812
01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:39.890
<v Speaker 8>Imagine the technology that could </v>
<v Speaker 8>provide those organs for a fee and </v>

1813
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:42.330
<v Speaker 8>imagine what a company would do to </v>
<v Speaker 8>monopolize that technology.</v>

1814
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:48.030
<v Speaker 8>The biotech firm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>janata tried to solve this problem by </v>

1815
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:51.711
<v Speaker 8>creating the ancestor,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a creature with transplantable human </v>

1816
01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:56.331
<v Speaker 8>ordinance,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they didn't get the dos style </v>

1817
01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:57.110
<v Speaker 8>hurting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Instead,</v>

1818
01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.440
<v Speaker 8>awakened something,</v>
<v Speaker 8>something something very,</v>

1819
01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.440
<v Speaker 8>very.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You want a monopoly monopoly on human </v>

1820
01:19:16.341 --> 01:19:19.850
<v Speaker 8>life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nothing sells like life itself.</v>

1821
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:27.110
<v Speaker 8>When we succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we will be the only vendor and be able </v>

1822
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:31.941
<v Speaker 8>to charge what the market will bear for </v>
<v Speaker 8>the millions of people.</v>

1823
01:19:32.821 --> 01:19:34.140
<v Speaker 8>Not quite ready for that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1824
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:40.780
<v Speaker 8>The market will bear.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's my favorite part.</v>

1825
01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:17.880
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's sure as fuck ain't no cow.</v>

1826
01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.260
<v Speaker 4>So you created that yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1827
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:30.310
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had people do the errand proctor a </v>

1828
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.590
<v Speaker 4>shot the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we went out and found a guy to do it</v>

1829
01:20:30.591 --> 01:20:34.090
<v Speaker 4>and he got all his actor friends and put</v>
<v Speaker 4>it together in the cgi and we got a.</v>

1830
01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.760
<v Speaker 4>We got permission from century media to </v>
<v Speaker 4>use in this moments.</v>

1831
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:37.760
<v Speaker 4>Music for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We shot it.</v>

1832
01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:43.020
<v Speaker 4>We assume that five minute movie we went</v>
<v Speaker 4>out in the mountains and the snow and </v>

1833
01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.060
<v Speaker 4>had an f and blast doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that kind of thing.</v>

1834
01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.530
<v Speaker 4>People still watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1835
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.520
<v Speaker 4>were from 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40,</v>

1836
01:20:46.521 --> 01:20:51.521
<v Speaker 4>50 times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My trailer for infected at a quarter of </v>

1837
01:20:51.521 --> 01:20:52.340
<v Speaker 4>a million views and it just keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting views.</v>

1838
01:20:52.341 --> 01:20:57.341
<v Speaker 4>So somebody's going to watch that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly the kind of book they </v>

1839
01:20:57.341 --> 01:20:57.341
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they go buy the book.</v>

1840
01:20:57.341 --> 01:21:02.170
<v Speaker 4>It's the only form of marketing and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>publishing industry that will continue </v>

1841
01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:02.170
<v Speaker 4>to sell books for you year after year.</v>

1842
01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:03.830
<v Speaker 4>So we go out and spend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent a ton of money in my trailers.</v>

1843
01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.240
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting.</v>

1844
01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.500
<v Speaker 4>Is this a common thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I just.</v>

1845
01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.320
<v Speaker 4>It's getting more leads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Getting more common.</v>

1846
01:21:09.321 --> 01:21:11.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of book trailers are.</v>

1847
01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:16.300
<v Speaker 4>They're awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a floating book cover with music </v>

1848
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.941
<v Speaker 4>and words floating in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's people who go out and just </v>

1849
01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:18.941
<v Speaker 4>shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1850
01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:22.991
<v Speaker 4>they do full on three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four minute movies to try and sell the </v>

1851
01:21:22.991 --> 01:21:22.991
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen one of these brands?</v>

1852
01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:26.250
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie for this app is.</v>

1853
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1854
01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.290
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

1855
01:21:30.291 --> 01:21:34.070
<v Speaker 4>We did the first one in 2008 and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>a relatively unheard of.</v>

1856
01:21:34.071 --> 01:21:34.960
<v Speaker 4>Now it's more common now.</v>

1857
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Professional writer and a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to explain to me 50 shades of</v>

1858
01:21:39.821 --> 01:21:40.120
<v Speaker 2>grey.</v>

1859
01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is going on?</v>

1860
01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.210
<v Speaker 4>It's the naughty factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

1861
01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:47.360
<v Speaker 4>it's a I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm guessing here,</v>

1862
01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:50.030
<v Speaker 4>so I'm trying to figure out primarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a female readership,</v>

1863
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:55.090
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out the female mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not something I'm that gift of </v>

1864
01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:55.090
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1865
01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:56.150
<v Speaker 2>or gay dudes pretending to be straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might read that.</v>

1866
01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think number one,</v>

1867
01:21:59.101 --> 01:21:59.950
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1868
01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:05.930
<v Speaker 4>it's not your usual sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is some stuff we read and he'd be </v>

1869
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.930
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my goodness,</v>

1870
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:09.441
<v Speaker 4>I can you put that in a book and then at</v>
<v Speaker 4>some point it tipped and enough people </v>

1871
01:22:09.441 --> 01:22:11.100
<v Speaker 4>had read it that it became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1872
01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:13.320
<v Speaker 4>you've got the hive mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1873
01:22:13.321 --> 01:22:15.450
<v Speaker 4>got a million people read this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that bad.</v>

1874
01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:19.260
<v Speaker 4>And then the other factor that I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody just ignores is,</v>

1875
01:22:19.261 --> 01:22:20.520
<v Speaker 4>I haven't read it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>

1876
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:25.590
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does not sell that many copies unless</v>

1877
01:22:25.591 --> 01:22:30.591
<v Speaker 4>that writing specifically appeals to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are buying it and they love </v>

1878
01:22:30.591 --> 01:22:30.591
<v Speaker 4>the reading experience.</v>

1879
01:22:30.591 --> 01:22:34.860
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why women don't trust</v>
<v Speaker 2>porn stars are strippers or prostitutes </v>

1880
01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.350
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other women that you know,</v>

1881
01:22:39.351 --> 01:22:44.351
<v Speaker 2>will do things along those lines from </v>
<v Speaker 2>money is because secretly I think </v>

1882
01:22:44.351 --> 01:22:49.181
<v Speaker 2>there's a fear in the female community </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all would have to happen would be </v>

1883
01:22:50.421 --> 01:22:53.990
<v Speaker 2>just a few hundred girls start doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible things.</v>

1884
01:22:53.991 --> 01:22:58.991
<v Speaker 2>Then they would all start doing it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a mass movement and when a book </v>

1885
01:22:58.991 --> 01:23:03.620
<v Speaker 2>like 50 shades of grey comes on and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball gags and you know,</v>

1886
01:23:03.621 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>all the crazy shit that doing that in</v>

1887
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.750
<v Speaker 5>that book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go back to the terrible part.</v>

1888
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 5>What's shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's terrible about a 200 girls going </v>

1889
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 5>out and having a grand old time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing terrible.</v>

1890
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:17.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean terrible from their point of view</v>
<v Speaker 5>and their own social norms of,</v>

1891
01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not wanting to be a slut and not wanting</v>

1892
01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:24.700
<v Speaker 5>to be promiscuous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in a book like 50 shades of gray can</v>

1893
01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:29.970
<v Speaker 5>literally change culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you got hold of sex and the </v>

1894
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:29.970
<v Speaker 5>city sex and the city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing.</v>

1895
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:34.820
<v Speaker 5>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet the sales of bondage instruments </v>

1896
01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 5>have gone up significantly since that </v>
<v Speaker 5>book has come out.</v>

1897
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:40.920
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think about women in like the </v>

1898
01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:40.920
<v Speaker 5>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like before sex and the city came along.</v>

1899
01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.360
<v Speaker 5>It was like sort of like there was no </v>
<v Speaker 5>milf world.</v>

1900
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.360
<v Speaker 5>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1901
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:49.380
<v Speaker 5>there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People weren't like really turned on by </v>

1902
01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:49.380
<v Speaker 5>really hot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>50 year olds like that.</v>

1903
01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:51.640
<v Speaker 5>That didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was none of that and then all of a</v>

1904
01:23:51.641 --> 01:23:55.090
<v Speaker 5>sudden it became okay and then all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>women that were like over 40,</v>

1905
01:23:55.091 --> 01:23:55.670
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it,</v>

1906
01:23:55.671 --> 01:24:00.671
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go out and get some dick </v>

1907
01:24:00.671 --> 01:24:00.671
<v Speaker 5>hanging out with my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like hanging out with many them.</v>

1908
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.030
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere along the line they realized </v>
<v Speaker 5>their marriage is a big charade.</v>

1909
01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.170
<v Speaker 5>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're seeing more,</v>

1910
01:24:08.171 --> 01:24:13.171
<v Speaker 5>especially a lot of the porn stars being</v>
<v Speaker 5>more open about what they do and going </v>

1911
01:24:13.171 --> 01:24:13.810
<v Speaker 5>on their own podcasts and talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1912
01:24:13.811 --> 01:24:14.610
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is my job here.</v>

1913
01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:19.620
<v Speaker 5>This is super fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are accepting it more and more </v>

1914
01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:19.620
<v Speaker 5>interested in a book like 50 shades of </v>
<v Speaker 5>grey.</v>

1915
01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:24.390
<v Speaker 5>Hopefully the norms of our parents are </v>
<v Speaker 5>are going away and somebody wants to go </v>

1916
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 5>get laid and the other person's into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the problem?</v>

1917
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.760
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1918
01:24:27.761 --> 01:24:29.380
<v Speaker 5>Unless you ball gags.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm real tight.</v>

1919
01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give her strain.</v>

1920
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.250
<v Speaker 5>Sooner or later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

1921
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:37.420
<v Speaker 5>autoerotic asphyxiation is gonna kick in</v>
<v Speaker 5>and somebody's gonna strangle get choked</v>

1922
01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:38.350
<v Speaker 5>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's sad.</v>

1923
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:41.170
<v Speaker 5>Whenever anybody dies from auto erotic </v>
<v Speaker 5>association,</v>

1924
01:24:41.171 --> 01:24:43.130
<v Speaker 5>I always smell foul play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1925
01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:43.780
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>

1926
01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:46.300
<v Speaker 5>You were going to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>discredit a guy.</v>

1927
01:24:46.301 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 5>Like there was a preacher that died and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he died.</v>

1928
01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:53.701
<v Speaker 5>He had a wet suit on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a black dildo up his ass and he </v>

1929
01:24:53.701 --> 01:24:55.630
<v Speaker 5>was doing a autoerotic creation and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>died.</v>

1930
01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:57.910
<v Speaker 5>And that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was figured,</v>

1931
01:24:57.911 --> 01:24:58.840
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

1932
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:04.020
<v Speaker 5>That guy is a priest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what kind of creepy shit he </v>

1933
01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:04.020
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1934
01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:04.840
<v Speaker 5>it's probably not a stupid priest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1935
01:25:04.841 --> 01:25:06.130
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very well.</v>

1936
01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.750
<v Speaker 5>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to whack someone.</v>

1937
01:25:07.751 --> 01:25:08.290
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1938
01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:09.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's a good way.</v>

1939
01:25:09.281 --> 01:25:11.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like as embarrassing as possible.</v>

1940
01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only difference is like you could </v>

1941
01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:19.081
<v Speaker 5>make it a little worse by leaving like </v>
<v Speaker 5>pornography around like gay porn or </v>

1942
01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:19.500
<v Speaker 5>kiddie porn or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You crossed me.</v>

1943
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:24.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm elite kiddie porn all around you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to die about his fixation </v>

1944
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:24.510
<v Speaker 5>mop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mop mafia,</v>

1945
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:25.540
<v Speaker 5>threatening that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll make something straightened out.</v>

1946
01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:30.570
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said that's what happened with </v>

1947
01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:31.651
<v Speaker 5>david carradine that I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought the same thought when that </v>

1948
01:25:31.651 --> 01:25:31.660
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1949
01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit what anybody does in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their own private time,</v>

1950
01:25:34.871 --> 01:25:37.630
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not buying that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He crossed someone.</v>

1951
01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:42.660
<v Speaker 5>He had to have crossed someone or owed </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody money or something because it </v>

1952
01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:42.660
<v Speaker 5>was just nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1953
01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:46.441
<v Speaker 5>the rumor was that there were some </v>
<v Speaker 5>organized crime involvement in his </v>

1954
01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:46.450
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the rumor.</v>

1955
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:49.090
<v Speaker 5>The rumor somebody easily could have </v>
<v Speaker 5>just made that up.</v>

1956
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:51.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is so many goddamn rumors,</v>

1957
01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.960
<v Speaker 5>so implausible that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you do that and.</v>

1958
01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.980
<v Speaker 5>But I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've tried.</v>

1959
01:25:56.981 --> 01:26:01.981
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's the greatest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm never going to find us to be </v>

1960
01:26:01.981 --> 01:26:03.961
<v Speaker 5>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not my cup of tea having </v>

1961
01:26:03.961 --> 01:26:03.961
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be great to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to do that either.</v>

1962
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:07.850
<v Speaker 5>Brian's dad was trying to get talked </v>
<v Speaker 5>into skydiving.</v>

1963
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.900
<v Speaker 5>Tell that story.</v>

1964
01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:11.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His friend was always like,</v>

1965

1970
01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:22.450
<v Speaker 6>a parachute got tangled up with her </v>
<v Speaker 6>emergency parachute.</v>

1971
01:26:22.570 --> 01:26:23.380
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she died.</v>

1972
01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.480
<v Speaker 6>And this was like a week before he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to go skydiving with her.</v>

1973
01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:27.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

1974

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1975
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:32.720
<v Speaker 5>Did he find out by just going into work </v>
<v Speaker 5>and she wasn't there?</v>

1976
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:34.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoops.</v>

1977
01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.850
<v Speaker 5>Not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More power to the people want to do it,</v>

1978
01:26:37.851 --> 01:26:38.790
<v Speaker 5>but not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not for me.</v>

1979
01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:40.560
<v Speaker 5>I avoid the crazy life threatening </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1980
01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>

1981
01:26:41.641 --> 01:26:45.240
<v Speaker 5>that's a funny one though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Skydiving one's a really funny one.</v>

1982
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:47.490
<v Speaker 5>It's like you want that big adrenaline </v>
<v Speaker 5>rush.</v>

1983
01:26:47.730 --> 01:26:49.500
<v Speaker 5>Wait till they come up with virtual </v>
<v Speaker 5>skydiving.</v>

1984
01:26:49.530 --> 01:26:51.150
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like it's going to be pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad ass.</v>

1985
01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:52.480
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a little fan things,</v>

1986
01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:57.600
<v Speaker 6>some pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever done one of those where </v>

1987
01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:57.600
<v Speaker 6>you're like over that big fan and you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>just kinda like,</v>

1988
01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:57.600
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1989
01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.600
<v Speaker 5>Floating that said it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.140
<v Speaker 5>They have one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The universal.</v>

1991
01:27:01.141 --> 01:27:02.090
<v Speaker 5>We should do it one day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1992
01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:02.780
<v Speaker 5>that'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1993
01:27:02.781 --> 01:27:03.870
<v Speaker 5>you fly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:08.980
<v Speaker 5>It's just like a technique to it too </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently because if you do it a </v>

1995
01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:12.021
<v Speaker 5>certain way you can fall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that give you the same drastic </v>

1996
01:27:12.021 --> 01:27:12.090
<v Speaker 5>fight or flight response though as </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking out,</v>

1997
01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:13.740
<v Speaker 5>jumping out of a plane?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1998
01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:15.650
<v Speaker 5>if anything goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to die.</v>

1999
01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.610
<v Speaker 5>That's the thrill I got to think for </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people.</v>

2000
01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

2001
01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.250
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big part of it.</v>

2002
01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.350
<v Speaker 5>So it's the part that people don't want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2003
01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.160
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to sort of admit it to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a thrill.</v>

2004
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:27.810
<v Speaker 5>What's the thrill part?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2005
01:27:27.811 --> 01:27:29.580
<v Speaker 5>the thrill is that you're almost dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2006
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:30.550
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna add,</v>

2007
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:33.750
<v Speaker 5>bungee jump at the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body is reacting like it's going to</v>

2008
01:27:33.751 --> 01:27:35.700
<v Speaker 5>die and you're tricking that.</v>

2009
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:37.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not really.</v>

2010
01:27:37.801 --> 01:27:39.570
<v Speaker 5>Like you're pretty sure it's not going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

2011
01:27:39.571 --> 01:27:42.270
<v Speaker 5>So it's not a full on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to die moment.</v>

2012
01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:43.980
<v Speaker 5>Well you only make that mistake once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it's,</v>

2013
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.640
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're all set.</v>

2014
01:27:45.150 --> 01:27:47.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're weird with our manipulation of our</v>

2015
01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:50.770
<v Speaker 5>fight or flight responses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The things we do,</v>

2016
01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:54.210
<v Speaker 5>wing suits and shit like that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2017
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:57.570
<v Speaker 5>organized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting the same thing you are.</v>

2018
01:27:57.571 --> 01:28:02.571
<v Speaker 5>You are channeling that base primitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>instinct to establish dominance over </v>

2019
01:28:02.571 --> 01:28:05.190
<v Speaker 5>another member of your species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the.</v>

2020
01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:10.250
<v Speaker 5>All of the things that used to go with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in primitive times are gone and </v>

2021
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:13.281
<v Speaker 5>it's just down to that one instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are going in there to test your </v>

2022
01:28:13.281 --> 01:28:15.000
<v Speaker 5>mettle against another person and a and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see if you can beat them.</v>

2023
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:20.030
<v Speaker 5>If you can establish dominance on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all that stuff is and the guys </v>

2024
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:23.481
<v Speaker 5>who are the best that establishing </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominance of the guys who rise to </v>

2025
01:28:23.481 --> 01:28:23.481
<v Speaker 5>prominence in their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in their sport and we're starting to see</v>

2026
01:28:23.481 --> 01:28:25.530
<v Speaker 5>younger and younger guys retire as well.</v>

2027
01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:30.710
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's being an issue now is a very </v>

2028
01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:33.970
<v Speaker 5>tiring because they've already got </v>
<v Speaker 5>damaged to the retaining ahead of </v>

2029
01:28:33.970 --> 01:28:33.970
<v Speaker 5>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2030
01:28:33.970 --> 01:28:33.970
<v Speaker 5>everybody's got a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>damage.</v>

2031
01:28:33.970 --> 01:28:38.661
<v Speaker 5>That's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reality is if you've done some </v>

2032
01:28:38.661 --> 01:28:39.440
<v Speaker 5>hearts bar and you've got damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just no.</v>

2033
01:28:39.490 --> 01:28:41.280
<v Speaker 5>So it doesn't seem like there's any </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting around that.</v>

2034
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:44.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much of it recovers after you know?</v>

2035
01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.470
<v Speaker 5>A couple of months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much is a couple of weeks?</v>

2036
01:28:46.471 --> 01:28:51.471
<v Speaker 5>How much has never depends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen fights where guys got beat up </v>

2037
01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:55.880
<v Speaker 5>and they were never the same guy again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just weren't that they're missing </v>

2038
01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:55.970
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were at,</v>

2039
01:28:56.010 --> 01:28:57.960
<v Speaker 5>if they were at 10 before they were at </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>

2040
01:28:57.961 --> 01:28:58.980
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2041
01:28:58.981 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 5>and that was where they were now and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they could have a fairly successful</v>

2042
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.050
<v Speaker 2>career at eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they would never be 10 again.</v>

2043
01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Now that's something the nfl is facing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've got 100 years of results</v>

2044
01:29:10.051 --> 01:29:11.790
<v Speaker 2>to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for something like the ufc,</v>

2045
01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 2>which is new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wonder at what point does it come in</v>

2046
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:17.530
<v Speaker 2>when they start to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we need to increase size?</v>

2047
01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.660
<v Speaker 2>The gloves are outlaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the various actually is um,</v>

2048
01:29:20.661 --> 01:29:25.661
<v Speaker 2>less safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the bigger gloves is </v>

2049
01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:25.661
<v Speaker 2>because they hit harder with know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beer gloves.</v>

2050
01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:30.621
<v Speaker 2>There's two issues with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that you don't break your hands </v>

2051
01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:33.171
<v Speaker 2>as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could pretty much punch a guy </v>

2052
01:29:33.171 --> 01:29:33.171
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not always,</v>

2053
01:29:33.171 --> 01:29:37.701
<v Speaker 2>some guys have fragile hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with the big gloves like floyd </v>

2054
01:29:37.701 --> 01:29:37.701
<v Speaker 2>mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's uh,</v>

2055
01:29:37.701 --> 01:29:39.060
<v Speaker 2>he's had several operations on his hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he kept,</v>

2056
01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:41.350
<v Speaker 2>kept breaking them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas I'm,</v>

2057
01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:46.360
<v Speaker 2>the mma gloves are smaller and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>take as many shots with them.</v>

2058
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:51.470
<v Speaker 2>The bigger gloves you can take more </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches and in fact it's not really </v>

2059
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 2>necessarily the concussive blows that do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of brain damage.</v>

2060
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.050
<v Speaker 2>It's the just the constant subconcussive</v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma that is the,</v>

2061
01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.970
<v Speaker 2>it's the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2062
01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:04.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy named nick denise who was </v>

2063
01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:06.981
<v Speaker 2>a mma fighter who just retired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe he was a premed student I </v>

2064
01:30:06.981 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very,</v>

2065
01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:08.580
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

2066
01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:13.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever his educational background was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was his concern was the sub sub</v>

2067
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:14.960
<v Speaker 2>concussive trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2068
01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:19.970
<v Speaker 2>you start thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't I remember where I put my </v>

2069
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.970
<v Speaker 2>fucking car keys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2070
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:21.930
<v Speaker 2>is that normal absentmindedness or am I </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing a year now?</v>

2071
01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2072
01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:26.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a real concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still safer than boxing.</v>

2073
01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:27.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean by far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right east,</v>

2074
01:30:27.811 --> 01:30:29.550
<v Speaker 2>supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2075
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.430
<v Speaker 2>because boxing has less options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2076
01:30:32.490 --> 01:30:33.480
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one,</v>

2077
01:30:33.481 --> 01:30:36.090
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't clench in a boxing match.</v>

2078
01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:41.090
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't take out of the ground if </v>

2079
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.090
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck in a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2080
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:44.640
<v Speaker 2>as far as repetitive head trauma goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>though it depends how your training your</v>

2081
01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:49.670
<v Speaker 2>training is what's really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of boxers who are very </v>

2082
01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:52.341
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't train that hard or as far as </v>

2083
01:30:52.341 --> 01:30:52.341
<v Speaker 2>a sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't spar hard.</v>

2084
01:30:52.341 --> 01:30:53.460
<v Speaker 2>They spar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they'll,</v>

2085
01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:56.880
<v Speaker 2>they'll get good sparring partners in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the box.</v>

2086
01:30:56.881 --> 01:30:59.880
<v Speaker 2>It like a 50 60 percent ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2087
01:30:59.881 --> 01:31:01.980
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't try to murder each other.</v>

2088
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Whereas there's a lot of mma gyms where </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are trying to merge of it and that </v>

2089
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.880
<v Speaker 2>not sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take place with boxing </v>

2090
01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:10.880
<v Speaker 2>because there's some camps where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly does,</v>

2091
01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.661
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part if you're watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>a high end boxing camp where there's a </v>

2092
01:31:14.661 --> 01:31:16.650
<v Speaker 2>lot of money on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having good,</v>

2093
01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:18.590
<v Speaker 2>hard sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

2094
01:31:18.591 --> 01:31:20.880
<v Speaker 2>they're also working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working on,</v>

2095
01:31:20.881 --> 01:31:25.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy imitating a certain style or you </v>

2096
01:31:25.881 --> 01:31:29.491
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting a certain amount of pressure on </v>

2097
01:31:29.491 --> 01:31:29.491
<v Speaker 2>a fighter or whatever you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2098
01:31:29.491 --> 01:31:29.491
<v Speaker 2>in the high end camp.</v>

2099
01:31:29.491 --> 01:31:30.130
<v Speaker 2>If you're dealing with floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>

2100
01:31:30.131 --> 01:31:32.430
<v Speaker 2>camper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere along anywhere in that range.</v>

2101
01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:35.040
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a strategy to it.</v>

2102
01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.610
<v Speaker 2>In mma you have a bunch of gems like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2103
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:42.390
<v Speaker 2>but then you also have a massive amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of gyms where people just sort of making</v>

2104
01:31:42.391 --> 01:31:44.790
<v Speaker 2>it up as they go along and they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the harder you go,</v>

2105
01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:46.590
<v Speaker 2>the better it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's go hard.</v>

2106
01:31:46.591 --> 01:31:51.591
<v Speaker 2>We're bad asses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going hard every day and they'll </v>

2107
01:31:51.591 --> 01:31:51.591
<v Speaker 2>go hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even to the head.</v>

2108
01:31:51.591 --> 01:31:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Like we had boss route nine yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was talking about a holland </v>

2109
01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:56.060
<v Speaker 2>style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sparring.</v>

2110
01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.870
<v Speaker 2>They would go full blast the body into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the legs,</v>

2111
01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 2>but to the head they would punches </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they realize,</v>

2112
01:32:00.341 --> 01:32:05.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're damaging each other in a lot of </v>

2113
01:32:05.341 --> 01:32:07.300
<v Speaker 2>the less experience mma gyms or the less</v>
<v Speaker 2>well-structured mma gyms.</v>

2114
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.010
<v Speaker 2>They don't realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>

2115
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:14.310
<v Speaker 2>they're punching each other full blast </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face and training and they're </v>

2116
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.310
<v Speaker 2>fucking each other up.</v>

2117
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2118
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 2>And then that up it adds up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

2119
01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:21.451
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't add up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll get a guy like alistair </v>

2120
01:32:21.451 --> 01:32:24.601
<v Speaker 2>overeem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been stopped something like nine </v>

2121
01:32:24.601 --> 01:32:24.601
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even 10.</v>

2122
01:32:24.601 --> 01:32:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I think this might be the 10th time has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been stopped.</v>

2123
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:28.000
<v Speaker 2>And his career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bigfoot fight,</v>

2124
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:33.510
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of times man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of times of the fight being </v>

2125
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:36.820
<v Speaker 2>stopped from you getting punched too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many times where you're just guns,</v>

2126
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not supposed to get nine of those</v>

2127
01:32:40.751 --> 01:32:41.730
<v Speaker 2>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2128
01:32:41.731 --> 01:32:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't think in it's supposed to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>one actually has an awful lot.</v>

2129
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you watch and you watch it.</v>

2130
01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:53.821
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a few of those you watch it start </v>

2131
01:32:53.821 --> 01:32:53.821
<v Speaker 2>to affect their ability to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

2132
01:32:53.821 --> 01:32:53.821
<v Speaker 2>they're not the same guy out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2133
01:32:53.821 --> 01:32:58.490
<v Speaker 2>it certainly does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially if they're not involved </v>

2134
01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:02.710
<v Speaker 2>in any testosterone replacement therapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things about,</v>

2135
01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:03.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2136
01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that trauma is,</v>

2137
01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:10.710
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of studies that show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it starts to shut down your </v>

2138
01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:12.000
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like multiple concussions than it.</v>

2139
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shuts down.</v>

2140
01:33:13.211 --> 01:33:18.211
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does A lot of damage to your </v>

2141
01:33:18.211 --> 01:33:19.801
<v Speaker 2>pituitary that apparently the pituitary </v>
<v Speaker 2>is quite sensitive to concussive blows </v>

2142
01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:25.620
<v Speaker 2>and when you get blasted a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times they've shown that it starts to </v>

2143
01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:26.230
<v Speaker 2>lower your testosterone and start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make us depressed.</v>

2144
01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:31.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that makes you </v>

2145
01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:31.980
<v Speaker 2>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2146
01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's a scary thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for a guy like you,</v>

2147
01:33:33.461 --> 01:33:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure who's you make your living with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

2148
01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2149
01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to get back into some </v>

2150
01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.590
<v Speaker 2>like mna bootcamp and stuff and they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little crop of guys.</v>

2151
01:33:42.591 --> 01:33:46.720
<v Speaker 2>San francisco had an mma course and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was having a ball doing that,</v>

2152
01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:49.090
<v Speaker 2>but I was not not going to get hit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head.</v>

2153
01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2154
01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.670
<v Speaker 2>that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my business.</v>

2155
01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:54.790
<v Speaker 2>And then when they actually did spar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got hit about three times.</v>

2156
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I never saw punch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't process that.</v>

2157
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you just did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see anything.</v>

2158
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grappling.</v>

2159
01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I can do all god damn day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't see punches.</v>

2160
01:34:03.881 --> 01:34:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Well the key is you got to do only with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who you really totally trust.</v>

2162
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.520
<v Speaker 2>You got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard if you do it with strangers or</v>

2163
01:34:12.521 --> 01:34:16.120
<v Speaker 2>if you do it with a guy who's got a chip</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the shoulder,</v>

2164
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:21.270
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guys just tagged them lightly and </v>

2165
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.700
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you're in a war that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2166
01:34:21.701 --> 01:34:22.720
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

2167
01:34:22.721 --> 01:34:26.770
<v Speaker 2>The istop sparring partner and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time guys don't,</v>

2168
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.590
<v Speaker 2>most time they just engaged in the war </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the spark writer.</v>

2169
01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:30.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't stop them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2170
01:34:30.941 --> 01:34:35.941
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not because you don't trust him </v>

2171
01:34:35.941 --> 01:34:35.941
<v Speaker 2>now because now he's swinging at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>full blast.</v>

2172
01:34:35.941 --> 01:34:37.290
<v Speaker 2>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2173
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:39.850
<v Speaker 2>that was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2174
01:34:39.851 --> 01:34:44.851
<v Speaker 2>I think that was one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems in mma in the early days of,</v>

2175
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts camps with guys </v>

2176
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.461
<v Speaker 2>getting beat up too much in the gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they ever even gotten to the </v>

2177
01:34:53.461 --> 01:34:53.510
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2178
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.370
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2179
01:34:54.371 --> 01:34:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you wonder what is that?</v>

2180
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of those things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into.</v>

2181
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v Speaker 4>Bell outnet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that galactic football league series I </v>

2182
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:05.300
<v Speaker 4>told you about his size,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speed and strength continue to increase.</v>

2183
01:35:05.301 --> 01:35:08.540
<v Speaker 4>Now we're seeing things in the nfl where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2184
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:13.590
<v Speaker 4>it's basic physics and you can put all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the patting you on around a guy unless </v>

2185
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:14.900
<v Speaker 4>they do something drastic to improve </v>
<v Speaker 4>that helmet.</v>

2186
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:18.590
<v Speaker 4>When you get more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more force that is on bigger,</v>

2187
01:35:18.591 --> 01:35:23.591
<v Speaker 4>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stronger bodies are going to produce </v>

2188
01:35:23.591 --> 01:35:25.181
<v Speaker 4>more force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That brain bounces around inside the </v>

2189
01:35:25.181 --> 01:35:27.311
<v Speaker 4>head and when you project football </v>
<v Speaker 4>players out to the four and 500 pound </v>

2190
01:35:27.311 --> 01:35:27.920
<v Speaker 4>size and fighters up to the 400 pound </v>
<v Speaker 4>size,</v>

2191
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:31.520
<v Speaker 4>it's something you try and try and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>into that.</v>

2192
01:35:31.521 --> 01:35:36.521
<v Speaker 4>In the fiction itself too is like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the average career like when </v>

2193
01:35:36.521 --> 01:35:39.881
<v Speaker 4>you're getting hit on a regular basis by</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that can bench press 1500 </v>

2194
01:35:39.881 --> 01:35:43.661
<v Speaker 4>pounds and can run 30 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Careers like through three seasons tops </v>

2195
01:35:43.661 --> 01:35:44.330
<v Speaker 4>and then you're just the vegetable.</v>

2196
01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.360
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing you can unless you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the head and create some kind of </v>

2197
01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:49.610
<v Speaker 4>additional structure between the brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the skull.</v>

2198
01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:54.611
<v Speaker 4>There's only so much that they can do </v>
<v Speaker 4>other than change the rules to stop so </v>

2199
01:35:54.611 --> 01:35:54.710
<v Speaker 4>much damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>

2200
01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in yOur fiction ever create some other </v>

2201
01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:00.320
<v Speaker 4>sort of protective wear that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>would wear?</v>

2202
01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:05.321
<v Speaker 4>Or did you issue it altoGether?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is what a lot of people think </v>

2203
01:36:05.321 --> 01:36:08.420
<v Speaker 4>would be the solution to stop a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the head butting each other and smashing</v>

2204
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:12.020
<v Speaker 4>heads will be given to the helmets that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time I heard that I'm like,</v>

2205
01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:13.940
<v Speaker 4>that's the dumbest thing I ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>

2206
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.980
<v Speaker 4>And then then I started to think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it a little bit.</v>

2207
01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:16.640
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2208
01:36:16.641 --> 01:36:20.690
<v Speaker 4>rugby does not have the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same kind of contact rugby.</v>

2209
01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:23.600
<v Speaker 4>You do not get a 15 yard headstart and </v>
<v Speaker 4>take someone out of the picture,</v>

2210
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:25.180
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2211
01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:28.880
<v Speaker 4>a very rough and very physical and yet </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't take to impact.</v>

2212
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:30.260
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And football players do.</v>

2213
01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 4>I do some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the magic hand waving with that.</v>

2214
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:32.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2215
01:36:32.691 --> 01:36:37.691
<v Speaker 4>this new helmet technology protects </v>
<v Speaker 4>against this much and then you just </v>

2216
01:36:37.691 --> 01:36:37.691
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't explain it because if we could</v>

2217
01:36:37.691 --> 01:36:38.270
<v Speaker 4>explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd be doing it right now.</v>

2218
01:36:38.271 --> 01:36:41.630
<v Speaker 4>So there it is taken into account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the main character,</v>

2219
01:36:41.631 --> 01:36:43.520
<v Speaker 4>quentin barnes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the seven book series.</v>

2220
01:36:43.521 --> 01:36:48.521
<v Speaker 4>We've got four books done and by book </v>
<v Speaker 4>five he's already starting to feel the </v>

2221
01:36:48.521 --> 01:36:48.530
<v Speaker 4>effects of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2222
01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:53.531
<v Speaker 4>I stand in the pocket and if I do my job</v>
<v Speaker 4>right sometimes in getting rid of the </v>

2223
01:36:53.531 --> 01:36:57.341
<v Speaker 4>ball and standing there when something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that weighs 800 pounds is hitting me as </v>

2224
01:36:57.341 --> 01:37:01.631
<v Speaker 4>hard as it can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you get paid to do and it's </v>

2225
01:37:01.631 --> 01:37:02.570
<v Speaker 4>going to start impacting him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm excited about that.</v>

2226
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.760
<v Speaker 4>The last three books start to get into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the character analysis.</v>

2227
01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.390
<v Speaker 4>what happens when a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a,</v>

2228
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:09.950
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate professional athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the top of his game,</v>

2229
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:12.920
<v Speaker 4>things don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't processing as fast anymore and he</v>

2230
01:37:12.921 --> 01:37:17.921
<v Speaker 4>can't make the decisions as quick as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could in his reads aren't quite as good </v>

2231
01:37:17.921 --> 01:37:17.921
<v Speaker 4>as they were before and his body's </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to hurt.</v>

2232
01:37:17.921 --> 01:37:22.690
<v Speaker 4>So follow them all the way from a 19 </v>
<v Speaker 4>year old rookie through this league to </v>

2233
01:37:22.690 --> 01:37:23.170
<v Speaker 4>the point where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at some point he's going to have to make</v>

2234
01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:25.700
<v Speaker 4>a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I continue to play and do what I love</v>

2235
01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:30.730
<v Speaker 4>and die doing what I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is admirable and going to die </v>

2236
01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:30.730
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whY not?</v>

2237
01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Or do you look to the future and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2238
01:37:31.491 --> 01:37:33.350
<v Speaker 4>what are the next 40 years of my life </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna be like.</v>

2239
01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:38.440
<v Speaker 4>So it's gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a huge influence in the book as to </v>

2240
01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:41.441
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen when you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop and think about what an actual </v>

2241
01:37:41.441 --> 01:37:44.651
<v Speaker 4>football player today a 310 pound man </v>
<v Speaker 4>who can run like,</v>

2242
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:48.830
<v Speaker 4>like literally like a track star of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>19 thirties.</v>

2243
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you stop and think about the kind </v>

2244
01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.991
<v Speaker 4>of damage they can do and you sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>look towards the future and a thousand </v>

2245
01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.560
<v Speaker 4>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2000 years from now,</v>

2246
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:01.170
<v Speaker 4>when this drastic changes happening just</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last 50,</v>

2247
01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:02.940
<v Speaker 4>60 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's unbelievable.</v>

2248
01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:07.980
<v Speaker 4>You look at where the guys are a third </v>
<v Speaker 4>larger than they used to be in just 50 </v>

2249
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:09.420
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you extrapolate that out.</v>

2250
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course there's genetic and </v>

2251
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.470
<v Speaker 4>physical limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as jeanette,</v>

2252
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:18.890
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as nutrition improves and science </v>

2253
01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:20.631
<v Speaker 4>improves and genetic engineering proves </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to wind up in the future </v>

2254
01:38:20.631 --> 01:38:21.240
<v Speaker 4>pro sports a couple centuries now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pro sport,</v>

2255
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:21.820
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2256
01:38:21.821 --> 01:38:26.821
<v Speaker 4>they're not even going to look human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna look like a different </v>

2257
01:38:26.821 --> 01:38:28.401
<v Speaker 4>species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I came up with the idea for </v>

2258
01:38:28.401 --> 01:38:29.841
<v Speaker 4>the book is um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to be able to do a little stuff </v>

2259
01:38:29.841 --> 01:38:33.081
<v Speaker 4>for espn when I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like manage the teams coming off the </v>

2260
01:38:33.081 --> 01:38:33.540
<v Speaker 4>field or hold a dish and that kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2261
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:38.870
<v Speaker 4>And I has 126 pounds and Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michigan state's a giant football game </v>

2262
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:39.630
<v Speaker 4>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's huge.</v>

2263
01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:45.060
<v Speaker 4>Espn is there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my producer out and I'm on the </v>

2264
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.631
<v Speaker 4>headset with him and he's gotten me </v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing the teams out of the out of </v>

2265
01:38:47.631 --> 01:38:48.570
<v Speaker 4>their dressing room and then he starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>screwing with me because I'm 19,</v>

2266
01:38:48.571 --> 01:38:49.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know any better and he's in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>ears.</v>

2267
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:54.950
<v Speaker 4>You wanT to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they don't come out at the right </v>

2268
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.950
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>espn is going to lose $5,</v>

2269
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:55.530
<v Speaker 4>million dollars of advertising and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be on you.</v>

2270
01:38:55.830 --> 01:39:00.830
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was fucking with me because he could </v>

2271
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.830
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't know any better and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>like so stressed out.</v>

2272
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:05.780
<v Speaker 4>And then let Michigan state out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>locker room at the point time and all </v>

2273
01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:08.370
<v Speaker 4>these giant human beings are coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then as they're coming out,</v>

2274
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:13.910
<v Speaker 4>they're running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walking by the door to the Michigan </v>

2275
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.910
<v Speaker 4>locker room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michigan.</v>

2276
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:14.950
<v Speaker 4>The door lock room door opens up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing in the doors.</v>

2277
01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scrap neck.</v>

2278
01:39:15.721 --> 01:39:16.680
<v Speaker 4>You ever heard of hIm?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2279
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:17.550
<v Speaker 4>He was six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>

2280
01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:19.220
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three 60.</v>

2281
01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:20.370
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was an.</v>

2282
01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.990
<v Speaker 4>It was a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giant man.</v>

2283
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:25.070
<v Speaker 4>Plus he's got all the gear on and I'm on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like.</v>

2284
01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 4>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little tinY thing,</v>

2285
01:39:26.611 --> 01:39:27.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2286
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.620
<v Speaker 4>oh hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michigan is going to come out.</v>

2287
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:33.770
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't let them come out of that </v>

2288
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.770
<v Speaker 4>locker room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what you have to do.</v>

2289
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:37.410
<v Speaker 4>And so I remember he's a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's sIx foot eight.</v>

2290
01:39:37.411 --> 01:39:39.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm five [inaudible] eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 125 pounds and uh,</v>

2291
01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:43.200
<v Speaker 4>and he goes to step out and I just put </v>
<v Speaker 4>my hand right right on the sternum.</v>

2292
01:39:43.201 --> 01:39:46.020
<v Speaker 4>I just stiff arm them and what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop right there.</v>

2293
01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:47.940
<v Speaker 4>you guys can't come out of that locked </v>
<v Speaker 4>room yet.</v>

2294
01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:52.560
<v Speaker 4>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he looked confused like,</v>

2295
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.630
<v Speaker 4>who is this little person?</v>

2296
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.110
<v Speaker 4>And he managed to wait and all the guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>were behind him and he managed wait just</v>

2297
01:39:58.111 --> 01:39:59.410
<v Speaker 4>long enough for Michigan state to come </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2298
01:39:59.411 --> 01:40:00.900
<v Speaker 4>And then I got out of the way and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>came out.</v>

2299
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.200
<v Speaker 4>but I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote the whole concept of the book </v>

2300
01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:08.561
<v Speaker 4>and that one moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole gfl series I had my hand on </v>

2301
01:40:08.561 --> 01:40:11.301
<v Speaker 4>this guy's here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My nose came up to his sternum and I </v>

2302
01:40:11.301 --> 01:40:11.301
<v Speaker 4>remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2303
01:40:11.301 --> 01:40:11.850
<v Speaker 4>it's like he's a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>species than me.</v>

2304
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:14.940
<v Speaker 4>And that was an after that I went home </v>
<v Speaker 4>and started writing that book.</v>

2305
01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Like what if we have different species </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing football?</v>

2306
01:40:17.131 --> 01:40:19.410
<v Speaker 4>And the whole thing blew up from there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

2307
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.850
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2308
01:40:20.851 --> 01:40:25.851
<v Speaker 4>I'm lucky I'm alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really are like completely </v>

2309
01:40:25.851 --> 01:40:26.390
<v Speaker 4>different species if you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 4>those super athletes,</v>

2310
01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:28.410
<v Speaker 4>football players.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're,</v>

2311
01:40:28.411 --> 01:40:30.600
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're getting some really enormous,</v>

2312
01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.000
<v Speaker 4>enormous human beings now in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>combine.</v>

2313
01:40:33.001 --> 01:40:34.460
<v Speaker 4>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I may have read this incorrectly.</v>

2314
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 4>They had three guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three offensive lineman,</v>

2315
01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.470
<v Speaker 4>300,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 pounds who ran for six forties.</v>

2316
01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:45.500
<v Speaker 4>If I stand still and they run at me and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit me like that,</v>

2317
01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.510
<v Speaker 4>dead on impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how much force is involved.</v>

2318
01:40:48.630 --> 01:40:49.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm just dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing you can do.</v>

2319
01:40:49.981 --> 01:40:52.080
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how many of these,</v>

2320
01:40:52.081 --> 01:40:57.081
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and coming players are more aware of </v>

2321
01:40:57.081 --> 01:40:57.610
<v Speaker 4>the risks now because of the past few </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

2322
01:40:57.611 --> 01:41:00.310
<v Speaker 4>all the different stories that have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out about players,</v>

2323
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.810
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>post,</v>

2324
01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:05.980
<v Speaker 4>post career suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>veterans probably are.</v>

2325
01:41:05.981 --> 01:41:10.981
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you are 22 years old and someone's </v>

2326
01:41:10.981 --> 01:41:11.050
<v Speaker 4>paying you hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars to play football and that's been</v>

2327
01:41:11.051 --> 01:41:13.660
<v Speaker 4>your dream your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still 22 in your bulletproof.</v>

2328
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:17.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that the rules have to come in </v>
<v Speaker 4>to adjust behavior.</v>

2329
01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:19.780
<v Speaker 4>It has to be run from the top down </v>
<v Speaker 4>because these,</v>

2330
01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:20.680
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2331
01:41:20.681 --> 01:41:23.470
<v Speaker 4>you were 22 and then if I was playing in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nfl,</v>

2332
01:41:23.471 --> 01:41:24.550
<v Speaker 4>there's nobody can tell me anything.</v>

2333
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:27.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go hit that motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard as I possibly can.</v>

2334
01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.770
<v Speaker 4>That's how I make my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I make my money.</v>

2335
01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:32.230
<v Speaker 4>That's how people know me because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who brings the heat.</v>

2336
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:37.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never gonna stop from the players </v>

2337
01:41:37.770 --> 01:41:37.770
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you start to think,</v>

2338
01:41:37.770 --> 01:41:37.870
<v Speaker 4>what if I get hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get out,</v>

2339
01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:40.780
<v Speaker 4>but I won't get hurt too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be smart.</v>

2340
01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:42.130
<v Speaker 4>They also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2341
01:41:42.131 --> 01:41:47.131
<v Speaker 4>try and remember back to that age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is this rationalization of maybe </v>

2342
01:41:47.131 --> 01:41:47.380
<v Speaker 4>I'll get hurt and won't be quite as </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart.</v>

2343
01:41:47.381 --> 01:41:51.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to pay that price in order </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have this moment right now.</v>

2344
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:54.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to give up years down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road and at 22,</v>

2345
01:41:54.551 --> 01:41:55.240
<v Speaker 4>23,</v>
<v Speaker 4>24,</v>

2346
01:41:55.241 --> 01:41:57.610
<v Speaker 4>that is a perfectly rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>logical decision.</v>

2347
01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:58.420
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2348
01:41:58.421 --> 01:42:01.150
<v Speaker 4>this makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not until you get 20 years down the</v>

2349
01:42:01.151 --> 01:42:01.450
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2350
01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.480
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad I didn't get any brain damage </v>

2351
01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:06.480
<v Speaker 4>that would suck right now.</v>

2352
01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:08.410
<v Speaker 4>It's also a thing when you're 22 and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>love playing football.</v>

2353
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing.</v>

2354
01:42:09.371 --> 01:42:12.220
<v Speaker 4>It's so very fucking exciting thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do as a,</v>

2355
01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:14.470
<v Speaker 4>as his mma finding as is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2356
01:42:14.471 --> 01:42:16.690
<v Speaker 4>a lot of murder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain motocross riding.</v>

2357
01:42:16.691 --> 01:42:21.691
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of crazy dangerous things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people really enjoy doing and </v>

2358
01:42:21.691 --> 01:42:25.681
<v Speaker 4>ultimately that's really our choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should we should have that across the </v>

2359
01:42:25.681 --> 01:42:27.160
<v Speaker 4>board.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're hard wired to go out and seek that</v>

2360
01:42:27.161 --> 01:42:28.990
<v Speaker 4>kind of danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Evolutionarily speaking.</v>

2361
01:42:28.991 --> 01:42:32.080
<v Speaker 4>We're hardwired to go out like we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go get into life and death situations</v>

2362
01:42:32.081 --> 01:42:33.250
<v Speaker 4>to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to defend,</v>

2363
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:38.640
<v Speaker 4>to fight off other tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the people who have those instincts </v>

2364
01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:39.940
<v Speaker 4>are the people who wound up living in </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproducing and passing that on.</v>

2365
01:42:40.150 --> 01:42:41.260
<v Speaker 4>So as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2366
01:42:41.290 --> 01:42:44.830
<v Speaker 4>18 to 27 year old male,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are hard wired for war.</v>

2367
01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:46.390
<v Speaker 4>That is what in a lot of guys aren't.</v>

2368
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:48.850
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of guys have that.</v>

2369
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:53.910
<v Speaker 4>That's what they inherited is like let's</v>
<v Speaker 4>go out and kill some shit and that's in </v>

2370
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:54.430
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had that in me.</v>

2371
01:42:54.431 --> 01:42:55.810
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't very good at because I was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>small.</v>

2372
01:42:55.811 --> 01:42:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling was a good outlet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2373
01:42:57.730 --> 01:43:02.730
<v Speaker 4>you know what that feeling is like and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these kinds of activities provide a </v>

2374
01:43:02.730 --> 01:43:04.150
<v Speaker 4>safe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rational outlet for those things.</v>

2375
01:43:04.151 --> 01:43:06.160
<v Speaker 4>But it's in there and it's going to come</v>
<v Speaker 4>out one way or another.</v>

2376
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For a lot of men.</v>

2377
01:43:07.841 --> 01:43:09.070
<v Speaker 4>So mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then again,</v>

2378
01:43:09.071 --> 01:43:14.071
<v Speaker 4>like as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some don't have it in them for a lot of </v>

2379
01:43:14.071 --> 01:43:14.071
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2380
01:43:14.071 --> 01:43:18.020
<v Speaker 4>that's a real issue because it's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>just you have a whole reward system set </v>

2381
01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:22.051
<v Speaker 4>up and your dna that you have no control</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and you have all these things that </v>

2382
01:43:22.051 --> 01:43:26.041
<v Speaker 4>you enjoy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's very little outlet for it when </v>

2383
01:43:26.041 --> 01:43:26.170
<v Speaker 4>you're working in a cubicle and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>

2384
01:43:26.170 --> 01:43:30.580
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to make your body a free of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the influence of all these interesting.</v>

2385
01:43:30.610 --> 01:43:32.260
<v Speaker 4>There's things that can't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationalized.</v>

2386
01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.550
<v Speaker 4>There's just things you cAnnot explain </v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

2387
01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:39.570
<v Speaker 4>Like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I used to wrestle and finally got </v>

2388
01:43:39.570 --> 01:43:40.930
<v Speaker 4>to compete against people my own size </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I played football too and played</v>

2389
01:43:40.931 --> 01:43:42.280
<v Speaker 4>as hard as I could and did everything he</v>
<v Speaker 4>could.</v>

2390
01:43:42.281 --> 01:43:43.720
<v Speaker 4>But I got my ass kicked away a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>

2391
01:43:43.721 --> 01:43:44.620
<v Speaker 4>100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 pounds.</v>

2392
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.560
<v Speaker 4>When I wrestled going up against guys my</v>
<v Speaker 4>own weight,</v>

2393
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:49.330
<v Speaker 4>I was able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2394
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:54.760
<v Speaker 4>dominate people and just things like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cross face or it's a,</v>

2395
01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:56.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of mean to say.</v>

2396
01:43:56.171 --> 01:44:01.171
<v Speaker 4>I guess one of the greatest feelings of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole life is I suplex the kid and </v>

2397
01:44:01.171 --> 01:44:02.590
<v Speaker 4>broke his collarbone and when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I brought him up,</v>

2398
01:44:02.591 --> 01:44:04.330
<v Speaker 4>put him back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he ran his collarbone and broken.</v>

2399
01:44:04.331 --> 01:44:07.720
<v Speaker 4>He just stuck there and it was utterly </v>
<v Speaker 4>primitive.</v>

2400
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:08.730
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2401
01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:11.020
<v Speaker 4>why would you be happy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just heard another human being.</v>

2402
01:44:11.050 --> 01:44:12.280
<v Speaker 4>He was a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew him.</v>

2403
01:44:12.281 --> 01:44:17.281
<v Speaker 4>He's a nice guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I that that for that brief </v>

2404
01:44:17.281 --> 01:44:17.281
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>

2405
01:44:17.281 --> 01:44:18.790
<v Speaker 4>all the chemistry inside and everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>else is like,</v>

2406
01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.560
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how you do it.</v>

2407
01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:21.100
<v Speaker 4>Does that help</v>

2408
01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:23.720
<v Speaker 2>pew and you're writing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing something like ancestor,</v>

2409
01:44:23.721 --> 01:44:24.500
<v Speaker 2>when you're writing about</v>

2410
01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:27.910
<v Speaker 4>this crazy gigantic pack predator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get into it.</v>

2411
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:31.030
<v Speaker 4>I get into it a ton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in the new book pandemic.</v>

2412
01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:35.740
<v Speaker 4>The thought process is we are a modified</v>
<v Speaker 4>by society.</v>

2413
01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:38.650
<v Speaker 4>We have a set of rules that we live by a</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain comradery,</v>

2414
01:44:38.651 --> 01:44:40.840
<v Speaker 4>helping out our fellow man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>helping our fellow women,</v>

2415
01:44:41.170 --> 01:44:42.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2416
01:44:42.161 --> 01:44:42.620
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2417
01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.120
<v Speaker 4>and are growing culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the growing equality of women.</v>

2418
01:44:46.121 --> 01:44:48.790
<v Speaker 4>And there's no need to be a douche bag </v>
<v Speaker 4>law by and large.</v>

2419
01:44:48.791 --> 01:44:52.210
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to Be a douche bag to and</v>
<v Speaker 4>get along just fine being a good guy and</v>

2420
01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:57.300
<v Speaker 4>then take these people who are aspiring </v>
<v Speaker 4>to become these better people who are </v>

2421
01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.470
<v Speaker 4>genuinely good people and then put them </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the pressure cooker.</v>

2422
01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:03.090
<v Speaker 4>When you start to get into it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you and me,</v>

2423
01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:04.240
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are both in this room,</v>

2424
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:09.270
<v Speaker 4>but if I get out that door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to live and you're going to </v>

2425
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.270
<v Speaker 4>die and if we both here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stay here together,</v>

2426
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:11.470
<v Speaker 4>we might both die and there's a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 4>chance in my.</v>

2427
01:45:12.010 --> 01:45:16.150
<v Speaker 4>That's what I play with a lot is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>what does a person do when their life is</v>

2428
01:45:16.151 --> 01:45:21.151
<v Speaker 4>actually on the line and there comes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation they have absolutely no </v>

2429
01:45:21.151 --> 01:45:22.450
<v Speaker 4>control over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do we regress to that lizard brain?</v>

2430
01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Do we start looking out for number one </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't get into it too much like I </v>

2431
01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.360
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You protect your kids,</v>

2432
01:45:28.361 --> 01:45:29.860
<v Speaker 4>you protect your family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy,</v>

2433
01:45:29.861 --> 01:45:31.470
<v Speaker 4>you've known him for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you two are gonna,</v>

2434
01:45:31.471 --> 01:45:36.471
<v Speaker 4>you know you're going down together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's largely when the strangers are </v>

2435
01:45:36.471 --> 01:45:38.080
<v Speaker 4>brought together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a small amount of time to gel to get</v>

2436
01:45:38.081 --> 01:45:40.270
<v Speaker 4>to know each other so it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely alien.</v>

2437
01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.330
<v Speaker 4>It's itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2438
01:45:41.331 --> 01:45:46.331
<v Speaker 4>it's one of my group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then bring in the 650 pound pack </v>

2439
01:45:46.331 --> 01:45:46.390
<v Speaker 4>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens?</v>

2440
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:47.740
<v Speaker 4>What do these characters do?</v>

2441

<v Speaker 2>That sounds awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2445
01:45:59.171 --> 01:46:02.171
<v Speaker 2>actualized by going out and putting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>online yourself and reading your own </v>

2446
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:05.510
<v Speaker 2>books and putting it out in an audio </v>
