00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I taught fourth grade and now those kids are grown up and that's really cool</v>

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>because some of them told me it was the best year of their lives.</v>

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>They come to see me do stand up.</v>

6
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:12.991
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

8
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:13.411
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.</v>

9
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Will you teach and what worth it took everything but fourth grade is different</v>

10
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:18.211
<v Speaker 1>than science.</v>

11
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

12
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:19.381
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

14
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>it's different than what you did because you went to people who had an interest</v>

15
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>and a love for something and wanted to explore it what you were doing.</v>

16
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>But mine is different.</v>

17
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>They had to be there.</v>

18
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>So my thing was self doubt,</v>

19
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:32.724
<v Speaker 1>self esteem.</v>

20
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I figured I can't teach them.</v>

21
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>These subjects are going to come and go in their lives,</v>

22
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>but teaching them self esteem and some of the most rewarding things were like</v>

23
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.951
<v Speaker 1>had this one kid,</v>

24
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>he was real shy,</v>

25
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.513
<v Speaker 1>so shy.</v>

26
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>He was real tall and he was embarrassed by it and he would stay in the.</v>

27
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>In the cloak room,</v>

28
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>they'd call it a,</v>

29
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>we're all the coats and you just stay in there.</v>

31
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:51.811
<v Speaker 1>It will come out.</v>

32
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

33

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>they can't stay,</v>

37
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't let a kid just sit and,</v>

38
00:00:59.121 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>and by the end of me just like work in his self esteem and all,</v>

40
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>he was in the middle of the class,</v>

41
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>just what everybody else waving his hand and his mother came up to me and she</v>

42

<v Speaker 1>I want to go to the gym.</v>

81

93
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.840

<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Darwish.</v>

123
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Trying to establish boundaries.</v>

124
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.961
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said,</v>

125
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>why do you feel young?</v>

126
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

127
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 2>because I can come on.</v>

128
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that becoming more aware or reaching a higher state of</v>

129
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.100
<v Speaker 2>consciousness because of your experiences will actually help you because it'll</v>

130
00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>abandoned a lot of the distractions that you present yourself almost</v>

131
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.824
<v Speaker 2>unknowingly.</v>

132
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

134
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.571
<v Speaker 2>it helps me.</v>

135
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 2>It helps me in training and particularly when I'm running now because I used to</v>

136
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:31.261
<v Speaker 2>listen to like Pantera and disorder when I was running and I worked myself into</v>

137
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 2>like a rage so I would run into exhaustion.</v>

138
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 2>That was kinda how I trained and I trained all the way through my career like</v>

139
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>that and the last couple of fights,</v>

140
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.311
<v Speaker 2>so sweet stuff.</v>

141
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I listened to a lot more like,</v>

142
00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 2>like more like buying binaural beat type of stuff when I'm running so I could</v>

143
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.340
<v Speaker 2>get into more like a meditative stage,</v>

144
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 2>doing a lot of yoga as well and trying to find the same thing where you just,</v>

146
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

147
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

148
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.470
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

149
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you're within yourself and you're not focusing on anything else.</v>

150
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 2>So your body's almost like on autopilot.</v>

151
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

152
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.581
<v Speaker 2>That the music that you listened to when you train can have a profound effect on</v>

153
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:03.791
<v Speaker 2>my approach.</v>

154
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Your training.</v>

155
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.633
<v Speaker 2>It really can.</v>

157
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 2>It's so important and that's why I've always been so vocal about all this stuff</v>

158
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I listen to like I'd like training camp playlist,</v>

159
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 2>so I tweet everyday trump songs I was listening to and that kind of thing is</v>

160
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

161
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.311
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

162
00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:16.471
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

163
00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing as well,</v>

164
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 2>like earlier on in my career,</v>

165
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I would use music to anchor feelings.</v>

166
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

167
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.110
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

168
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>when I fought Ludwig I used the song called Ian by Woodkid,</v>

170
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 2>which was the first time I'd switched it from Angola belongs to me for like,</v>

171
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of fives.</v>

173
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

174
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 2>so like for the 12 weeks of that fight I was training with Frank Mir,</v>

175
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:35.810
<v Speaker 2>we were going up to read it,</v>

176
00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:39.090
<v Speaker 2>it's up to Mount Charleston and now into red rock and like doing hill running</v>

177
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

178
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And we had some real tough sessions.</v>

179
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

180
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

181
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 2>we're ready to put ourselves through for that training camp and as soon as I got</v>

182
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:45.851
<v Speaker 2>back in my truck,</v>

183
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:46.481
<v Speaker 2>after the session,</v>

184
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.111
<v Speaker 2>after the session,</v>

185
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 2>if I felt like it was a good session that was productive and I felt positive,</v>

186
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I would put that song on and I would say I would constantly connect those</v>

187
00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 2>feelings to that song.</v>

188
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.930
<v Speaker 2>So then when,</v>

189
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 2>when I'm walking out and that song comes on immediately I get that feeling</v>

190
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

191
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

192
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

193
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>

194
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 2>just like when you listen to a sermon,</v>

196
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 2>you think of a person like,</v>

197
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.441
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

198
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I heard that someone was with that person and you made that connection</v>

199
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

200
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 2>But you can also train yourself to do it.</v>

201
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

202
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 2>That's why you like allison to Cypress Hill now.</v>

203
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 2>And it will take me back to fighting in cage warriors like back in 2006.</v>

204
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

205
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>And I have songs all the way through like that and now I don't listen to because</v>

206
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 2>it was like my first two fights.</v>

207
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 2>I came back to Pantera,</v>

208
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 2>drag the waters.</v>

209
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.880
<v Speaker 2>By the time I got to the cage I was so wound up and so angry that I was just run</v>

210
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 2>out of gas immediately.</v>

211
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 2>And now whenever I listened to those songs,</v>

212
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I get that feeling of like exhaustion,</v>

213
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.164
<v Speaker 2>like ugh.</v>

214
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.200
<v Speaker 2>And I look at what's out there.</v>

215
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Some answers make no sense to me and they seem to lead down really unhealthy</v>

216
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:47.850
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

217
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:48.690
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.</v>

218
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.553
<v Speaker 2>But no thanks.</v>

219
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Are there answers?</v>

220
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Make more sense or maybe eight aunt and like I'm happy with my own,</v>

221
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.570
<v Speaker 2>but as bad it really boiled down to the but mostly researcher and experience,</v>

222
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>a rejecting what is useless and absorb what is useful and what specific or</v>

223
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:03.501
<v Speaker 2>you're on,</v>

224
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:03.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 2>he's as you can make the dollar tree for Alpha approach knowledge.</v>

226
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

227
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 2>he applied it to martial arts,</v>

228
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 2>but he's a brilliant way of approach.</v>

229
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Just any kind of knowledge,</v>

230
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.241
<v Speaker 2>whether it's already.</v>

231
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.074
<v Speaker 2>It's about life.</v>

232
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

233
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:17.830
<v Speaker 2>That's hard for people to accept that.</v>

234
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

235
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.550
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

236
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.660
<v Speaker 2>it's much easier to follow the pattern that your family's from Holland.</v>

237
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Lutheran because grandma's Lutheran grandpa always said that no matter</v>

238
00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:26.201
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

239
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:27.250
<v Speaker 2>we will be Lutherans.</v>

240
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

241
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I remember talking to this girl and uh,</v>

242
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.140
<v Speaker 2>she said that she was going to get a tattoo of a cross.</v>

243
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.041
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

244
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:33.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

245
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

246
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

247
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

248
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.680
<v Speaker 2>you're really religious.</v>

249
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.250
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

250
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

251
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.971
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

252
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:37.804
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

253
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.900
<v Speaker 2>I was born Catholic and I figured out that no matter what,</v>

254
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.970
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing that'll be for the rest of my life.</v>

255
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.230
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

256
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

257
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 2>and I remember saying I don't like,</v>

258
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know her very well,</v>

260
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:48.160
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

261
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.993
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

262
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

263
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.500
<v Speaker 2>how do you know,</v>

264
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.711
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

265
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 2>how do you know you won't change your mind about that?</v>

266
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.780
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

267
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

268
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.280
<v Speaker 2>my family would kill me.</v>

269
00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.801
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

270
00:06:58.801 --> 00:06:59.131
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

271
00:06:59.131 --> 00:06:59.401
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

272
00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Well good luck with that.</v>

273
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with that.</v>

274
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.243
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

275
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Yet at war,</v>

276
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.530
<v Speaker 2>war gone different.</v>

277
00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:08.251
<v Speaker 2>There will be people.</v>

278
00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Today's a really nasty,</v>

279
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

280
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.850
<v Speaker 2>if I don't put the trust account,</v>

281
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.713
<v Speaker 2>my grandma would have.</v>

282
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Her feelings will get really hurt and so it's,</v>

283
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate the Jews,</v>

284
00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:19.780
<v Speaker 2>but grandma fucking hates Jews and I love grandma know.</v>

285
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't want to make them sad.</v>

286
00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:24.750
<v Speaker 2>You know what's hilarious is that she was going to get a Catholic tattoo in the</v>

287
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 2>first place because like in the Bible it very specifically says,</v>

288
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.450
<v Speaker 2>so like getting a religious attitude was like,</v>

289
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

290
00:07:33.781 --> 00:07:35.070
<v Speaker 2>you're not listening to me.</v>

291
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

292
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.530
