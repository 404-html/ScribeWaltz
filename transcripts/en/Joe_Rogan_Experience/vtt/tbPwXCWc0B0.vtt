<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

39
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>so I was,</v>

40
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>this is a couple of years ago.</v>

41
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.283
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

42
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I was in the best shape of my life and I was rock climbing like three,</v>

43
00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>four times a week and doing crossfit and all this.</v>

44
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:17.534
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

45
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

46
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I've always been lanky like this my whole life.</v>

47
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And I actually had muscles for the first time in my life and just like felt like</v>

48
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>superman.</v>

49
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

50
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.980
<v Speaker 1>and I was supposed to be rock climbing is on my birthday.</v>

51
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

52
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.750
<v Speaker 1>and there's some fires in Sedona where the rock climbing was supposed to be.</v>

54
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.584
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

55
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>so we went for a hike instead just to see a little bit of Sedona as my first</v>

56
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:38.474
<v Speaker 1>time there.</v>

57
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>And I was out with my friend,</v>

58
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Mikey and he,</v>

60
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

61
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>he was like this,</v>

62
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>he was like three,</v>

63
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>400 pounds,</v>

64
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I think he was like 400 pounds.</v>

65
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>like his whole life,</v>

67
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>he's been a hugely obese.</v>

68
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.040
<v Speaker 1>And then he went on this diet that he just drank coffee with butter in it for</v>

69
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>like 40 days.</v>

70
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.521
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

71
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:05.354
<v Speaker 1>That's all he ate.</v>

72
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>He cracked himself out.</v>

73
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.260
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>

74
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 1>how much did he lose in 40 days?</v>

76
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>So like a thousand pounds,</v>

77
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds.</v>

78
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>He lost all of his weight.</v>

79
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And then he was like a normal person.</v>

80
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>That sounds crazy.</v>

81
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I know it's 200 pounds in 40 days.</v>

82
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was that much.</v>

83
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>It was significant.</v>

84
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>It was like well over a hundred pounds.</v>

85
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

86
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.931
<v Speaker 1>and then he,</v>

88
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.950
<v Speaker 1>so then he started doing like Jujitsu.</v>

89
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.340
<v Speaker 1>It started like becoming active for like the first time in his life and was like</v>

90
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 1>all excited about this.</v>

91
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And so he was like,</v>

92
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.801
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

93
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:40.634
<v Speaker 1>I have this,</v>

94
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 1>there's this one shortcut that I want to take.</v>

95
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

96
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 1>my wife will never let me and so let's,</v>

97
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.090
<v Speaker 1>let's go and do that now.</v>

98
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>And I liked that it let me take a shortcut because it was too high of a jump.</v>

99
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And then I,</v>

100
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>and we got to this and um,</v>

101
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>and I looked and I was like,</v>

102
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:56.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

103
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:57.104
<v Speaker 1>that's too high.</v>

104
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

105
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>so because he's been so huge his whole life,</v>

106
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>he has no idea of how high you can jump from like this,</v>

107
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

109
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>he's never been able to play before.</v>

110
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And I know,</v>

111
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm an adrenaline junkie.</v>

112
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I love heights.</v>

113
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I've been climbing trees and jumping off shit my whole life.</v>

114
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

115
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

116
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>this is too high.</v>

117
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

118
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I think if we like climb down a little,</v>

119
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>it would be okay on like,</v>

120
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:24.454
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

121
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing barefoot running shoes at the time and then he was like determined</v>

122
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:30.350
<v Speaker 1>he was going to do it and high psych.</v>

123
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>So it was jumping from a cliff onto another cliff.</v>

124
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
<v Speaker 1>And so if you couldn't roll and if you landed it wrong and you rolled off,</v>

125
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.220
<v Speaker 1>it was like death,</v>

126
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

127
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.783
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of feet.</v>

128
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.823
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

129
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

130
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>and so now I'm like,</v>

131
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch this guy roll off this cliff because he's new to like</v>

132
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:52.350
<v Speaker 1>physical activity.</v>

133
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.</v>

134
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>And he's about to jump off this thing that's to lie on the other side.</v>

135
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>He's been carrying around an extra hundred plus pounds on his legs his whole</v>

136
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:01.271
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

137
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>His legs would probably strong as hell.</v>

138
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

140
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:03.874
<v Speaker 1>I imagine.</v>

141
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>And it was weird because he had like weird skin,</v>

142
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>like hanging off everywhere.</v>

143
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>It's tough from all from and like stretch marks and stuff.</v>

144
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.971
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

145
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:13.804
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

146
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>so he was,</v>

147
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 1>he was determined and I was like,</v>

148
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at it and I was like,</v>

149
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:18.334
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

150
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that I could make it.</v>

151
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

152
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>and then I can,</v>

153
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I can like at least be there.</v>

154
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>So he makes sure he doesn't roll off this fucking cliff front of me.</v>

155
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

156
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

157
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.141
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

158
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:29.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

159
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:29.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:30.551
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things,</v>

161
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you feel like a fool in hindsight.</v>

162
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.540
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

163
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.061
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

164
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:34.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

166
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I've jumped off stuff higher than this.</v>

167
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just that I'm wearing bad shoes and I can't roll.</v>

168
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to take it with my feet.</v>

169
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.651
<v Speaker 1>And I even told them,</v>

170
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:42.484
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

171
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be risking breaking a heel because I broke a heel once before when</v>

172
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I was like a teenager.</v>

173
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I love jumping off shit.</v>

174
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

175
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

176
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't like the end of the world.</v>

177
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:54.011
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

178
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:54.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:54.690
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

180
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>if I break a heel it won't,</v>

181
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll still be able to get around.</v>

182
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a couple month thing.</v>

183
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:01.121
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

184
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>in my mind this is the worst of what's going to happen.</v>

185
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>And so I went for it and I,</v>

186
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>and I jumped and I landed and um,</v>

187
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

188
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

189
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I landed,</v>

190
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I heard both of my heels break.</v>

191
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.313
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

193
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>the sound shot through my body and I heard it like,</v>

194
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>it sounded like a branch,</v>

195
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>like snapping underwater.</v>

196
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.183
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

197
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

198
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

199
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I think I was in shock or something cause I just kind of turned and looked at</v>

200
00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:30.350
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

201
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.731
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

202
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I just broke both my heels and I said it just like that.</v>

203
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>And so he thought I was like joking.</v>

204
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Speaker 1>So he was just about to do,</v>

205
00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:36.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

206
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:36.641
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

207
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:36.791
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

208
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

209
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I really broke both my heels.</v>

210
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to go around and try to help me down.</v>

211
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>And I started making my way down.</v>

212
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>It took them like a half hour,</v>

213
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes to get to me.</v>

214
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>And I had to kind of,</v>

215
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when you were in school in gym class to be,</v>

217
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>you have to do that crab walk thing where like your bellies facing the air?</v>

218
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

219
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>so I had my left foot just was,</v>

220
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>was already like five times that size within like 30 seconds.</v>

221
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And so I couldn't use that at all.</v>

222
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.650
<v Speaker 1>And then my,</v>

223
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.483
<v Speaker 1>my right foot,</v>

224
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>

225
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even tell if it was totally broken and for if I just bruised it real</v>

226
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:09.801
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

227
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but I was able to use my toes thankfully.</v>

228
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And so I had to kind of like a w one foot crab walk,</v>

229
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

230
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.511
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

231
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>And then he got around to me and was like,</v>

232
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>a couple of people were trying to help me for a little bit,</v>

233
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's too steep for anyone to help me.</v>

234
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>So I just kinda had to make it down on my own once we were at level ground,</v>

235
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>which took like three hours,</v>

236
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

237
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>of just like,</v>

238
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

239
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>it was an exceptionally annoying,</v>

240
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

241
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

242
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was painful.</v>

243
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

244
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd scoot down for a little bit and then I'd have to take a break for a few</v>

245
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:42.763
<v Speaker 1>minutes and just like,</v>

246
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>and then just like roll around in the fetal position and pain and,</v>

247
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:48.584
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

248
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

249
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.853
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

250
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

251
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.153
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

252
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>so this was his dumb idea.</v>

253
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>And on the way down he's just like standing there like next to me waiting for</v>

254
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

255
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>like trying to lighten the mood by telling me jokes and stuff.</v>

256
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:05.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

257
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:05.631
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

258
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>this is not the time for jokes.</v>

259
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I am fucking pissed right now.</v>

260
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

261
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.321
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

262
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

263
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.371
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

264
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be fine.</v>

265
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking need to focus and get through this and got down,</v>

266
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>went to the hospital.</v>

267
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

268
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean it hurt real bad and we had to go to a second hospital because the one</v>

269
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:26.721
<v Speaker 1>was too full.</v>

270
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:27.554
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

271
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.970

<v Speaker 1>I thought it was bad,</v>

274
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>but I thought I was like,</v>

275
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>this is more than just a little break.</v>

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And another doctor came in and he's like,</v>

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>It's got all the screws and plates in it.</v>

295
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

297
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

298
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

299
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>I imagine I have the originals around somewhere.</v>

300
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.933
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

301
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'm maybe somewhere way back in my Facebook,</v>

302
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>you could see some of the scars and stuff like that.</v>

303
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 1>It's real grill,</v>

304
00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not sure if you'd be able to find it or not.</v>

305
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.823
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

306
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.491
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

307
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:22.731
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

308
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.061
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

309
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>so they put these metal plates in it and kind of screwed in the pieces of the,</v>

310
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>the bigger pieces of the bone that were still there,</v>

311
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 1>like where they wanted them to be eventually.</v>

312
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's,</v>

313
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>you can't just put the bone,</v>

314
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you,</v>

315
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>if you snap like a candy bar and try to put it together,</v>

316
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>there's all these crumbs and stuff like that missing.</v>

317
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.930
<v Speaker 1>And so they just kind of put it in place where it was supposed to be and,</v>

318
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.591
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

319
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

320
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>and they were like,</v>

321
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:47.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

322
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it just kinda grows back and comes together.</v>

323
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

324
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.581
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

325
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

326
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>and it did really,</v>

327
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>the issue was so they,</v>

328
00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:58.764
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

329
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>the way they did the surgery,</v>

330
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>they told me I had a time,</v>

331
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

332
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.151
<v Speaker 1>it's a first,</v>

333
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 1>you see that?</v>

334
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>What am I looking at right here?</v>

335
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

336
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

337
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

338
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>from where they went in with the surgery.</v>

339
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

340
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

341
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

342
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.710
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

343
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.110
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

344
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 1>they said that they didn't want to do the surgery at first cause they're like</v>

345
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 1>this is really complicated surgery,</v>

346
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 1>but if we don't do it,</v>

347
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're ever going to walk right again.</v>

348
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And why did they not want to do it?</v>

349
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 1>They weren't qualified to do it.</v>

350
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that the idea?</v>

351
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

352
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>this guy was like,</v>

353
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

354
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>this guy I got referrals and this guy was like as good of theirs.</v>

355
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Theirs go further back than that.</v>

356
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>There's some real disgusting stuff.</v>

357
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

358
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.850
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

359
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

360
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 1>just the area that it's in and,</v>

361
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.691
<v Speaker 1>and so there's,</v>

362
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

363
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like a 90 degree angle that they have to cut in,</v>

364
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>in the corner of it.</v>

365
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh there we go.</v>

366
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't look good.</v>

367
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.211
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

368
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>and that was like,</v>

369
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>that was like months and months later too that this is a post surgery.</v>

370
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:00.890
<v Speaker 1>This is like four months after the fact that it looks like what it looked like.</v>

371
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.733
<v Speaker 1>Tissue.</v>

372
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:02.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

373
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of scar tissue and stuff.</v>

374
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 1>So see where it's open there and in that that corner ripped open.</v>

375
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

376
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I hope this corner doesn't rip open cause as sometimes happens with this surgery</v>

377
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.901
<v Speaker 1>and if it does,</v>

378
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be really susceptible to infection.</v>

379
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>And so I had,</v>

380
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

381
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.863
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

382
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I at the time I lived in Malibu and my place had like 50 steps and there's no</v>

383
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 1>way I could like get up with groceries and everything with two broken feet.</v>

384
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I could get around on crutches a little bit.</v>

385
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.181
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

386
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:30.301
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

387
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I ended up having to spend like three months in my parents' basement cause I</v>

388
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 1>couldn't care for myself or anything.</v>

389
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.480
<v Speaker 1>So like on top of having to cancel three months of work and not have,</v>

390
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a safety net and having no income and you know,</v>

392
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:47.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

393
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

394
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

395
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 1>it was actually like,</v>

396
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm very grateful for my parents and,</v>

397
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

398
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

399
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:54.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just embarrassing and you're like,</v>

400
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I had to move him in my parents' basement.</v>

401
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they understand though.</v>

402
00:10:58.081 --> 00:10:58.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

403
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you just,</v>

404
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 1>we were a loser and couldn't wake up on time,</v>

406
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 1>lost your apartment.</v>

407
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

408
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.050
<v Speaker 1>this is just fuck man.</v>

409
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Got worst part of it,</v>

410
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.960
<v Speaker 1>come to start walking again.</v>

411
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.290
<v Speaker 1>So after three months I got back on the road and um,</v>

412
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and there was still this,</v>

413
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Speaker 1>this little kind of wound that it opened up,</v>

414
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>wasn't healing.</v>

415
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And then I started,</v>

416
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it was just taking the,</v>

417
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 1>they told me it was going to take like at least six months to like start walking</v>

418
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 1>and it ended up taking much longer than that because so about four or five</v>

419
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:35.821
<v Speaker 1>months in,</v>

420
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I got on the road and then um,</v>

421
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 1>and then a,</v>

422
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>a doctor thought that maybe I was getting a like just a topical infection and</v>

423
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 1>gave me some stuff that wasn't good enough for the infection.</v>

424
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>And then I started,</v>

425
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 1>so about four or five months later I started having fevers and then I went into</v>

426
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 1>the hospital and then they're like,</v>

427
00:11:58.271 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 1>you have a bone infection.</v>

428
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

429
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

430
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause they are like this is really serious because that's when you can lose your</v>

431
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:06.341
<v Speaker 1>foot and stuff.</v>

432
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 1>If they can't stop the infection,</v>

433
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:09.070
<v Speaker 1>they just have to cut it off.</v>

434
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus came back,</v>

435
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.371
<v Speaker 1>canceled every,</v>

436
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:13.570
<v Speaker 1>all my work again.</v>

437
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Came back to La,</v>

438
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 1>they did a surgery and um,</v>

439
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 1>and I was really thankful that I had happened to sign up for the health care.</v>

440
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 1>This was right when the universal health care just came out.</v>

441
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I'd be bankrupt from it,</v>

442
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>but it was still,</v>

443
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:28.871
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

444
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 1>it was not perfect at all.</v>

445
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

446
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let me do stuff out of state.</v>

447
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I had to get myself back to California and,</v>

448
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.690
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

449
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by stuff out of state?</v>

450
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.780
<v Speaker 1>You mean surgical procedure?</v>

451
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Surgery and hospital checkups.</v>

452
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:41.764
<v Speaker 1>I had to pay,</v>

453
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 1>they had to do with me in California because of your insurance?</v>

454
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:44.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

455
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was in Wisconsin,</v>

456
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I had to pay out of pocket for that and,</v>

457
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's like kind of not supposed to be that way either.</v>

458
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:53.230
<v Speaker 1>But there was the,</v>

459
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:53.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

460
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

461
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I would call and try to,</v>

462
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 1>in the insurance company would be like,</v>

463
00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you need this one form.</v>

464
00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:58.691
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

465
00:12:58.691 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I call this company.</v>

466
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:00.364
<v Speaker 1>And they'd be like,</v>

467
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

468
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 1>only doctors can get that form.</v>

469
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd tell my doctor and he'd be like,</v>

470
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:04.601
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

471
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:05.201
<v Speaker 1>you can get that.</v>

472
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>You have to go here.</v>

473
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:07.810
<v Speaker 1>And then it was like around and around.</v>

474
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'd have to like pretend I was a doctor when I was on the phone with</v>

475
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>people just to get this fucking form that I need.</v>

476
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I paid out of pocket size,</v>

477
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:16.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

478
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.420
<v Speaker 1>getting medical bills were piling up.</v>

480
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And so the second surgery,</v>

481
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 1>what they did was they just cut out,</v>

482
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 1>they took out the hardware,</v>

483
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

484
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 1>that's what got infected.</v>

485
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And then they kind of,</v>

486
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.213
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

487
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 1>we're where the holes were from the screws.</v>

488
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:31.930
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

489
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.760
<v Speaker 1>they kind of drill those out a little bit and then they just cut off it cut as</v>

490
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>big of a hole as they possibly could in my foot to suck out as much of the</v>

491
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 1>infection as possible.</v>

492
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought I was going to be in a hospital for,</v>

493
00:13:45.761 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 1>and I still hadn't walked at this point.</v>

494
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought I was going to be there,</v>

495
00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:52.510
<v Speaker 1>like you'll be in a hospital for like a week and a half or so,</v>

496
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 1>two weeks.</v>

497
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.311
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

498
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:54.701
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

499
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

500
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.451
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

501
00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

502
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I finally,</v>

503
00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:58.990
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to be like taking care of me.</v>

504
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to get this done.</v>

505
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

506
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I have my computer,</v>

507
00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I was in good spirits and,</v>

508
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.590
<v Speaker 1>and getting a lot of work done and stuff.</v>

509
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

510
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and then like two days later they were like,</v>

511
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 1>your insurance is saying that they think you're better and you need to go home</v>

512
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.330
<v Speaker 1>and now we need to show you how to like care for yourself.</v>

513
00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:19.300
<v Speaker 1>So I had to train me on how to,</v>

514
00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I had to give Myself Ivy antibiotics three times a day.</v>

515
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

516
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

517
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

518
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.343
<v Speaker 1>they put,</v>

519
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.420
<v Speaker 1>they put lines in my arm and I had to like make sure that their sanitary all the</v>

520
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:33.210
<v Speaker 1>time and I'd have to get him in,</v>

521
00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:33.361
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

522
00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:34.194
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

523
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a complex medical procedure.</v>

524
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Giving yourself an ivy dude,</v>

525
00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I had to Google it.</v>

526
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I like fucking Google.</v>

527
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 1>What's the name of your insurance company?</v>

528
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.103
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

529
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.851
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

530
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Do I have the,</v>

531
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.570
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

532
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

533
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.153
<v Speaker 1>the fact and try,</v>

534
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 1>so that's the other thing is I have like two different insurance companies.</v>

535
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So this is like health net and then there's like this lake side and medical,</v>

536
00:14:59.121 --> 00:14:59.954
<v Speaker 1>which one?</v>

537
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 1>And I can never know which one is like the I call one and they'd be like,</v>

538
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:04.281
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

539
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Speaker 1>that's your,</v>

540
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 1>your other company.</v>

541
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:06.501
<v Speaker 1>I call the other one.</v>

542
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:07.380
<v Speaker 1>No that's this kind of,</v>

543
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 1>it was just a year of dealing with this.</v>

544
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Speaker 1>So because of the fact that this was so expensive,</v>

545
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.450
<v Speaker 1>they just decided to say fuck this guy.</v>

546
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Let's make him do all the medical stuff himself.</v>

547
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

549
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>have you ever heard of that before?</v>

550
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.611
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

551
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 1>well he's a young guy.</v>

552
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 1>He seems like he's in good spirits and healthy.</v>

553
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a bright guy.</v>

554
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Like he could take care of himself.</v>

555
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the logic behind it.</v>

556
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:29.924
<v Speaker 1>And so let's,</v>

557
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 1>let's get them Outta here.</v>

558
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:31.844
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's the clients.</v>

559
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

560
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Could you fight it?</v>

561
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I tried.</v>

562
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.361
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

563
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:35.661
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

564
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:36.494
<v Speaker 1>You're I,</v>

565
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this on my own.</v>

566
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 1>When they showed me what I had to do,</v>

567
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 1>it was so once I get the IBS hooked up and I'd have to figure out how to like</v>

568
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:45.980
<v Speaker 1>get bubbles out of the lines and stuff like that.</v>

569
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I was googling,</v>

570
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>how do you get bubbles out of the lines?</v>

571
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's literally what I say.</v>

572
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Then I had to,</v>

573
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>the first time they showed me what I had to do,</v>

574
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>

575
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.111
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

576
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:57.261
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

577
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>watch this because you're going to have to do this yourself.</v>

578
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.530
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

579
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.610
<v Speaker 1>so this huge hole in my foot was packed full of gauze and they started pulling</v>

580
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 1>out this gauze.</v>

581
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how big the hole was at first,</v>

582
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>but then it was like one of those magic scarves,</v>

583
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.300
<v Speaker 1>like wound on calming.</v>

584
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

585
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.620
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

586
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.451
<v Speaker 1>and then they're like,</v>

587
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 1>so you're gonna need to take this out and then look in here,</v>

588
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.440
<v Speaker 1>look in your hole.</v>

589
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.340
<v Speaker 1>You're going to need to clean it out and like clean off your bone and stuff</v>

590
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.773
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

591
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.613
<v Speaker 1>See your bone.</v>

592
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:25.291
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

593
00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I had to like scrub it off and then,</v>

594
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 1>and then I had to pack it full of Shit again and all of this with like wearing</v>

595
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.490
<v Speaker 1>gloves in a fee,</v>

596
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Speaker 1>a a mask and everything like that.</v>

597
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.473
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

598
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.320
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>

599
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.870
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd have to like put a rubber thing on to,</v>

600
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 1>to take a shower.</v>

601
00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I had to do this three times a day and then I couldn't sleep either because I</v>

602
00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 1>needed the IB antibiotics had to be every eight hours and it took two hours to</v>

603
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:51.944
<v Speaker 1>do them.</v>

604
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And so I could never get like a full eight hour rest.</v>

605
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:58.710
<v Speaker 1>So I was like mad it up.</v>

606
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It took two hours for the IB fluids to go and okay.</v>

607
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.933
<v Speaker 1>So you have to do,</v>

609
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 1>oh so I'd hang up these bags and stuff.</v>

610
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd hook up the IBS,</v>

611
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 1>then I'd spend 20 minutes with my foot hole and then,</v>

612
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.080
<v Speaker 1>and then after,</v>

613
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 1>after like a few weeks of that,</v>

614
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.890
<v Speaker 1>see they would always be like okay we can get you another home visit or</v>

615
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

616
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.420
<v Speaker 1>It would be like a week after I actually needed it.</v>

617
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.673
<v Speaker 1>Cause then I got,</v>

618
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I got this vacuum Suction Cup thing that they put on my feet and um,</v>

619
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.650
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

620
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

621
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 1>and it just kind of sucks all the infection stuff out and,</v>

622
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:39.703
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

623
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

624
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.060
<v Speaker 1>gets,</v>

625
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.310
<v Speaker 1>gets rid of it and closes up in,</v>

626
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.010
<v Speaker 1>creates like blood flow into that area.</v>

627
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.860
<v Speaker 1>So it generates the things actually work amazingly.</v>

628
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

629
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.740
<v Speaker 1>but so then I had this device and like a vacuum and I started performing again.</v>

630
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:59.991
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to like take this vacuum off myself and I close up my fucking foot hole</v>

631
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:04.650
<v Speaker 1>and then go on stage and perform and then get off and put this back Hume back</v>

632
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:05.011
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

633
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

634
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.473
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

635
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

636
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

637
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.560
<v Speaker 1>cause I had before I,</v>

638
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Speaker 1>before I,</v>

639
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.043
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

640
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.570

641
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.613
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

642
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.260
<v Speaker 1>before I broke my feet and when I,</v>

643
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 1>and I had been in like 12 years of relationships.</v>

644
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>

645
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not dating for a year.</v>

646

<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have sex.</v>

647
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to think about women for a year.</v>

648
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to get my head straight.</v>

649
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And I did that.</v>

650
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.250
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

651

<v Speaker 1>Got Tons of work done.</v>

652
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.090
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

653
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.300
<v Speaker 1>then when I started getting back into things,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but when I started getting back into it and I'm like,</v>

664
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember I brought a girl back back to my hotel when I still had this fucking</v>

665
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:55.854
<v Speaker 1>vacuum,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what kind of like energy levels did you have?</v>

674
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It would seem like if you're going through,</v>

675
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 1>your body's trying to repair itself for such a long period of time it has to</v>

676
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:17.701
<v Speaker 1>wear on you,</v>

677
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

678
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

679
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

680
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

681
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 1>it was more just the depression of it all.</v>

682
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And the stress was,</v>

683
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.810
<v Speaker 1>was harder than I was getting plenty of sleep and stuff.</v>

684
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:28.441
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

685
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 1>it was a depressing time,</v>

686
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately it was kind of,</v>

687
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of good in a way,</v>

688
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.373
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

689
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.670
<v Speaker 1>in building and some,</v>

690
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.983
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,</v>

691
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

692
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

693
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I got a good of,</v>

694
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

695
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.033
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

696
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:42.120
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

697
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

698
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 1>when I started in,</v>

699
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 1>in Boston and I started doing comedy,</v>

700
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I was like fearless.</v>

701
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I would do like the ballsiest stuff,</v>

702
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:51.960
<v Speaker 1>always trying new material and I just did not give a shit.</v>

703
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And I got a lot of attention for it.</v>

704
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.220
<v Speaker 1>And I caught some breaks early on.</v>

705
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And once I started making money and doing the road,</v>

706
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

707
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:05.700
<v Speaker 1>then you're worried about like getting negative comment cards and all this shit.</v>

708
00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:07.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's like my livelihood.</v>

709
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.003
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

710
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 1>it was just watering down what I was doing and I wasn't fearless on stage</v>

711
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:12.834
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

712
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:13.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

713
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

714
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.203
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

715
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.990
<v Speaker 1>and so after breaking my feet and having three months of my parents' house,</v>

716
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:19.980
<v Speaker 1>it kind of was just like,</v>

717
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck anymore.</v>

718
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing exactly what I want to do.</v>

719
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.803
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

720
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

721
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:26.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

722
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it really created a change in my career.</v>

723
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I thought that album and like the new act that I'm doing now or the best that</v>

724
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I've ever been.</v>

725
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>How long ago was the incident and the accident and how long did it take you to</v>

726
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:37.854
<v Speaker 1>recover?</v>

727
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

728
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.360
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>

729
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.680
<v Speaker 1>it was two years ago,</v>

730
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.813
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

731
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:42.683
<v Speaker 1>in May.</v>

732
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And then I,</v>

733
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.480
<v Speaker 1>about one year in I started using a cane and then that's when I,</v>

734
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 1>that was really hard when I started using a cane because I was like,</v>

735
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:55.691
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

736
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 1>the light at the end of the tunnel.</v>

737
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized,</v>

738
00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

739
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 1>every other stuff that I take for the rest of my life,</v>

740
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to hurt just every other step.</v>

741
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like always on.</v>

742
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

743
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that's why I take kratom before podcasts because there's always like a part of</v>

744
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>my brain that can't stop talking.</v>

745
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.340
<v Speaker 1>That's can't stop thinking about my stupid fucking foot.</v>

746
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

747
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 1>is it hurting you right now?</v>

748
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

749
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

750
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Right now it feels fine,</v>

751
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.320
<v Speaker 1>but when you walk here,</v>

752
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

753
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 1>well the cardamom helps,</v>

754
00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:23.710
<v Speaker 1>but if I,</v>

755
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not on that,</v>

756
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.390
<v Speaker 1>most days it's just like having a pretty sore foot.</v>

757
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And then some days,</v>

758
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.980
<v Speaker 1>like probably now it's,</v>

759
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.620
<v Speaker 1>it's coming along better than I thought it would actually,</v>

760
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:34.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

761
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 1>three days out of a month I have like this streak and I don't know what causes</v>

762
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:38.861
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

763
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's inactivity,</v>

764
00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:40.571
<v Speaker 1>the weather,</v>

765
00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:41.350
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

766
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I have a streak of like three days where I can just,</v>

767
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

768
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 1>where I should be using a cane again,</v>

769
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>where if you saw me,</v>

770
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:47.801
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

771
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:48.850
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with that guy?</v>

772
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.953
<v Speaker 1>Years later.</v>

773
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

774
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

775
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

776
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

777
00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

778
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.090
<v Speaker 1>about a year and a half after I started using a cane,</v>

779
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>so both eyes on a cane for about six months and then I started going without the</v>

780
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:01.570
<v Speaker 1>cane and just using it sometimes.</v>

781
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

782
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.401
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

783
00:22:03.401 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 1>so it's been quite an ordeal.</v>

784
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.203
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

785
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.893
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

786
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
