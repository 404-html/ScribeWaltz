<v Speaker 2>it was overwhelming because what I did,</v>

101
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Joe was throughout my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would store things and put them in the</v>

111
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 2>There was just too much pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

119
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had this crazy look with the </v>

120
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.321
<v Speaker 2>dreadlocks and Teddy Atlas is behind you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these big names and everybody's </v>

121
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 2>like Shannon cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brexit's an expat thing and you know,</v>

122
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot of success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was some people that felt like</v>

123
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:47.701
<v Speaker 2>you didn't live up to your full </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential and then you went away for a </v>

124
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 2>little bit and then you came back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look better than ever.</v>

125
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.950
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like my third combat,</v>

126
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest with you.</v>

127
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 2>This is like my fourth coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because I've always had like a foot </v>

128
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 2>and boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was nothing really.</v>

129
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Something that I was really dedicated to</v>
<v Speaker 2>or had the right team behind me.</v>

130
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>It was always something that was to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:14.131
<v Speaker 2>to get me by to make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's finally come to the point now </v>

132
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 2>at 44,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 45.</v>

133
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:19.261
<v Speaker 2>I think about three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years ago when I got to the point </v>

134
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:19.261
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

135
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that I've,</v>

136
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a talent that I've had because </v>

137
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I've had one foot in and one foot out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've done great.</v>

138
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say you can't cheat boxing.</v>

139
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I won the heavyweight title twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

140
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Not that I cheated boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never,</v>

141
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I never had the stability and the deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm backing,</v>

142
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.760
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

143
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I had a team behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong financially,</v>

144
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.090
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say they were for my best </v>

145
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>interest in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it was a marketing,</v>

146
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

147
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I could bring in big money from </v>
<v Speaker 2>investors and stuff like that,</v>

148
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but then it got to the point I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

149
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Shanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm better than that.</v>

150
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 2>But I wasn't given the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a real training situation.</v>

151
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on my own for a long time.</v>

152
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I really been on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it since like 1995 when </v>

153
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.621
<v Speaker 2>me and teddy that was split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I basically been on my own with </v>

154
00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>different trainers and different </v>
<v Speaker 2>promoters and really no management,</v>

155
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>just doing what I had to do to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

156
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 2>When you look back on your career and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look back,</v>

157
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.430
<v Speaker 2>especially in the early days when there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so much hype behind human,</v>

158
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 2>you are the next big thing out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brownsville.</v>

159
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 2>You're this guy that everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking forward to that this is going to</v>

160
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>be the next big heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much is that?</v>

161
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Too much pressure in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a lot of ways.</v>

162
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you almost like not train 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give yourself some excuses?</v>

163
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>

164
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.470
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess for other people it wasn't for </v>

165
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.470
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was going on for you back then?</v>

166
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.671
<v Speaker 2>Like what was that like to be that young</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and coming prospect with all those </v>

167
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:38.680
<v Speaker 2>eyes on them that wasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

168
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 2>it was overwhelming in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fun,</v>

169
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:43.470
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was overwhelming in a sense where</v>

170
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I wasn't ready.</v>

171
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I had a very limited amateur background </v>
<v Speaker 2>from day one.</v>

172
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I was put on the top level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

173
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I had 10 amateur fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on the USA team.</v>

174
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I fought Felix who had 300 fights when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had 18 amateur fights on ABC wide world </v>

175
00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 2>of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a little overwhelming for me.</v>

176
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:05.261
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 18 amateur fights and here I'm </v>

177
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:05.261
<v Speaker 2>fighting a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:05.261
<v Speaker 2>a gold medalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

179
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:05.640
<v Speaker 2>it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get,</v>

180
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I kinda started out young knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you're going to be on the </v>

181
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.660
<v Speaker 2>big screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be out there,</v>

182
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>although you're not prepared.</v>

183
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>So you felt like you were always playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch up?</v>

184
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

185
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 2>until the last couple of years where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was home making videos,</v>

186
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I had time to get in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't had a drink in over five years.</v>

187
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I started drinking when I was 13 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

188
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.170
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 13 years old.</v>

189
00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:30.171
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was homeless from when I was 13 to </v>

190
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:30.171
<v Speaker 2>about 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Live in here,</v>

191
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:34.510
<v Speaker 2>in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been on my own since basically </v>

192
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.510
<v Speaker 2>since I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

193
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 2>So when I was put on an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the image,</v>

194
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 2>the top level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been in a situation where,</v>

195
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

196
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 2>besides playing catch up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a Mac,</v>

197
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the big screen and I'm not ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got to do the best I can and I've </v>

198
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 2>always done that and that's what I try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell people to do the best you can,</v>

199
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

200
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Do the best you can because you never </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

201
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.540
<v Speaker 2>but that I'm not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thing seems to have been the constant </v>

202
00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:58.540
<v Speaker 2>theme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was always in the back of your</v>

203
00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

204
00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.980
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was that.</v>

205
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 2>That's confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what confidence is.</v>

206
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:05.490
<v Speaker 2>If you go into any fight saying to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already,</v>

207
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you already have to feed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was so talented that I could still</v>

208
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 2>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

209
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I fought George Foreman grill basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>on my own.</v>

210
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't with Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had split up.</v>

211
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I met a guy down in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a guy,</v>

212
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mines now and call us up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we trained for about eight weeks.</v>

213
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was battling George George Foreman and</v>

214
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 2>got a close decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

215
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:28.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

216
00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get knocked out and I was happy</v>

217
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:30.820
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

218
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 2>and I became the linear heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

219
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

220
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:38.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a light to beat George </v>

221
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:38.171
<v Speaker 2>Foreman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unimaginable.</v>

222
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a mount rushmore of boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes to the heavyweight division for</v>

223

<v Speaker 2>short.</v>

227
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.590

<v Speaker 2>looking at them on the other side of the</v>

228
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 2>ring.</v>

00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 2>I just met the trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

235
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got through to him.</v>

236
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:02.871
<v Speaker 2>He spoke no English at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would tell me is give me a jump rope </v>

237
00:09:02.871 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 2>and say jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jumped rope,</v>

238
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He spoke no English,</v>

239
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.960
<v Speaker 2>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spoke,</v>

240
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 2>spoke very little English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

241
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I speak very little Spanish but </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood working.</v>

242
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 2>We just worked and I want the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

243
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was now almost copy on Vamos can't be</v>

244
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.610
<v Speaker 2>all pretty much living in Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.720
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you split with Teddy Atlas,</v>

246
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.770
<v Speaker 1>that was a big deal too because teddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>atlas is a notorious hard ass now.</v>

247
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's the hardest of the hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even when you look at them,</v>

248
00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:31.760
<v Speaker 1>that big scar across his face and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

249
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.050
<v Speaker 1>he talks very brutally and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like open publicly,</v>

250
00:09:35.051 --> 00:09:37.330
<v Speaker 1>like saying that he just didn't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were all in.</v>

251
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.770
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

252
00:09:38.771 --> 00:09:43.771
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a real down point in my life </v>

253
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:46.801
<v Speaker 2>where I really felt like that was one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Times where suicide definitely came </v>

254
00:09:46.931 --> 00:09:48.880
<v Speaker 2>into play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that may sound crazy,</v>

255
00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:51.220
<v Speaker 2>but the reason why is because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.900
<v Speaker 2>when I got with Teddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like 19,</v>

257
00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:56.800
<v Speaker 2>20 years old and he was very over </v>
<v Speaker 2>bearing in that sense where it's like,</v>

258
00:09:56.801 --> 00:09:58.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

259
00:09:58.241 --> 00:09:59.230
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

260
00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I was homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to make and I was willing to do</v>

261
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:05.320
<v Speaker 2>anything he said or without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the management said to make it.</v>

262
00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Because it was either that or die in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>

263
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.000
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was in prison at the time where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he eventually died.</v>

264
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.880
<v Speaker 2>My mom was on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was on heroin and crack.</v>

265
00:10:12.881 --> 00:10:13.990
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

266
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 2>I got a manager now and I had an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to a trainer,</v>

267
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Teddy Alice.</v>

268
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.030
<v Speaker 2>We used to train my Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I gave myself to him in a sense where</v>

269
00:10:22.031 --> 00:10:27.031
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything he says I'm going to do and </v>

270
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:27.031
<v Speaker 2>in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

271
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I felt like when we split and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't publicly and said that about </v>

272
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.591
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts so bad because I looked at him </v>

273
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:35.950
<v Speaker 2>like a father figure because Cedi spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>many days I think,</v>

274
00:10:35.951 --> 00:10:40.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tearing me down so he could control and </v>

275
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:40.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind and that was cool,</v>

276
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:40.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

277
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:43.450
<v Speaker 2>I knew I didn't come to him as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept him as a 19,</v>

278
00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:47.050
<v Speaker 2>20 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we split and he went publicly,</v>

279
00:10:47.051 --> 00:10:48.490
<v Speaker 2>I was just at a down point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>

280
00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I was undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost for HBO,</v>

281
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.240
<v Speaker 2>neither the heavyweights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a big,</v>

282
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:52.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.960
<v Speaker 2>montage about me and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here I was,</v>

284
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.590
<v Speaker 2>the head of the show and I got knocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>out by Darren Wilson at the,</v>

285
00:10:57.591 --> 00:11:00.700
<v Speaker 2>around and when teddy went out I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

286
00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:01.360
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 2>what happened to the days when it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like me and you were like,</v>

288
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

289
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.740
<v Speaker 2>I was with them for three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

290
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.060
<v Speaker 2>five years from what I'm saying.</v>

291
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 2>It was so much a mental telling me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:11:13.181 --> 00:11:15.760
<v Speaker 2>without me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're nothing and you don't have this,</v>

293
00:11:15.761 --> 00:11:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then fight time,</v>

294
00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:19.150
<v Speaker 2>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So such a mental,</v>

295
00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pumping puppet type of thing.</v>

296
00:11:21.911 --> 00:11:24.130
<v Speaker 2>When we split,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I contemplated committed suicide.</v>

297
00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I was in my management's basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a shotgun.</v>

298
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

299
00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:30.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I mean I was just in a bad place</v>

300
00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:32.140
<v Speaker 2>and everyone turned it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned it back on me.</v>

301
00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:37.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the newspapers rip me apart in his </v>

302
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:38.320
<v Speaker 2>intelligence influence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teddy's influenced with the writers.</v>

303
00:11:38.321 --> 00:11:40.850
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York City cried was such,</v>

304
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.800
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so strong.</v>

305
00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.350
<v Speaker 2>He had built a great relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

306
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put anybody out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had built great relationships </v>

307
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 2>with a certain certain writers and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

308
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.710
<v Speaker 2>everybody's assaulted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just crazy.</v>

309
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 2>It was one born on Shannon break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I survived</v>

310
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.160
<v Speaker 3>that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was part of me saying,</v>

311
00:11:56.161 --> 00:12:01.161
<v Speaker 3>that's why I tell people I'm the champ </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've never spoken about this </v>

312
00:12:01.161 --> 00:12:01.161
<v Speaker 3>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my first time.</v>

313
00:12:01.161 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Let's go champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go champ.</v>

314
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

315
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 3>probably hit emotion in my voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I apologize.</v>

316
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.310
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

317
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

318
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.170
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was part of the reason why I call </v>

319
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:13.170
<v Speaker 3>myself the champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

320
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 3>because although when I beat for him in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

321
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

322
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:19.650
<v Speaker 3>you really lost and nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That third eye I wanted the title that </v>

323
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.251
<v Speaker 3>wasn't winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Winning was doing that with my mom had </v>

324
00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:23.251
<v Speaker 3>just died on my birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

325
00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:24.810
<v Speaker 3>that was to me why I'm the champ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

326
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.460
<v Speaker 3>because I went out there with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

327
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 3>without a stable stability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stable trainer.</v>

328
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 3>And I still fought and went 12 rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm the champ.</v>

329
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

330
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those type of moments in my life is yc </v>

331
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.340
<v Speaker 3>and the chain went under title again </v>
<v Speaker 3>with one second left on the clock would </v>

332
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 3>lie Covich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

333
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 3>that's not why I'm the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

334
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.340
<v Speaker 3>because I fought that fight with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>asthma attack and I was born asthmatic.</v>

335
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I meet the fact that I'm even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boxing is unreal.</v>

336
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:50.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent my childhood in the hospitals.</v>

337
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.870
<v Speaker 3>I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hardly got an education.</v>

338
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I dropped out of high school in ninth </v>
<v Speaker 3>grade.</v>

339
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

340
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never part of my school,</v>

341
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:02.790
<v Speaker 3>they used to go on trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was to come visit me in school because </v>

342
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.790
<v Speaker 3>of my asthma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

343
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 3>So for me to become a heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion of the world,</v>

344
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
<v Speaker 3>to Tom's about to be three very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an accomplishment for not only </v>

345
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.111
<v Speaker 3>myself but for asthmatic and people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't give up because I wanted to give </v>

346
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:13.111
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Teddy left me,</v>

347
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 3>I want them to give up champ.</v>

348
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know boxing,</v>

349
00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:19.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe don't know the legend of Teddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlas and him,</v>

350
00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:24.071
<v Speaker 1>how he directly connects the customer on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early days of the Tyson camp and you</v>

351
00:13:25.831 --> 00:13:26.640
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teddy's a,</v>

352
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.960
<v Speaker 1>he's like a famous motivator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

353
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways,</v>

354
00:13:31.011 --> 00:13:36.011
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxication that comes from people </v>

355
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:39.581
<v Speaker 1>telling you you're a great motivator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to believe it and buy it and </v>

356
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:40.430
<v Speaker 1>do it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may remember the Tim Bradley fight,</v>

357
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.140
<v Speaker 1>boys in timberly's caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

358
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.090
<v Speaker 1>we're firemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fight,</v>

359
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.750
<v Speaker 1>they fight the fire.</v>

360
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 3>I love Teddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen man.</v>

361
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:50.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

362
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.510
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

363
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.520
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me to talk about this now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is before the fame for </v>

364
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:56.520
<v Speaker 3>teddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

365
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Like when we met Teddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was working in a liquor </v>

366
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure,</v>

367
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 3>no disrespect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

368
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:06.991
<v Speaker 3>that's just the facts and he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing well financially and my manager </v>

369
00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:11.041
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I spoke about earlier </v>

370
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:12.751
<v Speaker 3>about he was a guy can go out and raise </v>
<v Speaker 3>capital and he had this young kid from </v>

371
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 3>the same neighborhood is Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had just won the national,</v>

372
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the US championships in 92 and 91,</v>

373
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.560
<v Speaker 3>92 and he was able to go out and get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>gods.</v>

374
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 3>He looked back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my guy,</v>

375
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:24.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like race horse,</v>

376
00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:29.261
<v Speaker 3>you don't just keep it real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got this famous trainer to train </v>

377
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 3>his own race horse was Teddy Alice and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

378
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 3>I submitted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

379
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:32.150
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

380
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.810
<v Speaker 3>I was listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was this or jail.</v>

381
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said dad was in prison and my step dad</v>

382
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:42.301
<v Speaker 3>was in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was in the streets and the manager was </v>

383
00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:42.301
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

384
00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 3>you know what sign would be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gonna put your mom in Rehab.</v>

385
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.820
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hell yeah.</v>

386
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:50.821
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did everything he said he was gonna </v>

387
00:14:50.821 --> 00:14:52.381
<v Speaker 3>do and he gave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believes in teddy and I believed in </v>

388
00:14:52.381 --> 00:14:52.381
<v Speaker 3>and teddy</v>

389
00:14:52.381 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 4>and the process I watched him say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he told me I would never be a </v>

390
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 4>commentator because he doesn't feel is </v>
<v Speaker 4>right to talk about fighters.</v>

391
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.830
<v Speaker 4>This is what he told me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he would never be a common ever,</v>

392
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course he is a commentator.</v>

393
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.210
<v Speaker 4>This was before he became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he decided to become on a lot of </v>

394
00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:10.210
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of things that were said.</v>

395
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically when we split and he went on </v>

396
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 4>television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York one and said,</v>

397
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

398
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 4>he didn't think I had this in the third.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

399
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:24.761
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what will all the times that we were </v>

400
00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:24.761
<v Speaker 4>winning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was weak when I lost that one time it</v>

401
00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:25.310
<v Speaker 4>was me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

402
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

403
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:31.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not an exact science to </v>

404
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:31.170
<v Speaker 4>motivating people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

405
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.091
<v Speaker 4>There's not an exact science of training</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of the relationship between a </v>

406
00:15:34.091 --> 00:15:37.001
<v Speaker 4>trainer and a fighter comes to like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect trainer for you might not be a </v>

407
00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:37.001
<v Speaker 4>perfect trainer for another guy.</v>

408
00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 4>It's just you gotta have that bond </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and whether you do your don't,</v>

409
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 4>you don't find out until you're in there</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

410
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:48.491
<v Speaker 4>Looking back as a man now as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplished man and you look back on </v>

411
00:15:48.491 --> 00:15:52.601
<v Speaker 4>your days when you were 19 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think would have been </v>

412
00:15:52.601 --> 00:15:55.691
<v Speaker 4>different?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what would you have done to </v>

413
00:15:55.691 --> 00:15:55.691
<v Speaker 4>motivate yourself or to talk to yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>differently back then?</v>

414
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>To be honest with you,</v>

415
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.230
<v Speaker 4>I honestly tell you joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what I'm doing right now,</v>

416
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.230

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

417
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.770
<v Speaker 4>everyone's not that type of fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

418
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 4>he worked great for I guess certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

419
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that type of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

420
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to have fun.</v>

421
00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 4>I like to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the bug out,</v>

422
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:12.470
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

423
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 4>I like to live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

424
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a happy guy.</v>

425
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.010
<v Speaker 4>Teddy is not different in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

426
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 4>And for a long time I'm look looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

427
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.350
<v Speaker 4>Ali Ali trained to archery moy trend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another other is before he got the </v>

428
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Dundee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dundee knew how to train our lead.</v>

429
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Let him do him and this is what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing now.</v>

430
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:31.540
<v Speaker 4>People will say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

431
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 4>my guys who worked with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesse Robertson,</v>

432
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Stacy Mckinley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the great statesman,</v>

433
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.920
<v Speaker 4>Mckenzie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Great Jesse Robertson,</v>

434
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 4>these guys know how to train me now and </v>
<v Speaker 4>although I'm 44,</v>

435
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 4>almost 45,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've learned later on in life how to </v>

436
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Speaker 4>just be me be free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

437
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 4>this works for Shannon Briggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>win,</v>

438
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 4>lose or draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works for Shannon breeze.</v>

439
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Opposed to being someone else because </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone else said,</v>

440
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:56.050
<v Speaker 4>and I've done a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the end it became a syndrome where </v>

441
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:56.050
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

442
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.750
<v Speaker 4>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in this with a manager,</v>

443
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.760
<v Speaker 4>with a trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and an investor became like a process </v>

444
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:03.760
<v Speaker 4>for me to go through it over and over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and over again.</v>

445
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like to the point where like your </v>
<v Speaker 4>man champ,</v>

446
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.860
<v Speaker 4>do you feel like all these people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to shape you and you were </v>

447
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.270
<v Speaker 4>resisting it or you were confused by it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going along with the program </v>

448
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.270
<v Speaker 4>champ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

449
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.940
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

450
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 4>survival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

451
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:16.290
<v Speaker 4>go on with the program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one,</v>

452
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 4>the hardest thing for me and my life was</v>
<v Speaker 4>being homeless,</v>

453
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a homeless teenager and losing my </v>

454
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.710
<v Speaker 4>home because it wasn't like something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was used to.</v>

455
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.321
<v Speaker 4>I came home from school one day I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to pitch a block at school </v>

456
00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:32.471
<v Speaker 4>whenever I came home and we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>affected and I looked through the peep </v>

457
00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:33.670
<v Speaker 4>hole and I looked in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The apartment was empty and I was like,</v>

458
00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:38.671
<v Speaker 4>I lived here all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was born and raised in Atlantic </v>

459
00:17:38.671 --> 00:17:38.671
<v Speaker 4>towers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

460
00:17:38.671 --> 00:17:39.100
<v Speaker 4>so that was a turning point for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

461
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I left home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I left that building that day,</v>

462
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.120
<v Speaker 4>a homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the homeless kid and no more comic </v>

463
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.420
<v Speaker 4>books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no more toys that I grew up,</v>

464
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:49.710
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then now the people who</v>

465

00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:59.631
<v Speaker 3>They see the television side of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I lost my childhood that day </v>

468
00:17:59.631 --> 00:18:03.650
<v Speaker 3>when I went home and we were evicted.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

473
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 3>I started getting in trouble and life </v>
<v Speaker 3>took me to where I am now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

476
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 3>You Start Boxing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started boxing.</v>

00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:25.770
<v Speaker 3>I was like 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>

478
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.960
<v Speaker 3>So you started boxing as you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless?</v>

479
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

480
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.820
<v Speaker 3>And how are you doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where were you sleeping in </v>

481
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:34.820
<v Speaker 3>different places?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the aunt's house,</v>

482
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 3>a cousin's house or friend's house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

483
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:38.740
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

484
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.950
<v Speaker 3>wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be honest with you.</v>

485
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 1>And so it wasn't until you started </v>
<v Speaker 1>having some success as a boxer that you </v>

486
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 1>stopped being homeless?</v>

487

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually I got an apartment,</v>

488
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.790
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Jimmy O'farrell my,</v>

490
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.220
<v Speaker 3>my savior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he found these gems third city when I </v>

491
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:56.360
<v Speaker 3>was about 16 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

492
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I stopped there many nights too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was staying in the gym and that's what</v>

493
00:18:59.351 --> 00:18:59.890
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

494
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.640
<v Speaker 3>It was funny because boxing always drew </v>
<v Speaker 3>me back in because,</v>

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

497
00:19:06.671 --> 00:19:11.671
<v Speaker 3>get arrested in whatever as a teen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm from wanting to get out of trouble </v>

498

<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

500
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.990
<v Speaker 3>And then I'd have to use the gym as my,</v>

583
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:28.391
<v Speaker 3>264 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fat as a balloon.</v>

584
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:33.361
<v Speaker 3>I'd get up early to get like food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't eat a big bowl of a box of </v>

585

<v Speaker 3>cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kid you not.</v>

586
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.870

<v Speaker 3>I put a whole box and a big huge bowl.</v>

587
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.880

<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

595
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.160
<v Speaker 3>I got up and I started walking and I </v>

613
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:41.791

<v Speaker 3>those things made me who I am today and </v>

626
00:24:02.711 --> 00:24:03.830
<v Speaker 3>use what you got to use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying,</v>

627
00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 3>do what you gotta do to get what you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get.</v>

628
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:10.300

<v Speaker 3>from my pis from that situation,</v>

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.830

<v Speaker 3>but I learned to use all that,</v>

657
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.720
<v Speaker 3>the field from that anger from getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot so many times.</v>

658
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Vernon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shannon,</v>

659
00:25:13.301 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 3>you're not a businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a boxer.</v>

660
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Every time you was homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time he was down and out,</v>

661
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 3>boxing saved you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ran back to boxing,</v>

662
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 3>he was doing business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You made fish.</v>

663
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Made that but boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

664
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having peace with that balancing act </v>

665
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 1>like the negative moments that you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life,</v>

666
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.150
<v Speaker 1>not defining you and figuring out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use them for fuel.</v>

667
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out how to look back on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative moments and,</v>

668
00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.860
<v Speaker 1>and don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't wallow in them,</v>

669
00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:43.861
<v Speaker 1>but say that's never gonna happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't that the great balancing act </v>

670
00:25:43.861 --> 00:25:47.971
<v Speaker 1>of the successful fighter because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a single success for </v>

671
00:25:47.971 --> 00:25:50.581
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't come from some kind of </v>

672
00:25:50.581 --> 00:25:50.581
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent.</v>

673
00:25:50.581 --> 00:25:50.581
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way,</v>

674
00:25:50.581 --> 00:25:50.581
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

675
00:25:50.581 --> 00:25:55.540
<v Speaker 3>I think we do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of us do this and hopes there is a </v>

676
00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.161
<v Speaker 3>finish line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The finish line is you want to retire </v>

677
00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:02.651
<v Speaker 3>with money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to hopefully leave a name for </v>

678
00:26:02.651 --> 00:26:05.681
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what I'm saying and you want to </v>

679
00:26:05.681 --> 00:26:05.681
<v Speaker 3>walk away with and what your brain's </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what I'm saying.</v>

680
00:26:05.681 --> 00:26:07.130
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to leave with my brains.</v>

681
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to leave with some money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

682
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 3>And I'm trying to leave with a name and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm using that fuel.</v>

683
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm using my past and my present because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you the truth,</v>

684
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:21.490
<v Speaker 3>although I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is some past hurt and you can </v>

685
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:21.490
<v Speaker 3>probably hear them when I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things.</v>

686
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:25.510
<v Speaker 3>There's so much positivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much great things that's </v>

687

<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

689
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

690
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.850
<v Speaker 3>just the disappointment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me,</v>

691
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.940
<v Speaker 3>the disappointment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much positivity is happening right </v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

931
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.980
<v Speaker 4>He sold the UFC to Dana and them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

932
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:18.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In Two thousand one call rob right now </v>

<v Speaker 4>bricks.</v>

934
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.170

<v Speaker 4>waiting for Mark Roberts to come home to</v>

<v Speaker 4>champ champ.</v>

937
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.160
<v Speaker 4>Sitting on the couch with a rock or </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxing is hard to get fights lined up </v>

938
00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.361
<v Speaker 4>because there's so many different </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflicting promoters and different </v>

939
00:35:37.361 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 4>piece of the pie</v>

940
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.580
<v Speaker 2>and then it's hard to get fighters to </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree to fight someone like you who's </v>

962
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.660
<v Speaker 2>birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom was on heroin when I was born.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If I didn't go home for seven,</v>

966
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:40.710
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine months before when I was born.</v>

1002
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.891
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like nothing you can ever imagine </v>

1003
00:38:03.891 --> 00:38:07.401
<v Speaker 2>because we take for granted because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>take oxygen for granted because it's </v>

1004
00:38:07.401 --> 00:38:09.000
<v Speaker 2>just here for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can go without food and water.</v>

1005
00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:14.001
<v Speaker 2>I said all the time for days to weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't go without oxygen for five</v>

1006
00:38:14.071 --> 00:38:15.120
<v Speaker 2>minutes with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four minutes,</v>

1011
00:38:24.381 --> 00:38:26.781

<v Speaker 2>it's like trying to breathe through a </v>

1012
00:38:26.781 --> 00:38:26.781
<v Speaker 2>straw.</v>

1013

<v Speaker 2>like a little straw.</v>

<v Speaker 3>take care of my family champ and it's </v>

1163
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 3>what drove me to the pure depression.</v>

1164
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.990
<v Speaker 3>But then I overcame that and now I'm </v>

<v Speaker 3>high level by but understanding the </v>

1201
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.180
<v Speaker 3>limitations of his body.</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't fight to the end.</v>

1219
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1220
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:58.260
<v Speaker 3>if I could've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've stayed fighting to the end.</v>

1221

<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson's locked up and he came back </v>

1225
00:46:07.011 --> 00:46:07.590
<v Speaker 3>and a box ray mercer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

1276
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's all about getting yourself </v>

1277
00:47:58.650 --> 00:47:59.170
<v Speaker 3>prepared for the moment where you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>perform.</v>

1278
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:04.500
<v Speaker 3>And I think so many guys leave too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the gym because they have this thing </v>

1279
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 3>in their head that you can't do too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>trade smarter,</v>

1280
00:48:07.091 --> 00:48:07.720
<v Speaker 3>not harder.</v>

1281
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 3>That is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1282
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:11.170
<v Speaker 3>And it's a balancing act smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not harder.</v>

1283
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Trying to find that balance between the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the car.</v>

1284
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:19.310
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to sell yourself short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to not push hard enough </v>

1285
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:19.310
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reach your potential.</v>

1286
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:22.210
<v Speaker 3>But how do you figure out like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in,</v>

1287
00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:23.460
<v Speaker 3>when you're out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel,</v>

1288
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 3>how do you figure out how to reach that </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect potential?</v>

1289
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Because only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1290
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working with a guy I love him,</v>

1291
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.710
<v Speaker 3>shout out to billy and billy told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1292
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to once in a while,</v>

1293
00:48:33.881 --> 00:48:36.720
<v Speaker 3>push yourself to see how far you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1294
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could run 15 miles,</v>

1295
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.780
<v Speaker 3>but can you run 20?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1296
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:41.410
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1297
00:48:41.411 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 3>so once in a while I do give myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1298
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1299
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.520
<v Speaker 3>what can you do?</v>

1300
00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to make A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to make it up and down </v>

1301
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:51.080
<v Speaker 3>these stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know 100 times,</v>

1302
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.720
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do the best I can just once</v>

1303
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 3>in a blue and then I give it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1304
00:48:54.071 --> 00:48:56.740
<v Speaker 3>I may do that again in three months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two months.</v>

1305
00:48:56.741 --> 00:48:59.360
<v Speaker 3>You know what you gotta know your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>to channel.</v>

1306
00:48:59.361 --> 00:49:00.820
<v Speaker 3>You got honest and you got to be honest </v>
<v Speaker 3>with yourself.</v>

1307
00:49:00.821 --> 00:49:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Because I wasn't always honest with </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself because of asthma,</v>

1308
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:08.130
<v Speaker 3>I was having high anxiety when it came </v>
<v Speaker 3>to running and they came to like pushing</v>

1309
00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.350
<v Speaker 3>my lungs because this is something I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced all my life since birth.</v>

1310
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember,</v>

1311
00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:15.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finishing school because I was always in</v>

1312
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:17.560
<v Speaker 3>the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in St Mary's in Brooklyn.</v>

1313
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.990
<v Speaker 3>St John's in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kings county in Brooklyn.</v>

1314
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.410
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in the hospital.</v>

1315
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you what the children's play </v>
<v Speaker 3>rooms look like.</v>

1316
00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:25.860
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a kid,</v>

1317
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.240
<v Speaker 3>kids ward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I grew up in these places,</v>

1318
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 3>so for me to become a box and have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use so much breathing,</v>

1319
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1320
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to get myself a blow job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just the truth.</v>

1321
00:49:35.981 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1322
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:37.990
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1323
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:42.991
<v Speaker 3>what other heavyweight champion history </v>
<v Speaker 3>can honestly say they suffer from </v>

1324
00:49:42.991 --> 00:49:46.621
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're underdeveloped lungs and became a </v>

1325
00:49:46.621 --> 00:49:46.621
<v Speaker 3>champion and him on the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>

1326
00:49:46.621 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Hell no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but could I be possibly.</v>

1327
00:49:47.141 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Because if I had the lungs that some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys had,</v>

1328
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.300
<v Speaker 3>who knows how good I might be a fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit hard.</v>

1329
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:54.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with whatever.</v>

1330
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>champ.</v>

1331
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.930
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Joe.</v>

1332
00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.750
<v Speaker 3>They haven't seen the best to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest with you.</v>

1333
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.330
<v Speaker 3>They've never seen the best and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>has and I.</v>

1334
00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:05.710
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I'm back because why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't want to leave this earth or</v>

1335
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:08.440
<v Speaker 3>wherever I'm going next level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next dimension.</v>

1336
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to go st man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish they had seen me because I'm nice</v>

1337
00:50:12.101 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:18.001
<v Speaker 3>those who really know me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm really good at this box and </v>

1339

<v Speaker 3>things like I'm self taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched Mohammad Ali and Ray Robertson</v>

1340
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:22.540
<v Speaker 3>till I was blue in the face as a kid and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eliminate them as a heavyweight.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You got one of the best left hook to the</v>

<v Speaker 4>I worked with everybody.</v>

1390
00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:24.431
<v Speaker 4>Chimp and Maggie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'll stone was the guy that pumped a </v>

1391
00:52:24.431 --> 00:52:25.990
<v Speaker 4>spinks up when he fought Lara.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He bumped them up a little bit,</v>

1392
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't slow him down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1393
00:52:27.591 --> 00:52:29.780
<v Speaker 4>He had this boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't you work with Holyfield too?</v>

1394
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.230
<v Speaker 4>He worked with Holyfield as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he worked for Hany leaning.</v>

1395
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:34.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1396
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.570
<v Speaker 4>He might've worked with holy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy is the man holy.</v>

1397
00:52:36.571 --> 00:52:39.590
<v Speaker 4>He worked with everybody to holy was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>real guy who bought this.</v>

1398
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:45.100
<v Speaker 4>Bought that into prominence as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>strength and conditioning and and </v>

1399
00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:45.470
<v Speaker 4>especially in boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1400
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:50.760
<v Speaker 4>This was the first one of the first guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>were weightlifting became accepted </v>

1401
00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.510
<v Speaker 4>because for the longest time boxing </v>
<v Speaker 4>trainers will tell you that weight </v>

1402
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:58.051
<v Speaker 4>lifting slows you down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which it kind of does because it makes </v>

1403
00:52:58.051 --> 00:52:58.250
<v Speaker 4>you soar and then you don't perform as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well in the gym,</v>

1404
00:52:58.251 --> 00:53:01.070
<v Speaker 4>but once you recover then you're fast </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1405
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.730
<v Speaker 4>So holyfield was like one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys to make that leap,</v>

1406
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.840
<v Speaker 4>to understand like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1407
00:53:05.841 --> 00:53:10.841
<v Speaker 4>he's going to go from a cruiserweight to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a heavyweight and he became a legit </v>

1408
00:53:10.841 --> 00:53:12.140
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the best ever.</v>

1409
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean his performance against Mike </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tyson.</v>

1410
00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:15.380
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

<v Speaker 4>other day.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I heard this from inside that he was </v>

1533
00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1534
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:28.660

<v Speaker 3>with that to chairman.</v>

1535
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:33.661
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to get myself a blow job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was suffering from depression </v>

1536
00:57:33.661 --> 00:57:37.471
<v Speaker 3>champ and I was fortunate to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and got like 10 different Mris </v>

1537
00:57:37.471 --> 00:57:38.230
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with me?</v>

1538
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm always depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always feeling like,</v>

1539
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:41.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1540
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:46.140
<v Speaker 3>I feel anxiety overcoming me and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>given this night and then I was hip to </v>

1541
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.780
<v Speaker 3>cbd for a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years ago,</v>

1542
00:57:48.781 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 3>and changed life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing experimentation.</v>

1543
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm here,</v>

1544
00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:57.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But CBD is an interesting thing because </v>

1545
00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.841
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of marijuana but it's not </v>

1546
00:58:00.841 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people like they,</v>

1547
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:03.160
<v Speaker 3>they hear about it and they get worried </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1548
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.080
<v Speaker 3>They feel like it's drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1549
00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 3>But it has nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the beneficial parts of</v>

1550
00:58:08.261 --> 00:58:13.261
<v Speaker 3>the plant just eliminates inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for people that have arthritis or </v>

1551
00:58:13.261 --> 00:58:15.740
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of other injuries or just hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>training like you're doing.</v>

1552
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:17.620
<v Speaker 3>And I was drinking since I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid,</v>

1553
00:58:17.621 --> 00:58:18.340
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>

1554
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:19.770
<v Speaker 3>And I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

1555
00:58:19.771 --> 00:58:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I had a family member that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was an oh,</v>

1556
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.270
<v Speaker 3>marijuana smoke and we're kinda was.</v>

1557
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.080
<v Speaker 3>The person was abusive to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very abusive physically and mentally.</v>

1558
00:58:29.081 --> 00:58:34.081
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the smell of marijuana was something </v>

1559
00:58:34.081 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 3>that always reminded me of those times </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a child.</v>

1560
00:58:34.541 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>

1811
01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:58.891
<v Speaker 4>Klitschko was a heavyweight champion </v>
<v Speaker 4>where literally no one could tell you </v>

1812

1814
01:08:05.761 --> 01:08:05.761
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight champion and they would </v>

1818
01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:13.270
<v Speaker 4>no one cared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a such a boring style.</v>

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:18.480
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to mix it up and put her </v>

1820
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.891
<v Speaker 4>in line.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was shit.</v>

1856
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.350
<v Speaker 4>It was for nothing because he kicked the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell out of me.</v>

1857
01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.760
<v Speaker 4>He's a big fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man.</v>

1858
01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:46.990
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe it felt like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like two bats it together.</v>

1859
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:51.980
<v Speaker 4>I said if he kicked me one more time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to go down.</v>

1860
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.960
<v Speaker 4>I can't take it.</v>

1861
01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:55.510

<v Speaker 4>I said I can't take it if he want more.</v>

1862
01:09:55.511 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 4>He kicked me again.</v>

1864
01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:02.690

<v Speaker 4>And when I,</v>

1865
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 4>and he looked at me because I'm able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>read fast,</v>

1866
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:08.840
<v Speaker 4>you got to be able to read within tenths</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a second milliseconds and boxing.</v>

1867
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 4>I read in his eyes that that wasn't that</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

1868
01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Like he must've felt like it wasn't that</v>
<v Speaker 4>strong of a punch and he could come and </v>

1869
01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:18.920
<v Speaker 4>he came in to punch at that point and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when he came into punch,</v>

<v Speaker 3>everywhere I go,</v>

2145
01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:02.300
<v Speaker 3>people are saying,</v>

2149
01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:07.830
<v Speaker 3>that shift?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'd had a little bit of money.</v>

2150
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Never made a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those guys were hundreds of </v>

2151
01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.830
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I made a little bit of money for me </v>

2152
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.830
<v Speaker 3>to feel good.</v>

2153
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:17.070
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I never felt love.</v>

2154
01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:22.380
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom was in the streets trying to put </v>

2155
01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 3>a roof over our head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had a dad.</v>

2156
01:20:22.891 --> 01:20:25.050
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had a brother and sister.</v>

2157
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:26.630
<v Speaker 3>I was basically on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2158
01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.080
<v Speaker 3>you look at my personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell.</v>

2159
01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:33.081
<v Speaker 3>I've watched a lot of television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up reading comic books and </v>

2160
01:20:33.081 --> 01:20:35.800
<v Speaker 3>cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I never had love and to have what I </v>

2161
01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.460
<v Speaker 3>feel is love from people who genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know me and just see me and say,</v>

2162
01:20:38.461 --> 01:20:39.420
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

2163
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.740

<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2164
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 3>that's more fulfilling than anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever felt.</v>

2165
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.560
<v Speaker 3>You feel me?</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2168
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I think your message is important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying about having all that</v>

2169
01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:54.940
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the material possessions and </v>

2170
01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:54.940
<v Speaker 1>counting on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2171
01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I remember Chuck d talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>

2172
01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was during the height of when people </v>

2173
01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.581
<v Speaker 1>have giant wheels and they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars and every all in that room and he </v>

2174
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:02.581
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2175
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I drive a Ford explorer and he's like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a it,</v>

2176
01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't put any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any power in that</v>

2177
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:12.350
<v Speaker 3>shit at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sad that I was a slave to it.</v>

2178
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:17.410
<v Speaker 3>I feel so miserable when I think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the days that I spent money on sweaters,</v>

2179
01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:21.290
<v Speaker 3>caused jewelry bottles at the club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

2180
01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Damn what a lot of athletes go broke </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to keep up with the Joneses,</v>

2181
01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:30.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as part of our culture because we never </v>

2182
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.050
<v Speaker 3>had shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2183
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:34.271
<v Speaker 3>So now we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're feeling good because someone's </v>

2184
01:21:34.271 --> 01:21:37.271
<v Speaker 3>admiring you for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The admiration is what becomes </v>

2185
01:21:37.271 --> 01:21:37.271
<v Speaker 3>intoxicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2186
01:21:37.271 --> 01:21:39.140
<v Speaker 3>what I'm fighting for me was that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:43.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2191
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.590
<v Speaker 3>I was smart though because I've always </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to keep a place,</v>

2192
01:21:45.591 --> 01:21:47.660
<v Speaker 3>a roof over my head and I'll put value </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that as well.</v>

2193
01:21:47.661 --> 01:21:52.661
<v Speaker 3>But you do a lot of the things too is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just for show it off other people and </v>

2194
01:21:52.661 --> 01:21:54.860
<v Speaker 3>that once I was able to get past that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was,</v>

2195
01:21:54.861 --> 01:21:56.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of me was cutting my hair.</v>

2196
01:21:56.570 --> 01:22:00.420
<v Speaker 3>You don't have it locked for 27 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people want to come over here.</v>

2197
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the response from people was just,</v>

2198
01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.030
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the people looking at me like,</v>

2199
01:22:05.031 --> 01:22:06.350
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at you.</v>

2200
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:09.020
<v Speaker 3>You cut your hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you finish.</v>

2201
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:14.350
<v Speaker 3>You'll never get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll never be nothing or boxes over </v>

2202
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.350
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

2203
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think you cut your hair?</v>

2204
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the sickest thing.</v>

2205
01:22:16.901 --> 01:22:21.310
<v Speaker 3>It was like the most eye opening thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people were literally like,</v>

2206
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.170
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were telling me,</v>

2207
01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.140
<v Speaker 3>but I could also see deeper into what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were saying.</v>

2208
01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're finished.</v>

2209
01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:30.490
<v Speaker 3>You'll never make another movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never fight.</v>

2210
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:35.550
<v Speaker 3>You're just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was your marketing tool that you </v>

2211
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.550
<v Speaker 3>would just your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2212
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2213
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:36.730
<v Speaker 3>I can really fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2214
01:22:36.731 --> 01:22:38.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really got hands and they were like,</v>

2215
01:22:38.410 --> 01:22:40.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one believed in me,</v>

2216
01:22:40.241 --> 01:22:45.241
<v Speaker 3>so that's what makes this thing even </v>
<v Speaker 3>more powerful than the fact that I got </v>

2217
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:45.970
<v Speaker 3>rid of that here and I'm still doing my </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2218
01:22:45.971 --> 01:22:46.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm still a child.</v>

2219
01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Weird thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people to focus on dreadlocks </v>

2220
01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:55.380
<v Speaker 1>marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looked at it like it was a </v>

2221
01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:56.910
<v Speaker 1>marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was back in the day that was a big </v>

2222
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.910
<v Speaker 1>part of who you were and they always </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketed your hair.</v>

2223
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crazy dreadlocks.</v>

2224
01:22:58.131 --> 01:22:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2225
01:22:58.571 --> 01:22:59.500
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>

2226
01:22:59.501 --> 01:23:00.970
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to stay because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2227
01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:04.480
<v Speaker 3>you really know me that that's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

2228
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>That was mark and again,</v>

2229
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:10.360
<v Speaker 4>the hair was blocking me that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>blocking my vibe because I was like,</v>

2230
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:11.470
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this haircut,</v>

2231
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:16.520
<v Speaker 4>the hair had his own personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his own personality and then it's really</v>

2232
01:23:16.571 --> 01:23:21.571
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then cutting the hair and see how </v>

2233
01:23:21.571 --> 01:23:21.571
<v Speaker 4>people treated me.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cool.</v>

<v Speaker 4>did know who I didn't know who I was.</v>

2256

<v Speaker 4>I grew up overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's understandable?</v>

2257
01:24:08.521 --> 01:24:13.521
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a long time for everybody if </v>

2258
01:24:13.521 --> 01:24:13.521
<v Speaker 4>everything's worked out perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 4>released,</v>

2259
01:24:13.521 --> 01:24:14.170
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>

2260
01:24:14.171 --> 01:24:19.171
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every person that's ever lived know you </v>

2261
01:24:19.171 --> 01:24:19.171
<v Speaker 4>don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one ever fails.</v>

2262
01:24:19.171 --> 01:24:21.100
<v Speaker 4>If you do your full,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you mean if you're 18 years old,</v>

2263
01:24:21.101 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 4>you've got it all figured out and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck out of here.</v>

2264
01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.950
<v Speaker 4>That own apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like 15,</v>

2265
01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:28.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

2266
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:31.120
<v Speaker 4>not my problem when I was 15 and was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2267
01:24:31.121 --> 01:24:31.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a,</v>

2268
01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.700
<v Speaker 4>we call it when you are living in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>place you're squatting in a sense.</v>

2269
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:36.820
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2270
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:40.270
<v Speaker 4>I've been on my own all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine's just Robinson said to</v>

2271
01:24:40.271 --> 01:24:40.930
<v Speaker 4>me one day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

2272
01:24:40.931 --> 01:24:41.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack,</v>

2273
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.130
<v Speaker 4>you basically been making your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions since she was a kid,</v>

2274
01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:49.060
<v Speaker 4>but now you understand yourself better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know who the fuck I was.</v>

2275
01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know who I was.</v>

2276
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:55.711
<v Speaker 4>I was just knew that I was living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But going through all the bad times,</v>

2277
01:24:56.231 --> 01:25:01.231
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably what has made your</v>
<v Speaker 4>character so strong today and now that </v>

2278
01:25:01.231 --> 01:25:04.861
<v Speaker 4>everything's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you you understand the importance of </v>

2279
01:25:04.861 --> 01:25:07.771
<v Speaker 4>keeping it good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why this positive message that </v>

2280
01:25:07.771 --> 01:25:07.771
<v Speaker 4>you keep pumping out.</v>

2281
01:25:07.771 --> 01:25:07.940
<v Speaker 4>And that's why this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go chat.</v>

2282
01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:11.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm one step away from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one step away,</v>

2283
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.670
<v Speaker 4>a fruit punch from not feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to Roscoe's yesterday,</v>

2284
01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great for getting waffles and I had a.</v>

2285
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:21.100
<v Speaker 4>I took a sip of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's it called?</v>

2286
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:22.780
<v Speaker 4>Eliminate Sunrise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2287
01:25:22.781 --> 01:25:25.950
<v Speaker 4>The fruit punch and sugary shit got me </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking bad.</v>

2288
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.830
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

2289
01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I feel terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like so again,</v>

2290
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.390
<v Speaker 4>I say that you say I want a path and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the great power.</v>

2291
01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:36.310
<v Speaker 4>But so is so crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diet's important.</v>

2292
01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Who I'm around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's important.</v>

2293
01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:43.460
<v Speaker 4>You feel what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that's the energy you feel me </v>

2294
01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:43.460
<v Speaker 4>and I'm around somebody doing some </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative shit.</v>

2295
01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:48.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm not on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't need to be around this </v>

2296
01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.821
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even listen to like that much </v>

<v Speaker 4>hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listen to beats.</v>

2298
01:25:50.821 --> 01:25:52.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't eat because I don't want to hear</v>
<v Speaker 4>you drinking,</v>

2299
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.740

<v Speaker 4>I already went through that and that was</v>

2303
01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:04.801
<v Speaker 4>a bad portion of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The nineties is something that I wish </v>

<v Speaker 4>world for get that around the world is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kids don't have guidance.</v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2345
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:39.650
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have a role model.</v>

2346
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:42.260
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they looked at my videos were days.</v>

2347
01:27:42.261 --> 01:27:43.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to make videos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

2348
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:45.320
<v Speaker 4>I get text chat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You okay?</v>

2349
01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.260
<v Speaker 4>You okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chad,</v>

2350
01:27:48.261 --> 01:27:49.580
<v Speaker 4>we haven't heard from you in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>

2351
01:27:49.581 --> 01:27:54.581
<v Speaker 4>So I have a responsibility now to help </v>
<v Speaker 4>others make them feel happy by being </v>

2352
01:27:54.581 --> 01:27:56.270
<v Speaker 4>happy sometimes when I don't even feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>

2353
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:58.670
<v Speaker 4>But I think one of the things you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying it's really important that you're</v>

2354
01:27:58.671 --> 01:28:01.370
<v Speaker 4>talking about a mental diet as well as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>physical 100 percent.</v>

2355
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 4>And I think you really do have a mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet and if you just take it,</v>

2356
01:28:04.431 --> 01:28:07.490
<v Speaker 4>nothing but negative things all day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>around negative people.</v>

2357
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:12.610
<v Speaker 4>And especially when you just expose </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself to 7 billion people's worth of </v>

2358
01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:16.151
<v Speaker 4>news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the only stuff that gets popular as </v>

2359

<v Speaker 4>because then it physically started </v>

<v Speaker 4>I felt so crazy with this election.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But right now I've got to focus on me </v>

2380

<v Speaker 4>mentally,</v>

2387
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:07.680
<v Speaker 4>What does it do for a man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The anxiety,</v>

2388
01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:08.910
<v Speaker 4>the Judas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>

2389
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:11.310
<v Speaker 4>the chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the what it does to your brain,</v>

2390
01:29:11.311 --> 01:29:12.960
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It alters it champ.</v>

2391
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:15.540
<v Speaker 4>All you got to be careful not to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>your medicine.</v>

2392
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:20.541
<v Speaker 4>Follow your doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not telling you you don't listen to </v>

2393
01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:20.541
<v Speaker 4>doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but me personally,</v>

2394
01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:25.220
<v Speaker 4>I had to go on a journey to find out how</v>
<v Speaker 4>to save me because I went to every </v>

2395
01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:30.141
<v Speaker 4>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know anything about hormones </v>

2396
01:29:30.141 --> 01:29:30.390
<v Speaker 4>and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know anything.</v>

2397
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:35.450
<v Speaker 4>They don't know how you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard you once say you want to find </v>

2398
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:38.670
<v Speaker 4>about your hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a super old doctor that looks </v>

2399
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:41.301
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that knows about this type of shit </v>

2400
01:29:41.301 --> 01:29:42.810
<v Speaker 4>because when you're feeling depressed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and your testosterone is like 80 or 20,</v>

2401
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:44.660
<v Speaker 4>you feel like killing yourself champ.</v>

2402
01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:50.060
<v Speaker 4>You've got to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People can't give you a bunch of pills </v>

2403
01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:50.190
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this will make you feel better.</v>

2404
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:52.110
<v Speaker 4>It's because you're still going to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>low test,</v>

2405
01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:54.930
<v Speaker 4>which for a man is gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make you feel like a bitch.</v>

2406
01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.940
<v Speaker 4>Excuse my language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just a fact.</v>

2407
01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.000
<v Speaker 4>So all these different factors play a </v>
<v Speaker 4>role.</v>

2408
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:02.010
<v Speaker 4>And also again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to what you're saying,</v>

2409
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.750
<v Speaker 4>what you're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mental diet.</v>

2410
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.750
<v Speaker 4>If you're watching people getting killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>all day,</v>

2411
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.440
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna feel a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all this shit is going on in your </v>

2412
01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.021
<v Speaker 4>brain and your mental stores.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel me and now you're just </v>

2413
01:30:15.021 --> 01:30:15.021
<v Speaker 4>wondering why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you're eating sugar.</v>

2414
01:30:15.021 --> 01:30:16.710
<v Speaker 4>He eating cookies and donuts and fast </v>
<v Speaker 4>food and Chinese food.</v>

2415
01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:20.580
<v Speaker 4>This shit ain't helping you weave the </v>
<v Speaker 4>champ and that's what I'm telling people</v>

2416
01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:21.480
<v Speaker 4>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>champ,</v>

2417
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:23.150
<v Speaker 4>leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too tempting.</v>

2418
01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:24.660
<v Speaker 4>Everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see fast food.</v>

2419
01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:26.730
<v Speaker 4>Take take the food home and cook it </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

2420
01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.150
<v Speaker 4>We've got to try to bet and it's not in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is it's not cheap,</v>

2421
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.340
<v Speaker 4>but we can afford to go to whole foods </v>
<v Speaker 4>every day,</v>

2422
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:33.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2423
01:30:33.571 --> 01:30:35.580
<v Speaker 4>Who can ice hard?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm struggling.</v>

2424
01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Who can afford every day to spend $150,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$20 for their family a day,</v>

2425
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.160
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit is hard chat.</v>

2426
01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

2427
01:30:43.150 --> 01:30:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important about a mental and a </v>

2428
01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:48.150
<v Speaker 1>physical diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

2429
01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:51.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing in that like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch it all the violence on </v>

2430
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.800
<v Speaker 1>television or all the negative news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like sugar.</v>

2431
01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Very compelling and to take in and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2432
01:30:55.010 --> 01:31:00.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had that sugar drink last night and I </v>

2433
01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:00.010
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm not used to it.</v>

2434
01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:00.380
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2435
01:31:00.381 --> 01:31:01.430
<v Speaker 4>I was feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2436
01:31:01.431 --> 01:31:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chill.</v>

2437
01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.880
<v Speaker 4>This is what people drinking every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all day every day.</v>

2438
01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.060
<v Speaker 4>And I was happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

2439
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:10.460
<v Speaker 4>I able to do it now I can't take a sip.</v>

2440
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy how your body adjusts your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

2441
01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:16.450
<v Speaker 1>your body adapts to not having sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling healthy.</v>

2442
01:31:16.451 --> 01:31:18.890
<v Speaker 1>And then when you do have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unhealthy you,</v>

2443
01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:23.980
<v Speaker 1>you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you really feel deep in your body </v>

2444

<v Speaker 1>and it was like somebody hit me with a </v>

2447
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:33.060
<v Speaker 1>tranquilizer dart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt terrible telling you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>nothing crazy,</v>

2450
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:39.790
<v Speaker 1>but I think what you're saying I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very important for people to take in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and then come out of it with this </v>

2453
01:31:47.131 --> 01:31:47.850
<v Speaker 1>positive energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is that.</v>

2454
01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:52.900
<v Speaker 1>That is so powerful for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a motivational thing for </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical.</v>

2480
01:32:52.991 --> 01:32:55.390
<v Speaker 3>When I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really passionate about it because</v>

2481
01:32:55.540 --> 01:33:00.540
<v Speaker 3>it's something that I was saying again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have nobody around me to whites to </v>

2482
01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:00.970
<v Speaker 3>have friends with me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm training,</v>

2483
01:33:00.971 --> 01:33:01.510
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2484
01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:03.400
<v Speaker 3>They all left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was always moved on.</v>

2485
01:33:03.401 --> 01:33:06.670

2486
01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:09.820
<v Speaker 3>I've got to push myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started talking to myself something</v>

2487
01:33:09.821 --> 01:33:12.070
<v Speaker 3>that I ever did and that's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>nother story.</v>

2488
01:33:12.071 --> 01:33:14.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna tell you in the book why I </v>
<v Speaker 3>refused to talk to myself.</v>

2489
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Why does your friends tell me I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saving it for Book Chalky,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2496
01:33:28.481 --> 01:33:30.370
<v Speaker 3>The reason why is because um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an uncle,</v>

2497
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:34.000
<v Speaker 3>my mother's brother Anthony part hand,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He went to the military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to the Vietnam war as a child,</v>

2499
01:33:37.091 --> 01:33:37.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a young man,</v>

2500
01:33:37.841 --> 01:33:39.130
<v Speaker 3>18 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he left high school,</v>

2501
01:33:39.131 --> 01:33:42.840
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have to because it was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sisters and he wanted to be Kogi.</v>

2502
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:44.860
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to go because everyone in </v>
<v Speaker 3>town,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Petersburg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Virginia,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody from his town,</v>

2506
01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:50.920
<v Speaker 3>the young men were going his own cousins</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody.</v>

2507
01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 3>So he went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came back,</v>

2508
01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm disturbed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came back,</v>

2509
01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different than when he went in.</v>

2510
01:33:57.131 --> 01:34:02.131
<v Speaker 3>He was actually missing for quite a time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we could declare him dead when he </v>

2511
01:34:02.131 --> 01:34:03.620
<v Speaker 3>showed up one day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2512
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:06.710
<v Speaker 3>with a trench coat on army boots and </v>
<v Speaker 3>neck it.</v>

2514
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Easy street in Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this led to him being mentally </v>

2515
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.890
<v Speaker 3>disturbed all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would talk to himself.</v>

2516
01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.020
<v Speaker 3>He lived with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2517
01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.200
<v Speaker 3>I slept in a twin bed here and he slept </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the bed there and he was with </v>

2518
01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 3>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He drank.</v>

2519
01:34:22.961 --> 01:34:24.930
<v Speaker 3>He became very violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2520
01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 3>he beat my mom up one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really bad colds.</v>

2521
01:34:27.491 --> 01:34:32.491
<v Speaker 3>I had eyes on him talking to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something I grew up all my life </v>

2522
01:34:32.491 --> 01:34:34.020
<v Speaker 3>watching and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I got older.</v>

2526
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:41.950
<v Speaker 3>I would just refuse to even have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with myself.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>conversations with myself.</v>

2529
