<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>because I think people think that there's something silly and there's something</v>

28
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>where people are not going to take you seriously,</v>

29
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>you're admitting to fucking some fake vagina,</v>

31
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

32
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.211
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

33
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

34
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.271
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

35
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I do shows and I have like a sex toy company name,</v>

36
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:02.121
<v Speaker 1>a fun factory does my live shows with me and there they had the cadillacs of FEC</v>

37
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>and vibrators and girls go crazy over that issue.</v>

38
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>He ever is.</v>

39
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Definitely a vibrator.</v>

40
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Girls are allowed to get vibrators.</v>

41
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Dudes are not allowed to have it before.</v>

42
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Like something that smelled like a raft pop.</v>

43
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Those things are useless.</v>

45
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>When fleshlight came along,</v>

46
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing else.</v>

47
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking good dude.</v>

48
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

49
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.431
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:19.771
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

51
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>have used it several times.</v>

53
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>It's way better than beating off.</v>

54
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's like a weird thing to admit.</v>

55
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>People don't admit that they masturbate.</v>

56
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>My name is Joe Rogan and I masturbate.</v>

57
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So this podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight because it's fucking solid</v>

58
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.251
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>

59
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

60
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

61
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Forget about all the what?</v>

62
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>When I first moved down here,</v>

63
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't masturbate or talk about masturbation to anybody.</v>

64
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>You're the first person from Ohio.</v>

65
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>You're the first person that I remember.</v>

66
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>You were always like talking about it.</v>

67
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

68
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I should talk about it.</v>

69
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I started talking about masturbating and then now it's just like,</v>

70
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I do it every day.</v>

71
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.410
<v Speaker 1>There are definitely some suppress people there.</v>

72

<v Speaker 1>shit about this product.</v>

80
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>People think it's ridiculous.</v>

81
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I used it the other day.</v>

00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I think people will.</v>

87
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Some people are not going to want to Zeus.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sam Tripoli is also going to get some Alpha brain today.</v>

100
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited about.</v>

101
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>We're also sponsored by Alpha brain.</v>

102
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>If you go to [inaudible] dot com,</v>

103
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>o n n I t a,</v>

104
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>we have a bunch of products now.</v>

105
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>We have Alpha brain and then we have this new,</v>

106
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>new mood knew mood is a five htp supplement,</v>

108
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.251
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

109
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:50.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I found out about that shift from Neal Brennan,</v>

111
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of different things that you can do.</v>

112
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>They're called nootropics to tweak your mind.</v>

113
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.031
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

114
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>this Alpha brain thing has not been without controversy.</v>

115
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I have to be honest.</v>

116
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>There's people who love it.</v>

117
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people who say it's a placebo.</v>

118
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do shit.</v>

119
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.190
<v Speaker 1>people have been taking these particular nutrients like Coleen and a bunch of</v>

121
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>different other ones were like,</v>

122
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>they're referred to as nootropics.</v>

123
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>They've been taking them for years.</v>

124
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind it is that it just makes you think a little clearer.</v>

125
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not this fucking Bradley Cooper,</v>

126
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>limitless shit.</v>

127
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to make you smart if you're dumb.</v>

128
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>But I liked the way it affects me.</v>

129
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I take two every morning with water and I believe in it.</v>

130
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.441
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

131
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>there's um,</v>

132
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of controversy about it though.</v>

133
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>There's controversy about the science behind it and we are doing the best to</v>

134
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>clear up all that stuff.</v>

135
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>We're going to release a new document tonight.</v>

136
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it might already be up there on on it for people who are concerned about</v>

137
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>the amount of l Dopa in it from a being the velvet bean,</v>

138
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:48.071
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

139
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>it's an extract of food extract.</v>

140
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.630
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind all of this is that I think the body works better when it's</v>

141
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>supplemented with nutrients with a lot of nutrients.</v>

142
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I think you work better when you take fish oil.</v>

143
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of controversy behind that.</v>

144
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I think your body works,</v>

145
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>but I know my joints work better when I take fish oil for sure.</v>

146
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>No question about it because I do a lot of really hard training.</v>

147
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I do Jujitsu and lift weights and when I don't take fish oil,</v>

148
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I notice a difference in how my joints feel.</v>

149
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a lot of fresh squeezed juices.</v>

155
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm very concerned with keeping my body running at a,</v>

156
00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>at a,</v>

157
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>at a good place,</v>

161
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>And when I take this stuff and I take this alphabet,</v>

162
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I can definitely notice a difference.</v>

163
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

164
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if everybody can and I don't know,</v>

165
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe some people are just negative.</v>

166
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:43.961
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

167
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe some people's bodies are just different because it's weird.</v>

171
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.930

172
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 1>He could because there's another,</v>

289
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:03.560
<v Speaker 1>It was like trying to figure it out,</v>

290
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.410
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

291

<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that great?</v>

293
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that immediate pussy.</v>

294
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like taking the condemned house and throwing down on it and being like,</v>

295
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>why don't I look better?</v>

296
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:16.511
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

297
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like I want you to take the test and let me know if you're the same as me</v>

298
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>because I took two weeks to figure it out.</v>

299
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>I look at our guts.</v>

300
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:25.320
<v Speaker 1>We have the same problems here,</v>

301

<v Speaker 1>I don't smoke cigarettes,</v>

304
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>but we've got the same problem.</v>

305
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>You should take a little time.</v>

306
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.933
<v Speaker 1>You might start to show.</v>

307
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 1>You would start this motherfucker,</v>

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

331
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.831
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing over there,</v>

332
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:17.510
<v Speaker 3>Brian?</v>

333
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 3>You're going to sniff things.</v>

334
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 3>Smoking Weirdo fucking smelled it for some reason.</v>

335
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:26.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what Mike Pocket Brian's going to be like when he's like 60.</v>

336
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.040
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is going to have the same child?</v>

337
00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 3>Their sense of humor just like this,</v>

338
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 3>but I did not realize I did that.</v>

339
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

340
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea why.</v>

341
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.323
<v Speaker 3>Just did that.</v>

342
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Because you tell so many people to sniff yours at home.</v>

343
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

344
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.791
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

345
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just with new things.</v>

346
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I like smelling new things,</v>

347
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 3>but I thought I do that.</v>

348
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I smelled things like getting a new laptop or a video game system.</v>

349
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:47.970
<v Speaker 3>We'd take off that Styrofoam.</v>

350
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:48.650
<v Speaker 3>We go,</v>

351
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

352
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I ate lobster last night and they give you the little bib thing and you gotta</v>

353
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 3>put it on,</v>

354
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

355
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 3>it seems ridiculous,</v>

356
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 3>but my little daughter wanted me to put it on and I decided to smell it.</v>

357
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 3>The Bib smelled gross.</v>

358
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

359
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 3>it's plastic,</v>

360
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 3>but like a weird plastic smell.</v>

361
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Not like the Macdonald Bibs or whatever.</v>

362
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Like throw away ones.</v>

363
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

364
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:09.691
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

365
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 3>I am thinking of that age.</v>

366
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I would ever go near lobster.</v>

367
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

368
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.671
<v Speaker 3>because it's a kid.</v>

369
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a monster.</v>

370
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to go.</v>

371
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.100
<v Speaker 3>They need a octopus real fucking.</v>

372
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>

373
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 3>there's the eat octopus doesn't to like.</v>

374
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

375
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.053
<v Speaker 3>Oh my daughters.</v>

376
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:24.361
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

377
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 3>what optimism is that video?</v>

378
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:27.661
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

379
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 3>is that even fucking possible?</v>

380
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.023
<v Speaker 3>Lobsters.</v>

381
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.100
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking pee.</v>

382
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.973
<v Speaker 3>There's a group of people,</v>

383
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.581
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not.</v>

384
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 3>I called the lobster liberation group and these motherfuckers,</v>

385
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 3>they go out and they break into markets and restaurants and they take the</v>

386
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 3>lobsters out and they release them in the wild.</v>

387
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Could you fucking imagine how dumb you have to be to risk your freedom because</v>

388
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:54.981
<v Speaker 3>you will go to jail for this or for a bunch of solace fucking bugs or how like</v>

389
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 3>how like Kushy Kushy your life must be that.</v>

390
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:03.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem that you want to solve in the world of all the problems like</v>

391
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.130
<v Speaker 3>you must have your credit cards must be paid off.</v>

392
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Your credit must be great.</v>

393
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.230
<v Speaker 3>You must be on some kind of salary from your parents that you want to go save</v>

394
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 3>little creature from like water.</v>

395
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.321
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

396
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:13.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

397
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 3>and little creatures that don't give a fuck about you,</v>

398
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 3>that not only do they not give a fuck about you,</v>

399
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:18.700
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

400
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 3>they're too stupid to feel pain,</v>

401
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.090
<v Speaker 3>but what about the thing about the killer whale where they're like people,</v>

402
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.080
<v Speaker 3>that's what they wanted to say,</v>

403
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:25.730
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>

404
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.320
<v Speaker 3>they should have the right to people that killer whales are a completely</v>

405
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.040
<v Speaker 3>different animal.</v>

406
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.411
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

407
00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 3>you're now you're talking about something where I'm probably agree with them.</v>

408
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 3>I think what's going on with killer whales,</v>

409
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 3>killer whales are a super intelligent life form that we can't understand and</v>

410
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Speaker 3>because we can't understand them like,</v>

411
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 3>well that's a category and getting a fucking cage then a light going in cages.</v>

412
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 3>They don't like being in those ponds.</v>

413
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 3>They want to be in the goddamn ocean and they're really attached to their</v>

414
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.310
<v Speaker 3>families and they steal them.</v>

415
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 3>They steal them from their fucking mothers when they're,</v>

416
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.020
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

417
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 4>this is really the most evil shit ever.</v>

418
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:56.681
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

419
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 4>Dolphin Training and Orca training,</v>

420
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 4>it might look cool because they're jumping up to get their fish,</v>

421
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.811
<v Speaker 4>but guess what?</v>

422
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 4>They have to jump up to get their fish.</v>

423
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 4>You don't know how depressed they are.</v>

424
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 4>You don't know how fucked it must be to live that kind of a life.</v>

425
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like us getting abducted by aliens and they put us in a really small</v>

426
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 4>apartment complex with a pool and we all kind of hang out at the pool,</v>

427
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:16.781
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

428
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 4>And then that's exactly what it's like for these dolphins.</v>

429
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:19.301
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

430
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:19.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

431
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.660
<v Speaker 4>as for social world and they can never have freedom,</v>

432
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 4>they can never be free then in that sense,</v>

433
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:27.820
<v Speaker 4>I think often never over.</v>

434
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up for life.</v>

435
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

436
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up.</v>

437
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.080
<v Speaker 4>That's not cool.</v>

438
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking the other day about how like I just got a dog,</v>

439
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

440
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 4>it's my first responsibility in a long time and uh,</v>

441
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 4>I just watched his dog and all it does is I'm basically can't.</v>

442
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like Kathy Griffin's assistant.</v>

443
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 4>I just get ran by this dog constantly.</v>

444
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 4>And algae does is eat poop and eat herself out.</v>

445
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:50.500
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty much all my dog does.</v>

446
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Jesus stuff out all day,</v>

447
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 4>all day.</v>

448
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 4>It was done a little under a year,</v>

449
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.473
<v Speaker 4>little over a year.</v>

450
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

451
00:12:56.981 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Speaker 4>if aliens come and make us pet,</v>

452
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 4>is this what I'm going to be able to do it because that's not so bad.</v>

453
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 4>Like I could just eat and then suck myself off.</v>

454
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.253
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

455
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.741
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

456
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:06.790
<v Speaker 4>you can suck your own Dick.</v>

457
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 4>I can try.</v>

458
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.471
<v Speaker 4>Second of all.</v>

459
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:08.861
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

460
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:09.111
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

461
00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:11.350
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to have the freedom to go as you choose.</v>

462
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:12.220
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

463
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.130
<v Speaker 4>You don't know,</v>

464
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.370
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

465
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.180
<v Speaker 4>number one thing that would drive you the most craziest to know that your</v>

466
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 4>existence is defined by four walls forever.</v>

467
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 4>That's a for a person.</v>

468
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 4>That's maddening.</v>

469
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 4>The person wants to experience new things,</v>

470
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 4>is a natural thing to check out new movies,</v>

471
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 4>go down to a new restaurant,</v>

472
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:28.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

473
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:28.570
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

474
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 4>go drive through a new neighborhood.</v>

475
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 4>It's part of what we are.</v>

476
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 4>We like to explore things.</v>

477
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 4>We're curious.</v>

478
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.240
<v Speaker 4>You tell a person and this is all you're going to see this,</v>

479
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.050
<v Speaker 4>the only input you're going to get forever.</v>

480
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 4>They'll go fucking crazy.</v>

481
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 4>It was what we're doing in those dolphins.</v>

482
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're doing in those orchids.</v>

483
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.150
<v Speaker 4>We just assume that because they can't alter their environment,</v>

484
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:47.890
<v Speaker 4>that they can't be as intelligent as us,</v>

485
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 4>but they could be a matter of fact,</v>

486
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 4>the cerebral cortex of an ORC is like 40 percent larger than that of a human</v>

487
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:53.890
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

488
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.551
<v Speaker 4>so we don't know.</v>

489
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 4>We don't know if that's because it has to manipulate this really super large</v>

490
00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 4>body because we do know that neanderthals were dumber than people,</v>

491
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:01.330
<v Speaker 4>but they had bigger brains.</v>

492
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:01.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

493
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.530
<v Speaker 4>so it might have been just too,</v>

494
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 4>because neanderthals had basically like superhero bodies.</v>

495
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 4>They were like an anatomic,</v>

496
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.021
<v Speaker 4>like five,</v>

497
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:08.441
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

498
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 4>200 fucking pounds of solid muscle with these.</v>

499
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy bone structure like a chimp,</v>

500
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:13.931
<v Speaker 4>but you don't know.</v>

501
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:14.231
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>

502
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:14.711
<v Speaker 4>maybe that,</v>

503
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

504
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean they could be as smart because they were starting from less.</v>

505
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:18.904
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

506
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Like we're farther along in the past so we're dealing with more complex shit.</v>

507
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 4>But you had to start at the simple thought and then build on that.</v>

508
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:30.370
<v Speaker 4>Over time you may have just had the same kind of ability to think,</v>

509
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.700
<v Speaker 4>but you have to start at nothing and build that something.</v>

510
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:34.570
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand what I'm saying?</v>

511
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.380
<v Speaker 4>We don't quite know whether or not neanderthals were making tools before they</v>

512
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 4>learned them from Homo sapiens either.</v>

513
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:41.074
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>

514
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.830
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot.</v>

515
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of debate on that.</v>

516
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:46.570
<v Speaker 4>I think they think that the homosapiens just fucking basically wiped them out.</v>

517
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 4>We were just too clever,</v>

518
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 4>but that might be wrong.</v>

519
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

520
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe they were about it.</v>

521
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.030
<v Speaker 4>What if</v>

522
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.980
<v Speaker 3>one of their cell phones,</v>

523
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 3>they send a grated from that long?</v>

524
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

525
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 3>What if,</v>

526
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 3>what if their heads were that big because they were looking on their screens so</v>

527
00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 3>much and the Internet made their head's bigger and then they all got wiped out</v>

528
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:02.241
<v Speaker 3>and died.</v>

529
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 3>And you really think that there could have possibly been an internet at some</v>

530
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 3>point in the past?</v>

531
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

532
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:06.770
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

533
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Definitely 100 percent.</v>

534
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

535
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.290
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

536
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 3>How many thousands of years ago do you think it would have to have six?</v>

537
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

538
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.403
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kidding.</v>

539
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

540
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:16.180
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

541
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.610
<v Speaker 3>but based on what this is,</v>

542
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 3>30,000 years ago.</v>

543
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:20.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

544
00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:22.230
<v Speaker 1>So you got to go way back because six,</v>

545
00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:24.720
<v Speaker 1>we know we go to six and we know like,</v>

546
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.700
<v Speaker 1>they know that a Sumerian text they know,</v>

547
00:15:27.701 --> 00:15:27.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

548
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.280
<v Speaker 1>they wrote the tuner form.</v>

549
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.233
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird.</v>

550
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.140
<v Speaker 1>It looks like little,</v>

551
00:15:31.141 --> 00:15:31.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

552
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:32.910
<v Speaker 1>like nails,</v>

553
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

554
00:15:33.481 --> 00:15:36.360
<v Speaker 1>like old nails ever see how an old nails,</v>

555
00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:38.460
<v Speaker 1>not like a straight line with a flat top on it,</v>

556
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like the whole piece is like,</v>

557
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:41.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:15:41.221 --> 00:15:43.230
<v Speaker 1>angled and that's what they're like writing,</v>

559
00:15:43.231 --> 00:15:43.681
<v Speaker 1>look like,</v>

560
00:15:43.681 --> 00:15:44.700
<v Speaker 1>look like old nails,</v>

561
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:46.050
<v Speaker 1>like sideways and upside down.</v>

562
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It really weird fucking crazy language when you think about it because it was</v>

563
00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:54.591
<v Speaker 1>all basically most of the same characters just reused in some weird order that</v>

564
00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:57.390
<v Speaker 1>they understood and they had come to agree on.</v>

565
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.720
<v Speaker 1>And so we had to sort of decipher that because it's a dead language.</v>

566
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.160
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what it sounds like,</v>

567
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:02.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:04.350
<v Speaker 1>like no one talks it so they,</v>

569
00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:06.000
<v Speaker 1>they know of the Sumerians wrote,</v>

570
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.451
<v Speaker 1>although it's,</v>

571
00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:10.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is under debate because of there's a guy named Zechariah switching.</v>

572
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.280
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard about him.</v>

573
00:16:11.281 --> 00:16:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't trust anyone named Zechariah who was a bad motherfucker,</v>

574
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.270
<v Speaker 1>but he was never.</v>

575
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.830
<v Speaker 1>He was a believer and he believed that the Sumerian texts was all about the</v>

576
00:16:19.831 --> 00:16:20.521
<v Speaker 1>Annunaki,</v>

577
00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:24.930
<v Speaker 1>which is a an alien race from another planet that came down here that isn't an</v>

578
00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:25.860
<v Speaker 1>elliptical orbit,</v>

579
00:16:25.861 --> 00:16:26.310
<v Speaker 1>this planet,</v>

580
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.091
<v Speaker 1>every 3000,</v>

581
00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:32.091
<v Speaker 1>600 years and that they came down here to get humans and they created us from</v>

582
00:16:32.221 --> 00:16:34.260
<v Speaker 1>lower hominids by adding their DNA.</v>

583
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>This is all like supposedly in the scenario</v>

584
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:36.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't have.</v>

585
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.291
<v Speaker 3>You know what man,</v>

586
00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:38.460
<v Speaker 3>when they talk about angels,</v>

587
00:16:38.461 --> 00:16:39.570
<v Speaker 3>you never know man.</v>

588
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.700
<v Speaker 3>There could be some crazy shit coming down.</v>

589
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.241
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

590
00:16:42.241 --> 00:16:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

591
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.440
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it probably is what Brian is saying.</v>

592
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.990
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it probably is 30,000 years ago,</v>

593
00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:47.621
<v Speaker 1>not six,</v>

594
00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:48.790
<v Speaker 1>but 30,000 years ago,</v>

595
00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:50.890
<v Speaker 1>there was like a super fucking advanced civilization.</v>

596
00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:54.100
<v Speaker 1>They'd reached the heights that we've reached and what happened?</v>

597
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Who knows</v>

598
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.410
<v Speaker 3>if someone came in his answer,</v>

599
00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I think there are way past us and then they invented something that's still with</v>

600
00:17:00.211 --> 00:17:02.220
<v Speaker 3>us that we just don't know even know about yet.</v>

601
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:02.521
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

602
00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:03.160
<v Speaker 3>like they like,</v>

603
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:03.993
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>

604
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:09.070
<v Speaker 3>they invaded like air that could a heel and send information or something like</v>

605
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.220
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

606
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.740
<v Speaker 3>And we haven't turned into it once we figured out a machine.</v>

607
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

608
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.300
<v Speaker 3>I believe in that.</v>

609
00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:15.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

610
00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:16.560
<v Speaker 3>And it's like the Internet.</v>

611
00:17:16.561 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like the version of the Internet now look,</v>

612
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.881
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

613
00:17:18.881 --> 00:17:21.630
<v Speaker 3>you could never have explained the Internet to somebody 50 years ago.</v>

614
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.380
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing you ever looked at the old videos when they try to explain</v>

615
00:17:25.381 --> 00:17:27.120
<v Speaker 3>computers like in the eighties,</v>

616
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:28.771
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

617
00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:31.920
<v Speaker 3>what was the thing that they used to use back in the wild west days?</v>

618
00:17:31.921 --> 00:17:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Remember de de de de de de Morse code.</v>

619
00:17:35.131 --> 00:17:35.401
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

620
00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:37.200
<v Speaker 3>what they used back in the old wild west days?</v>

621
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:37.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

622
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.161
<v Speaker 3>it was called.</v>

623
00:17:38.161 --> 00:17:38.791
<v Speaker 3>What was it called?</v>

624
00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:39.051
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

625
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:39.270
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

626
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.120
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't called Mars.</v>

627
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.380
<v Speaker 3>You could troll someone so easy on Morris Code.</v>

628
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 3>They'd have no idea it was you,</v>

629
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

630
00:17:45.091 --> 00:17:46.050
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like facebook.</v>

631
00:17:46.051 --> 00:17:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Or let me see your picture.</v>

632
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.870
<v Speaker 3>Take a picture right now of you and put it on your</v>

633
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.821
<v Speaker 4>is what I want you to do.</v>

634
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 4>Want you to wear red,</v>

635
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 4>white and blue socks on.</v>

636
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 4>Old people talk more</v>

637
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 4>imagined back then telling people that you're going to be able to watch people</v>

638
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 4>fuck on your phone.</v>

639
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:02.401
<v Speaker 4>So look at that,</v>

640
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 4>see my phone,</v>

641
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 4>I can watch people fuck on this.</v>

642
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.770
<v Speaker 4>It will be mind blowing.</v>

643
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.900
<v Speaker 4>You watched me go fuck on it.</v>

644
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 4>It's streams and perfect time.</v>

645
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:09.730
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

646
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean like just to quantum leap,</v>

647
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.461
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

648
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine what's going to be in 10 years.</v>

649
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 4>In 20 years the real,</v>

650
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:15.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

651
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:20.631
<v Speaker 4>there's people that have a real scientific be scientifically based theory that</v>

652
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.770
<v Speaker 4>the entire world that we live in is like a computer simulation and there's like,</v>

653
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

654
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.640
<v Speaker 4>when they start getting into quantum theory and you know,</v>

655
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand quantum physics and Richard Feynman said it best.</v>

656
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:33.061
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

657
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 4>if you think you understand quantum physics,</v>

658
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand quantum physics because even the scientists don't really,</v>

659
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

660
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.600
<v Speaker 4>they're still like a lot.</v>

661
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 4>It just violates all these laws.</v>

662
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:45.330
<v Speaker 4>Like there's things like a particle and being superposition where it's moving</v>

663
00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 4>and still at the same time and they can appear in more than one place at the</v>

664
00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:50.820
<v Speaker 4>same time and disappear and they literally,</v>

665
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 4>the particles disappeared.</v>

666
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 4>We don't know where the fuck they go.</v>

667
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:56.040
<v Speaker 4>They go away and then they come back and on top of that,</v>

668
00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 4>particles seem to be interacting with each other despite no matter how long the</v>

669
00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.520
<v Speaker 4>distances between them,</v>

670
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 4>they seem to be able to automatically like instantaneously interact with each</v>

671
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:06.871
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

672
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:07.690
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

673
00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:07.921
<v Speaker 4>There.</v>

674
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 4>They can interact quicker than the speed of light apparently.</v>

675
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:10.710
<v Speaker 4>So it's.</v>

676
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 4>So it's.</v>

677
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.090
<v Speaker 4>I can't even talk about it because I'm not exactly sure what I'm saying.</v>

678
00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

679
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.470
<v Speaker 4>to me it's like what I'm saying is like,</v>

680
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you taught me how to say something in French,</v>

681
00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:21.420
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what it means and if you're like xenophobic,</v>

682
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 4>why Misha and then I just replete the noises,</v>

683
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what I'm saying.</v>

684
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.580
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying right now what I'm talking about this,</v>

685
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:27.811
<v Speaker 4>you know it's there,</v>

686
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 4>but you're not quite sure what you're saying.</v>

687
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.220
<v Speaker 4>But the bottom line is it's so strange and so bizarre and so not something that</v>

688
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:36.541
<v Speaker 4>you can bang on.</v>

689
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 4>So not what we're used to in this world that really literally anything is</v>

690
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:40.801
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

691
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:41.030
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

692
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:41.390
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

693
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.130
<v Speaker 4>this may very well be a computer simulation.</v>

694
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.371
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

695
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 4>going back to that computer simulation thing,</v>

696
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 4>that scene in the matrix is kind of what that's about.</v>

697
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:54.411
<v Speaker 4>Do you know where like neo neo meets like the creator and he talks about how</v>

698
00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 4>like he's the eighth one or the 11th one and he's reacting different than all</v>

699
00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:00.474
<v Speaker 4>the other ones.</v>

700
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of what that's about and that no matter what happens,</v>

701
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.920
<v Speaker 4>people react the same way to stimulate and you hear that a lot about when they</v>

702
00:20:07.921 --> 00:20:08.401
<v Speaker 4>talk about,</v>

703
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:08.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

704
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.211
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

705
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:10.500
<v Speaker 4>the Illuminati or whatever,</v>

706
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 4>when they're trying to do a,</v>

707
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:16.170
<v Speaker 4>they do certain things and see how people will react over time so that when they</v>

708
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:17.760
<v Speaker 4>want to cause something to happen,</v>

709
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.690
<v Speaker 4>they know the exact reaction of what people mean when they crashed the economy.</v>

710
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 4>They want to see how people react,</v>

711
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:24.150
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>

712
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Speaker 4>And that was the scene in the matrix where he's like,</v>

713
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 4>you're reacting different than the last seven guys have because it's no matter</v>

714
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:31.230
<v Speaker 4>what happens,</v>

715
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.030
<v Speaker 4>people are going to do the same thing.</v>

716
00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 4>We act like we're different.</v>

717
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 4>And that's a whole thing from talking like your stone.</v>

718
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:37.321
<v Speaker 4>You're not even a stone.</v>

719
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:38.154
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>

720
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 4>That's what that old saying.</v>

721
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

722
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 4>that's what he's saying.</v>

723
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:41.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

724
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:42.294
<v Speaker 4>He's just.</v>

725
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

726
00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.250
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand what I'm saying.</v>

727
00:20:44.251 --> 00:20:45.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making sense.</v>

728
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.680
<v Speaker 4>You connected a couple of things together that I'm baffled by.</v>

729
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know</v>

730
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 3>the scene in the matrix.</v>

731
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I think I might be on the wrong scene.</v>

732
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Explained to me there's a scene where he walks in.</v>

733
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.240
<v Speaker 3>This is the first matrix.</v>

734
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:55.451
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

735
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 3>this is like the second,</v>

736
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.813
<v Speaker 3>third possible.</v>

737
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Why cut off after the first?</v>

738
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

739
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 3>you have to go back and watch those without the emotions.</v>

740
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 3>It's so much better.</v>

741
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Without the expectations.</v>

742
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Speaker 3>The emotions of this is going to be great.</v>

743
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be the greatest movie ever.</v>

744
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.250
<v Speaker 3>You put too much,</v>

745
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

746
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.360
<v Speaker 3>too much into it and then you're like,</v>

747
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't live up to your expectations,</v>

748
00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 3>but without those expectations,</v>

749
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:18.410
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a great movie in the maximum here.</v>

750
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:18.971
<v Speaker 3>Here's what it is,</v>

751
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 3>buddy.</v>

752
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.070
<v Speaker 3>There was one really good movie and then the next one sucked.</v>

753
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 3>I like the first and second one.</v>

754
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I thought the third one was okay.</v>

755
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Just that one scene was the only problem I have.</v>

756
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Watch them again.</v>

757
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.250
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

758
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.340
<v Speaker 3>so what are you saying it yet?</v>

759
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 3>What do you say?</v>

760
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:38.100
<v Speaker 3>So neo walks into this room and he meets the creator of the Matrix and the guy</v>

761
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:40.600
<v Speaker 3>says that the,</v>

762
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 3>based upon the neos reaction to what he's saying is that he's different than the</v>

763
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.083
<v Speaker 3>rest.</v>

764
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.230
<v Speaker 3>And basically what he's saying is that the human beings,</v>

765
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:53.430
<v Speaker 3>they keep resetting everything because they keep getting freewill.</v>

766
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.120
<v Speaker 3>They keep fighting back against the matrix.</v>

767
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 3>So they reset everything and everyone reacts the same way.</v>

768
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 3>They reset it and it becomes another computer program and he act,</v>

769
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 3>he acting different than all the past ones.</v>

770
00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 3>His emotions are different.</v>

771
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:08.440
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I'm trying to say.</v>

772
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.900
<v Speaker 3>And then I've read books about how like these guides,</v>

773
00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 3>the Illuminati or whatever you want to call them,</v>

774
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.980
<v Speaker 3>who supposedly running the country and the,</v>

775
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:15.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

776
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.080
<v Speaker 3>they opened the Federal Reserve and stuff like that from the Federal Reserve.</v>

777
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Speaker 3>They created the Federal Reserve.</v>

778
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:21.334
<v Speaker 3>Sorry about that.</v>

779
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

780
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

781
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.631
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

782
00:22:22.631 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 3>that's like one was listening to Magic Johnson today.</v>

783
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

784
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:25.871
<v Speaker 3>and he was in,</v>

785
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 3>they were replaying his whole speech about catching the HIV and he used the</v>

786
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:33.090
<v Speaker 3>wrong words instead of contract says,</v>

787
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 3>I have a penis,</v>

788
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I forget what word you.</v>

789
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

790
00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

791
00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 3>a speechmaker must have gotten pissed right there.</v>

792
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 3>But back to what I was saying that they,</v>

793
00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.050
<v Speaker 3>they do certain things where they just see what the reaction of people will will</v>

794
00:22:44.051 --> 00:22:44.770
<v Speaker 3>be over time.</v>

795
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.110
<v Speaker 3>You should see that movie multiple times and every time you see it you get into</v>

796
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.150
<v Speaker 3>some emotion to it and become a what a mind fuck it would be if you went to a</v>

797
00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 3>movie and you know,</v>

798
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 3>like maybe the glitch in the computer program was that when you went to see the</v>

799
00:22:58.301 --> 00:22:59.260
<v Speaker 3>movie the second time,</v>

800
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.390
<v Speaker 3>there was a scene in that wasn't there the first time.</v>

801
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.591
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's cool.</v>

802
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

803
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:03.971
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

804
00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:04.470
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

805
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.530
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

806
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:05.770
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

807
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 3>the movie ends,</v>

808
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's different and you,</v>

809
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

810
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a mind fuck because you're like,</v>

811
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:10.931
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

812
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember that.</v>

813
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.100
<v Speaker 3>And the people on the other end like,</v>

814
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

815
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that fucking scene was in the movie.</v>

816
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we showed them that.</v>

817
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 3>I think we showed him the first version of it.</v>

818
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

819
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.570
<v Speaker 3>So this poor guy has got to like wander through,</v>

820
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 3>try to figure out if this going insane.</v>

821
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if that's what it was.</v>

822
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Insane people are,</v>

823
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 3>it's their program,</v>

824
00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:29.051
<v Speaker 3>their program,</v>

825
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:31.400
<v Speaker 3>the one that they're living in has a crazy glitch in it.</v>

826
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 3>It's just some glitch.</v>

827
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.780
<v Speaker 3>So just wandering around.</v>

828
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:36.030
<v Speaker 3>They're all fucked up and homeless.</v>

829
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.800
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to explain the fucking things.</v>

830
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that video that everyone's got on reddit and they're going after</v>

831
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:42.850
<v Speaker 3>this kid in Chicago because he,</v>

832
00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

833
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 3>he punched this old homeless man in the head and knocked him out</v>

834
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 4>on video.</v>

835
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

836
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 4>And then they were laughing about it.</v>

837
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:48.974
<v Speaker 4>And you see this,</v>

838
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 4>the whole Internet is going after this kid because it's one of the cruelest,</v>

839
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:54.141
<v Speaker 4>nastiest,</v>

840
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 4>meanest fucking things I've ever seen someone do to an old man who,</v>

841
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.963
<v Speaker 4>a homeless guy.</v>

842
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.020
<v Speaker 4>And he's broke and he's asking people for a young kid,</v>

843
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.470
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>

844
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.861
<v Speaker 4>18,</v>

845
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:05.060
<v Speaker 4>maybe it looks like your kid,</v>

846
00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:05.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

847
00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:05.661
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

848
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:06.430
<v Speaker 4>it could be 20,</v>

849
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.263
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a kid.</v>

850
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.090
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

851
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.691
<v Speaker 4>he is,</v>

852
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

853
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 4>they're all standing there and this poor guy is like old and rickety and barely</v>

854
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 4>walk.</v>

855
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.580
<v Speaker 4>And the gates of the train opened the doors to train open and he says something</v>

856
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 4>to the old man like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're getting hit by the fucking world thinking about what's happening.</v>

873
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.020

<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

889

890
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:16.700
<v Speaker 4>that someone could want to do that to someone for no fucking reason whatsoever.</v>

898
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.610
<v Speaker 4>when they're young and sometimes that's like spanking or stuff like that where</v>

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:43.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1005
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.371
<v Speaker 4>That's not that funny.</v>

1006
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:45.204
<v Speaker 4>You don't do that too.</v>

1007
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 4>It was a dude.</v>

1008
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.740
<v Speaker 4>It would be way funnier,</v>

1009
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:48.120
<v Speaker 4>but doing it to a cute little girl.</v>

1010
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:48.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1011
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.291
<v Speaker 4>come on man.</v>

1012
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:50.124
<v Speaker 4>Why you doing that?</v>

1013
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.270
<v Speaker 4>So this was a little girl.</v>

1014
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1015
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.471
<v Speaker 4>And she's a little girl.</v>

1016
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.320
<v Speaker 4>She's drinking.</v>

1017
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:53.701
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1018
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:54.534
<v Speaker 4>why are you shitting on?</v>

1019
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Where's your boyfriend?</v>

1020
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.880
<v Speaker 4>Where somebody's boyfriend.</v>

1021
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:57.714
<v Speaker 4>She didn't have a boyfriend.</v>

1022
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 4>I guess they were drinking.</v>

1023
00:27:59.401 --> 00:27:59.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1024
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.700
<v Speaker 4>should it gets crazy you.</v>

1025
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you're 17,</v>

1026
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:02.371
<v Speaker 4>18,</v>

1027
00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:03.061
<v Speaker 4>whatever the hell she is,</v>

1028
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what the hell you're doing.</v>

1029
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 4>But I have this thing with the bullies to man.</v>

1030
00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:07.180
<v Speaker 4>It's just like I,</v>

1031
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.870
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1032
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 4>I understand the whole move to stop bullying and it's true.</v>

1033
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 4>But I have this thing where you got to understand it.</v>

1034
00:28:12.451 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 4>Some of these bullies also are rarely hurt children and they come from bad</v>

1035
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>

1036
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:18.790
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

1037
00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying,</v>

1038
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:20.401
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1039
00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:20.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1040
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 4>let's not stop bullying,</v>

1041
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.440
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1042
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:22.981
<v Speaker 4>I don't want,</v>

1043
00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:27.870
<v Speaker 4>I hate when adults put their issues on children and because a lot of these</v>

1044
00:28:27.871 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 4>adults got bullied in high school,</v>

1045
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:31.050
<v Speaker 4>they want to go back and clean it up.</v>

1046
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 4>But you got to understand that these kids have social issues and mental issues</v>

1047
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

1048
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.090
<v Speaker 4>that you don't want to.</v>

1049
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.220
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to tag them with something,</v>

1050
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.260
<v Speaker 4>some kind of police record that's going to screw their whole rest of life up</v>

1051
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 4>though the rest of their life up.</v>

1052
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:43.830
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1053
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.150
<v Speaker 4>But you have to protect her,</v>

1054
00:28:45.151 --> 00:28:45.870
<v Speaker 4>the other students,</v>

1055
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.400
<v Speaker 4>100 percent of the other students.</v>

1056
00:28:47.401 --> 00:28:48.151
<v Speaker 4>And you've got to figure out,</v>

1057
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:48.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1058
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:53.220
<v Speaker 4>the real issue is parents that do a terrible job of raising kids are never</v>

1059
00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 4>penalized for it.</v>

1060
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:54.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1061
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 4>you never get in trouble.</v>

1062
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:56.011
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1063
00:28:56.011 --> 00:28:58.800
<v Speaker 4>you can do a terrible job of driving your car and you can get tickets.</v>

1064
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.371
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1065
00:28:59.371 --> 00:28:59.850
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

1066
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.190
<v Speaker 4>Nothing happens when you raise a shit kid.</v>

1067
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.200
<v Speaker 4>Your kid could be a God damn serial killer.</v>

1068
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.660
<v Speaker 4>My dog got sound bites.</v>

1069
00:29:05.661 --> 00:29:07.830
<v Speaker 4>Someone I get sued 100 percent.</v>

1070
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go to jail,</v>

1071
00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:09.750
<v Speaker 4>I got a bad dog,</v>

1072
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 4>but if you have a kid and your kid goes out and kill somebody,</v>

1073
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 4>you're not even somehow responsible for it.</v>

1074
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.050
<v Speaker 4>That tried to do that for a while.</v>

1075
00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.230
<v Speaker 4>Then there was this big bash backlash against Moses.</v>

1076
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 4>There was something where like the this one area and I honestly Chicago,</v>

1077
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not 100 percent sure that they were going to try to do something where</v>

1078
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 4>parents were going to be held accountable for their children's actions.</v>

1079
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't surprise me.</v>

1080
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.970
<v Speaker 4>You kind of should be in some way,</v>

1081
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:33.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1082
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1083
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.310
<v Speaker 4>not entirely named me,</v>

1084
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:36.270
<v Speaker 4>but can.</v>

1085
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.310
<v Speaker 4>You never know what happens once the kid leaves the nest.</v>

1086
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.031
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1087
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 4>and what if the kid has a predilection for addiction?</v>

1088
00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>

1089
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.290
<v Speaker 1>if the kid has got that wacky gene,</v>

1090
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.380
<v Speaker 1>they can't drink cough syrup or fucking goes on a bender,</v>

1091
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:47.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1092
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:49.010
<v Speaker 1>and that is a real gene man.</v>

1093
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I think you and I have both seen it.</v>

1094
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.330
<v Speaker 1>We all in the comedy world especially,</v>

1095
00:29:52.331 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 1>we know a lot of wacky people that can't smoke.</v>

1096
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:56.050
<v Speaker 1>A joint camp can have a drink,</v>

1097
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:56.650
<v Speaker 1>can't do it,</v>

1098
00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:57.431
<v Speaker 1>can't do it.</v>

1099
00:29:57.431 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you say.</v>

1100
00:29:58.421 --> 00:29:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's different man.</v>

1101
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1102
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I have my own problems with that stuff and uh,</v>

1103
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:02.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1104
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:03.230
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1105
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1106
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like in my family,</v>

1107
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 1>they have different forms of it,</v>

1108
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:06.881
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1109
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got their own kind of little.</v>

1110
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 1>They're little vice and I,</v>

1111
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:10.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
00:30:10.431 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I have my advice too and I just,</v>

1113
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just I'm all or nothing type of guy.</v>

1114
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1115
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I have a very similar personality,</v>

1116
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:17.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's not with substances.</v>

1117
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Luckily I take time off of weed all the time.</v>

1118
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a couple of weeks off.</v>

1119
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't,</v>

1120
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.993
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother me at all.</v>

1121
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd never feel the need to drink coffee is the only thing that I've ever been</v>

1122
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:32.140
<v Speaker 1>convinced that I was addicted to because I took off once when I was writing,</v>

1123
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I was writing right before I did my last special.</v>

1124
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I was for every day for 30 days I was writing a blog because I think there's</v>

1125
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 1>something about writing everyday.</v>

1126
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It really keeps your mind real sharp,</v>

1127
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1128
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.450
<v Speaker 1>it's great for performing.</v>

1129
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 1>It seems weird,</v>

1130
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:45.910
<v Speaker 1>but writing all the time,</v>

1131
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:46.744
<v Speaker 1>it's great for performance.</v>

1132
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 1>So I was drinking a lot of coffee man and then I tried to not have coffee once I</v>

1133
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:52.840
<v Speaker 1>was done and Iud did I get a headache?</v>

1134
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I got a 100 percent and I felt like shit.</v>

1135
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I felt like really like sluggish and I was like,</v>

1136
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.560
<v Speaker 1>oh great.</v>

1137
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to caffeine.</v>

1138
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 1>So I've done it a couple of times where I've gotten off of caffeine and every</v>

1139
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:07.330
<v Speaker 1>time I've done it I have this weird like for like a couple of days I have a</v>

1140
00:31:07.331 --> 00:31:07.571
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>

1141
00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink caffeine after a certain time unless I have to perform and I'm</v>

1142
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:12.700
<v Speaker 1>really sluggish,</v>

1143
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but like after 8:00 I try to cut it off because then I can't sleep at night and</v>

1144
00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm twitching and I'm waking up in the middle of it and like to get a good</v>

1145
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:22.000
<v Speaker 1>night's sleep.</v>

1146
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I like I,</v>

1147
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I stopped drinking coffee.</v>

1148
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to.</v>

1149
00:31:25.271 --> 00:31:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of different things that I do to get ready for shows,</v>

1150
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:31.270
<v Speaker 1>but the number one best one for sure is warm your body up.</v>

1151
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of stretching,</v>

1152
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.860
<v Speaker 1>stretching is big because when you stretch,</v>

1153
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.420
<v Speaker 1>like you really fucking stretch,</v>

1154
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you release tension and it just,</v>

1155
00:31:39.581 --> 00:31:39.811
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

1156
00:31:39.811 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you feel better,</v>

1157
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:41.510
<v Speaker 1>you feel easier,</v>

1158
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.360
<v Speaker 1>like tension builds up in you.</v>

1159
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So before a show,</v>

1160
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.290
<v Speaker 1>like I warm up and I stretch and I learned this new.</v>

1161
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I've learned this new breathing stuff from Steve Maxwell.</v>

1162
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:51.993
<v Speaker 1>He's into this,</v>

1163
00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:52.641
<v Speaker 1>he's this,</v>

1164
00:31:52.641 --> 00:31:52.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1165
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fitness trainer world would down really high level fitness trainer.</v>

1166
00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.470
<v Speaker 1>It's got degrees and he's also a black belt in Jujitsu and he's a,</v>

1167
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:01.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1168
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.870
<v Speaker 1>a world famous Kettlebell instructor and really cool guy.</v>

1169
00:32:04.871 --> 00:32:06.330
<v Speaker 1>But he's basically a,</v>

1170
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's lived his whole life with a passion for fitness,</v>

1171
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1172
00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:13.300
<v Speaker 1>so he's always constantly gathering information and one of the things he's been</v>

1173
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:13.991
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on,</v>

1174
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:15.280
<v Speaker 1>his breathing techniques,</v>

1175
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.480
<v Speaker 1>he's been concentrated on a Pranayama and all this yoga breathing.</v>

1176
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.000
<v Speaker 1>And so we did a bunch of these crazy,</v>

1177
00:32:21.001 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1178
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.450
<v Speaker 1>breathing exercises like,</v>

1179
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.313
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

1180
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought breathing was just bullshit.</v>

1181
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like breathe through your mouth.</v>

1182
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:27.643
<v Speaker 1>Breathe.</v>

1183
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just something where you're not being tough enough.</v>

1184
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:30.251
<v Speaker 1>Suck it up,</v>

1185
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Pussy Stop,</v>

1186
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.510
<v Speaker 1>stop boiling and about how your breathing.</v>

1187
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:32.861
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

1188
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's go do another lap.</v>

1189
00:32:33.831 --> 00:32:34.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1190
00:32:34.081 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 1>like that's what I always stopped breathing was.</v>

1191
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.080
<v Speaker 1>But what it is is a,</v>

1192
00:32:37.081 --> 00:32:39.370
<v Speaker 1>a much more rapid way of recovery.</v>

1193
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.500
<v Speaker 1>This pranayama</v>

1194
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.760
<v Speaker 4>breathing and that you can actually control your breath when you become like a,</v>

1195
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 4>like a yoga guy,</v>

1196
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:47.211
<v Speaker 4>like a Yogi,</v>

1197
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 4>like one of those high level guys,</v>

1198
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 4>they actually can control their breath,</v>

1199
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:51.171
<v Speaker 4>like in control,</v>

1200
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:52.620
<v Speaker 4>their heart rate and it,</v>

1201
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.820
<v Speaker 4>like they can calm themselves down when they're in periods of stress.</v>

1202
00:32:55.821 --> 00:32:57.320
<v Speaker 4>And so I started doing these,</v>

1203
00:32:57.321 --> 00:32:57.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1204
00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.041
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1205
00:32:58.041 --> 00:32:58.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1206
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.190
<v Speaker 4>breathing exercises and it's a fascinating shit.</v>

1207
00:33:01.191 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 4>So that along with stretching,</v>

1208
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 4>that's the best shot when I get older,</v>

1209
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:05.751
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1210
00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not working out,</v>

1211
00:33:06.711 --> 00:33:06.981
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1212
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:10.730
<v Speaker 4>my breathing goes to shit like when I'm trying to run and stuff like that.</v>

1213
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you get older man,</v>

1214
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 4>and you don't work out,</v>

1215
00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:17.210
<v Speaker 4>you're rigor mortis starts setting in and that's what you're fighting.</v>

1216
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 4>Even though you're still alive,</v>

1217
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 4>you're fighting rigor mortis,</v>

1218
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 4>setting in and breathing is a big part of that man.</v>

1219
00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:23.391

<v Speaker 4>better reserve of energy.</v>

1241
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 4>Don't know about that,</v>

1242
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:03.811

00:34:03.811 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 4>that's going.</v>

1244
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:04.993
<v Speaker 4>Even going back to your,</v>

1245
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.050

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:06.620
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

1248
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.140
<v Speaker 4>I tell young comedians like always be writing.</v>

1249
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a muscle,</v>

1250
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1251
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:12.120
<v Speaker 4>so and also makes you.</v>

1252
00:34:12.121 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 4>It reinforces the fact that you're a professional,</v>

1253
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 4>that you have worked to do,</v>

1254
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1255
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.490
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of comics who like to feel like they're just fuck off's and you</v>

1256
00:34:19.491 --> 00:34:19.630
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1257
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:23.300
<v Speaker 4>they just like to just go on stage and try to remember what their jokes are and</v>

1258
00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:24.440
<v Speaker 4>don't write anything down.</v>

1259
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:25.750
<v Speaker 4>You can do that.</v>

1260
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:26.170
<v Speaker 4>You chuckled.</v>

1261
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:26.691
<v Speaker 4>Junkies,</v>

1262
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:29.570
<v Speaker 4>they're very nervous about not getting the laugh.</v>

1263
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.160
<v Speaker 4>They're afraid of that.</v>

1264
00:34:31.161 --> 00:34:32.750
<v Speaker 4>They're afraid of that silence.</v>

1265
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.591
<v Speaker 4>Terrifying.</v>

1266
00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I just don't mind the silence and then sometimes what I like to do</v>

1267
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:38.091
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1268
00:34:38.091 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Speaker 4>if I run into a really shitty crowd,</v>

1269
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:45.430
<v Speaker 4>I like to go on my ipod and I get pocket Sitcom and I add my own laughter to the</v>

1270
00:34:46.221 --> 00:34:50.000
<v Speaker 4>crowd because sometimes I don't like the crowd and I'd rather have my own life's</v>

1271
00:34:50.001 --> 00:34:52.790
<v Speaker 4>going so I'll do this and to the crowd or something like that.</v>

1272
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:53.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll do.</v>

1273
00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I'll just go and just enjoy my own laughter.</v>

1274
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.493
<v Speaker 4>You did,</v>

1275
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1276
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.330
<v Speaker 4>this is an Internet meme and then have you ever seen those where it says you're</v>

1277
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:03.164
<v Speaker 4>doing it wrong?</v>

1278
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.023
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1279
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.080
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I do now.</v>

1280
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:07.740
<v Speaker 4>Well that's ridiculous,</v>

1281
00:35:07.741 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Sam.</v>

1282
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.271
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1283
00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:11.540
<v Speaker 4>I sometimes the crowds just staring at me and I just don't feel that I did.</v>

1284
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:13.520
<v Speaker 4>The way the deal is you to get your own crowds.</v>

1285
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 4>That's when the world changes.</v>

1286
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.320
<v Speaker 4>It's real hard to like when you show up at the store on a Tuesday night.</v>

1287
00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:19.610
<v Speaker 4>That's why everybody likes doing that.</v>

1288
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 4>Like people with the real reason why people like to stop in and places is</v>

1289
00:35:23.361 --> 00:35:27.080
<v Speaker 4>because until you become like really super famous where every crowd is your</v>

1290
00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:27.650
<v Speaker 4>crowd,</v>

1291
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Chris rock or something like that.</v>

1292
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.571
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1293
00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 4>when you just stop in,</v>

1294
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.470
<v Speaker 4>then you get sort of a slice of people that,</v>

1295
00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:33.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1296
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.070
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1297
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>

1298
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.800
<v Speaker 4>they're not as inclined to laugh at you.</v>

1299
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 4>They're not like super</v>

1300
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 3>psyched to have seen you.</v>

1301
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Like all my God,</v>

1302
00:35:40.711 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go see Damon Wayans.</v>

1303
00:35:42.031 --> 00:35:42.864
<v Speaker 3>We're so pumped up.</v>

1304
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Big Difference between that and then sitting in the audience.</v>

1305
00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:44.971
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1306
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Damon Wayans is here.</v>

1307
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1308
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.780
<v Speaker 3>so he's going to get a much more honest response from,</v>

1309
00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:49.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1310
00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that before to see comics who get out of there like,</v>

1311
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1312
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1313
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna say names,</v>

1314
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 3>but you see him there in the crowd.</v>

1315
00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:56.521
<v Speaker 3>They're crushing.</v>

1316
00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:57.311
<v Speaker 3>Take them out of their crowd.</v>

1317
00:35:57.311 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

1318
00:35:58.711 --> 00:35:59.790
<v Speaker 3>well I'm back in the gym.</v>

1319
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I got to work out,</v>

1320
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:01.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1321
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:02.461

<v Speaker 3>yeah man.</v>

1323
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:05.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean once you have a big crowd,</v>

1324
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 3>once you have your crowd,</v>

1325
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:09.150
<v Speaker 3>it's easier to work on new finds a crowd sometimes.</v>

1326
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:10.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think they're all at yourself short.</v>

1487
00:40:17.261 --> 00:40:18.094
<v Speaker 4>but you have to do.</v>

1488
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:23.430
<v Speaker 4>People require improvement in their life to be happy and it might be improvement</v>

1489
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:24.160
<v Speaker 4>of just you.</v>

1490

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to paint a landscape scene,</v>

1494
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.513
<v Speaker 4>I fucking did it.</v>

1495
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1496
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.390
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

1497
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.710
<v Speaker 4>whenever I do anything,</v>

1498
00:40:32.711 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a podcast or I write something,</v>

1499
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 4>that feeling that you get when you're done like I did it.</v>

1500
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 4>You need that to be happy.</v>

1502
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 4>percent and I'm to just going to drink and fucking suit outside.</v>

1503
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.780
<v Speaker 4>You were going to get bored,</v>

1504
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:47.021
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1505
00:40:47.021 --> 00:40:48.100
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna want to do something?</v>

1506
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.270
<v Speaker 4>The idea of the ultimate idea of ultimate vacation is a stupid idea.</v>

1507
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:52.811
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1508
00:40:52.811 --> 00:40:53.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1509
00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:54.130
<v Speaker 4>even when I go on vacation,</v>

1510
00:40:54.131 --> 00:40:56.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm good for like a day and then I want to do something.</v>

1511
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.340
<v Speaker 4>I want to do some shit.</v>

1512
00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.420
<v Speaker 4>So then it's vacation.</v>

1513
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.440
<v Speaker 4>What's go do fun shit.</v>

1514
00:40:59.441 --> 00:41:00.400
<v Speaker 4>While we're on vacation,</v>

1515
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.630
<v Speaker 4>but the idea of just sitting and just drinking in front of a fucking ocean for</v>

1516
00:41:04.631 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 4>three days like Jesus Christ,</v>

1517
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.540
<v Speaker 4>how long can you do that?</v>

1518
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.190
<v Speaker 4>What kind of attention span do you have?</v>

1519
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 4>But do you have a day of rest?</v>

1520
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.650
<v Speaker 4>One day?</v>

1521
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1522
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:12.890
<v Speaker 4>That's my son.</v>

1523
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 4>Sit down one day,</v>

1524
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:14.501
<v Speaker 4>Sunday.</v>

1525
00:41:14.501 --> 00:41:15.334
<v Speaker 4>I just don't.</v>

1526
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 4>I try not to do shit,</v>

1527
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.610
<v Speaker 4>but I sometimes I don't feel like I deserve it,</v>

1528
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.870
<v Speaker 4>but I don't feel like I deserve it.</v>

1529
00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 4>I won't give them feel guilty sometimes,</v>

1530
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.780
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like you have to have that moment of just relax.</v>

1531
00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:26.440
<v Speaker 4>You Do,</v>

1532
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:26.890
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>

1533
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:28.870
<v Speaker 4>But I think you have to earn it in my mind.</v>

1534
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.100
<v Speaker 4>For me to be happy,</v>

1535
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.420
<v Speaker 4>I have to earn it.</v>

1536
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 4>I have to make sure that I've not like slacking off about a bunch of shit that</v>

1537
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 4>piles up in your subconscious because that's the shit that fucks with you when</v>

1538
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:40.810
<v Speaker 4>you're on brownies and that's the shit that fucks with you.</v>

1539
00:41:40.811 --> 00:41:42.140
<v Speaker 4>And when you're in the isolation tank,</v>

1540
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 4>when I'm in the isolation tank,</v>

1541
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 4>everything that fucks with me as things that I'm not doing,</v>

1542
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 4>it's 100 percent things that I'm not doing or some mean stuff I said to someone</v>

1543
00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:51.200
<v Speaker 4>when I was 10 or something.</v>

1544
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes that'll come back and you'll get some weird memory of that.</v>

1545
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:56.490
<v Speaker 4>But for me like you know,</v>

1546
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.900
<v Speaker 4>where I am in my life and what I've done and all that stuff,</v>

1547
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I have one thing someone said to me is I asked them how they were doing.</v>

1548
00:42:03.981 --> 00:42:06.400
<v Speaker 4>They go a lot better than I think I am know.</v>

1549
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 4>Because sometimes people like Neal Brennan,</v>

1550
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 4>you're doing,</v>

1551
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.610
<v Speaker 4>you're actually probably doing better than you give yourself credit for.</v>

1552
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:14.421
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1553
00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:18.100
<v Speaker 4>sometimes people focus on what hasn't happened yet or you know,</v>

1554
00:42:18.101 --> 00:42:20.990
<v Speaker 4>then what has gone well in their life.</v>

1555
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of people sometimes compare their insides to other people's outsides.</v>

1556
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 4>And that's where you start getting really weirded out.</v>

1557
00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.470
<v Speaker 4>Like when you start looking at this guy and he's got what you've always wanted</v>

1558
00:42:33.471 --> 00:42:35.120
<v Speaker 4>or you think you've always wanted and you're like,</v>

1559
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 4>oh I don't get anything.</v>

1560
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 4>And you don't realize how much you've done with your life.</v>

1561
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:44.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm really just in the moment of there's tons of stuff I would love to do and</v>

1562
00:42:45.471 --> 00:42:46.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm working on doing.</v>

1563
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 4>But like at the end of the day,</v>

1564
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.800
<v Speaker 4>like from what I've wanted to,</v>

1565
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:50.810
<v Speaker 4>I've done a lot of it.</v>

1566
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.220
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot more to do,</v>

1567
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:53.320
<v Speaker 4>but I've done a lot of it.</v>

1568
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.390
<v Speaker 4>The most important thing to me when you have that feeling,</v>

1569
00:42:56.391 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 4>you compare yourself to other people.</v>

1570
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 4>This is not a bad thing to do,</v>

1571
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:05.290
<v Speaker 4>but what you gotta do is only be inspired and have that as an ethic.</v>

1572
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 4>Don't ever be jealous.</v>

1573
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Don't ever be Uber self critical or down yourself instead of.</v>

1574
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:12.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1575
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:13.693
<v Speaker 4>Instead of going,</v>

1576
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking lazy piece of Shit,</v>

1577
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:15.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1578
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:19.210
<v Speaker 4>look at this guy's doing his fucking second comedy central special and I don't</v>

1579
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.500
<v Speaker 4>even have a fucking hour and a half that I really like,</v>

1580
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1581
00:43:21.911 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 4>this is my socks and I can't keep a relationship.</v>

1582
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.270
<v Speaker 4>Instead of saying that instead of saying that,</v>

1583
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.710
<v Speaker 4>watch some guy that you really love or respect or in instead of,</v>

1584
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:31.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1585
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 4>instead of being put down by it,</v>

1586
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:37.210
<v Speaker 4>be elevated because $100 got it.</v>

1587
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.510
<v Speaker 4>You can choose to do that,</v>

1588
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1589
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.250
<v Speaker 4>People could choose to do that.</v>

1590
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:40.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1591
00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:41.091
<v Speaker 4>you might.</v>

1592
00:43:41.091 --> 00:43:41.901
<v Speaker 4>You might be right.</v>

1593
00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 4>You might be a lazy piece of Shit.</v>

1594
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 4>You might be right,</v>

1595
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:45.470
<v Speaker 4>but don't think about it.</v>

1596
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.560
<v Speaker 4>Don't concentrate on that because if you concentrate on the fact that you're a</v>

1597
00:43:48.561 --> 00:43:49.520
<v Speaker 4>lazy piece of Shit,</v>

1598
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 4>you will continue to manifest that reality.</v>

1599
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like hippie bullshit.</v>

1600
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.813
<v Speaker 4>Fucking true.</v>

1601
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.270
<v Speaker 4>Energy and intent.</v>

1602
00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 4>I have some thoughts,</v>

1603
00:43:57.501 --> 00:44:01.880
<v Speaker 4>man about about reality and I have some thoughts about the use of the mind and</v>

1604
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 4>the imagination of how it sculps reality.</v>

1605
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's as simple as they want to break it down and like the secret</v>

1606
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:10.490
<v Speaker 4>and the law of attraction and I put a picture of this house on the wall.</v>

1607
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1608
00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:13.100
<v Speaker 4>That's where years later I was moving into that house.</v>

1609
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's that,</v>

1610
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's kind of that.</v>

1611
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something to the idea that your thoughts and imagination have an</v>

1612
00:44:22.641 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 4>effect,</v>

1613
00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.013
<v Speaker 4>a reality.</v>

1614
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.750
<v Speaker 4>This isn't my reason why I say this because I think the imagination is something</v>

1615
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 4>that we're not taking it as seriously as we should be,</v>

1616
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 4>and what I mean by that is that I don't think.</v>

1617
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.220
<v Speaker 4>If you looked at like what?</v>

1618
00:44:38.221 --> 00:44:40.710
<v Speaker 4>What part does this play in life?</v>

1619
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.210
<v Speaker 4>What part does food play in life?</v>

1620
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:43.720
<v Speaker 4>What part does the.</v>

1621
00:44:43.721 --> 00:44:48.721
<v Speaker 4>The imagination has a huge impact on our reality because we take things out of</v>

1622
00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 4>the imagination and we build them like this fucking laptop.</v>

1623
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:59.540
<v Speaker 4>It's came from originally from someone's idea and it blossomed and evolved into</v>

1624
00:44:59.731 --> 00:45:00.660
<v Speaker 4>what you see in front of you,</v>

1625
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 4>but it came out of the imagination.</v>

1626
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.720
<v Speaker 4>It came out of the air.</v>

1627
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.930
<v Speaker 4>Someone figured out how to put something together because they had an idea.</v>

1628
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:07.831
<v Speaker 4>They had a spark.</v>

1629
00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 4>They saw the vision,</v>

1630
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:13.320
<v Speaker 4>they saw it feel fully formed in their mind or they saw steps along the way</v>

1631
00:45:13.321 --> 00:45:15.390
<v Speaker 4>fully formed and they figured out how to do that.</v>

1632
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I think your mind doesn't just control things in a sense that you bring things</v>

1633
00:45:20.221 --> 00:45:21.054
<v Speaker 4>out of the ether,</v>

1634
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.690
<v Speaker 4>you bring things out of your imagination and bring them and manifest them in the</v>

1635
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:25.524
<v Speaker 4>real world,</v>

1636
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.560
<v Speaker 4>but I think your mind actually has an effect on how things go in the real world.</v>

1637
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:32.463
<v Speaker 4>As I said before,</v>

1638
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.061
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

1639
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:35.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand quantum physics,</v>

1640
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it,</v>

1641
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.680
<v Speaker 4>but I do know that they've done tests where they show that particles react</v>

1642
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:45.060
<v Speaker 4>differently if you're observing them than if you're not observing them and I</v>

1643
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 4>think there's probably something,</v>

1644
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 4>some unmeasurable thing that's too fucking freaky and far out and really</v>

1645
00:45:51.871 --> 00:45:52.800
<v Speaker 4>difficult to prove,</v>

1646
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.870
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that there's your mind</v>

1647
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 4>might have some sort of an impact on reality.</v>

1648
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.631
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1649
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:03.650
<v Speaker 4>babies are still going to get killed by drive bys and people are still going to</v>

1650
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.920
<v Speaker 4>get caught in avalanches just randomly.</v>

1651
00:46:05.921 --> 00:46:06.111
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

1652
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

1653
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Not to say that shit can't happen.</v>

1654
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.940
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't most certainly can happen and most certainly there are natural</v>

1655
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:15.030
<v Speaker 4>occurrences that are going to be absolutely beyond anyone's control.</v>

1656
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.361
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1657
00:46:15.361 --> 00:46:17.280
<v Speaker 4>there's levels of experiences like you know,</v>

1658
00:46:17.281 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 4>you get to a meteor impact,</v>

1659
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:19.554
<v Speaker 4>that's a wrap.</v>

1660
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Maybe 65 million years ago,</v>

1661
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:24.930
<v Speaker 4>a big one slammed in and there's nothing bigger than a fucking hamster lived.</v>

1662
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:25.640
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1663
00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.340
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

1664
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.190
<v Speaker 4>And that could happen again and no,</v>

1665
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.200
<v Speaker 4>no matter how much imagination you have and how much you,</v>

1666
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.540
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1667
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:30.751
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1668
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:31.021
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1669
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 4>you dream of a perfect world.</v>

1670
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you can prevent that.</v>

1671
00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:36.900
<v Speaker 4>I think that there might be quantum things,</v>

1672
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:39.900
<v Speaker 4>there might be macro things that might be a whole bunch of things working</v>

1673
00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

1674
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:45.470
<v Speaker 4>but I don't discount the idea that you can use your own mind and you're in your</v>

1675
00:46:45.481 --> 00:46:48.900
<v Speaker 4>own imagination to manipulate reality to a certain degree.</v>

1676
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:49.411
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1677
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:50.101
<v Speaker 4>100 percent,</v>

1678
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:54.440
<v Speaker 4>I've always felt felt the energy you give out sometimes most of the time here,</v>

1679
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.650
<v Speaker 4>Angie,</v>

1680
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:55.200
<v Speaker 4>you get back.</v>

1681
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 4>How about dudes who just force shit with their mind?</v>

1682
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1683
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 4>this is going to sound crazy,</v>

1684
00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 4>but when Dane Cook became really famous,</v>

1685
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the first things that I thought of and I was like,</v>

1686
00:47:04.081 --> 00:47:04.351
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1687
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:08.940
<v Speaker 4>this guy wanted it so much that he figured out a way to make it like Dane Cook,</v>

1688
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.790
<v Speaker 4>we all have talked about it in the comedy world.</v>

1689
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.220
<v Speaker 4>That was a real shocker for a lot of us were like,</v>

1690
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:14.611
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1691
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 4>how did he do that?</v>

1692
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:16.410
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

1693
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.610
<v Speaker 4>How do you get that big,</v>

1694
00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.710
<v Speaker 4>that big,</v>

1695
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:19.381
<v Speaker 4>that big.</v>

1696
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1697
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.573
<v Speaker 4>but the whole thing,</v>

1698
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.440
<v Speaker 4>you can always point.</v>

1699
00:47:22.441 --> 00:47:25.080
<v Speaker 4>You could always tell someone's going to work and I always felt,</v>

1700
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1701
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:26.370
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1702
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:27.960
<v Speaker 4>he's a different person right now.</v>

1703
00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:29.590
<v Speaker 4>I feel that that when I him,</v>

1704
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.290
<v Speaker 3>which was many years ago,</v>

1705
00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 3>was way different now because it's successful and he sort of relaxed and he's</v>

1706
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 3>realized that things in his life have happened that made him reassess where he</v>

1707
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:40.910
<v Speaker 3>wants to be and what he has brought us.</v>

1708
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:41.710
<v Speaker 3>We want them all.</v>

1709
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:41.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1710
00:47:41.841 --> 00:47:42.021
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1711
00:47:42.021 --> 00:47:42.854
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1712
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1713
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 3>But he was a win at all cost guy.</v>

1714
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:46.331
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1715
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:46.990
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1716
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 3>And with that comes a certain price and you know,</v>

1717
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:52.420
<v Speaker 3>I've always said that and not that he's a bad person,</v>

1718
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:55.480
<v Speaker 3>but I've always said sometimes bad things happen to good people,</v>

1719
00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 3>but I always felt bad things always happen to bad people and it may not be</v>

1720
00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 3>instantaneous and it may not have the board bad.</v>

1721
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Maybe isn't the right way to describe somebody.</v>

1722
00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:08.290
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like if you're always putting out energy and you're,</v>

1723
00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:08.900
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1724
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.020
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking over your fellow man to,</v>

1725
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.570
<v Speaker 3>to win almost.</v>

1726
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.510
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come back.</v>

1727
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 3>And it might not be instantaneous.</v>

1728
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Meaning if I fuck you right now that you know I'm going to walk out and get hit</v>

1729
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 3>by a car,</v>

1730
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:19.580
<v Speaker 3>you never know.</v>

1731
00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:19.731
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1732
00:48:19.731 --> 00:48:20.540
<v Speaker 4>this is what I think.</v>

1733
00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.630
<v Speaker 4>I think that the only time that doesn't work as associate paths,</v>

1734
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.920
<v Speaker 4>because sociopaths don't seem to have any feelings about things like that.</v>

1735
00:48:27.921 --> 00:48:29.510
<v Speaker 4>They don't worry about hurting people's feelings.</v>

1736
00:48:29.511 --> 00:48:29.710
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

1737
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:30.830
<v Speaker 4>they don't feel connected.</v>

1738
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:33.440
<v Speaker 4>But the real problem with regular people like you and I,</v>

1739
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.260
<v Speaker 4>is that you feel connected with someone when you hurt their feelings.</v>

1740
00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.070
<v Speaker 4>Like I've had people that are hecklers there that are just idiots and they're</v>

1741
00:48:40.071 --> 00:48:41.270
<v Speaker 4>ruining a show.</v>

1742
00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.210
<v Speaker 4>There's a thousand people in there and one person wants to,</v>

1743
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:49.250
<v Speaker 4>wants to fucking throw in their own stupid brain and and slosh up the whole</v>

1744
00:48:49.251 --> 00:48:49.491
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

1745
00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:50.990
<v Speaker 4>So I'll destroy this person,</v>

1746
00:48:50.991 --> 00:48:51.591
<v Speaker 4>I'll torture them.</v>

1747
00:48:51.591 --> 00:48:52.490
<v Speaker 4>I break down their life,</v>

1748
00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:53.390
<v Speaker 4>but I feel bad.</v>

1749
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:54.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel good about it.</v>

1750
00:48:54.321 --> 00:48:55.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do that.</v>

1751
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:56.840
<v Speaker 4>I want everybody to have a good time.</v>

1752
00:48:56.841 --> 00:48:57.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hurt this guy's feelings.</v>

1753
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:59.120
<v Speaker 4>And as the guys leaving,</v>

1754
00:48:59.121 --> 00:48:59.721
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

1755
00:48:59.721 --> 00:49:00.800
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking zero.</v>

1756
00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:01.461
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1757
00:49:01.461 --> 00:49:01.831
<v Speaker 4>come on man,</v>

1758
00:49:01.831 --> 00:49:02.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm at least on one or a two.</v>

1759
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:03.763
<v Speaker 4>This is ridiculous.</v>

1760
00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.210
<v Speaker 4>And everyone's laughing and I'm like,</v>

1761
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.920
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you 100 percent.</v>

1762
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:08.990
<v Speaker 4>He crazy asshole.</v>

1763
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.320
<v Speaker 4>100,000 people here and you're trying to ruin their night and people are</v>

1764
00:49:12.321 --> 00:49:13.011
<v Speaker 4>screaming and cheering.</v>

1765
00:49:13.011 --> 00:49:13.844
<v Speaker 4>This guy's leaving.</v>

1766
00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:14.720
<v Speaker 4>And as the guys leaving,</v>

1767
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:15.733
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad.</v>

1768
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 4>I do like,</v>

1769
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:18.530
<v Speaker 4>does he want his night's ruined?</v>

1770
00:49:18.531 --> 00:49:18.921
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1771
00:49:18.921 --> 00:49:19.541
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hurt him,</v>

1772
00:49:19.541 --> 00:49:20.450
<v Speaker 4>but you really just want to</v>

1773
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 3>perform and entertain people that paid money to see exactly.</v>

1774
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.</v>

1775
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.420
<v Speaker 4>I think people that that hurt people's feelings,</v>

1776
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.520
<v Speaker 4>even if you justify it,</v>

1777
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.940
<v Speaker 4>you know you did something and I think the thing that fucks with your head and</v>

1778
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:36.490
<v Speaker 4>it devalues you in your own eyes.</v>

1779
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:37.990
<v Speaker 4>You're not a hero in your own eyes.</v>

1780
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:38.381
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>

1781
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:39.700
<v Speaker 4>you're not someone who you respect,</v>

1782
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:41.950
<v Speaker 4>you know you're doing what you gotta do to get by,</v>

1783
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:44.380
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately you're not respecting yourself.</v>

1784
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:48.130
<v Speaker 4>And I think we all have a certain amount of appreciation and respect for hero</v>

1785
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:48.581
<v Speaker 4>figures.</v>

1786
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:48.831
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1787
00:49:48.831 --> 00:49:52.330
<v Speaker 4>like we all look at like the guy who never lies and it always does the right</v>

1788
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:54.430
<v Speaker 4>thing and fucking helps everybody out.</v>

1789
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 4>And that's the John Wayne character.</v>

1790
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:56.261
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1791
00:49:56.261 --> 00:49:56.521
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1792
00:49:56.521 --> 00:49:57.020
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

1793
00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate hero.</v>

1794
00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 4>And when you look at your own life and you don't stack up,</v>

1795
00:50:01.301 --> 00:50:02.051
<v Speaker 4>you're a thief.</v>

1796
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:06.400
<v Speaker 4>You stole money from your wife's purse and you know you don't want to smoke</v>

1797
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:06.821
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes,</v>

1798
00:50:06.821 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 4>but you fucking have to.</v>

1799
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.460
<v Speaker 4>You can't deal with the stress.</v>

1800
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:10.210
<v Speaker 4>You smoke,</v>

1801
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.380
<v Speaker 4>you devalue yourself.</v>

1802
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.180
<v Speaker 4>You slowly start devaluing yourself.</v>

1803
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:13.680
<v Speaker 4>You will.</v>

1804
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.501
<v Speaker 4>You look at yourself,</v>

1805
00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:16.660
<v Speaker 4>you realize that if you were judging yourself,</v>

1806
00:50:16.661 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 4>you would judge yourself unfavorably.</v>

1807
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 4>If you're stealing,</v>

1808
00:50:19.121 --> 00:50:20.170
<v Speaker 4>if you're hurting people,</v>

1809
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.241
<v Speaker 4>so no matter who,</v>

1810
00:50:22.241 --> 00:50:24.980
<v Speaker 4>you can't pretend you're the the,</v>

1811
00:50:24.981 --> 00:50:25.340
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1812
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 4>the hero of your story.</v>

1813
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.891
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>

1814
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 4>You have to be the hero of your own story and you can do that.</v>

1815
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:34.340
<v Speaker 4>You can be the hero of your own story that woke up today.</v>

1816
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 4>You can be the hero of your own story that at 40 years of age stopped,</v>

1817
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 4>got out of bed and said,</v>

1818
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing this anymore.</v>

1819
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing this different Andrea.</v>

1820
00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:49.170
<v Speaker 4>I am going to figure this out and I want to do it only by my instincts and only</v>

1821
00:50:49.581 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 4>by my morals and my ideals and my mind and I'm going to be dead honest with</v>

1822
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 4>myself because I'm realizing this is not going to last forever and I'm going to</v>

1823
00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 4>be the nicest fucking human being to everyone.</v>

1824
00:50:58.850 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 4>I meet possibly,</v>

1825
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.190
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to get myself in shape,</v>

1826
00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:03.230
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to eat healthy and I'm going to do this because this is.</v>

1827
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.071
<v Speaker 4>This is me.</v>

1828
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:04.550
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1829
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:09.550
<v Speaker 4>I decided that this is me and people have to realize that you are not your past.</v>

1830
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 4>You are not all the times you fucked up,</v>

1831
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:13.900
<v Speaker 4>you are not all the times.</v>

1832
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't get it up,</v>

1833
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:17.330
<v Speaker 4>you're not all the times you were drunk and you know,</v>

1834
00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:19.310
<v Speaker 4>and you threw up in someone's car,</v>

1835
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 4>you that's not you,</v>

1836
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:20.861
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

1837
00:51:20.861 --> 00:51:25.520
<v Speaker 4>you are the person who's learned from a great deal of experiences that if you</v>

1838
00:51:25.521 --> 00:51:28.490
<v Speaker 4>learn correctly and if you process them correctly,</v>

1839
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 4>you'll have a happier life.</v>

1840
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1841
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:31.671
<v Speaker 4>in recovery.</v>

1842
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:32.930
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part of it.</v>

1843
00:51:32.931 --> 00:51:33.370
<v Speaker 4>When they,</v>

1844
00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:34.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1845
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to list all the stuff you've done and apologized to them and</v>

1846
00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:37.650
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1847
00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:39.860
<v Speaker 4>What it is is you just get it out and you're like,</v>

1848
00:51:39.861 --> 00:51:40.694
<v Speaker 4>I did this.</v>

1849
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1850
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Now it's gone.</v>

1851
00:51:42.441 --> 00:51:43.280
<v Speaker 4>You have done.</v>

1852
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 4>And usually the person you admit to,</v>

1853
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:45.621
<v Speaker 4>they'll be like,</v>

1854
00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:47.540
<v Speaker 4>I did all that and a little more.</v>

1855
00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Look where I am,</v>

1856
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:50.120
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't define you.</v>

1857
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.021
<v Speaker 4>And that's the truth.</v>

1858
00:51:51.021 --> 00:51:52.430
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes people hold onto that.</v>

1859
00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

1860
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:56.030
<v Speaker 4>psychological stuff like athletes and entertainers.</v>

1861
00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:00.140
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they'll do something and something bad will happen and it almost like</v>

1862
00:52:00.141 --> 00:52:00.771
<v Speaker 4>wounds them.</v>

1863
00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:01.604
<v Speaker 4>It's like high school,</v>

1864
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:02.241
<v Speaker 4>so in shit,</v>

1865
00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 4>Anya,</v>

1866
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:06.320
<v Speaker 4>it sticks with us instead of understanding that that was a moment in time and</v>

1867
00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:08.720
<v Speaker 4>that person was probably hurt themselves.</v>

1868
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.700
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't define you as a person.</v>

1869
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:11.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1870
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:11.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1871
00:52:11.481 --> 00:52:12.110
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1872
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.050
<v Speaker 4>we all do things that were not happy that we did.</v>

1873
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:16.740
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't mean that's you now,</v>

1874
00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1875
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:17.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1876
00:52:17.831 --> 00:52:18.380
<v Speaker 4>do you know going to.</v>

1877
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.360
<v Speaker 4>You got to learn that and the,</v>

1878
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:23.540
<v Speaker 4>the thing about apologizing to someone once you get it out there,</v>

1879
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.160
<v Speaker 4>once you've relieved this tension,</v>

1880
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:28.160
<v Speaker 4>then it's no longer this burden that you're carrying around because otherwise</v>

1881
00:52:28.161 --> 00:52:29.120
<v Speaker 4>you have like burdens.</v>

1882
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 4>Like I seriously,</v>

1883
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:35.060
<v Speaker 4>I was all think about some shit that happened from fucking 20 or 30 years ago</v>

1884
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 4>and I'll be like,</v>

1885
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:36.601
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1886
00:52:36.601 --> 00:52:37.700
<v Speaker 4>I should have been nicer to her.</v>

1887
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Or Oh,</v>

1888
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.590
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't have talked to him that way and it will,</v>

1889
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 4>it will fuck with me.</v>

1890
00:52:41.481 --> 00:52:43.310
<v Speaker 4>Like 20 or 30 years later,</v>

1891
00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:44.900
<v Speaker 4>there's this girl named Aaron mcnally.</v>

1892
00:52:44.901 --> 00:52:48.920
<v Speaker 4>I went to school there and I went to my last reunion just hoping that she would</v>

1893
00:52:48.921 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 4>show up because during elementary school we treated her so badly and I hated it</v>

1894
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:54.321
<v Speaker 4>and it wasn't part of it,</v>

1895
00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:54.800
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1896
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I saw it happening,</v>

1897
00:52:55.851 --> 00:52:57.950
<v Speaker 4>but I wasn't strong enough to cause I was a kid.</v>

1898
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:00.260
<v Speaker 4>I've always wanted to like,</v>

1899
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:00.830
<v Speaker 4>just be like,</v>

1900
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:02.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry that that had happened,</v>

1901
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:02.810
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1902
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1903
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Well when I was a kid,</v>

1904
00:53:04.191 --> 00:53:04.610
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1905
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:08.180
<v Speaker 4>especially as I got older and it was more and more angry,</v>

1906
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.080
<v Speaker 4>I became,</v>

1907
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:09.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1908
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.000
<v Speaker 4>the first person to pull the trigger.</v>

1909
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:14.090
<v Speaker 4>I was like the first person to insult someone because I figured,</v>

1910
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:14.241
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1911
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 4>you're going to insult me so I'll get you first.</v>

1912
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1913
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.841
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1914
00:53:17.841 --> 00:53:18.071
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1915
00:53:18.071 --> 00:53:18.450
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1916
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:21.950
<v Speaker 4>you develop this sort of a protective personality like that.</v>

1917
00:53:21.951 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Especially if like you're a little guy and people want to fuck with you.</v>

1918
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 4>And that was me.</v>

1919
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:26.370
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1920
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 3>when you do that,</v>

1921
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:27.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1922
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 3>you all of a sudden that'll be a way you behave now.</v>

1923
00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 3>And then you'll say things like,</v>

1924
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't even say that that's,</v>

1925
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 3>that's such a Douchey fucking thing to say,</v>

1926
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.570
<v Speaker 3>but it's just a purely.</v>

1927
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.700
<v Speaker 3>It's based purely on insecurity.</v>

1928
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 3>We used to,</v>

1929
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:43.420
<v Speaker 3>I used to call it the triple a low blow where we would be like having,</v>

1930
00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.101
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing over there,</v>

1931
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:44.341
<v Speaker 3>buddy?</v>

1932
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:45.660
<v Speaker 3>You want to participate in the conversation?</v>

1933
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 3>And there's no way I could do that</v>

1934
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:52.320
<v Speaker 3>anticipating this conversation because it was so long winded.</v>

1935
00:53:52.321 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what you guys were talking about near the end.</v>

1936
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.870
<v Speaker 3>I know we're talking about to break it down for her and it's like a two year old</v>

1937
00:53:57.871 --> 00:53:58.370
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>

1938
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1939
00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean I got the,</v>

1940
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 3>the main point near the beginning and then it was kind of like I just stopped</v>

1941
00:54:02.821 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>

1942
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1943
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1944
00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 3>I have a real problem like in school with anything when it,</v>

1945
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:10.020
<v Speaker 3>when something gets really deep into a conversation and less,</v>

1946
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:12.720
<v Speaker 3>it's about something that I'm totally interested in,</v>

1947
00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:14.550
<v Speaker 3>like to solve some kind of mystery.</v>

1948
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.181
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1949

<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1950
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:15.911
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1951
00:54:15.911 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I just lose interest in it.</v>

1952
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.230
<v Speaker 3>How about we talk about are you going to stink,</v>

2044
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.150
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest,</v>

2045
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 1>the two biggest wow.</v>

2046
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 1>You would know because folks,</v>

2047
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:52.060
<v Speaker 1>this is not coming out of a manager.</v>

2048
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:53.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the person that's coming to the studio.</v>

2049
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:54.603
<v Speaker 1>That's a tranny.</v>

2050
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:55.713
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That looks like a dude.</v>

2052
00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:57.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2053
00:56:57.701 --> 00:56:58.534
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

2054
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.690
<v Speaker 1>when they go to fuck when they go too far with the makeup here,</v>

2055
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:02.050
<v Speaker 1>trannies,</v>

2056
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:03.070
<v Speaker 1>let me give you a little piece of advice.</v>

2057
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:08.410
<v Speaker 1>You're better off looking sort of like a man with less makeup than look like a</v>

2058
00:57:08.411 --> 00:57:11.050
<v Speaker 1>tranny with a lot of makeup because when you have a lot of makeup on,</v>

2059
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:12.460
<v Speaker 1>it always looks like you're trying to.</v>

2060
00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 1>What am I trying to trick me?</v>

2061
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.820
<v Speaker 1>They try to go look like lumberjacks.</v>

2062
00:57:15.821 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 1>What guys are really at all around with the lesbian.</v>

2063
00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Butch was the ones that don't want to work.</v>

2064
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:22.330
<v Speaker 1>They look like hot chicks,</v>

2065
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2066
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:23.321
<v Speaker 1>Lipstick,</v>

2067
00:57:23.321 --> 00:57:23.950
<v Speaker 1>lesbians,</v>

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:24.820

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Well those are the ones that don't want to work.</v>

2070
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2071
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.190
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

2072
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.130
<v Speaker 1>They want a woman to come along and take care of him the way a man would.</v>

2073
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:33.790
<v Speaker 1>They want a woman to be like their bodyguard and they're usually passing through</v>

2074
00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.260
<v Speaker 1>just Chaz Bono them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>100 grand that look like Larry the cable guy.</v>

2077
00:57:37.991 --> 00:57:39.730
<v Speaker 1>That's so fucked up.</v>

2078
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it costs?</v>

2079
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:41.613
<v Speaker 1>100 grand.</v>

2080

<v Speaker 1>You know what's weird about Chaz Bono?</v>

2081
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2082
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:43.901
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2083
00:57:43.901 --> 00:57:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2084
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I would never criticize someone who's doing that because I don't know what the</v>

2085
00:57:47.441 --> 00:57:47.621
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>

2087
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the inside of his body.</v>

2088
00:57:52.541 --> 00:57:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2089
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have no problems with it.</v>

2090
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:55.781
<v Speaker 1>Be Yourself,</v>

2091

<v Speaker 1>but don't tell me.</v>

2092
00:57:56.351 --> 00:57:57.184
<v Speaker 1>It's a little weird.</v>

2093
00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2094
00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.001
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2095
00:57:58.001 --> 00:57:58.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2096
00:57:58.211 --> 00:58:00.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like if your cat starts barking like a dog,</v>

2097
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:01.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a little weird.</v>

2098
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's wrong and I totally support his right to do it,</v>

2099
00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:07.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's not normal.</v>

2100
00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Normal.</v>

2101
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's saying it's not.</v>

2102
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:09.641
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2103
00:58:09.641 --> 00:58:09.881
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2104
00:58:09.881 --> 00:58:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what exactly do you call it here?</v>

2105
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:12.540
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2106
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I call me.</v>

2107
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 1>He at now I call my he.</v>

2108
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2109
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:16.780
<v Speaker 1>That's why he is now.</v>

2110
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Respectfully.</v>

2111
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2112
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2113
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I have to see his dick called me.</v>

2114
00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2115
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.070
<v Speaker 1>that's my idea.</v>

2116
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:22.091
<v Speaker 1>Say Hey,</v>

2117
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:22.930
<v Speaker 1>what's up Chaz?</v>

2118
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say he or she may.</v>

2119
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 1>We'll just call him a chest.</v>

2120
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:29.410
<v Speaker 1>The navajos thought that there was four basics,</v>

2121
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.530
<v Speaker 1>a basic sexist,</v>

2122
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:33.640
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't for preferences.</v>

2123
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:34.740
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't male females,</v>

2124
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:35.051
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>

2125
00:58:35.051 --> 00:58:35.531
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>

2126
00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 1>masculine woman,</v>

2127
00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Feminine Male,</v>

2128
00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:39.100
<v Speaker 1>and then they thought that makes sense.</v>

2129
00:58:39.101 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Just a natural thing.</v>

2130
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 1>And then there was always people that wish they were born a girl and it was.</v>

2131
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And I believe it,</v>

2132
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2133
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2134
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:46.570
<v Speaker 1>100 percent believable.</v>

2135
00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 1>There's just too many people.</v>

2136
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:48.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2137
00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I know it could be just nutty people,</v>

2138
00:58:49.851 --> 00:58:51.660
<v Speaker 1>it could be some weird imbalance.</v>

2139
00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:55.600
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing that has proven that experiences will literally shape the mapping</v>

2140
00:58:55.601 --> 00:59:00.010
<v Speaker 1>of your fucking mind and the way your mind makes correlations and the way you</v>

2141
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:01.990
<v Speaker 1>know and even shape your jeans.</v>

2142
00:59:01.991 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>You know that it's genes are activated because of certain stresses and different</v>

2143
00:59:06.041 --> 00:59:08.450
<v Speaker 1>things that happened to you like literally in the womb.</v>

2144
00:59:08.451 --> 00:59:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2145
00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:09.461
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2146
00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:13.520
<v Speaker 1>That's why so many people that come from really super volatile environments are</v>

2147
00:59:13.521 --> 00:59:17.140
<v Speaker 1>really quick to jump and be violent and the reason being is that they're fucking</v>

2148
00:59:17.141 --> 00:59:18.400
<v Speaker 1>program to say,</v>

2149
00:59:18.401 --> 00:59:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2150
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.710
<v Speaker 1>we're going to shoot you out in the middle of a fucking war zone.</v>

2151
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2152
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.173
<v Speaker 3>When you come out,</v>

2153
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.400
<v Speaker 3>it's craziness right out the get go.</v>

2154
00:59:25.401 --> 00:59:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Your mom almost got shot today coming home from work and you experienced all</v>

2155
00:59:28.701 --> 00:59:32.070
<v Speaker 3>this inside the womb that your body's like getting ready for war.</v>

2156
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.260
<v Speaker 3>It's triggering set as triggering everything in variances and you draw from</v>

2157
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:38.580
<v Speaker 3>those experiences on how to react to it.</v>

2158
00:59:38.581 --> 00:59:40.130
<v Speaker 3>Search in certain situations,</v>

2159
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 3>but the back to the training stuff is like,</v>

2160
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.830
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's like gay training wheels that.</v>

2161
00:59:45.831 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2162
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:47.350
<v Speaker 3>it's not that.</v>

2163
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2164
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 3>but why it's so popular on the Internet.</v>

2165
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.141
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2166
00:59:51.141 --> 00:59:51.711

2168
00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2169
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Why is it so popular?</v>

2170
00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Videos?</v>

2171
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a broad spectrum.</v>

2172
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.871
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

2173
00:59:58.871 --> 00:59:59.300
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2174
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2175
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a broad spectrum of,</v>

2176
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>

2177
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:06.200
<v Speaker 3>sexual likes and dislikes and some guys literally get off and they're not even</v>

01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:17.680
<v Speaker 3>I ran it by Cheetah and they were cheetahs and they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what it is</v>

2270
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.221
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's good la club or there's good strip clubs though.</v>

2384
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>You enjoy going to good strip clubs in la or just completely broken because of</v>

01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:35.971
<v Speaker 1>the actress thing.</v>

2388
01:04:41.891 --> 01:04:43.260
<v Speaker 1>less and less and less.</v>

2389
01:04:43.261 --> 01:04:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed then when I was younger and it's just because I do the math,</v>

01:04:49.351 --> 01:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>the cause and effect,</v>

2393
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

2394
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>what is the initial starting point for this per the current behavior.</v>

2395
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.840

<v Speaker 3>it's more of an American Indian look know sort of.</v>

2583
01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:27.690
<v Speaker 3>When I went to mek combination,</v>

2584
01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.440
<v Speaker 3>I went to Mexico City to see metallica and uh,</v>

2585
01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:35.840
<v Speaker 3>we flew in and my friends were already there and we didn't know what to do.</v>

2586
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:36.700

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:38.930
<v Speaker 3>We were going to go.</v>

2589
01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:39.860
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

2590
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:40.461
<v Speaker 3>we need a ride.</v>

2591
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:42.440
<v Speaker 3>So we find a taxi and it gets shady.</v>

01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Dude detects drivers like follow me man.</v>

2593
01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 3>We walked through the airport and as we get through the airport we keep walking</v>

2594
01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:50.840
<v Speaker 3>and gets more and more third world,</v>

2595
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:51.920
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not lying to you.</v>

2596
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Eventually were walking out the airport through this back alley where there's</v>

2597
01:09:55.371 --> 01:09:57.890
<v Speaker 3>these chickens all running around and I'm like,</v>

2598
01:09:57.891 --> 01:10:00.020
<v Speaker 3>this is not going right man.</v>

2599
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:01.310
<v Speaker 3>And we got into the car.</v>

2600
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I made a video of it and he drove around and like that's the worst thing you can</v>

2601
01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:09.611
<v Speaker 3>do in Mexico City is getting a taxi because they will kidnap you.</v>

2602
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.090
<v Speaker 3>They'll drive you somewhere,</v>

2603
01:10:11.091 --> 01:10:14.480
<v Speaker 3>they'll take you in the hold you for a couple of days until they drain your atm</v>

2604
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.730
<v Speaker 3>and if you're lucky they'll let you come back.</v>

2605
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.631
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know.</v>

2606
01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:18.441
<v Speaker 3>This guy liked us,</v>

2607
01:10:18.441 --> 01:10:21.650
<v Speaker 3>we started talking about hookers and all that stuff because there's something</v>

2608
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:24.560
<v Speaker 3>about me whenever I land to do stand up or do somewhere,</v>

2609
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.351
<v Speaker 3>I always asked,</v>

2610
01:10:25.351 --> 01:10:26.300
<v Speaker 3>so what's going on in this town?</v>

2611
01:10:26.301 --> 01:10:28.370
<v Speaker 3>And they always tell me where the hookers are.</v>

2612
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:29.450
<v Speaker 3>The immediately,</v>

2613
01:10:29.451 --> 01:10:30.950
<v Speaker 3>the first thing they always tell me is like,</v>

2614
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.251
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2615
01:10:31.251 --> 01:10:32.540
<v Speaker 3>you can get some girls over here.</v>

2616
01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

2617
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:34.760
<v Speaker 3>You seem like a party guy.</v>

2618
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>

2619
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.250
<v Speaker 3>but do I look like I need hookers?</v>

2620
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:37.791
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2621
01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2622
01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:38.890
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2623
01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

01:10:41.031 --> 01:10:42.080
<v Speaker 3>That's a cool color.</v>

2627
01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:45.290
<v Speaker 3>You'd like him like you could tell like I don't want to.</v>

2628
01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.480
<v Speaker 3>I just want to talk to them and get to know them.</v>

2629
01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.220
<v Speaker 3>And the hooker whisper.</v>

2630
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:49.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2631
01:10:49.821 --> 01:10:51.830
<v Speaker 3>Mexico is a very tricky place.</v>

2632
01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:53.570
<v Speaker 3>Last time I was there I was in Cancun.</v>

2633
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 3>It was a few years back and I remember landing and walking through the airport</v>

2634
01:10:57.321 --> 01:11:01.340
<v Speaker 3>and just all these people like coming at you to try to give you a ride.</v>

2635
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:02.061

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:07.580
<v Speaker 3>you can't move through them.</v>

2642
01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm walking,</v>

2643
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.840
<v Speaker 3>pulling my bags and like one after the other unit.</v>

2644
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:11.121
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2647
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2648
01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2649
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:13.850

2650
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 1>holding up their fucking sign and it's like,</v>

2651
01:11:16.411 --> 01:11:16.681
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2652
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:17.730
<v Speaker 1>this is weird.</v>

2653
01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm uncomfortable here.</v>

2654
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:19.741
<v Speaker 1>You realize like,</v>

2655
01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:19.951
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:20.370
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

2657
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:21.600
<v Speaker 1>They're playing by different rules.</v>

2658
01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a third world country son.</v>

2659
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:24.950
<v Speaker 1>You can call it canned coon.</v>

2660
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.650
<v Speaker 1>All you want.</v>

2661
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:28.680
<v Speaker 1>You just landed in a place where laws don't apply.</v>

2662
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Everything's different mean.</v>

2663
01:11:29.711 --> 01:11:30.541
<v Speaker 1>Some laws apply,</v>

2664
01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same.</v>

2665
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:31.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2666
01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>everything's run by fucking violent drug gangs.</v>

2667
01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>You know there's,</v>

2668
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have a short.</v>

2669
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 1>They have a military presence.</v>

2670
01:11:37.801 --> 01:11:38.634
<v Speaker 1>Sure they have police,</v>

2671
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>but the fucking drug gangs in Mexico are.</v>

2672
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.030
<v Speaker 1>They run every,</v>

2673
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.571
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

2674
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:44.220
<v Speaker 1>every spec in there near the border.</v>

2675
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.930
<v Speaker 1>You go to the</v>

2676
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:46.060
<v Speaker 3>even have our weapons.</v>

2677
01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:49.540
<v Speaker 3>They ended up busting them with our military weapons.</v>

2678
01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Is that when you realize how fucking nutty these government agents are,</v>

2679
01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.280
<v Speaker 1>did you hear about that?</v>

2680
01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:56.061
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>

2681
01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Operation fast and furious.</v>

2682
01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:58.490
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2683
01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.640
<v Speaker 1>do you think we give it to them or they just end up.</v>

2684
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Because we'd like to destabilize regions.</v>

2685
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2686
01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:07.910
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

2687
01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:09.200
<v Speaker 1>We played both sides.</v>

2688
01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:09.561
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2689
01:12:09.561 --> 01:12:10.190
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2690
01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.770
<v Speaker 1>because guns turned up in El Paso to the guns.</v>

2691
01:12:12.771 --> 01:12:15.740
<v Speaker 1>They turned up in crimes that were used in El Paso,</v>

2692
01:12:15.741 --> 01:12:19.820
<v Speaker 1>so the guns that the atf sold to the Mexican drug traffickers,</v>

2693
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:22.190
<v Speaker 1>those fucking guns showed up in our country,</v>

2694
01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.060
<v Speaker 1>so those,</v>

2695
01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.570
<v Speaker 1>those guns could have easily been used to kill Americans.</v>

2696
01:12:25.571 --> 01:12:26.031
<v Speaker 1>Civilians,</v>

2697
01:12:26.031 --> 01:12:28.940
<v Speaker 1>because our fucking government is completely incompetent and retarded.</v>

2698
01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand weapons were trafficked along the US Mexico border and many were</v>

2699
01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:37.430
<v Speaker 1>using violent crimes in Mexico and in addition to Ak 47,</v>

2700
01:12:37.431 --> 01:12:41.150
<v Speaker 1>semiautomatics involved in the program were recovered after a US border.</v>

2701
01:12:41.151 --> 01:12:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Agent was killed south of Tucson.</v>

2702
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2703
01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:46.160
<v Speaker 1>A US fucking border agent was killed with one of these weapons.</v>

2704
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:50.390
<v Speaker 1>So under the program dub fast and furious agents with the Federal Bureau of</v>

2705
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.391
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol,</v>

2706
01:12:50.391 --> 01:12:50.841
<v Speaker 1>tobacco,</v>

2707
01:12:50.841 --> 01:12:55.841
<v Speaker 1>and firearms and explosives in the Phoenix field office allowed licensed firearm</v>

2708
01:12:56.271 --> 01:13:01.271
<v Speaker 1>dealers to sell weapons to illegal straw buyers in the hope that the agents</v>

2709
01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:04.400
<v Speaker 1>could track the weapons and arrest Mexican drug cartel leaders.</v>

2710
01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:08.300
<v Speaker 1>That was their walkie fucking dopey ass idea.</v>

2711
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.100
<v Speaker 1>They were going to allow the fucking Mexican drug cartels to get more weapons.</v>

2712
01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Did they have gps things at home or something?</v>

2713
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Then that kind of makes sense.</v>

2714
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:20.790
<v Speaker 3>If you give a bunch of guns and you watched,</v>

2715
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.001
<v Speaker 3>that's dumb.</v>

2716
01:13:22.001 --> 01:13:22.751
<v Speaker 3>They know where they are.</v>

2717
01:13:22.751 --> 01:13:23.710
<v Speaker 3>They already know where they are there.</v>

2718
01:13:23.711 --> 01:13:24.491
<v Speaker 3>Where the drug guys.</v>

2719
01:13:24.491 --> 01:13:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Are they a fucking ranches man?</v>

2720
01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.940
<v Speaker 3>These guys are to be bro.</v>

2721
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.221
<v Speaker 3>Yo.</v>

2722
01:13:28.221 --> 01:13:29.720
<v Speaker 3>They have dollars.</v>

2723
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:31.111
<v Speaker 3>So you never know.</v>

2724
01:13:31.111 --> 01:13:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a whole theory that they want to really like bankrupt Mexico.</v>

2725
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of the marrow?</v>

2726
01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.250
<v Speaker 3>You buy into that at all?</v>

2727
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I heard about it,</v>

2728
01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:40.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2729
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole thing was just.</v>

2730
01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.210
<v Speaker 3>We actually had it on CNN.</v>

2731
01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:47.650
<v Speaker 3>I think about just like how they're trying to like make like Mexico is broke as</v>

2732
01:13:47.651 --> 01:13:52.090
<v Speaker 3>shit and then America broke as shit and then bring down Canada with us and then</v>

2733
01:13:52.091 --> 01:13:52.630
<v Speaker 3>everything's.</v>

2734
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:53.441
<v Speaker 3>Our money's worth.</v>

2735
01:13:53.441 --> 01:13:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Nothing that they just get rid of are.</v>

2736
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:57.220
<v Speaker 3>It's the Amiro think that's possible.</v>

2737
01:13:57.221 --> 01:14:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that the government actually plots to crash the economy?</v>

2738
01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Absolute incompetence.</v>

2739
01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that they plot to crash shit.</v>

2740
01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:08.250
<v Speaker 3>I do think that the powers that be crashed,</v>

2741
01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:11.770
<v Speaker 3>the market so they can buy everything cheaper and then it goes up and they buy</v>

2742
01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>more and</v>

2743
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think that.</v>

2744
01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:13.961
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2745
01:14:13.961 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2746
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Well I definitely think that people short stocks and they manipulate the market</v>

2747
01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and do stuff like that to get kids to get money,</v>

2748
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 1>but those aren't.</v>

2749
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily the same people that are the government.</v>

2750
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:25.270
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

2751
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:27.700
<v Speaker 1>this is people that are involved in the market.</v>

2752
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:31.930
<v Speaker 1>The market sort of pays for the government to get the government to do certain</v>

2753
01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:36.931
<v Speaker 1>things their way that helped them and them and stealing money and make sure</v>

2754
01:14:37.151 --> 01:14:38.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of clauses.</v>

2755
01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>They get away a lot of shady shit completely legally,</v>

2756
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.210
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they're plotting.</v>

2757
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Here's my theory over the,</v>

2758
01:14:43.961 --> 01:14:44.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2759
01:14:44.321 --> 01:14:44.981
<v Speaker 1>the economy.</v>

2760
01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:45.814
<v Speaker 1>I think that's kind of.</v>

2761
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>You ever watched the first 48?</v>

2762
01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:48.693
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2763
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You ever see somebody kill somebody over $20 worth of crack?</v>

2764
01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2765
01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:52.961
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

2766
01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:54.430
<v Speaker 1>well those are just thugs and gals,</v>

2767
01:14:54.431 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but they're people.</v>

2768
01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:56.680
<v Speaker 1>They're wired certain ways.</v>

2769
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.120
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at the government,</v>

2770
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at people who are dealing with tr billions,</v>

2771
01:15:00.701 --> 01:15:02.350
<v Speaker 1>if not trillions of dollars.</v>

2772
01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think they're going to let you know a flip of a coin to decide</v>

2773
01:15:06.521 --> 01:15:09.490
<v Speaker 1>where that money goes and that they could have some problem with manipulating</v>

2774
01:15:09.491 --> 01:15:09.850
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2775
01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that's what happens,</v>

2776
01:15:11.141 --> 01:15:16.141
<v Speaker 1>but I would never ever put a pass somebody to manipulate something for a ton of</v>

2777
01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:17.110
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2778
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2779
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:17.741
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

2780
01:15:17.741 --> 01:15:18.401
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

2781
01:15:18.401 --> 01:15:21.040
<v Speaker 1>There's too many people would have to be involved in rigging the whole economy</v>

2782
01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:23.530
<v Speaker 1>to collapse and then you'd have to figure out who the hell's gonna profit on</v>

2783
01:15:23.531 --> 01:15:25.030
<v Speaker 1>this and then you'd have to follow the money.</v>

2784
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:26.103
<v Speaker 1>Here's the,</v>

2785
01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:26.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2786
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2787
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.260
<v Speaker 1>There's no mystery why things collapsed.</v>

2788
01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no mystery.</v>

2789
01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.760
<v Speaker 1>There was a god damn money grab and they,</v>

2790
01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:35.470
<v Speaker 1>they knew that it was temporary and they went crazy and they made,</v>

2791
01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2792
01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:36.361
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2793
01:15:36.361 --> 01:15:41.361
<v Speaker 1>the whole economy for Julie based on nothing based on nonsense,</v>

2794
01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.950
<v Speaker 1>but slowly but surely not least on gold up based on anything.</v>

2795
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:46.390
<v Speaker 1>It's all based on craziness.</v>

2796
01:15:46.391 --> 01:15:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And then there's derivatives,</v>

2797
01:15:47.351 --> 01:15:50.650
<v Speaker 1>and I read this mat tie eeb article we just talking about the derivative economy</v>

2798
01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:52.870
<v Speaker 1>being like 100 times larger than the regular economy.</v>

2799
01:15:52.871 --> 01:15:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck that means like it's it,</v>

2800
01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 1>it gets so fucking squirrely.</v>

2801
01:15:57.971 --> 01:15:58.540
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

2802
01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>they know what,</v>

2803
01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:00.460
<v Speaker 1>what went wrong.</v>

2804
01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not like someone's sabotage it on purpose so that they can profit from it</v>

2805
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:09.430
<v Speaker 1>and that they could slowly devalue the dollar so they can combine the countries</v>

2806
01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:09.980
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2807
01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:10.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2808
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no profit in that man.</v>

2809
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:12.340
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2810
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.250
<v Speaker 1>there's no ultimate profit and creating one giant country.</v>

2811
01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:15.790
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>

2812
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I've listened.</v>

2813
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:17.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying.</v>

2814
01:16:17.011 --> 01:16:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say that's the theory out there.</v>

2815
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2816
01:16:19.591 --> 01:16:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I the,</v>

2817
01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond,</v>

2818
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:21.873
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't,</v>

2819
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't put it past anybody.</v>

2820
01:16:23.321 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're talking about because when they do that,</v>

2821
01:16:25.211 --> 01:16:27.110
<v Speaker 1>supposedly what's going to have to happen,</v>

2822
01:16:27.111 --> 01:16:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and this is such a radical thing,</v>

2823
01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 1>but it would be like you would scrap the constitution,</v>

2824
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to scrap the constitution and have done that anyway.</v>

2825
01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:36.220
<v Speaker 1>They've sort of done that anyway.</v>

2826
01:16:36.221 --> 01:16:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely this will be a direct light parts of freedom of speech.</v>

2827
01:16:40.211 --> 01:16:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Parts of the Second Amendment,</v>

2828
01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:45.190
<v Speaker 1>the right to bear arms has been compromised significantly in this country and</v>

2829
01:16:45.191 --> 01:16:46.800
<v Speaker 1>more and more now that the,</v>

2830
01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:49.470
<v Speaker 1>the they were trying to do with the vapor,</v>

2831
01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:49.871
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2832
01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:50.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2833
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:51.010
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana,</v>

2834
01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:53.080
<v Speaker 1>they trying to make it so that if you have medical marijuana,</v>

2835
01:16:53.081 --> 01:16:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to possess a gun anymore or you're not a lot of buy a new</v>

2836
01:16:55.631 --> 01:16:56.320
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>

2837
01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.160
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2838
01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:58.023
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2839
01:16:58.050 --> 01:16:58.411
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

2840
01:16:58.411 --> 01:16:59.860
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking with people's rights,</v>

2841
01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 1>inalienable rights as non criminals in the United States of America,</v>

2842
01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:04.961
<v Speaker 1>as hunters,</v>

2843
01:17:04.961 --> 01:17:05.400
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

2844
01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.730
<v Speaker 1>as people that want to go target shooting.</v>

2845
01:17:06.731 --> 01:17:08.740
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever you know you're saying because someone uses medical,</v>

2846
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be allowed to.</v>

2847
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.570
<v Speaker 1>What about oxycodone?</v>

2848
01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:12.440
<v Speaker 1>You got that on your list?</v>

2849
01:17:12.441 --> 01:17:12.591
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2850
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:13.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

2851
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll go fuck yourself.</v>

2852
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:14.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2853
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking criminals.</v>

2854
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2855
01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>did she go to jail for that dude just for even suggesting that medical marijuana</v>

2856
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 1>should be something that you should lose your gun for and not oxycontin and</v>

2857
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Vicodin and not a regular drinker.</v>

2858
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

2859
01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:28.850
<v Speaker 1>You going on your purse?</v>

2860
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>So transparent man,</v>

2861
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the most transparent pieces of corruption the world has ever</v>

2862
01:17:34.311 --> 01:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

2863
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:39.110
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the fucking atf is going to go after potheads before they go after</v>

2864
01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies.</v>

2865
01:17:40.251 --> 01:17:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol companies.</v>

2866
01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.250
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go after people who smoke pot.</v>

2867
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.390
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones who can't have guns.</v>

2868
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Well then what about Obama and his administration now trying to shut down all</v>

2869
01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:50.490
<v Speaker 1>the dispensary's?</v>

2870
01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2871
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:51.703
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

2872
01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:53.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a bag of goods.</v>

2873
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:56.950
<v Speaker 1>It's all bullshit and they say it's the Department of Justice or say</v>

2874
01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're not listening to them.</v>

2875
01:18:01.131 --> 01:18:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2876
01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2877
01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:02.251
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2878
01:18:02.251 --> 01:18:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works.</v>

2879
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:03.561
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2880
01:18:03.561 --> 01:18:04.394
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much.</v>

2881
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Say the president really wants you.</v>

2882
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:06.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2883
01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:10.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think happens is he got in there he wanted like,</v>

2884
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:10.401
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2885
01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:12.440
<v Speaker 1>we can get in there real.</v>

2886
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.330
<v Speaker 1>It's all the bill Hicks whole thing.</v>

2887
01:18:14.331 --> 01:18:17.910
<v Speaker 1>They showed him a different fucking view of the Kennedy assassination.</v>

2888
01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:19.880
<v Speaker 1>It's even different than the bill Hicks joke.</v>

2889
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:23.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like instead he thought he was going to go there and he was going to get</v>

2890
01:18:23.571 --> 01:18:26.660
<v Speaker 1>into an office and he was going to be able to change shit and when he got there,</v>

2891
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people feverously working to patch up a hole in the middle of</v>

2892
01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:32.270
<v Speaker 1>the universe and they're like,</v>

2893
01:18:32.271 --> 01:18:32.541
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2894
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:32.841
<v Speaker 1>this is what.</v>

2895
01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:35.640
<v Speaker 1>You can only keep this together for another fucking year or two and it's going</v>

2896
01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:35.961
<v Speaker 1>to blow.</v>

2897
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if the economy goes.</v>

2898
01:18:37.221 --> 01:18:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter if we get cancer.</v>

2899
01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:38.740
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2900
01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:39.890
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking thing's going to blow.</v>

2901
01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:40.200
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

2902
01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:40.501
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2903
01:18:40.501 --> 01:18:41.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a hole in the universe.</v>

2904
01:18:41.421 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to patch it up.</v>

2905
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.810
<v Speaker 1>We've got our boys holding it down and they flew him out the fucking area.</v>

2906
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Fifty one and Nevada and he looked at the whole university went fuck.</v>

2907
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:49.260
<v Speaker 1>And then his hair slowly became gray.</v>

2908
01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 1>What do you wanna go after pot after pot.</v>

2909
01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:52.030
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2910
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

2911
01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:53.121
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

2912
01:18:53.121 --> 01:18:54.530
<v Speaker 1>At this point in Pakistan?</v>

2913
01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.393
<v Speaker 1>Where with Pakistan?</v>

2914
01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:56.091
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

2915
01:18:56.091 --> 01:18:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2916
01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Iran?</v>

2917
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Iran as bombs.</v>

2918
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.211
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

2919
01:18:58.211 --> 01:19:01.040
<v Speaker 1>let's bomb them first fucking hole in the universe.</v>

2920
01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:01.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2921
01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.920
<v Speaker 1>why not get gray quick?</v>

2922
01:19:03.921 --> 01:19:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Didn't,</v>

2923
01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:04.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2924
01:19:04.731 --> 01:19:05.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2925
01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:05.661
<v Speaker 1>he looks better.</v>

2926
01:19:05.661 --> 01:19:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Most black don't crack,</v>

2927
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:07.821
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

2928
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:08.654
<v Speaker 1>Because of the bush.</v>

2929
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2930
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.771
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

2931
01:19:09.771 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Speaker 1>They didn't care because they started seeing shit that we don't even know about.</v>

2932
01:19:13.971 --> 01:19:14.804
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

2933
01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 1>you hear what Bill Clinton said,</v>

2934
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:17.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2935
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>One of the craziest things that he said about being in an office,</v>

2936
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:20.990
<v Speaker 1>it was about the moon landings.</v>

2937
01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:25.220
<v Speaker 1>He said that when he was a kid just a couple of months after the Apollo 11</v>

2938
01:19:25.221 --> 01:19:25.910
<v Speaker 1>landing,</v>

2939
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2940
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.050
<v Speaker 1>he said that it was amazing that man put a person on the moon and he worked with</v>

2941
01:19:30.051 --> 01:19:30.884
<v Speaker 1>his old carpenter.</v>

2942
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Carpenter said that he thought that that was bs and that a television fellows,</v>

2943
01:19:37.251 --> 01:19:38.270
<v Speaker 1>because I don't believe a word of it,</v>

2944
01:19:38.271 --> 01:19:41.780
<v Speaker 1>those television fellers can try to get you to believe anything I don't believe</v>

2945
01:19:41.781 --> 01:19:42.614
<v Speaker 1>man landed on the moon.</v>

2946
01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.870
<v Speaker 1>And he said at the time I thought that guy was a crank.</v>

2947
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:45.531
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2948
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.360
<v Speaker 1>but after eight years in the White House,</v>

2949
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 1>just stop and think about that.</v>

2950
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Who did he say after eight years in the White House?</v>

2951
01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I started to think maybe he was ahead of his time.</v>

2952
01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:58.160
<v Speaker 1>This is the fucking president the fucking president said that.</v>

2953
01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine the shit that he saw where he would even pretend that the moon</v>

2954
01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 1>landings possibly could have been faked,</v>

2955
01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.380
<v Speaker 1>that he would even entertain that for a moment.</v>

2956
01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we have a goddamn clue as to what really creepy shit is going on</v>

2957
01:20:14.011 --> 01:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>behind closed doors.</v>

2958
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>When the farmers who shopped pharmaceutical companies talk about the amount of</v>

2959
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 1>drugs that they produce every year that they need to sell and how they upped the</v>

2960
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:25.470
<v Speaker 1>oxycontin every fucking year.</v>

2961
01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:25.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2962
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:28.500
<v Speaker 1>they've upped it so much since we've been in Afghanistan too.</v>

2963
01:20:28.501 --> 01:20:29.334
<v Speaker 1>What a coincidence.</v>

2964
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan producers,</v>

2965
01:20:30.601 --> 01:20:32.900
<v Speaker 1>all the heroin and that's where their fucking getting it and that's where they</v>

2966
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>make an oxycontin and we're over there protecting it 100 percent and it's so</v>

2967
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:40.570
<v Speaker 1>funny that people don't believe any of that,</v>

2968
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:40.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2969
01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:40.950
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2970
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 1>that they can't sit there and as we told them,</v>

2971
01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 1>that their leaders might not have their best interest.</v>

2972
01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're talking about billions and billions and billions of</v>

2973
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.990
<v Speaker 1>dollars when you're talking about just ridiculous sums of money.</v>

2974
01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.040
<v Speaker 1>We're willing,</v>

2975
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.690
<v Speaker 1>we're willing to do some creepy shit.</v>

2976
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.310
<v Speaker 1>We're willing to do some creepy shit,</v>

2977
01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:56.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2978
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And they don't give a fuck man.</v>

2979
01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I always question authority,</v>

2980
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.110
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2981
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.651
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

2982
01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's more fun.</v>

2983
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:04.171
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

2984
01:21:04.171 --> 01:21:04.591
<v Speaker 1>Why keep,</v>

2985
01:21:04.591 --> 01:21:05.610
<v Speaker 1>make their jobs easier,</v>

2986
01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:08.670
<v Speaker 1>but look how easily they can justify what they do.</v>

2987
01:21:08.671 --> 01:21:09.504
<v Speaker 1>Like Obama had,</v>

2988
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:12.720
<v Speaker 1>there was some fucking one of those speeches where they talked about,</v>

2989
01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:12.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2990
01:21:12.861 --> 01:21:13.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2991
01:21:13.290 --> 01:21:15.420
<v Speaker 1>where it was like Obama had jokes written for him,</v>

2992
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2993
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.840
<v Speaker 1>and he had a joke about his daughters and he said,</v>

2994
01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I have a two words for you predator.</v>

2995
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:22.253
<v Speaker 1>Drone.</v>

2996
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Like he was joking,</v>

2997
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.360
<v Speaker 1>people dating his daughter that he will send a Predator drone on you.</v>

2998
01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.760
<v Speaker 1>What's kind of a fucked up joke.</v>

2999
01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And then when you go look into how many people have died using Predator drones,</v>

3000
01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:37.080
<v Speaker 1>how many innocent people have done hundreds of them,</v>

3001
01:21:37.081 --> 01:21:37.740
<v Speaker 1>including like,</v>

3002
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 150 children.</v>

3003
01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.360
<v Speaker 1>So children,</v>

3004
01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:42.870
<v Speaker 1>small jokes.</v>

3005
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:47.870
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 50 children have been killed by things that are ultimately under</v>

3006
01:21:48.031 --> 01:21:52.080
<v Speaker 1>his control since he is the commander in chief of the United States army and the</v>

3007
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:52.771
<v Speaker 1>United States military force.</v>

3008
01:21:52.771 --> 01:21:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3009
01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:53.910
<v Speaker 1>He's the commander in chief.</v>

3010
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you,</v>

3011
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.150
<v Speaker 1>so ultimately he's at the top of the blame list.</v>

3012
01:21:57.270 --> 01:22:02.270
<v Speaker 1>A hundred and 50 babies were killed by missiles from a flying robot and he's</v>

3013
01:22:03.931 --> 01:22:06.360
<v Speaker 1>joking around about people dating his daughter.</v>

3014
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:07.740
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent and here's the whole.</v>

3015
01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I've said I'm using a predator.</v>

3016
01:22:09.301 --> 01:22:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Drones go after him,</v>

3017
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.300
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

3018
01:22:12.301 --> 01:22:13.650
<v Speaker 1>it's back to hand to hand combat.</v>

3019
01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 1>If you and I are going at it and you see I give up,</v>

3020
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense of like,</v>

3021
01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:17.881
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3022
01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:18.600
<v Speaker 1>he's giving up,</v>

3023
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.280
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a thousand miles away,</v>

3024
01:22:20.281 --> 01:22:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to see me surrender.</v>

3025
01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.720
<v Speaker 1>And it means nothing.</v>

3026
01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.570
<v Speaker 1>There's no like the detachment.</v>

3027
01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the same kind of detachment you get on the Internet where you're allowed to</v>

3028
01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:27.900
<v Speaker 1>use like a fake name.</v>

3029
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy could talk about training porn because he doesn't have to worry.</v>

3030
01:22:30.301 --> 01:22:30.991
<v Speaker 1>He's detached.</v>

3031
01:22:30.991 --> 01:22:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Or if someone could be mean to you and you know,</v>

3032
01:22:32.791 --> 01:22:34.930
<v Speaker 1>they don't worry about the social repercussions of being mean to you because</v>

3033
01:22:34.931 --> 01:22:35.970
<v Speaker 1>they don't say it was like a fuck.</v>

3034
01:22:35.971 --> 01:22:36.410
<v Speaker 1>You triple,</v>

3035
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.141
<v Speaker 1>you fucking suck.</v>

3036
01:22:37.141 --> 01:22:39.340
<v Speaker 1>You will read my comments</v>

3037
01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.770
<v Speaker 1>against those or did you hear that?</v>

3038
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:45.610
<v Speaker 1>The founder of Facebook,</v>

3039
01:22:45.611 --> 01:22:49.770
<v Speaker 1>his sister is trying to make it so people have to use their real names on the</v>

3040
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

3041
01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it'll ever happen.</v>

3042
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:52.583
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>

3043
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I think you should be able do whatever you want.</v>

3044
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.230
<v Speaker 1>If you want to use your real name,</v>

3045
01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:55.891
<v Speaker 1>your real name,</v>

3046
01:22:55.891 --> 01:22:56.311
<v Speaker 1>if you don't.</v>

3047
01:22:56.311 --> 01:22:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be places where you have to use your real name.</v>

3048
01:22:58.711 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I my message board,</v>

3049
01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I would like it if you had your real face and your real name and that's what we</v>

3050
01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:05.020
<v Speaker 1>saw and that's you.</v>

3051
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.930
<v Speaker 1>That's that can't make that happen.</v>

3052
01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess I could,</v>

3053
01:23:07.991 --> 01:23:08.421
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>

3054
01:23:08.421 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be censoring people and if that was the case,</v>

3055
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:14.530
<v Speaker 1>people wouldn't be able to post shit because of what they do for a living.</v>

3056
01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some people that have asked me to change their screen names because</v>

3057
01:23:17.321 --> 01:23:18.154
<v Speaker 1>their screen name,</v>

3058
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.100
<v Speaker 1>somebody from work found out their screen names,</v>

3059
01:23:20.101 --> 01:23:23.830
<v Speaker 1>so they asked me to change their screen name so that they couldn't get some</v>

3060
01:23:23.831 --> 01:23:25.690
<v Speaker 1>fucking tattle tattletale at work.</v>

3061
01:23:25.691 --> 01:23:26.081

3065
01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.290

<v Speaker 1>It's so much track tracking to nowadays,</v>

3069
01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:37.451
<v Speaker 1>like twitter,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Did you get a forecast?</v>

3082
01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3084
01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:52.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3085
01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:53.070
<v Speaker 1>it has.</v>

3086
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.970
<v Speaker 1>It has that shit on it.</v>

3087
01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3088
01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3089
01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:56.010
<v Speaker 1>it's creepy.</v>

3090
01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:56.843
<v Speaker 1>It is creepy.</v>

3091
01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just think people are.</v>

3092
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean because there's no ramifications.</v>

3093
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:02.340
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

3094
01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.130
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately everything comes down to accountability.</v>

3095
01:24:05.131 --> 01:24:08.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think we get away from more and more in,</v>

3096
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:09.390
<v Speaker 3>in this society,</v>

3097
01:24:09.391 --> 01:24:11.070
<v Speaker 3>especially in this country in which is,</v>

3098
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:11.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3099
01:24:11.491 --> 01:24:15.930
<v Speaker 3>my whole thing is I wish they would say that I occupy Wall Street or la is like,</v>

3100
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.490
<v Speaker 3>you want accountability,</v>

3101
01:24:17.491 --> 01:24:17.821
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3102
01:24:17.821 --> 01:24:20.370
<v Speaker 3>You want accountability for everything you do.</v>

3103
01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:20.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3104
01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:21.900
<v Speaker 3>whether it's government,</v>

3105
01:24:21.901 --> 01:24:23.040
<v Speaker 3>whether it's your personal,</v>

3106
01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:23.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3107
01:24:23.611 --> 01:24:24.180
<v Speaker 3>actions.</v>

3108
01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.610
<v Speaker 3>It's accountability and that's what they're asking for.</v>

3109
01:24:26.611 --> 01:24:28.740
<v Speaker 3>But no one will come out and say that on that thing.</v>

3110
01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.400
<v Speaker 3>So they all put out there,</v>

3111
01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up and the whole thing's falling apart and no one's going to jail.</v>

3112
01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:34.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

3113
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:35.350
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

3114
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:39.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a sure sign that the justice system is not working properly.</v>

3115
01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:43.880
<v Speaker 1>A sure sign that our elected leaders are not going after the people that had</v>

3116
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:44.900
<v Speaker 1>created this problem.</v>

3117
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.883
<v Speaker 3>100.</v>

3118
01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.990
<v Speaker 3>I gotTa stop saying that 100 percent,</v>

3119
01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.350
<v Speaker 3>1000 percent fighting I should say.</v>

3120
01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:52.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like a drinking game.</v>

3121
01:24:52.491 --> 01:24:53.091
<v Speaker 3>At this point.</v>

3122
01:24:53.091 --> 01:24:55.480
<v Speaker 3>People were drinking shots at this player,</v>

3123
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:56.630
<v Speaker 3>shit faced.</v>

3124
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine in the future,</v>

3125
01:24:58.641 --> 01:25:02.360
<v Speaker 3>like if there was a movie that that was designed like prior,</v>

3126
01:25:02.361 --> 01:25:03.590
<v Speaker 3>like Avatar or something like that,</v>

3127
01:25:03.591 --> 01:25:07.370
<v Speaker 3>like Cgi and every time you wash it and going back to what you were talking</v>

3128
01:25:07.371 --> 01:25:07.880
<v Speaker 3>about earlier,</v>

3129
01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.000
<v Speaker 3>every time you watched it in a new partner,</v>

3130
01:25:11.001 --> 01:25:14.780
<v Speaker 3>a new scene was in the movie and it was created randomly buy a computer</v>

3131
01:25:14.781 --> 01:25:16.100
<v Speaker 3>generated kind of like minecraft.</v>

3132
01:25:16.101 --> 01:25:17.300
<v Speaker 3>This video that could be possible.</v>

3133
01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:21.230
<v Speaker 3>You could sit down and you can sit down and watch star wars,</v>

3134
01:25:21.231 --> 01:25:22.310
<v Speaker 3>like a whole new thing,</v>

3135
01:25:22.311 --> 01:25:23.150
<v Speaker 3>version of star wars.</v>

3136
01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Every time you watch it becomes like a choose your own adventure movie where</v>

3137
01:25:27.381 --> 01:25:30.850
<v Speaker 3>it's like different choices give you a different ending to the script.</v>

3138
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3139
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3140
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.813
<v Speaker 1>absolutely man.</v>

3141
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:38.250
<v Speaker 1>The future is going to be very strange when it comes to what you can create,</v>

3142
01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.080
<v Speaker 1>artificial environments that you can create.</v>

3143
01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:41.640
<v Speaker 1>The real question to me is like,</v>

3144
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.050
<v Speaker 1>what is gonna?</v>

3145
01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:43.860
<v Speaker 1>What's gonna?</v>

3146
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.620
<v Speaker 1>When is it going to be human stupidity?</v>

3147
01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Or is it going to be technology?</v>

3148
01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:48.361
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3149
01:25:48.361 --> 01:25:50.460
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like there's a race to a final conclusion.</v>

3150
01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Theology maybe,</v>

3151
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:57.830
<v Speaker 1>but we're also invading Pakistan and Iran has got nukes and fucking with the</v>

3152
01:25:58.261 --> 01:26:01.770
<v Speaker 1>large Hadron collider and some new laser they're proposing to build in Britain</v>

3153
01:26:01.771 --> 01:26:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that could punch a whole new space time and that</v>

3154
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 4>this is a weird race going on and at the same time,</v>

3155
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:08.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3156
01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.290
<v Speaker 4>can you go again?</v>

3157
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:11.650
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3158
01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:14.090
<v Speaker 4>so look what's going on in the Congo,</v>

3159
01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:15.440
<v Speaker 4>look what's going on in Mexico.</v>

3160
01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Look what's going on.</v>

3161
01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:21.080
<v Speaker 4>So many different parts of the world where human lives are just falling apart.</v>

3162
01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 4>Human civilization falling apart,</v>

3163
01:26:23.331 --> 01:26:24.164
<v Speaker 4>chaos,</v>

3164
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3165
01:26:24.591 --> 01:26:25.760
<v Speaker 4>just ultimate chaos.</v>

3166
01:26:25.761 --> 01:26:29.750
<v Speaker 4>You look at like watch like documentaries on parts of Africa and you would swear</v>

3167
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:31.940
<v Speaker 4>this is a post apocalyptic vision.</v>

3168
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.240
<v Speaker 4>Things they do like just hacking or just to get there.</v>

3169
01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:38.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3170
01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:43.280
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy eating the flesh of innocent children on the enemy side to,</v>

3171
01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:43.570
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3172
01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:48.140
<v Speaker 4>to be little vulnerable and battle some of the stuff that I watched</v>

3173
01:26:48.141 --> 01:26:49.370
<v Speaker 4>documentaries on Liberia.</v>

3174
01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.350
<v Speaker 4>They've stained my brain forever,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it just gets a new passport.</v>

3215
01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:37.060
<v Speaker 4>You're better off telling me about his one in North Korea and how crazy it is.</v>

3216
01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:38.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well he said he's got some North Korea.</v>

3218
01:27:40.150 --> 01:27:41.480
<v Speaker 4>He said N K slay footage.</v>

3219
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.320
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know what that meant,</v>

3220
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:43.640
<v Speaker 4>but in the Internet schooled me,</v>

3221
01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 4>North Korea Douche.</v>

3222
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.950
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3223
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:46.521
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3224
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:46.851
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

3225
01:27:46.851 --> 01:27:47.211
<v Speaker 4>People are like,</v>

3226
01:27:47.211 --> 01:27:48.044
<v Speaker 4>you seriously?</v>

3227
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what it is.</v>

3228
01:27:49.410 --> 01:27:50.180
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>

3229
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.590
<v Speaker 4>I started trying to think of what that meant.</v>

3230
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.290
<v Speaker 4>I never associated North Korea with slaves for some reason.</v>

3231
01:27:54.291 --> 01:27:55.550
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think that there would be slaves.</v>

3232
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.630
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

3233
01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:59.450
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you that happens more and more common,</v>

3234
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:00.890
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3235
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:02.030
<v Speaker 4>And that's a whole thing about,</v>

3236
01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:02.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3237
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:05.750
<v Speaker 4>this whole free trade where they moved their businesses over these third world</v>

3238
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:06.740
<v Speaker 4>and your phone off the table.</v>

3239
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:08.570
<v Speaker 4>Everybody take your phone off the table,</v>

3240
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:11.000
<v Speaker 4>everybody keeps lowering lowering prices.</v>

3241
01:28:11.001 --> 01:28:14.120
<v Speaker 4>Eventually the Labor is going to be to the point where they don't even want pay</v>

3242
01:28:14.121 --> 01:28:16.190
<v Speaker 4>for Labor to keep the prices so low.</v>

3243
01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3244

01:28:18.981 --> 01:28:20.240
<v Speaker 4>we're willing to do that to dolphins.</v>

3248
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:21.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3249
01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:22.100

01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand that either.</v>

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:24.853
<v Speaker 4>that's really helpful.</v>

3255
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:26.540
<v Speaker 4>If you ever go to China,</v>

3256
01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.100
<v Speaker 4>you'll have the best time ever.</v>

3257
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:29.690

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.930

3271
01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:50.750
<v Speaker 4>Chinese people.</v>

3272

3274
01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:54.200
<v Speaker 4>It was like mostly white people.</v>

3275
01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:55.760
<v Speaker 4>It was like 80 percent white.</v>

3276
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:56.660
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3277

<v Speaker 4>it was amazing.</v>

3280
01:28:59.031 --> 01:28:59.570
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Chinese are the nicest people ever and you know,</v>

3284
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:07.830
<v Speaker 1>you just learn.</v>

3285
01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:09.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody's the same and she,</v>

3286
01:29:09.181 --> 01:29:13.800
<v Speaker 1>she got governments and they're fighting with each other over resources.</v>

3287
01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 1>The resources problem in China's.</v>

3288
01:29:15.751 --> 01:29:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It's really a problem.</v>

3289
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You is a funny thing.</v>

3290
01:29:19.381 --> 01:29:22.140
<v Speaker 1>That whole factory thing in China.</v>

3291
01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>You know when people.</v>

3292
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I had a thing on the podcast were I was trying to figure out,</v>

3293
01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:27.210
<v Speaker 1>is there a Karma free cell phone,</v>

3294
01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:31.440
<v Speaker 1>his cell phone that I can get where I don't feel bad about owning it?</v>

3295
01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Turns out there's not.</v>

3296
01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Why do you feel bad about owning it?</v>

3297
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad that someone has to make fucking fifteen cents an hour to make</v>

3298
01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:38.544
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3299
01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:44.240
<v Speaker 1>They should have an iphone called the Karma and the icon has made in America and</v>

3300
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:49.230
<v Speaker 1>they pay the people a real wage and you're going to cost twice as much.</v>

3301
01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It costs twice as much and a lot of people would folk you do sugar,</v>

3302
01:29:52.411 --> 01:29:52.950
<v Speaker 1>brilliant food.</v>

3303
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:53.341
<v Speaker 1>My phone.</v>

3304
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:53.820

<v Speaker 1>who are you fucking go to me.</v>

3306
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.741
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying,</v>

3307
01:29:55.741 --> 01:29:55.951
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3308
01:29:55.951 --> 01:29:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about you if you want to.</v>

3309
01:29:57.151 --> 01:29:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not judging you,</v>

3310
01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:03.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying it would be nice for me if I knew that this was made by people</v>

3311
01:30:03.061 --> 01:30:05.010
<v Speaker 1>who were paid for their labor,</v>

3312
01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3313
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:10.430
<v Speaker 1>a really fair price so they could afford to go on vacation so they could afford</v>

3314
01:30:10.861 --> 01:30:12.900
<v Speaker 1>to live in a nice place so they can afford to have food.</v>

3315
01:30:12.901 --> 01:30:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3316
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I think if you fucking work all day,</v>

3317
01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:16.920
<v Speaker 1>you should not have issues.</v>

3318
01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.060
<v Speaker 1>You should not have issues.</v>

3319
01:30:18.061 --> 01:30:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3320
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3321
01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:19.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3322
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:19.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm homeless.</v>

3323
01:30:19.801 --> 01:30:20.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3324
01:30:20.011 --> 01:30:20.821
<v Speaker 1>you should not have issues.</v>

3325
01:30:20.821 --> 01:30:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3326
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:21.421
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3327
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford health insurance.</v>

3328
01:30:22.771 --> 01:30:23.400
<v Speaker 1>You should not.</v>

3329
01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.630
<v Speaker 1>If you're working all day,</v>

3330
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:25.031
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3331
01:30:25.031 --> 01:30:25.301
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3332
01:30:25.301 --> 01:30:27.310
<v Speaker 1>your day should be worth something.</v>

3333
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:27.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3334
01:30:27.481 --> 01:30:30.870
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I think the whole thing is going to collapse because not just in</v>

3335
01:30:30.871 --> 01:30:31.261
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

3336
01:30:31.261 --> 01:30:34.740
<v Speaker 1>but around the world because here you're taking these jobs from here where</v>

3337
01:30:34.741 --> 01:30:38.190
<v Speaker 1>you're paying a living wage and you're taking over here and you're not paying a</v>

3338
01:30:38.191 --> 01:30:39.930
<v Speaker 1>living wage or paying next to nothing.</v>

3339
01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:43.020
<v Speaker 1>So the people over here can't buy anything and now the people over here can't</v>

3340
01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 1>buy anything.</v>

3341
01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So who's going to buy the goods?</v>

3342
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:45.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3343
01:30:45.511 --> 01:30:46.490
<v Speaker 1>the real question is,</v>

3344
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3345
01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:47.681
<v Speaker 1>who can buy it,</v>

3346
01:30:47.681 --> 01:30:50.040
<v Speaker 1>but the real question is how can you compete,</v>

3347
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:53.430
<v Speaker 1>how can you make something in this chair of support and that's why the</v>

3348
01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:58.431
<v Speaker 1>administration just same three new huge free trade agreements they say are as</v>

3349
01:30:58.801 --> 01:31:03.060
<v Speaker 1>big as Nafta and they're going around like job creating bill on that and you</v>

3350
01:31:03.061 --> 01:31:03.870
<v Speaker 1>just sign that,</v>

3351
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 1>that free trade thing.</v>

3352
01:31:04.831 --> 01:31:05.491
<v Speaker 1>We're screwed.</v>

3353
01:31:05.491 --> 01:31:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Map and stuff like that is where people really get the motivation.</v>

3354
01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:10.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

3355
01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3356
01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.800
<v Speaker 1>the inspiration to think that this is a rigged system to think that this is some</v>

3357
01:31:16.081 --> 01:31:19.050
<v Speaker 1>sort of Illuminati plan to slowly crashed the economy.</v>

3358
01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:20.003
<v Speaker 1>Things like that,</v>

3359
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3360
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.420
<v Speaker 1>free trade agreements.</v>

3361
01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.310
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's just a fucking money grab.</v>

3362
01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:25.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just greedy corporations,</v>

3363
01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.300
<v Speaker 1>corporations and greedy cons.</v>

3364
01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.010
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is the corporations,</v>

3365
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.030
<v Speaker 1>they found out that the Chinese and all these different industries,</v>

3366
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.260
<v Speaker 1>nations all around the world are willing to work harder,</v>

3367
01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:41.280
<v Speaker 1>longer hours for less money and then thus they can produce shit cheaper.</v>

3368
01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.710
<v Speaker 1>And because they found out that it's like,</v>

3369
01:31:43.711 --> 01:31:43.951
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3370
01:31:43.951 --> 01:31:44.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3371
01:31:44.071 --> 01:31:47.100
<v Speaker 1>we have to compete if you want these American jobs,</v>

3372
01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3373
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:50.430
<v Speaker 1>our whole business is going to go under unless you move or at least our</v>

3374
01:31:50.431 --> 01:31:52.380
<v Speaker 1>factories over there.</v>

3375
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3376
01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.221
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3377
01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:53.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3378
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:53.680
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3379
01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.130
<v Speaker 1>move your factories over there but sell your Nike's over here,</v>

3380
01:31:56.490 --> 01:31:56.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3381
01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you gotta have some Nike employees over here,</v>

3382
01:31:59.050 --> 01:31:59.230
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3383
01:31:59.230 --> 01:31:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3384
01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3385
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:00.870
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

3386
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 4>And over there it's like,</v>

3387
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:06.100
<v Speaker 4>I guess the stuff's cheap or to sell in terms of like,</v>

3388
01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:06.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3389
01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:08.860
<v Speaker 4>what Chinese are buying the same goods as us.</v>

3390
01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:12.700
<v Speaker 4>We pay way more because we supposedly have a higher standard of living.</v>

3391
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.830
<v Speaker 4>But eventually that's going to have to go down to.</v>

3392
01:32:14.831 --> 01:32:15.161
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3393
01:32:15.161 --> 01:32:18.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean if we're not having those jobs and we're all working at Walmart making</v>

3394
01:32:18.851 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 4>like $7 an hour,</v>

3395
01:32:19.931 --> 01:32:21.200
<v Speaker 4>we can't afford to buy a,</v>

3396
01:32:21.210 --> 01:32:21.601
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3397
01:32:21.601 --> 01:32:21.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3398
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:23.290
<v Speaker 4>$150 phone or something.</v>

3399

<v Speaker 4>The Chinese,</v>

01:33:23.561 --> 01:33:24.580
<v Speaker 4>they don't give a shit.</v>

3442
01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.810
<v Speaker 4>They're totally racist.</v>

3443
01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:26.590
<v Speaker 4>I used to,</v>

3444
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:27.161
<v Speaker 4>when I was there,</v>

3445
01:33:27.161 --> 01:33:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I had a full beard.</v>

3446
01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:29.920
<v Speaker 4>I looked Middle Eastern.</v>

3447
01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:32.470
<v Speaker 4>They don't like middle easterns because they think they're all drug dealers</v>

3448
01:33:32.471 --> 01:33:33.070
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3449
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:34.390
<v Speaker 4>So I couldn't get a car,</v>

3450
01:33:34.391 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 4>sometimes a taxi,</v>

3451
01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:39.340
<v Speaker 4>so the only guy that would pick us up one time was this dude who drew,</v>

3452
01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.510
<v Speaker 4>drove what looked like they took a hot dog vending machine and turned it into a</v>

3453
01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:47.560
<v Speaker 4>car and it literally had like the most chunkiest like shift,</v>

<v Speaker 4>through China through Beijing or Shanghai because they don't follow the lights.</v>

3457

3459
01:34:01.901 --> 01:34:03.640
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people get run over by cars in China.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I couldn't watch it.</v>

3466
01:34:08.970 --> 01:34:10.060
<v Speaker 4>It just makes me sad.</v>

3477
01:34:23.591 --> 01:34:25.720
<v Speaker 4>think that everybody is precious because he's precious.</v>

3577
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:27.410
<v Speaker 1>But the other Guy Smith.</v>

3578
01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:28.700
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's his name?</v>

3579
01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.133
<v Speaker 1>Pat Duffy.</v>

3580
01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Pat Duffy was the other guy who let them throw up and its mouth.</v>

3581
01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:35.211
<v Speaker 1>So this was a,</v>

3582
01:36:35.211 --> 01:36:39.090
<v Speaker 1>there was a eggnog eating contest and I don't remember how many shots you have.</v>

3583
01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:39.960
<v Speaker 1>It was something insane.</v>

3584
01:36:39.961 --> 01:36:41.270
<v Speaker 1>He's almost a gallon I think.</v>

3585
01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I think the human body can only have a gallon of milk or two gallons.</v>

3586
01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.010
<v Speaker 1>It was like 70 shots or something like that.</v>

3587
01:36:47.410 --> 01:36:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Something insane.</v>

3588
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:49.101
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

3589
01:36:49.101 --> 01:36:49.934
<v Speaker 1>he does that.</v>

3590
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:50.960
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

3591
01:36:50.961 --> 01:36:51.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3592
01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.660
<v Speaker 1>we were trying to figure out what to do because he knew he was gonna throw up.</v>

3593
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And then we suggested that one of the interns lean his head over the dumpster,</v>

3594
01:36:58.461 --> 01:37:01.910
<v Speaker 1>over the garbage bucket and open his mouth and let the dude throw up in his</v>

3595
01:37:01.911 --> 01:37:03.470
<v Speaker 1>mouth like a baby bird feed.</v>

3596
01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.100

01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:07.731

01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:09.530
<v Speaker 1>He did a bunch of other shit too.</v>

3601
01:37:09.531 --> 01:37:09.810

3776
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:42.660
<v Speaker 3>They called up again.</v>

3777

01:40:53.190 --> 01:40:53.530
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3787
01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>This is some</v>

3788
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.251
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3789
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the fuck is happening.</v>

3790
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:55.601
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3791
01:40:55.601 --> 01:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's in Cuba.</v>

3792
01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who came up with this,</v>

3793
01:40:58.661 --> 01:41:01.900
<v Speaker 1>but there's these guys in a ring and they have fucking fist.</v>

3794
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.290
<v Speaker 1>They have things on their fists that are electrocuting each other like tasers on</v>

3795
01:41:05.291 --> 01:41:05.980
<v Speaker 1>their knuckles,</v>

3796
01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.990
<v Speaker 1>but they're punching each other with tasers.</v>

3797
01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a guy knocks a guy out with a fucking taser in his hand.</v>

3798
01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It's bad ass.</v>

3799
01:41:11.670 --> 01:41:12.503
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3800
01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:13.620
<v Speaker 1>They're throwing kicks and</v>

3801
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3802
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>he was dog collars.</v>

3803
01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.980
<v Speaker 1>The crowd just zap them.</v>

3804
01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:22.840
<v Speaker 1>He's willing to do some stuff that I don't understand,</v>

3805
01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.670
<v Speaker 1>but this shock fights is like,</v>

3806
01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:25.271
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3807
01:41:25.271 --> 01:41:25.461
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>

3808
01:41:25.461 --> 01:41:30.400
<v Speaker 1>How far are we from throwing a dude with a sword into an arena with a lion?</v>

3809
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:31.341
<v Speaker 1>How far away?</v>

3810
01:41:31.341 --> 01:41:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I'm sure in third world countries is going to happen sooner than</v>

3811
01:41:34.271 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>you think because there was a.</v>

3812
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:38.890
<v Speaker 1>There was a thing where a guy was going to have a fucking sword fight.</v>

3813
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:40.030
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

3814
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the guy going to fight a lion.</v>

3815
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:43.960
<v Speaker 1>It was a Greek guy or something like that.</v>

3816
01:41:43.961 --> 01:41:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the whole story was,</v>

3817
01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:46.301
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

3818
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I remember this thing,</v>

3819
01:41:47.291 --> 01:41:49.470
<v Speaker 1>like it was either a sword fight or he's going to fight an aunt,</v>

3820
01:41:49.471 --> 01:41:50.860
<v Speaker 1>a wild animal or something like that,</v>

3821
01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:51.910
<v Speaker 1>but I remember thinking like,</v>

3822
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:52.181
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3823
01:41:52.181 --> 01:41:53.470
<v Speaker 1>this is how it starts.</v>

3824
01:41:53.710 --> 01:41:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Because it starts where people hear about on the Internet and then they go,</v>

3825
01:41:57.131 --> 01:41:57.461
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3826
01:41:57.461 --> 01:41:58.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3827
01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And then somewhere,</v>

3828
01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:00.070
<v Speaker 1>wherever the fuck it is,</v>

3829
01:42:00.071 --> 01:42:01.330
<v Speaker 1>where life's not that expensive.</v>

3830
01:42:01.331 --> 01:42:02.164
<v Speaker 1>High Tiawana.</v>

3831
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere along those lines,</v>

3832
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.470
<v Speaker 1>they set up an arena and they just say,</v>

3833
01:42:05.471 --> 01:42:05.651
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3834
01:42:05.651 --> 01:42:06.580
<v Speaker 1>instead of both sides,</v>

3835
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:09.960
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to have people wearing armor and they're gonna fight lions and</v>

3836
01:42:09.961 --> 01:42:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm rooting for the line every time.</v>

3837
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3838
01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe how do you not?</v>

3839
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the guy has children who can't feed and he's fucking willing to get in</v>

3840
01:42:17.501 --> 01:42:18.281
<v Speaker 1>there with a lot of line.</v>

3841
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Has No choice.</v>

3842
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3843
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:20.500
<v Speaker 1>and being sure.</v>

3844
01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy has a choice,</v>

3845
01:42:21.461 --> 01:42:22.660
<v Speaker 1>but I still root for the person.</v>

3846
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm reminded lying people.</v>

3847
01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm on team lying,</v>

3848
01:42:25.641 --> 01:42:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

3849
01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:26.861
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>

3850
01:42:26.861 --> 01:42:27.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3851
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I just like the lines aren't choosing to be there.</v>

3852
01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:30.131
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

3853
01:42:30.131 --> 01:42:31.210
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to kill the person.</v>

3854
01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:33.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the person that was any different than the killer.</v>

3855
01:42:33.191 --> 01:42:34.024
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3856
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:35.430
<v Speaker 1>that's are dumb.</v>

3857
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Lions aren't smart.</v>

3858
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not that much different,</v>

3859
01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.320
<v Speaker 1>but lions are not that.</v>

3860
01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:40.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3861
01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:43.720
<v Speaker 1>lions are just fucking there to remove mental capacity,</v>

3862
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:45.430
<v Speaker 1>whether it's going to be a crime or not.</v>

3863
01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:46.293
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

3864
01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I feel like lions are part of our domain,</v>

3865
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:49.930
<v Speaker 1>whereas killer whales,</v>

3866
01:42:49.931 --> 01:42:53.410
<v Speaker 1>we have to go into their world and pull them out of their world and cap.</v>

3867
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:56.800
<v Speaker 1>They don't interact with us on a regular basis unless we get on boats and enter</v>

3868
01:42:56.801 --> 01:42:57.634
<v Speaker 1>into their world.</v>

3869
01:42:57.730 --> 01:42:58.301
<v Speaker 1>Lions.</v>

3870
01:42:58.301 --> 01:42:59.134
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

3871
01:42:59.140 --> 01:42:59.681
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

3872
01:42:59.681 --> 01:43:01.340
<v Speaker 1>You mean you're in Africa like they.</v>

3873
01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.970
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine was in Africa and while he was there,</v>

3874
01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:05.950
<v Speaker 1>some guy got killed where they.</v>

3875
01:43:05.951 --> 01:43:07.750
<v Speaker 1>It came into the camp.</v>

3876
01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:09.070
<v Speaker 1>It came into the camp.</v>

3877
01:43:09.071 --> 01:43:12.910
<v Speaker 1>The lion came into the camp while the dude was in the fucking shower and dragged</v>

3878
01:43:12.911 --> 01:43:14.980
<v Speaker 1>him out of the shower to female lions.</v>

3879
01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Lions can suck my Dick.</v>

3880
01:43:19.450 --> 01:43:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3881
01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Lions can go fuck themselves.</v>

3882
01:43:21.161 --> 01:43:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a killer whale.</v>

3883
01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Like guys,</v>

3884
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:22.940
<v Speaker 1>surfing,</v>

3885
01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:24.360
<v Speaker 1>kill comes up and whoop some ass.</v>

3886
01:43:24.361 --> 01:43:24.731
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3887
01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:25.150
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

3888
01:43:25.150 --> 01:43:25.983
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

3889
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:27.140
<v Speaker 1>No one's been killed by Carol.</v>

3890
01:43:27.141 --> 01:43:27.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3891
01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:28.030
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

3892
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.511
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

3893
01:43:28.511 --> 01:43:29.344
<v Speaker 1>they help people.</v>

3894
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:32.800
<v Speaker 1>They've actually saved people when they've learned they're drowning.</v>

3895
01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Killer whales aren't sharks.</v>

3896
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:35.051
<v Speaker 1>The sharks.</v>

3897
01:43:35.051 --> 01:43:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I could see your point.</v>

3898
01:43:35.770 --> 01:43:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Sharks can suck my dick.</v>

3899
01:43:36.761 --> 01:43:38.590
<v Speaker 1>You can take a shark and throw in a fish tank all day long.</v>

3900
01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a feeling for a sharp,</v>

3901
01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.360
<v Speaker 1>but killer whales are superintelligent safe people.</v>

3902
01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:45.390
<v Speaker 1>But I think that when you're,</v>

3903
01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3904
01:43:45.730 --> 01:43:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3905
01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you should have Christians versus the lions.</v>

3906
01:43:48.491 --> 01:43:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you should pick an arm dudes and send them in and you know,</v>

3907
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>have a sword fight</v>

3908
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.610
<v Speaker 3>with the lions.</v>

3909
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:53.990
<v Speaker 3>But I am saying if it goes down,</v>

3910
01:43:53.991 --> 01:43:55.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for the fucking person.</v>

3911
01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I think I want to know,</v>

3912
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:58.280
<v Speaker 3>can you kill a lion with a sword?</v>

3913
01:43:58.610 --> 01:44:01.790
<v Speaker 3>Can you be armored up and kill a fucking line with nothing but a sword?</v>

3914
01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 3>If that guy can do it,</v>

3915
01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:03.261
<v Speaker 3>good for him,</v>

3916
01:44:03.261 --> 01:44:03.650
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3917
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I just might not be able to.</v>

3918
01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:06.420
<v Speaker 3>You might not be able to line.</v>

3919
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Might just Jack you every time.</v>

3920
01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:10.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like you want to dudes from death row fighting to the death.</v>

3921
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:11.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine with that.</v>

3922
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Really just fighting it an animal.</v>

3923
01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

3924
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:15.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3925
01:44:15.651 --> 01:44:16.380
<v Speaker 3>it's like I get,</v>

3926
01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I get.</v>

3927
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:18.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should do it.</v>

3928
01:44:18.730 --> 01:44:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3929
01:44:19.150 --> 01:44:19.983
<v Speaker 3>If you do do it,</v>

3930
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for the person and then I will put 20 bucks and I'm always going for</v>

3931
01:44:23.661 --> 01:44:24.090
<v Speaker 3>the lie.</v>

3932
01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3933
01:44:24.810 --> 01:44:25.643
<v Speaker 3>I'm always.</v>

3934
01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Was that Brian?</v>

3935
01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Same.</v>

3936
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Same exact reasons.</v>

3937
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:32.780
<v Speaker 3>But what if you found out the guy was like super poor and you have the Guy</v>

3938
01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Brian?</v>

3939
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.321
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3940
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I just no sleep.</v>

3941
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Why is it black?</v>

3942
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:38.700
<v Speaker 3>It looks under the thing like you just got rocked and your eyeball.</v>

3943
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:39.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>

3944
01:44:39.490 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Speaker 3>It's coming out of his eyeballs.</v>

3945
01:44:42.730 --> 01:44:43.260
<v Speaker 3>He had fun.</v>

3946
01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:45.410
<v Speaker 3>While I agree with Sam on that,</v>

3947
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:46.130
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3948
01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I think even if they showed me the story of this poor,</v>

3949
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:49.514
<v Speaker 3>sad guy,</v>

3950
01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:52.770
<v Speaker 3>he has a choice to chose the choice to fucking line on it,</v>

3951
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:56.090
<v Speaker 3>but I'm rooting for him and we might not interfere with whales because we</v>

3952
01:44:56.091 --> 01:44:56.960
<v Speaker 3>haven't moved there yet.</v>

3953
01:44:56.961 --> 01:44:57.890
<v Speaker 3>But if you went,</v>

3954
01:44:57.891 --> 01:44:58.190
<v Speaker 3>came,</v>

3955
01:44:58.190 --> 01:45:00.500
<v Speaker 3>went back thousands and thousands of years.</v>

3956
01:45:00.501 --> 01:45:02.420
<v Speaker 3>We're in lion territory right now,</v>

3957
01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:02.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3958
01:45:02.821 --> 01:45:04.610
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sort of.</v>

3959
01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:06.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was some sort of big cats here.</v>

3960
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Saber Tooth Tigers I think.</v>

3961
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:07.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3962
01:45:07.641 --> 01:45:08.580
<v Speaker 3>I think there was lions.</v>

3963
01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.381
<v Speaker 3>Well actually there was,</v>

3964
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:11.960
<v Speaker 3>there was a North American line a long fucking time ago.</v>

3965
01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:15.470
<v Speaker 3>So a different commands welcome through the jungle and a lion comes.</v>

3966
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for the guy.</v>

3967
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3968
01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for the guy.</v>

3969
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 3>But when you grabbed the lion,</v>

3970
01:45:19.401 --> 01:45:24.401
<v Speaker 3>you have very specific rules in line to be there with no choice where it's not</v>

3971
01:45:24.831 --> 01:45:27.460
<v Speaker 3>naturally going to be there and it could die because you're.</v>

3972
01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:28.440
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to make 20.</v>

3973
01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3974
01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:31.790
<v Speaker 3>it's like why people didn't like the dog fighting.</v>

3975
01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you have a dog.</v>

3976
01:45:33.891 --> 01:45:34.071
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3977
01:45:34.071 --> 01:45:34.904
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3978
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:35.181
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3979
01:45:35.181 --> 01:45:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you should do it,</v>

3980
01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.130
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying if you do do it,</v>

3981
01:45:37.131 --> 01:45:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to root for you.</v>

3982
01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I'll smack it.</v>

3983
01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Animal though.</v>

3984
01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:40.280
<v Speaker 3>I'd not heard it though.</v>

3985
01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Just you've got discipline your dog.</v>

3986
01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:43.933
<v Speaker 3>We slept at him.</v>

3987
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:47.180
<v Speaker 3>See the woman who heads it like a hippo for a pet.</v>

3988
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:48.103
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3989
01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:49.520
<v Speaker 3>I read some article on it.</v>

3990
01:45:49.521 --> 01:45:50.690
<v Speaker 3>She has a hippo for pack.</v>

3991
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:52.130
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come and get ya.</v>

3992
01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:53.500
<v Speaker 3>It's eventually going to turn on you.</v>

3993
01:45:53.501 --> 01:45:54.334
<v Speaker 3>Is it a male?</v>

3994
01:45:54.670 --> 01:45:54.961
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

3995
01:45:54.961 --> 01:45:55.794
<v Speaker 3>I didn't read it.</v>

3996
01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Whether it was a male or a female.</v>

3997
01:45:57.501 --> 01:45:58.940
<v Speaker 3>She can keep it together for a little while.</v>

3998
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.961
<v Speaker 3>If it's a male,</v>

3999
01:45:59.961 --> 01:46:01.280
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be biting people in half.</v>

4000
01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:03.290
<v Speaker 3>They bite crocodiles and half to 100.</v>

4001
01:46:03.730 --> 01:46:05.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent.</v>

4002
01:46:07.930 --> 01:46:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Was is 100 percent.</v>

4003
01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:09.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4004
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.940
<v Speaker 3>no man.</v>

4005
01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm just agreeing with you.</v>

4006
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.320
<v Speaker 3>What'd you get on your testing?</v>

4007
01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Me One hundred percent.</v>

4008
01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:15.170
<v Speaker 3>You a plus student?</v>

4009
01:46:15.370 --> 01:46:16.050
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4010
01:46:16.050 --> 01:46:17.520
<v Speaker 3>From this weekend you're in La Hoya.</v>

4011
01:46:17.521 --> 01:46:20.630
<v Speaker 3>If people want to go see you at the comedy store when you work with down there.</v>

4012
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:22.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm working with uh,</v>

4013
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Steve Simone.</v>

4014
01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

4015
01:46:24.710 --> 01:46:25.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4016
01:46:25.071 --> 01:46:26.270
<v Speaker 3>And Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

4017
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:29.270
<v Speaker 3>They just had a couple gigs fall out.</v>

4018
01:46:29.271 --> 01:46:30.200
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to be in sale,</v>

4019
01:46:30.201 --> 01:46:32.060
<v Speaker 3>but then I'm going to be December first.</v>

4020
01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.250
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have the naughty show at the comedy store.</v>

4021
01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Powerful change.</v>

4022
01:46:35.241 --> 01:46:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan should make a return.</v>

4023
01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:37.521
<v Speaker 3>Can't go.</v>

4024
01:46:37.521 --> 01:46:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

4025
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.970
<v Speaker 3>We can do it.</v>

4026
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.381
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

4027
01:46:39.381 --> 01:46:40.280
<v Speaker 3>And Satan's asshole.</v>

4028
01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:41.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4029
01:46:41.611 --> 01:46:42.201
<v Speaker 3>I could do it,</v>

4030
01:46:42.201 --> 01:46:43.034
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to.</v>

4031
01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

4032
01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:44.293
<v Speaker 3>Are you one?</v>

4033
01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever need to go back to that.</v>

4034
01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:47.030
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

4035
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:48.500
<v Speaker 3>There's no win contests.</v>

4036
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 3>You know what one is</v>

4037
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.510
<v Speaker 4>the art form of comedy one,</v>

4038
01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:56.100
<v Speaker 4>but the comedy store absolutely fucking picked the wrong side so they can go</v>

4039
01:46:56.101 --> 01:46:56.934
<v Speaker 4>fuck themselves.</v>

4040
01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:58.043
<v Speaker 4>Fucked up,</v>

4041
01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 4>I like the laugh factory.</v>

4042
01:47:00.331 --> 01:47:02.370
<v Speaker 4>I just that places you have a problem with that place.</v>

4043
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:02.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4044
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:04.740
<v Speaker 4>100 percent doing naughty comedy now.</v>

4045
01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:06.090
<v Speaker 4>Then the Improv is awesome.</v>

4046
01:47:06.150 --> 01:47:06.983
<v Speaker 4>I love the</v>

4047
01:47:08.210 --> 01:47:08.490
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>

4048
01:47:08.490 --> 01:47:10.050
<v Speaker 4>I felt it was better for my act anyway.</v>

4049
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:13.530
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the comedy store is so dark and angry that I think a lot of that</v>

4050
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:14.011
<v Speaker 4>shaped.</v>

4051
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:15.390
<v Speaker 4>My material's changed.</v>

4052
01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:16.320
<v Speaker 4>Braille hasn't really.</v>

4053
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:17.700
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean that to be like,</v>

4054
01:47:17.701 --> 01:47:18.210
<v Speaker 4>it's different.</v>

4055
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:20.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you leaving.</v>

4056
01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Was it changed really?</v>

4057
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4058
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.640
<v Speaker 4>Now it's much like pricing.</v>

4059
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:26.803
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4060
01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean like it's not the same as it used to be.</v>

4061
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.670
<v Speaker 4>What was it like?</v>

4062
01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:30.540
<v Speaker 4>What's the difference?</v>

4063
01:47:30.810 --> 01:47:31.643
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

4064
01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.640
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like the acts aren't,</v>

4065
01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4066
01:47:35.191 --> 01:47:36.030
<v Speaker 4>I used to watch,</v>

4067
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:36.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4068
01:47:36.670 --> 01:47:38.010
<v Speaker 4>monsters onstage,</v>

4069
01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.120
<v Speaker 4>just guys who are like,</v>

4070
01:47:39.121 --> 01:47:40.200
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>

4071
01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:42.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't see that as much anymore.</v>

4072
01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:43.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not what it used to be.</v>

4073
01:47:43.771 --> 01:47:45.690
<v Speaker 4>There's a couple of young guys I think are bringing it,</v>

4074
01:47:45.691 --> 01:47:46.524
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>

4075
01:47:46.890 --> 01:47:47.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4076
01:47:47.170 --> 01:47:47.701
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

4077
01:47:47.701 --> 01:47:49.440
<v Speaker 4>it's now a TV credit land.</v>

4078
01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:51.270
<v Speaker 4>How did that,</v>

4079
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:52.260
<v Speaker 4>how did it make that change?</v>

4080
01:47:53.290 --> 01:47:54.123
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4081
01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:56.281
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4082
01:47:56.281 --> 01:47:57.020
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4083
01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:00.340
<v Speaker 4>I think it's weird how they use the same people over and over again.</v>

4084
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:02.423
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4085
01:48:02.770 --> 01:48:03.630
<v Speaker 4>But now they have.</v>

4086
01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:06.840
<v Speaker 4>They've definitely opened the door but just seems like I've gotten there on some</v>

4087
01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:11.190
<v Speaker 4>nights where these people are in the main room at 8:00 on like a Wednesday or</v>

4088
01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:12.024
<v Speaker 4>Thursday or whatever.</v>

4089
01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 4>And I'm saying this person sucks so bad.</v>

4090
01:48:14.011 --> 01:48:15.450
<v Speaker 4>He shouldn't even be in the belly room.</v>

4091
01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:17.010
<v Speaker 4>And he's in the main stage.</v>

4092
01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:17.520
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

4093
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.130
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that what,</v>

4094
01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:22.020
<v Speaker 4>what made that place great and it was never perfect,</v>

4095
01:48:22.050 --> 01:48:27.050
<v Speaker 4>but what made it great was that you could be somebody who was an unknown and you</v>

4096
01:48:27.211 --> 01:48:30.180
<v Speaker 4>could get up on stage there and start honing your craft.</v>

4097
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.530
<v Speaker 4>Those days are done.</v>

4098
01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.101
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4099
01:48:32.101 --> 01:48:34.110
<v Speaker 4>there's certain things going on there were like,</v>

4100
01:48:34.111 --> 01:48:36.060
<v Speaker 4>apparently if you're on Chelsea lately,</v>

4101
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4102
01:48:36.721 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 4>that's a sign that you've arrived and you see like a lot of people who do that</v>

4103
01:48:40.171 --> 01:48:44.850
<v Speaker 4>panel now in the lineup and that's a great show and she's done great for like</v>

4104
01:48:44.970 --> 01:48:46.410
<v Speaker 4>blowing up some of my friends,</v>

4105
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.370
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to crush in that our which has</v>

4106
01:48:50.371 --> 01:48:51.204
<v Speaker 4>its own Voodoo.</v>

4107
01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:51.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4108
01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 4>so nothing wrong with putting people that are coming up,</v>

4109
01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:58.830
<v Speaker 4>but you got to put them in between some really good talent and the problem is</v>

4110
01:48:58.831 --> 01:49:01.380
<v Speaker 4>they have some talent that really doesn't work anywhere else.</v>

4111
01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:04.770
<v Speaker 4>They have some people there that can't get spots anywhere,</v>

4112
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:08.490
<v Speaker 4>but they're grandfathered in somehow and they've got jokes that are literally 30</v>

4113
01:49:08.491 --> 01:49:09.324
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

4114
01:49:09.450 --> 01:49:10.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's some,</v>

4115
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:12.960
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that tell some jokes and you haven't seen them in a decade</v>

4116
01:49:12.961 --> 01:49:15.840
<v Speaker 4>and then they'll go through the act the same fucking way and you know,</v>

4117
01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:17.130
<v Speaker 4>they don't get that many spots,</v>

4118
01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:17.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4119
01:49:17.431 --> 01:49:20.010
<v Speaker 4>because there's a gang of them so they don't put them up every week,</v>

4120
01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.680
<v Speaker 4>but they'll put them up like every two weeks or every three or four weeks.</v>

4121
01:49:23.010 --> 01:49:24.420
<v Speaker 4>And you would sit there and you'd see them at.</v>

4122
01:49:24.421 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Some of them would be like bitter and shit and I'm thinking there's something</v>

01:49:28.411 --> 01:49:31.320
<v Speaker 4>wrong with these young kids and they suck and you know,</v>

01:51:26.591 --> 01:51:27.220
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They do their appearances and they show up and you know what,</v>

4211
01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of the day they're really not that different than comedians and</v>

4212
01:51:39.031 --> 01:51:41.440
<v Speaker 3>if you really sat down and you had a conference that you'd be like,</v>

01:51:49.090 --> 01:51:51.160
<v Speaker 3>most of them are just straight business people.</v>

4220
01:51:54.071 --> 01:51:57.220
<v Speaker 3>They sort of go into this business mode and that always weirds me out.</v>

4221
01:51:57.221 --> 01:51:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Like there's two types of porn stars.</v>

01:52:46.191 --> 01:52:46.611
<v Speaker 5>If you're.</v>

4255
01:52:46.611 --> 01:52:49.190
<v Speaker 5>If you're 18 years old and you need money,</v>

4256
01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:49.540
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

4257
01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:52.160
<v Speaker 5>There is a way to block the whole state you live in,</v>

4258
01:52:52.161 --> 01:52:53.810
<v Speaker 5>so like say like if you live in California,</v>

4259
01:52:53.811 --> 01:52:58.700
<v Speaker 5>you block California and you can block certain cities and then you can cam where</v>

4260
01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:00.500
<v Speaker 5>you can make like fucking whatever,</v>

4261
01:53:00.501 --> 01:53:01.670
<v Speaker 5>$5 a minute,</v>

4262
01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:05.840
<v Speaker 5>$10 a minute and you have these things where you have like 20 people in the same</v>

4263
01:53:05.841 --> 01:53:09.470
<v Speaker 5>room and they're all chipping in more and more for you to stay in these rooms</v>

4264
01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:13.340
<v Speaker 5>and these girls are making thousands a night from just sitting on their fucking</v>

4265
01:53:13.341 --> 01:53:15.860
<v Speaker 5>ass masturbating and doing nothing.</v>

4266
01:53:15.861 --> 01:53:16.694
<v Speaker 5>But that's.</v>

4267
01:53:16.770 --> 01:53:21.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's basically sits taking advantage of the whole,</v>

4268
01:53:21.901 --> 01:53:24.840
<v Speaker 3>like primal caveman girl,</v>

4269
01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.490
<v Speaker 3>female relationship.</v>

4270
01:53:26.491 --> 01:53:30.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you go to a strip club and the stripper makes icon,</v>

4271
01:53:30.210 --> 01:53:34.650
<v Speaker 3>she does all the stuff that if you're at a normal club that lets the girl know</v>

4272
01:53:34.651 --> 01:53:36.710
<v Speaker 3>that she's interested in you so you make moves,</v>

4273
01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:37.920
<v Speaker 3>so they do all that.</v>

4274
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:41.460
<v Speaker 3>They trick you and all that Shit and all they want you to do is by lap dances</v>

4275
01:53:41.461 --> 01:53:41.731
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

4276
01:53:41.731 --> 01:53:41.801
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4277
01:53:41.801 --> 01:53:42.511
<v Speaker 3>that's the weirdest thing.</v>

4278
01:53:42.511 --> 01:53:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Most strip clubs with the roles are reversed and we men who've never been or</v>

4279
01:53:46.861 --> 01:53:47.730
<v Speaker 3>don't usually go,</v>

4280
01:53:47.850 --> 01:53:48.810
<v Speaker 3>they don't know how to deal with it.</v>

4281
01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:51.450
<v Speaker 3>You get there and all of a sudden the women are pursuing you and are super</v>

4282
01:53:51.451 --> 01:53:52.220
<v Speaker 3>aggressive about it.</v>

4283
01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:52.381
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4284
01:53:52.381 --> 01:53:52.981
<v Speaker 3>well you want to.</v>

4285
01:53:52.981 --> 01:53:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Well you want to dance.</v>

4286
01:53:54.150 --> 01:53:57.600
<v Speaker 3>So for a lot of guys they just melt and like fall into it and next thing you</v>

4287
01:53:57.601 --> 01:54:00.930
<v Speaker 3>know that broke because the whole dynamic has just been shifted and they don't</v>

4288
01:54:00.931 --> 01:54:01.770
<v Speaker 3>understand like they're,</v>

4289
01:54:01.890 --> 01:54:02.430
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

4290
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:04.170
<v Speaker 3>They haven't built up a resistance for it.</v>

4291
01:54:04.171 --> 01:54:08.220
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the immune system for a strip club social immune system.</v>

4292
01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:10.680
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole thing about the naughty show is just like,</v>

4293
01:54:10.681 --> 01:54:12.850
<v Speaker 3>I like to explore that side of the world now.</v>

4294
01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not just sexual either.</v>

4295
01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:15.331
<v Speaker 3>It just like.</v>

4296
01:54:15.331 --> 01:54:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I like the crazier side of life and just like what makes everybody different and</v>

4297
01:54:20.031 --> 01:54:21.210
<v Speaker 3>stuff that everybody wants,</v>

4298
01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.430
<v Speaker 3>that everybody does in the shadows.</v>

4299
01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:25.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like a lot of people are doing it.</v>

4300
01:54:25.261 --> 01:54:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Why is they one talking about it and not that I don't like sex out in the open.</v>

4301
01:54:28.771 --> 01:54:33.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean meaning like I don't think porn star should be like Oscar award winners.</v>

4302
01:54:33.541 --> 01:54:33.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

4303
01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:34.531
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

4304
01:54:34.531 --> 01:54:36.270
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody has their place,</v>

4305
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:38.850
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's something you should have to be ashamed of where like</v>

4306
01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:42.270
<v Speaker 3>some find something out about you and now you're like the town like,</v>

4307
01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:42.571
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4308
01:54:42.571 --> 01:54:44.340
<v Speaker 3>you're just so used to it to most men,</v>

4309
01:54:44.341 --> 01:54:47.940
<v Speaker 3>the last thing they want is evidence that the woman has fucks some other dude,</v>

4310
01:54:48.090 --> 01:54:49.040
<v Speaker 3>not just fucks some other dude,</v>

4311
01:54:49.050 --> 01:54:51.390
<v Speaker 3>but he went asked to mouth on her and shot a load up her nose.</v>

4312
01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:51.501
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4313
01:54:51.501 --> 01:54:51.990
<v Speaker 3>well that's a whole.</v>

4314
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:53.520
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different thing.</v>

4315
01:54:53.521 --> 01:54:54.354
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about</v>

4316
01:54:55.770 --> 01:54:58.350
<v Speaker 3>guys who date porn stars.</v>

4317
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that you know,</v>

4318
01:54:59.581 --> 01:55:02.430
<v Speaker 3>you don't judge them if you don't judge them or if you met a girl and then she</v>

4319
01:55:02.431 --> 01:55:04.190
<v Speaker 3>wanted a day and then you found out that she was a porn star.</v>

4320
01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:04.411
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

4321
01:55:04.411 --> 01:55:05.244

<v Speaker 3>Well if that's not what you're into.</v>

4323
01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:07.670
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

4324
01:55:07.670 --> 01:55:08.401
<v Speaker 3>if you're not into it,</v>

4325
01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:08.671
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

4326
01:55:08.671 --> 01:55:08.911

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4328
01:55:09.001 --> 01:55:09.781
<v Speaker 3>but that's nothing.</v>

4329
01:55:09.781 --> 01:55:10.290
<v Speaker 3>You could do it.</v>

4330
01:55:10.290 --> 01:55:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Could you date a porn star?</v>

4331
01:55:12.011 --> 01:55:13.260
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the porn star.</v>

4332
01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Then what she did.</v>

4333
01:55:14.370 --> 01:55:15.840
<v Speaker 3>So stupid hot.</v>

4334
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Depends on what you do.</v>

4335
01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:18.930
<v Speaker 3>She came home smelling like loads.</v>

4336
01:55:19.650 --> 01:55:20.640
<v Speaker 3>Then I couldn't do that,</v>

4337
01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:21.901
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4338
01:55:21.901 --> 01:55:25.290
<v Speaker 3>he dated a girl who does lesbian porn and like lesbos stuff's okay.</v>

4339
01:55:25.291 --> 01:55:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4340
01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Which is a weird thing,</v>

4341
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:28.950
<v Speaker 3>but I can also see where like,</v>

4342
01:55:28.951 --> 01:55:29.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4343
01:55:29.191 --> 01:55:30.960
<v Speaker 3>some like aiden who is married to Bella,</v>

4344
01:55:30.961 --> 01:55:31.794
<v Speaker 3>Donna,</v>

4345
01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:33.700
<v Speaker 3>he's cooled watching her just get.</v>

4346
01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she doesn't anymore,</v>

4347
01:55:35.071 --> 01:55:37.290
<v Speaker 3>but she just getting my brother</v>

4348
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.561
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

4349
01:55:37.561 --> 01:55:40.110
<v Speaker 5>I think even the guys that say it's not cool is still.</v>

4350
01:55:40.610 --> 01:55:42.150
<v Speaker 3>I think there's guys who are into that.</v>

4351
01:55:42.250 --> 01:55:42.921
<v Speaker 3>It is cool.</v>

4352
01:55:42.921 --> 01:55:43.754
<v Speaker 3>It's not cool</v>

4353
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.020
<v Speaker 4>guys that are into.</v>

4354
01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying everybody's into it.</v>

4355
01:55:46.561 --> 01:55:49.390
<v Speaker 4>I think people evolved,</v>

4356
01:55:49.410 --> 01:55:49.920
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4357
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:52.740
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes they just look what guys go to prison.</v>

4358
01:55:52.741 --> 01:55:54.720
<v Speaker 4>They all of a sudden develop a desire to fuck man.</v>

4359
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:55.501
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

4360
01:55:55.501 --> 01:55:56.310
<v Speaker 4>Because they evolve,</v>

4361
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:57.450
<v Speaker 4>they adapt,</v>

4362
01:55:57.570 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 4>they adapt to the situation and if the only way you can get a check like Bella,</v>

4363
01:56:01.021 --> 01:56:03.000
<v Speaker 4>Donna is to lead black guy's coming her ass.</v>

4364
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:03.781
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>

4365
01:56:03.781 --> 01:56:04.614
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

4366
01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:05.603
<v Speaker 4>let's do this.</v>

4367
01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:07.650
<v Speaker 4>But that's from your perspective.</v>

4368
01:56:07.651 --> 01:56:08.510
<v Speaker 4>I totally understand.</v>

4369
01:56:08.630 --> 01:56:10.730
<v Speaker 4>But he may be into.</v>

4370
01:56:10.770 --> 01:56:11.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying,</v>

4371
01:56:11.530 --> 01:56:12.660
<v Speaker 4>could be yes,</v>

4372
01:56:12.690 --> 01:56:13.471
<v Speaker 4>but could be.</v>

4373
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:16.140
<v Speaker 4>That's the only one that's been around forever.</v>

4374
01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:16.910
<v Speaker 4>That's true too.</v>

4375
01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4376
01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:22.170
<v Speaker 4>That's guys and just enjoy watching their girls get rocked by monsters.</v>

4377
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:26.390
<v Speaker 4>Buddy of mine said that he met this girl at a party and she was really hot and</v>

4378
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.190
<v Speaker 4>she was coming on to him and then all the sudden this dude came over and</v>

4379
01:56:29.191 --> 01:56:31.140
<v Speaker 4>introduced himself as the husband and the guy's like,</v>

4380
01:56:31.141 --> 01:56:31.261

01:56:32.130 --> 01:56:33.060

01:56:33.751 --> 01:56:34.081
<v Speaker 4>It's cool.</v>

4386
01:56:34.081 --> 01:56:35.400
<v Speaker 4>It's cool that we swing.</v>

4387
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.731
<v Speaker 4>It's cool.</v>

4388
01:56:35.731 --> 01:56:36.270
<v Speaker 4>It's cool.</v>

4389
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.720

01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.900
<v Speaker 4>So that's such an interesting cat,</v>

4538
01:59:43.901 --> 01:59:44.530
<v Speaker 4>isn't he?</v>

4539
01:59:44.530 --> 01:59:46.630
<v Speaker 4>He is just telling you I can't follow things.</v>

4540
01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:47.861
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't.</v>

4541
01:59:47.861 --> 01:59:48.760
<v Speaker 4>And it's very interesting.</v>

4542
01:59:48.761 --> 01:59:49.571
<v Speaker 4>We have a podcast.</v>

4543
01:59:49.571 --> 01:59:49.741
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4544
01:59:49.741 --> 01:59:54.610
<v Speaker 4>I know how excited Brian is about the gas by how interactive he is if he's not</v>

4545
01:59:54.611 --> 01:59:55.271
<v Speaker 4>talking to the guests,</v>

4546
01:59:55.271 --> 01:59:58.450
<v Speaker 4>which makes me nervous right now because he hasn't talked at all a while.</v>

4547
01:59:58.451 --> 01:59:59.081
<v Speaker 4>I've been here,</v>

4548
01:59:59.081 --> 02:00:02.880
<v Speaker 4>but we've both been chatting up a storm and Qa,</v>

4549
02:00:03.010 --> 02:00:04.030
<v Speaker 4>chatty Cathy's here.</v>

4550
02:00:04.031 --> 02:00:04.730
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

4551
02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:06.550
<v Speaker 4>it was like he just sits there quietly,</v>

4552
02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:07.090
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4553
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:09.010
<v Speaker 4>come on and be interactive with me,</v>

4554
02:00:09.011 --> 02:00:09.340
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

4555
02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:09.851
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

4556
02:00:09.851 --> 02:00:10.390
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4557
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:11.470
<v Speaker 4>I always got to have a girl.</v>

4558
02:00:11.471 --> 02:00:13.420
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like bring me to a beast.</v>

4559
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:17.350
<v Speaker 4>You always got to have a girl in the room and when you bring a girl then he's</v>

4560
02:00:17.351 --> 02:00:17.951
<v Speaker 4>more interactive.</v>

4561
02:00:17.951 --> 02:00:18.131
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4562
02:00:18.131 --> 02:00:18.640
<v Speaker 4>100.</v>

4563
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:18.791
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4564
02:00:18.791 --> 02:00:20.770
<v Speaker 4>you can tell if he likes the porn star.</v>

4565
02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:22.930
<v Speaker 4>He won't even let me talk.</v>

4566
02:00:23.090 --> 02:00:23.471
<v Speaker 4>Cuts me.</v>

4567
02:00:23.471 --> 02:00:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Obviously with running.</v>

4568
02:00:24.341 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 4>And this is why Brian is so fucking interested in podcasting is because all of a</v>

4569
02:00:27.851 --> 02:00:29.770
<v Speaker 4>sudden it's put him in contact with all these freaks.</v>

4570
02:00:29.790 --> 02:00:30.130
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4571
02:00:30.130 --> 02:00:32.050
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when I did that he supply,</v>

4572
02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:36.050
<v Speaker 4>even though I met both of the girls I've dated off the podcast.</v>

4573
02:00:36.210 --> 02:00:37.240
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of,</v>

4574
02:00:37.241 --> 02:00:38.510
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

4578
02:00:48.251 --> 02:00:51.880
<v Speaker 4>was a new casting couch and we both laughed at him and then it's true.</v>

4681
02:02:52.371 --> 02:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4682
02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:54.950
<v Speaker 1>there's like three topping colleges.</v>

4683
02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:58.280
<v Speaker 1>One of them had like the highest rate of stds of any college in the country.</v>

4684
02:02:58.281 --> 02:02:58.671
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

4685
02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:01.610
<v Speaker 1>the rate of stds have any in the country.</v>

4686
02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4687
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>So you know the party,</v>

4688
02:03:03.671 --> 02:03:04.310
<v Speaker 1>it's warm out.</v>

4689
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:06.290
<v Speaker 1>It's one people fuck more probably.</v>

4690
02:03:06.291 --> 02:03:07.124
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4691
02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:09.330
<v Speaker 1>She's an outside college.</v>

4692
02:03:09.370 --> 02:03:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Remember when you were in college,</v>

4693
02:03:10.371 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

4694
02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>just tapping ass left and right.</v>

4695
02:03:13.201 --> 02:03:13.730
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

4696
02:03:13.730 --> 02:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>it's always going to be like this.</v>

4697
02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:16.910
<v Speaker 1>At some point you're like,</v>

4698
02:03:16.911 --> 02:03:17.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4699
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go away for college.</v>

4700
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I went to a college in Boston so that I could still train and compete martial</v>

4701
02:03:23.121 --> 02:03:23.810
<v Speaker 1>arts tournaments.</v>

4702
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So I stayed for the first couple of years.</v>

4703
02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I was at home still until I was 20.</v>

4704
02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:30.800
<v Speaker 1>When I was 20 I moved out.</v>

4705
02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:31.851
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

4706
02:03:31.851 --> 02:03:32.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4707
02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:32.811
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

4708
02:03:32.811 --> 02:03:33.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4709
02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:33.771
<v Speaker 1>go to school.</v>

4710
02:03:33.771 --> 02:03:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I would just go to school for the day and then leave.</v>

4711
02:03:35.181 --> 02:03:35.871
<v Speaker 1>I had no like,</v>

4712
02:03:35.871 --> 02:03:37.760
<v Speaker 1>school interaction I had no,</v>

4713
02:03:37.761 --> 02:03:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to parties.</v>

4714
02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get laid in college at all.</v>

4715
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>College was the high school.</v>

4716
02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4717
02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:46.100
<v Speaker 1>But college is a biggest drought of bisexual career ever.</v>

4718
02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4719
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4720
02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4721
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Also the most insecure in college too because then it was,</v>

4722
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.863
<v Speaker 1>I was um,</v>

4723
02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:55.370
<v Speaker 1>making this transition from being this person who concentrated on only martial</v>

4724
02:03:55.371 --> 02:03:56.660
<v Speaker 1>arts my entire life.</v>

4725
02:03:56.900 --> 02:03:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Literally barely paid attention to school.</v>

4726
02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:00.073
<v Speaker 1>So all of a sudden,</v>

4727
02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:00.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4728
02:04:00.881 --> 02:04:02.060
<v Speaker 1>becoming like 18,</v>

4729
02:04:02.061 --> 02:04:03.770
<v Speaker 1>19 out in the real world and going,</v>

4730
02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:06.260
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck am I gonna support myself.</v>

4731
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4732
02:04:06.591 --> 02:04:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching taekwondo at Boston University and I had my own school in revere,</v>

4733
02:04:11.001 --> 02:04:11.691
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

4734
02:04:11.691 --> 02:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do man?</v>

4735
02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I just do this for the rest of my life because this is not really what I want to</v>

4736
02:04:15.231 --> 02:04:15.321
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

4737
02:04:15.321 --> 02:04:16.154
<v Speaker 1>I want to compete,</v>

4738
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but there's no money in competing and then,</v>

4739
02:04:18.061 --> 02:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>and then you start thinking about brain damage,</v>

4740
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:20.571
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of other things.</v>

4741
02:04:20.571 --> 02:04:20.871
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4742
02:04:20.871 --> 02:04:21.291
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

4743
02:04:21.291 --> 02:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I might become a loser,</v>

4744
02:04:22.281 --> 02:04:22.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4745
02:04:22.551 --> 02:04:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I had no definitive direction until I went into stand up.</v>

4746
02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I was just competing and then worrying about shit.</v>

4747
02:04:28.610 --> 02:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>From the time I was like 19,</v>

4748
02:04:29.901 --> 02:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I had started to realize like maybe this was like a dead end route.</v>

4749
02:04:32.601 --> 02:04:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Like where am I going with this?</v>

4750
02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Because I also,</v>

4751
02:04:34.881 --> 02:04:36.350
<v Speaker 1>when I was 19 I had some.</v>

4752
02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some of the worst knockouts</v>

4753
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:39.990
<v Speaker 3>around that age.</v>

4754
02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:43.590
<v Speaker 3>I'd seen some bad head kick knockouts where I was like,</v>

4755
02:04:43.591 --> 02:04:43.951
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

4756
02:04:43.951 --> 02:04:45.790
<v Speaker 3>like what made you know what if that happens,</v>

4757
02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I may go,</v>

4758
02:04:47.210 --> 02:04:48.210
<v Speaker 3>go flat line,</v>

4759
02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:48.871
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

4760
02:04:48.871 --> 02:04:50.760
<v Speaker 3>I saw a lot of guys get kicked in the head man.</v>

4761
02:04:50.761 --> 02:04:53.160
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys get like seriously flatlined,</v>

4762
02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:56.700
<v Speaker 3>like just like that dude in the subway where the guy sucker punches him.</v>

4763
02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:57.751
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot of that.</v>

4764
02:04:57.751 --> 02:04:58.471
<v Speaker 3>When you get kicked,</v>

4765
02:04:58.471 --> 02:04:59.880
<v Speaker 3>like taekwondo kicks to the head.</v>

4766
02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:01.290
<v Speaker 3>They don't land that often,</v>

4767
02:05:01.291 --> 02:05:01.711
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

4768
02:05:01.711 --> 02:05:03.550
<v Speaker 3>when they land it's like getting hit with a bat.</v>

4769
02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:06.330
<v Speaker 3>There was a video on this website that's really cool.</v>

4770
02:05:06.331 --> 02:05:11.331
<v Speaker 3>Called Barstool sports.com and they like it just a fun sports website and they</v>

4771
02:05:11.881 --> 02:05:15.260
<v Speaker 3>showed these guys mma fighting in their living room and the w,</v>

4772
02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:15.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4773
02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:16.770
<v Speaker 3>the first time they fight,</v>

4774
02:05:16.771 --> 02:05:17.790
<v Speaker 3>the one guy tapped,</v>

4775
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:18.721
<v Speaker 3>the second one,</v>

4776
02:05:18.721 --> 02:05:18.930
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4777
02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:19.720
<v Speaker 3>they're fighting in living.</v>

4778
02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:20.830
<v Speaker 3>Do just head kicks him.</v>

4779
02:05:20.831 --> 02:05:21.960
<v Speaker 3>The guy just goes down,</v>

4780
02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:27.260
<v Speaker 3>hits his head basically on like the marble of the fireplace and like lights out.</v>

4781
02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:28.883
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

4782
02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:30.540
<v Speaker 3>See I didn't get late in high school,</v>

4783
02:05:30.541 --> 02:05:33.810
<v Speaker 3>but then I went to college and it was just insanity.</v>

4784
02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:34.411
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4785
02:05:34.411 --> 02:05:35.610
<v Speaker 3>If I went to a college,</v>

4786
02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:36.600
<v Speaker 3>if I had actually gone away,</v>

4787
02:05:36.610 --> 02:05:37.470
<v Speaker 3>so I went to unl.</v>

4788
02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4789
02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:42.290
<v Speaker 3>Jesus just didn't even pretend you're going to learn anything and I didn't.</v>

4790
02:05:42.430 --> 02:05:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Did I admit it?</v>

4791
02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:44.330
<v Speaker 3>I moved there.</v>

4792
02:05:44.330 --> 02:05:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to do stand up as a lot of drugs.</v>

4793
02:05:47.070 --> 02:05:47.420
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

4794
02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:48.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4795
02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:50.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really get into anything like that until later.</v>

4796
02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Much is vegas as a real drug problem.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The family wasn't making as much money.</v>

4824
02:06:23.130 --> 02:06:23.730
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

4825
02:06:23.730 --> 02:06:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Now this one color Fred's name.</v>

4826
02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:26.070
<v Speaker 3>You'd have a joke about,</v>

4827
02:06:26.071 --> 02:06:26.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4828
02:06:26.251 --> 02:06:27.870
<v Speaker 3>you don't take a hooker to Disneyland.</v>

4829
02:06:27.871 --> 02:06:28.321
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

4830
02:06:28.321 --> 02:06:30.390
<v Speaker 3>why would you make Vegas a family destination?</v>

4831
02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4832
02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:32.490
<v Speaker 3>It was just a place where it's,</v>

4833
02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:33.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4834
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:35.310
<v Speaker 3>it was just what's there for the kids.</v>

4835
02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4836
02:06:36.150 --> 02:06:36.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4837
02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:38.570
<v Speaker 3>at one point there was a treasurer,</v>

4838
02:06:38.630 --> 02:06:43.630
<v Speaker 3>a like a circus circus had this huge like park and then the mgm grand tried to</v>

4839
02:06:44.251 --> 02:06:45.084
<v Speaker 3>create a park.</v>

4840
02:06:45.210 --> 02:06:45.721
<v Speaker 3>It just like,</v>

4841
02:06:45.721 --> 02:06:47.400
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to bring your kids where there's gambling.</v>

4842
02:06:47.401 --> 02:06:48.490
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a good idea.</v>

4843
02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:49.620
<v Speaker 3>People do all the time,</v>

4844
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:51.650
<v Speaker 3>but not like what they wrote.</v>

4845
02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.550
<v Speaker 3>They were hoping to pull from Orlando,</v>

4846
02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:55.261
<v Speaker 3>Orlando,</v>

4847

4849
02:06:58.711 --> 02:06:59.010
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4850
02:06:59.010 --> 02:07:02.220
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting when a bunch of different metamorphoses have gone on,</v>

4851
02:07:02.670 --> 02:07:03.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4852
02:07:03.330 --> 02:07:05.600
<v Speaker 3>and now it's Kinda like it's in a different place.</v>

4853
02:07:05.610 --> 02:07:06.900
<v Speaker 3>Like Vegas is broke.</v>

4854
02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:08.213
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is now?</v>

4855
02:07:09.710 --> 02:07:10.543
<v Speaker 3>Dead.</v>

4856

4857
02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:15.660
<v Speaker 3>Well they sit down like 50 percent men,</v>

4858
02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:20.460
<v Speaker 3>50 percent and there's all those shopping centers that they started to build and</v>

4859
02:07:20.461 --> 02:07:22.830
<v Speaker 3>then whatever happened and now they're just sitting there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Stop that.</v>

4867
02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:35.560
